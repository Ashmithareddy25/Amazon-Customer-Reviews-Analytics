B007SGM084|5.0|I just finished book 3 and I only started this trilogy a few days ago.  I wasn't remotely able to put it down because I was so addicted to it.  I loved every bit of it.  The only down side to it is that it ended.  I got this let down feeling (like I get after reading great books) and I wish there were more books like these.  I just wish the story didn't have to end.  It was fifty shades of amazing!!!
B001TH16DI|2.0|I was watch Search For Spock the third Star Trek and when it reached 1 hour 08 minutes 17 seconds, it starts freezing up and starts playing again repeatedly. There is definitly wrong with this blu ray disc like if it was some dvd disc. I just don't understand why it does that. Does anybody have an answer to this problem? I did everything I could to fix it like wiping the disc with a soft cloth and blowing it but nothing helps. I would've given it a five star, but the disc is the issue and I wanna return this product back. So far I only saw Star Trek 1 & 2, but the third didn't do so well. The pictures of these films I saw were great but only if I could watch the third movie without any freeze ups then I would be really happy with the set. I just hope iv, v and vi isn't like the third one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I first heard about Wool about a month ago on Slashdot, and decided on a whim to check it out. Am I glad I did. I'm a long-time sci-fi fan, but have strayed away from the genre in recent years because there just hasn't been anything new that really capture my attention. Wool hooked me from the first chapter and didn't let go till the end (Why is it called Wool? Feels more like Velcro.). I'm now reading the author's Molly Fyde series, which is similarly excellent. Whether you like sci-fi or you don't, I can't recommend this enough.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|This is a half baked effort to depict the true heroism and sacrifice of the Tuskegee airmen of WWII fame. The story is great and the heroism is there but the rest of the story/movie is way over the top. As someone who has had the honour of meeting former Tuskegee airmen I can tell you that I am deeply disappointed in how little thought must have been given to producing and making this motion picture. So many errors and technical glitches plus an array of make-believe fibs that don't fit in the real story of those men. In one scene, the white bomber pilot praises black fighters for their good job over 'Polesti' which he must have meant 'Ploesti' in Romania. Then there is a scene on top of the ATC tower where the black sgt. says 'Roger that, sir' which is not how troops responded to orders in 1940s. 'Roger' is a modern mil-speak invention. I might be wrong on that so feel free to correct me. Then there is the unnecessary romance cliche. Do they want us to believe this BS? One has to take the aerial dogfight scenes with a grain of salt. The B-17 wouldn't have had structural failures like those shown in the movie just after a few hits. It would have taken a lot more to bring down a 'Fort'. It is nauseating that the film makers decided to show white fighter pilots as cowards in the first few scenes. And I object to that. However, It is a visually entertaining movie and i liked it enough to give it a three star rating. 3/5
0345803493|5.0|I love the book.  I love the characters.  The author is brilliant.  The book is well written and shows how one can overcome anything.
1439156816|5.0|I have never read a Stephen King book of fiction, and I picked up this book based on an extensive blog review about it. As a full time blogger and writer of a few books - one of which sells extremely well to my own surprise and delight - I LOVE writing. I don't even know why I love it so much because I studied engineering in college. I find Stephen King fascinating as a writer and a storyteller even just from reading \\"On Writing\\". I read some of the reviews here before writing my own, and especially the 2-star reviews. Someone had complained about King not sharing the secrets to his \\"magic\\" and I had to laugh. Did they expect to read this book and then apply X Y Z tricks to become like him tomorrow? Writing is hard work, and there is always resistance to accepting the truth about hard work when we listen to those who have accomplished great heights with it.<br /><br />This book was brilliant and it was a page turner in every sense. While I did not want to hear about all of King's terrible childhood experiences, I am glad I did. He starts out as an autobiography and then gets more into the craft of writing. His sense of humor is brilliant. His honesty raw and pure and intense. His advice is remarkable and his discipline is inspiring. He shared more than I thought anyone in his position would and he did it in the true spirit of helping you become a better writer. He shared what works and what doesn't. He said what to do and what not do to. He also told you where to go run with your creativity and leave him the hell alone because that's the stuff you figure out on your own.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough. I blasted through it in a few days and I am a very slow reader. I set aside 2 other reads just to get through this and I am about to go write an extensive review over at my blog, Prolific Living, on all the reasons this book rocks and why a career on writing is indeed a rewarding one.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. King for sharing your work, your inspiration, your motivation, and your pain and suffering as well as your joy of writing and marriage. I truly enjoyed this and will be applying a lot of your advice in my own writing life., your motivation, and your pain and suffering as well as your joy of writing and marriage. I truly enjoyed this and will be applying a lot of your advice in my own writing life.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I'm not ashamed to say it: \\"Home\\" is beautiful. As much as I despise the American Idol movement for reducing much of modern music to little more than a competition to see whose vocals carry the farthest, here, in \\"Home,\\" there is some delicious fruit off of that hideous vine.<br /><br />The rest of the album? A pleasant singing voice dubbed over harmless melodies. Yep.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game fast paced.incredibly addicting. and free!Temple run is definetly something I would recemend for others.Way better than AngryBirds or Doodle Jump.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this game. It is pretty addictive. When you are out of a wifi area it lags - that's why I gave it four stars. Otherwise great app.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'll admit, I gave in to the hype as well as being worn down by about 3 dozen women asking me \\"Have you read FSOG yet??? OMG, it's amazing!\\" Okay. Now, I've read it and I put it to you - why? Tell me why it's amazing. Granted, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but when people who I consider to be smart, educated and generally a great judge of \\"amazing\\" literature recommend such tripe to me and tag it as \\"amazing\\", I have to wonder if I slept through a global shift.<br />Aside from the fact it's based on Twilight fan-fic, badly written and the sexual matter is laughable at best, it objectifies women and endorses abuse. While I'm the first to protect our rights and defend freedom of speech/expression, my disgust at this book's unprecedented success has nothing to do with its content. I am not a prude nor is this the first time I've read sexually explicit passages in books. But this IS the first time I can recall in my adult life observing thousands of women fantasizing about being in an abusive relationship where they are dominated in the sickest possible ways. And then they call it \\"hot, romantic, a love story\\"...please. I just saw a bumper-sticker with a photo of handcuffs and the caption reads \\" Honk if you're a member of Christian's Sub ( submission) Club\\". What does this tell you? Okay ladies, you want a beater? Line up outside your local prison on release day and grab one. Oh wait - you want a wealthy, successful, drop dead gorgeous, 27-year-old beater who draws up contracts. I'm sorry. My bad. THAT makes it way okay. But I digress...<br /><br />I also heard that Dr. Oz had a whole show around this book and promoted it as a \\"sexual/marital aid\\". I watched the show and once again, I am horrified. As best as I can determine, using the audience as a representative sampling of the gazillions who love this book, women who have NEVER EVER in their LIVES read any kind of sexual matter got a hold of this. They've never read porn or erotica and since this came out as a mainstream novel, they're excited, titillated and just a little embarassed. I get that. But to call it \\"amazing\\"? There's so much better out there and perhaps this will open them up to books with far better stories, far better writing and hot sex that's actually essential to the growth of a character and not just gratuitous.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I first discovered Scalzi when I ran across a copy of Old Man's War a few years ago. I loved it and proceeded to read everything he had written in the SF genre. Since then, I have eagerly awaited each new SF writing.<br /><br />With that said, the recent offerings; God Engines, Little Fuzzy and now Redshirts, have been enjoyable but left me wishing for more OMW stories or perhaps another series with the scope and depth of the OMW universe.  I remain a Scalzi fan, but I hope John can see fit to get back to the style of book(s) that brought me into the fold.
B0086700CM|5.0|could not wait until kindle got this. next they need Nba jam and feed the dragon. this game is amazing.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Wow, this is the real deal.  Finally had a chance to listen to the whole album on the headphones with no distractions.  It's great from start to finish, and four songs (the first one and the last three) are as good as anything the group has ever released.  Brian's unique production touches and unmatched vocal arrangements are there on every song.  I love the trombone on \\"Shelter\\", the \\"San Miguel\\" percussion on \\"Strange World\\", and the \\"Night Was So Young\\" guitar on \\"From There to Back Again\\".  All the guys sound great, and Jeff Foskett comes as close to duplicating the sound of Carl's voice as anyone is going to get this side of heaven.  Truly an unexpected gift from America's greatest band.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Product arrived on time and accomplished what was promised.<br />Well done job! On time and the product was according described.<br />I recommend it.<br />:-)
0345803485|5.0|I loved this trilogy. I could do without the BDSM element, but there are just as many \\"vanilla\\" sex scenes to offset it. The detailed sex scenes add so much to the love story behind it all. And it really is a love story in the end, the way he is transformed from a dark world by finding true love. My favorite is the second book where they have a mutual respect for one another and really fall in love, the sweet things they say to each other are to die for.  The email banter is sweet and funny and it shows an example of a relationship where email communication is more honest and sincere than regular conversation (common these days).<br />There are a few grammatical mistakes in the book, but the only thing I noticed that was British-sounding was the common use of the word \\"surname\\".  The rhetoric used was very mature for the characters' ages, and I feel like the way Ana spoke maturely and handled many situations made it hard to believe she could be 21 but at least 30 if not 35 or 40.  The sex scenes were great to read, don't get me wrong, but I see it as more of a fantasy because the sex drive of those two is unrealistic, unless they are taking some kind of Viagra-type med, no matter what your age, that is a lot of sex. I am a native of the Seattle area and it is quite obvious that it was not written by someone familiar with it, or even familiar with the Northwest, which I don't like, the author could have at least consulted with a local about some of the locations and terminology. And Christian Grey, minus his sexual deviance, is almost too perfect to be believable. But even so, this is the best thing I have read in a long time, I was so moved by the depth of the love between these two. I am reading it over again because I cannot find a good enough book to follow it.  If anyone has a suggestion please let me know.
1423117166|5.0|There might be some complaints that it doesn't show \\"classic poses\\" of the films, but I like that quality. Jafar's snare, Maleficent's rage...I can go on. I love this book and think any other Animation or Art fan would love the work.

B0021L8V0M|2.0|Ever read a book with an improbable series of events that seem too convenient and tidy? Welcome to Salt, from Salt's Russian training to her relationship with Orlov and her fellow assassins to a tepid to nonexistent chemistry with her husband - this movie lacks punch. It lacks the authenticity of The Sum of All Fears, the gritty and stark nature of Jason Bourne to say nothing of making early 007(think Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnian) resemble a prodigy. Heck, I'd take Liam Neeson in Taken with all of his technique and sheer heart - natural talent over this tale which I hate to say really doesn't seem real. There's no character development for starters, you are talking about one dimensional characters - we're not even beginning to touch on the 'torture' scene which is laughable at best. Oh and exchange of Salt to the US? Come on now, what foreign country is going to trade up someone whom they think is a spy?? I don't care if another country offered the US the Lindberg baby or Jimmy Hoffa - we would NEVER and I mean NEVER EVER give up a spy for either of those two. If you want great stories and action in intelligence: stick with Ryan from Patriot Games and Jason Bourne, this is a waste of time. The open-ended closing sequence is a joke which is hardly a cliffhanger.
0553381695|2.0|I'm looking forward to watching the HBO series when it comes out on DVD. This way, I'll only use up 10-12 hours of my life instead of the 16 or so hours it took me to wade and slog through the depression, battles, death, dirt, filth, destruction, rapine etc. of A CLASH OF KINGS.<br /><br />After a while, I thought to myself, \\"The author is loading us all with this crud, it's shock value now. Yeah, I get the stabbings, heads on spikes, rape the dog-girl, blah-blah-blah. Get on with it all right all ready.\\"  That's why it get 2 stars: character and scenic descriptions are great!<br /><br />Thank heavens I got it out of the library instead of paying money for the Kindle version or buying the book!<br /><br />I really liked the first book so I was looking forward to the second book.  And I do like that characters are followed and you see different points of view. I understand that people are not black and white but shades of gray. But I started to not like (or root for) any of the characters. I couldn't wait to get out of Westeros, take a bath (the author did a good job of making me feel dirty) and dive into a good grisly murder mystery. I still can't get those hours of my life back.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm rooting for Tyrion's (the dwarf) girlfriend, Shae.  No doubt she gets killed of in Book 3. I hope Joffrey, the bratty boy king does get knocked off.  I doubt it, too bad.<br /><br />Thank heavens for the internet. No doubt I can find a synopsis of the next books so I don't have to waste more of my time.  If HBO does as good a job on this book as they did on the first, take my advice, watch the miniseries.
B004EPYZUS|1.0|I think I made it through about 20 mins of this piece of crap before turning it off and mking it a point to return it from where it came. Acting? Anemic, plot?? Bombing at the Kremlin which is so obviously overdone with computer generated graphics. Ethan's wife and friends from the previous movies? Nowhere to be found, getting the picture yet  .  .  . it's your worst nightmare - it's Bond minus the charm, the brains, the polish, the sophistication and the death for breakfast - sex for dinner mentality. Next to Salt, you couldn't find more of a waste of a movie to put on your shelf. Nothing worse than a film that aspires to be what it isn't - a riveting watch.

B000KIPT30|5.0|I need to convert to a pair of headphones at church when I am playing the drums in services,from a PA monitor that sits behind me in the floor.Currently I play with a pair of blue ear protection ear muffs which work fine.But I have been desiring to go to headphones.I took this amp to church and used it one time and it worked ok.However,when I plugged in the jack cable from the monitor to the amp,it only gave me a mono signal and I heard the music out of one ear only.I need to get a stereo adapter to give me a stereo signal so I can hear through both earphones.The separate volume knobs makes it good to adjust the volume in the earphones themselves.This is a plus feature.At this time,I have not gotten a stereo adapter due to job loss.But my review on this headphone amp is that it is a good amp and I reccommend it to anyone needing to power a pair of headphones.

B007MAETA8|5.0|John Mayer- there are so many different sides to this guy, but the reason he is an enduring artist is because he knows how to craft great songs. Everything in this album is done tastefully, and every song is interesting and enjoyable to listen to. I'm a guitar player and a musician myself and I've always respected John Mayer for his creativity in chord voicing and excellent tone- but all of that would mean nothing if he didn't write excellent songs. These songs are singable- and you want to listen to them over and over. It's a real shame his vocal cords have granulomas and he is currently unable to support this album through touring because I know these songs would be even better live than they are on the album. The good news is he is writing another new album instead, so I'm looking forward to that!<br /><br />Everyone looks at Continuum as John Mayer's best album but I must say, I think Born and Raised is his most solid offering to date. It's outstanding, enduring music. It's not trying to show off, it's just existing, as if these songs have always existed and John simply pulled them out of thin air.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Okay, totally honest... I've never written a review for a book... seriously.  This book was THE BOMB!  How can it be that a major publisher hasn't picked it up?<br /><br />There are a couple of things that immediately jump out, firstly being the development of the main character.  The reader is really drawn to like him, flaws, claws, and all.  Second is the dance the author weaves around the dark aspects and what they really are.<br /><br />I, for one, can't wait for the next book... Hurry up dude!

B005LAIGP0|5.0|Eureka!!!  Finally a modern day Horror film which discards CGI as an overwhelming crutch and goes for the jugular as Director James Watkins updates Writer Susan Hill's chilling ghost story 'THE WOMAN IN BLACK' and shows how true Horror films have been sorely missed over the past few decades.  The gothic Horror tale has long since been left in the dust by the supposed chillers of hacks such as Wes Craven , M. Night Shayamalan, Rob Zombie , to name but a few. With cheap tricks, gore effects,and screenplays which seem to succeed with modern audiences , none have even touched the terrifying sequences within this film.  Yes, they have their fans and supporters but they wouldn't know true Horror if it bit them where the sun don't shine.  Mr. Watkins, however, has done his homework by creating a beautifully chilling nightmare with such incredible atmosphere, you can feel the mist and fog come right through the monitor.  Daniel Radcliffe, who was criticized as being too young for the role, is excellent and Ciaran Hinds lends great support as Director Watkins glides his camera through an absolutely terrifying encounter with a haunted mansion. With a bone chilling score by Marco Beltrami and superior cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones, this is a film that truly lives up to the cliche, 'Don't watch it alone'.  I happened to view this film with at least four other Horror fans who have seen countless ghost films over the years and I counted no fewer than 8 times that they jumped right out of their skins, something modern day Horror tries to emulate but never succeed.  The film is released by Hammer Films of England who were responsible for a literal Horror renaissance beginning in the mid fifties and lasting to the early seventies but not even those photoplays have the class of this true Horror masterpiece.  If you love the films of Val Lewton and think that the champion of all ghost stories, Director Robert Wise's 'THE HAUNTING'- 1963 is the definitive haunted house thriller ,you will be surprised. If ever a film was perfect for the Blu-Ray format, this is it as Sony releases it in a beautiful 2.35 transfer with jaw dropping 5.1 DTS sound.  Ignore the negative reviews that many gave to this film and experience a truly terrifying tone poem, one that the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' films try to succeed at but ultimately fail.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I had my reservations about this movie after hearing the critics and seeing a poor trailer.  Well after viewing it as a rental I immediately had to own this movie.  The story is wonderful, the special effects are superb and the story telling hardens back to an era when movies were movies!
B006VC3LES|5.0|In 1974, director Roman Polanski and writer Robert Towne created a masterpiece, \\"Chinatown\\", which is regarded as a model for screenwriting novices who wish to study the process.  So successful was the film that it spawned a less successful sequel which reunited Towne with its star, Jack Nicholson, but without Polanski. The Blu-ray transfer excellently captures the color and decor of this original.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I've held off on purchasing a monitor stand for some time due to the cost of them. I finally broke down and purchased one for my new 1080p 24\\" monitor. This is a high-quality stand that is extremely flexible. Installation is super easy and fast. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchased and am buying another for my second monitor.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked this book better then Hunger Games. Katniss isn't portrayed as \\"dumb\\" as she was the first time around. I like to be able to come to the same conclusions with the characters at the same time, this book worked much better at that then the first one did. There's nothing like screaming at the character (in your mind of course... Anything like that out loud will get you odd looks) to catch up to the unfolding plot already. A slow main character will only lead to frustrations from the reader.<br /><br />I wish there had been some better physical descriptions of the arena and the way it worked. I got the whole \\"it's a clock\\" thing, but really the segments and how they were separated got blurred for me throughout.<br /><br />I had a hard time with the ending point too. It wasn't one of those cliff hanger moments that has me dying to start the next book. It comes at a lull after the action and excitement has tapered down. So, the break was rather anti-climactic.<br /><br />I really don't know where all this Gale vs. Peta hype comes from though... It's not really all that big of a tipping point in the series to me. Maybe it will take on a new meaning in the final book, MockingJay.<br /><br />Overall, a good book that I enjoyed reading and am looking forward to the last.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I read the books right before the movie came out and was very happy with the outcome.  I also watched Princess of Mar's and found it rather good.  It's very sad that the film was not as popular has I'd have liked.  I would love to see the second movie, that I'm sure was planned, but doubt now will ever be made.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it. the big numbers, just because its easy don't. hate it.  I like because,  I don't have to carry my kindle and a calculator. I can only carry my kindle. For those who hate it don't you look at the example before you get it.

B005PD0VDI|1.0|The dental assistant asked me if I wanted to continue with the procedure and I mumbled \\"Yes\\" as they proceeded to take out the other two wisdom teeth in what amounted to a two and half hour surgery.  The pain afterwards was akin to having metal screws drilled into my skull.  I would willingly relive that pain again before I see Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life for a second time.<br /><br />Five minutes into this movie, I wanted to shoot the director.  The whispered dialogue doesn't establish any of the characters and yields a story that has to be guessed at.  Then there's a 30-minute \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" drug sequence that shows beautiful images and concludes with dinosaurs before going back to the Texas home of the characters introduced earlier.  At this point, I was already asleep.  I contend that The Tree of Life robs one of one's pranic life energy.  It has beautiful cinematography but no payoff, nothing to justify the journey.<br /><br />My review is actually minus 1 star.  Yes, I'm giving The Tree of Life a negative star, a black hole, someplace in which to throw this piece of garbage. Mr. Malick, you steal two and half hours out of my life and I'll get even with you.<br /><br />Finally, what does \\"Tree of Life\\" have to do with this movie anyway?  And why would anyone within a two hundred billion light-year distance of Earth even give a damn?
B007L6VR6M|5.0|There is no accounting for taste.<br />The magic of this film worked for me and for thousands of others.<br />But it doesn't work for everyone.<br /><br />If the magic doesn't work for you that's fine.<br />A prior review here used considerable intellect and very good critical faculties to justify a response that is emotional and taste related.<br />It doesn't come close to capturing the beauty of the film.<br /><br />What Anderson does miraculously is distance you with satire and artifice at the same time he draws you in emotionally with a look at good people struggling with complex feelings.<br />Good fairy tales do the same.<br />The imagery, use of music, cinematography, and script are all creative and for me were magical.<br /><br />Look at Anthony Lane's review in The New Yorker. Lane is one of our better reviewers and has the expertise to look at this film far more perceptively than I can or the prior reviewer can.<br />You may still not like the film.<br />I've been a serious filmgoer for 50 years. I'm also not a Wes Anderson junky. I don't like all of his films.<br />I loved this one.
B007SGM084|1.0|Why is this trilogy on all of the top best selling lists?? I considered many times buying the books but thought they were too expensive, particularly the kindle version (with no sharing rights), so I held off but eventually my curiosity got the best of me and decided to sample the trilogy. After reading the first few chapters of each book, I can confidently say the writing is horrific! Didn't she have an editor? How can this work be published? Her sentence structure is so choppy it's extremely distracting. The author is also inconsistent with her writing style and with Ana's character - one sentence has her sounding like an intellectual woman and the next sentence has her sounding like an immature and simple-minded teenager. I have no desire to read any further...don't want to waste my money. I suggest you read the low rated reviews before buying this book. If you want a better written erotica story that basically has identical characters as Fifty Shades of Grey but with a more sassy and interesting female character, I suggest [[ASIN:0425263908 Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel]] by Sylvia Day.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I have read many books by Picoult and some of them are really outstanding.  I found The Pact to be good, but not great.  It is an enjoyable read, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I didn't find the choices some of the characters made believable, and I was not happy with the ending.
B007SGM084|4.0|Good bedtime read.  Fluff and fun!  Brainless entertaining reading.  Recommend as a summer reading bundle.<br />Enjoy ;-)  Too much fun to put down, read through them in record time.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Kindle ebook review. Genre: Romance (?). <-This question marks my slight confusion in categorizing this read. Ok, it's a romance, a young adult romance at that, no matter how it is tagged. The main central love interest revolves around two first-year college students, Travis and \\"Pidge\\", whose unconventional upbringing is slowly unfolded as the two fall for each other. Their relationship starts when she is splattered with the blood of his \\"FightClub\\"-esque opponent. He takes one look at her and falls in love. She's hard to get. The two form a bet where for the first half of the novel she ends up sleeping, only sleeping, in his bed for six weeks.<br /><br />Here's what I liked about the book: The writing was crisp and undistracting. I read the novel without thinking about how the words were on the screen--that's a good sign for me. The narrative was somewhat original. I like the characters--I found them entertaining and realistic. For these reasons this book deserves four stars. BUT. Here's what I didn't like: I couldn't understand what we readers were waiting for. And even after the ending, I wondered what it was I hoped to see happen in this novel.  Also, one key narrative turning point comes about when Pidge's father shows up unexpectedly and unwanted. While the conflict he brings into the narrative is partially resolved, I think the novel fails to return to fully sort out Pidge's issues with him. And BTW, the book's title is useless. I cannot see how it is related to the narrative at all. And for these reasons I would give this book three stars. Average=4 stars for a book that kept me reading until the end but is not one I would recommend to broader romance audiences. This one specifically would appeal to the younger romance reader.<br /><br />Addendum: Now that I've read the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy I realize I might have been a little harsh with my rating for Beautiful Disaster, which is, IMHO, a better book by far.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|All David Baldacci books are breathtaking. Once you start reading the book, you need to know how it will end.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|Playing this game on my Kindle Fire is frustrating to say the least due to the fact you must repeat all the puzzles in a given section if you fail to solve all of them in the given time. If you have no orb left to allow you to skip a puzzle you are unable to solve, you are stuck and can not advance in the game. I am at that point now as I am unable to get the robot puzzle solved.  I have been a Big Fish fan for many years and have bought many games for my laptop, but I have not run into this kind of problem. Having to repeat all puzzles is a bad concept as far as I am concerned. Hopefully an update will be coming soon.

B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Prometheus came out with high, high expectations, so it's no biggie that it didn't live up to that hype. No, there were many different problems, but the biggest one I had with it was that it awkwardly shifted between horror and sci-fi, and doing neither effectively.<br /><br />Actually the horror aspect wasn't so bad, I got truly scared when I first saw one of the scientists had a pink mowhawk and tattoos. I was really scared for how the movie would turn out. So a crew is sent on a trillion dollar mission to search for life on a distant planet, judging by the sheer enormity of the mission you'd think they'd send only the best and brightest right? Well no, not at all. Almost every crew member makes completely baffling stupid decisions throughout the movie, and the ones that don't make stupid decisions are completely underutilized.<br /><br />Once they arrive on the planet, they drive down one little valley to the 'tomb' or whatever is located, so that's all you see of the planet, that little valley and the one tomb, ok whatever. So they get into the 'tomb' and one of them decides to pull off his helmet because the air is breatheable. Ok? So what if it's breatheable, what about alien viruses, toxins, bacteria, aren't you guys supposed to be really smar-oh great now they're all removing their helmets. So Ridley Scott made this movie to appeal to mouth-breathing neanderthals, ok whatever maybe it'll be a good horror movie.<br /><br />So the Punk Scientist (I can't believe what I'm typing) and his ambigiously gay friend go split off from everyone in true bad horror movie writing, and can't find their way out for plot convience. Eventually they get trapped inside the tomb because of a storm and the ship is monitering them. Well only one guys is monitering these two idiots stranded on a planet and all he says to them is 'sleep tight' then laughs at his gay joke. Don't worry it gets dumber. Charlize Thereon, who's made out to be this cold calculating badass captain decides to sleep with the only guy watching the two stranded crew guys, and I think it was at this point where I started chucking candy at the screen. This was directed by the same guy that did Alien, Black Hawk Down, and Gladiator?<br /><br />So the two scientists are scared s***less about the crew finding other signs of life in the tomb, but when some snake-like creature comes out of the water they're next to, what do they do? Well the choice is obvious, stick your arm out and try to pet it. Then goofus and gallant get picked off in admittably creepy ways while the whole crew on Prometheus is busy f***ing each other. Later in another scene the captain realizes that one of the crewmembers is contaminated and can't come back on the ship, however later when one of the idiots who's been missing for like a day comes back the crew just opens up the hatch without checking him out first, not realizing that the guy is now some angry giant mutant straight outta the Hills Have Eyes.<br /><br />So it seems like this is going to go for to pure adrenline-rushing horror, but instead Prometheus takes a left turn and brings Guy Pearce in a cheap old man costume out for no reason other than to throw in a tweest, and none of the crew members seem to care, I sure as hell didn't. The rest of the movie turns into some stupid social commentary, such as \\"they ain't stupid 'nuff to build weapons of mass destruction on their front doorstep\\" or \\"what did we do to deserve to die\\"? Great, now this movie thinks it's smart.<br /><br />So Prometheus could've been a solid albeit dumb horror movie, but instead it tries to expand upon it's vague half-baked typical self-loathing hollywood message that humans don't deserve to live. Then Ridley Scott shoves his 'working class good, corporations bad' message AGAIN. We see the white collar members are up to no good, scheming behind everyone's back while the cool down to earth blue collar guys are the good guys. The crew don't even get picked off in a tense coolway of getting hunted or anything, they ram their ship into another ship, dying in the lamest way possible. See kids, Prometheus is too smart to be fun.<br /><br />So later the crew with Old Guy pearce meet up with the engineer who was sleeping and when they wake him up, does he want to communicate with the beings that he supposedly created? Does he want to assess the situation to know there's a giant ship outside ready to ram his if he tries to escape? Nope, he goes on a gorilla rampage beating everyone then jumps into his ship. Then after the multi-cultural blue collar folks ram into his ship the two leading ladies are being chased by the donut-shaped ship rolling along, only one of them realizing that you should move out of the direction that it's rolling in.<br /><br />Prometheus is a flat out disappointment. Nice set designs and atmosphere don't erase poor script-writing and a geniuenly lame story, Prometheus is made for idiots who want to pretend that they're smart.ir ship into another ship, dying in the lamest way possible.

B0086700CM|4.0|I had this on my ipod and was waiting for this.<br />finally this game came out for kindle fire. I was hoping it would come out soon for the kindle fir
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app...easy to use, nice presentation. Recommended if all you need is a simple calculator.  Looks great on the Kindle Fire.
0393338398|4.0|I have almost no interest in baseball, yet found this book fascinating - about the sport, the business of the sport, and the individual characters involved. It's also well-written.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Prometheus stands well above the vast majority of sci-fi/horror films. Visually stunning (the first film i have ever seen that i didnt HATE the cgi...no hyperbole). Unlike some of the other opinions ive read, I thoroughly enjoyed the existential foundation of Prometheus. Questions were posed and, for the most part, answered (within reason...some of the questions were never meant to be answered). I feel like Prometheus really needs another film or two to fully flesh out the intriguing groundwork that it began (and to further tie into the alien canon/biology etc.). Though maybe not a \\"prequel\\" in the traditional sense, prometheus definitely resides within the confines of the fictional world that was constructed in alien, aliens, and alien 3 (yes, i left out the travesty known as alien \\"insurrection\\"). The biggest questions I have concern the various forms of alien biology explored in the film. Id really like to see the biological progression moved forward and explained a bit more in future films. anyways...enjoyed the movie. I particularly enjoyed the many strands of subtext runnning through prometheus. I plan on buying the blu -ray (2D forever!) Try not to let all of the hype and history blow things out of proportion for you. Just do your homework and appreciate the film for what it is. Awaiting the next installment...
B0013F1D02|4.0|Never Ending Story,  Princess Bride,  Stardust.<br /><br />Found this movie based on reviews.  Takes you to a far away land and the story was an unexpected delight.  Recommended.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|This is outside the genre I normally read, but after reading a synopsis, I couldn't resist reading this one.  Overall, I found it to be an entertaining read.  Definitely had it figured out about half-way through, but that didn't make me any less eager to read to the last page.  I disagree with some of the reviewers that spoke to slow-moving development.  The author twists the plot and gives hints/clues a plenty by changing time and location constantly.  I felt this kept things moving quickly.  I also enjoyed seeing a woman as the protagonist in a genre that seems to typically be dominated by male protagonists.  Added a bit of freshness.  On a side note, I also enjoyed the description of different European cities and neighborhoods.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I got it to replace the original one, which had all of its insulation crumbling off, a very disturbing material defect. So far the original seems to work ok.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I am a *huge* Cut The Rope fan.  I played the original game until I was able to collect 3 stars on every level.  And then I had to wait what seemed like an interminably long time before Cut The Rope: Experiments was available on the Android platform.  But it was worth the wait.<br /><br />Experiments takes up where the original left off.  There are new levels, new tools, new features, and lots more.  The game provides all of the challenges, and all of the fun of the original.  And, as with that first game, I eagerly await whatever additional levels Zeptolab supplies (some of which have already arrived, since downloading the original Experiments).<br /><br />Thousands of games exist for the Android platform; and I have played many, many hundreds of them.  Cut The Rope (and Cut The Rope: Experiments) ranks right up at the top, in my estimation.  I am completely bored by \\"match 3\\" games.  \\"Hidden object\\" games are catchy only for a very short time.  Jumping, fighting, shooting, and other fast-finger games are not even in my vernacular.  I like a challenge -- a thinking challenge.  Some of my other favorites include Where's My Water, Sprinkle, and the Angry Birds series.  But the two Cut The Rope games (including this one) are my absolute favorites.
B005Z6YHEY|4.0|This book is interesting, informative, straight to the point, professional, and easy to read. The basic premise is that the brain is not permanently hardwired, its plastic, and can be changed. It gives examples of those that have been chronically injured and impaired, and have been able to recover based on creating new mind maps through various types of rehabilitation, and many more. A very good book.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|This movie looks fantastic. Any fear that it would look too phony of CGI'd are very quickly laid to rest. It looks better than just about any movie ever made.<br /><br />That's where the good ends.<br /><br />This script is a disaster. No one ever acts logically, in fact, they almost always act in exact opposition to logic. A scientist that starts an expedition based on no objective interpretation of hard data, but on her \\"belief\\"in what she WANTS her data to mean. Archeologists that are \\"depressed\\" at the discovery of the first proof of an alien civilization just because they can't talk to any of the long dead aliens. A geologist WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE IS TO MAP THE RUINS they are exploring, who gets LOST despite the fact that HE'S THE ONE WITH THE BLOODY MAP. A biologist who, after seeing a room full of dead alien bodies (done in by some unknown attacker), discovers a giant hissing alien worm and his first reaction is to POKE IT.<br /><br />This is just the set up to the mess that follows. Entire sequences happen concurrently without ever affecting one another, so that they seem to be from different movies. You keep waiting for the actions in one to affect the other, and they never do, indeed, they often never come up again at all. And the final \\"reveals\\" are so stupid (not to mention telegraphed) that all the tension in the third act is just sucked out the airlock.<br /><br />The connections to the Alien movies simply muddle things further. These plot elements don't actually make sense in relation to the original two movies, and they don't add much of anything to the film on its own. This film would have been better off as a stand alone film rather than being a prequel, since the connection only serves to make an incoherent script downright inconsistent.<br /><br />You could go, scene by scene, through the entire movie, and find something very wrong in each sequence. It's that big a mess. And it's all due to a screenplay that thinks it's being profound by asking \\"bigquestions\\" when it has absolutely no idea what questions it is actually asking, let alone how to answer any of them. This is not surprising when you learn that the screenplay was written by one of the showrunners from LOST, the king of \\"make-it-up-as-you-go-without-any-idea-where-you're-going\\" storytelling.<br /><br />Any assertions that the movie is somehow deeply profound or spiritual and that those who do not like it just don't \\"get it\\" is pseudo-intellectual mental masturbation. You might as well assert that you can see the Emperor's new clothes, whereas I see a naked fool walking down the street.<br /><br />This movie LOOKS and SOUNDS like it should be a really good film, and the performances are for the most part really solid. But don't let the window dressing fool you. A movie is only as good as the story it tells, and this is one cake that's really just an enormous stinking turd covered in deceptively rich frosting.<br /><br />You won't avoid it. But you should.
0786271531|5.0|This book is amazing! My daughter had read this first several years ago and had just finished it again. I took it on a trip with me to read it, after she told me how good it was. Well, I couldn't wait to get back from my trip to discuss it with her. It will definitely make you think about life, and will stay with you for a long time. I definitely recommend it for anyone!
0345803485|5.0|after reading several reviews, i learned that several people thought this book was a slow starter....and it was!!! seemed to take for-ev-er to get started, but once it did...HANG ON!!!  ill save you some waiting time...dont do like i did and just order the first one to \\"try it out\\"..youll LOVE it!! order them all now so you wont have to wait! ENJOY!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well if your looking for love story this is not it. If your looking for a full erotic novel this is not it. The book is of course not well written to be a number one seller. Ana kept repeating the same things over and over again, but doesn't every human just like that, a word or the same phrases defy you. Ana is likely a very curious, lost, and at times very impulsive with her decisions. Every fight turned into a full hot sex, which is very unlikely to happen to anyone. A virgin, who feels confused about how she feels, a man who takes full advantage of the situation makes for some hot and times fake sex. I rate it a 4 because I've read book two already and is not such a bad storyline. Keep on reading it gets a little more interesting.
0345803507|5.0|this book was AMAZING! had several twists i never saw coming. i could not put this entire trilogy down until it was done.  Definitely recommend!!!
0307951529|5.0|I have absolutely no complaints about this book.  It just has a way of taking the massive cloud of entrepreneurial doubt and overcoming it by simplifying the process into easily manageable chunks.  If you're looking for a book that will help you accurately see your entrepreneurial goals as a definite possibility, the you'll want to check this one out.  Chris is a man who has been there and knows what it takes to succeed.  He's seen it hundreds of times and has distilled his experience into the bare-boned truth.  He really cuts the fluff and gives you no reason to put off pursuing your dream any longer.  For me, this book delivered all that for my own mentality and it is guaranteed to pay off for you too.
0345803493|5.0|this book was a MUST HAVE after reading book one.  i would definitely recommend (and have already recommended) this book to a friend! have fun, and you might as well go ahead and order fifty shades freed now....you will make it through this book in no time!
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Being a fan of the less blood-more story gothic thriller, I picked up a copy with not a lot of expectation.  It simply seemed a little too hyped in my area.  However, I was quite pleasantly surprised and happily put it (once viewed) on the top shelf alongside similar vein movies such as \\"The Others\\", Half Light\\", my myriad Hitchcock gleanings... I agree with some of the other esteemed reviews in that there is no sense of \\"Harry Potter\\" in Mr. Radcliffe's performance and he does a perfect job is \\"being\\" Arthur Kipps.  This movie has stayed with me and it has prompted me to read the novel, even if it and the movie likely do not follow so closely.<br /><br />It is indeed a \\"spine-tingling tale\\" and well worth adding it to your collection, in my humble but particular opinion.
B00760BPOC|5.0|It's a really good book. Interesting to read. Little bit hard to follow up. The characters are still interesting but missing a some of the Stark family.

B00722ZIBA|5.0|Sometimes a great band fizzles out just at,or just before the point where they begin to really get some momentum going. Incognito were something of a one off project in the beginning with their debut [[ASIN:B000003JBJ Jazz Funk]]. Since Jean Paul \\"Bluey\\" Maunick returned with the band in 1991,they've spent the last 21 releasing a steady stream of albums that celebrate 70's jazz funk as a full fledged musical movement as opposed to a passing musical fashion trend. Never seems to matter if few seem to be listening. If Amazon.com is any indication there are lots of people who appreciate Bluey and his commitment to musical and creative vision over mass popularity. Musically it's always been a bit of an open house. But generally the band gets it's distinction from two sources: Bluey and the wonderful vocals of Maysa. As usual other singers,in this case Natalie Williams,longtime member Vanessa Haynes and male singer Mo Brandis join in on lead...Maysa is almost the bands lead singer especially considering Incognito is almost by nature a revolving musical collective rather than a steady band. Even so nothing is lost on the quality of the music overall.<br /><br />  \\"The Less You Know\\",\\"Ain't It Time\\" and the dripping \\"Capricorn Sun\\" are all wonderfully uptempo danceable 70's style jazz-funk numbers,full of that elaborately chorded sense of melodic exploration they are so great with explorting.  \\"Above The Night\\" and \\"To Be With You\\" are beautifully crafted ballads that explore the same territory only with the tempo a bit mellower. \\"Restless As We Are\\" takes the music to a more stripped down place,with the horns and arrangements playing more of a punctuation role as the song is built on an elaborate bass/guitar interaction that takes presidents. As the album goes on into numbers such as \\"Rivers On The Run\\",\\"The Way You Love\\" and \\"Thoughtful Fantasies\\" they stretch out,even on the non vocal parts into areas that are jazzier. The rhythm remains locked right down while the horns,keyboards and harmony vocals improvise in,over and around the funk and create it's own little grooving instrumental universe. Again it's the band hot and cold style of melodic development that makes these songs really stand out. \\"Don't Want To Know\\" is all about melody,with the horns locked into a pattern not dissimilar to another band: Chicago.<br /><br />  Most people I hear,on both sides of the pond in this day and age,who are looking to make funk music tend to do so through the filter of hip-hop. Whether it be via samples of old songs or a guest rapper/producer it seems that funk is supposed to be somehow indebted to a genre that has become,frankly a somewhat uneven and often lyrically juvenile mainstream style of music. But I am not criticizing hip-hop. A lot of good has come out of it too. And many funkateers utilizing it as a filter make creative music doing so. However Incognito have kept up their strength as one of the few self contained bands (along with Mint Condition) who devote themselves to funk music. For a collective with such an anonymous name who are known for so many collaborations primarily,they've maintained a very consistent and stable musical identity all the while. To hear unified funk bands such as this,you still often would have to look in the jazz  sections of your record stores to find it as I did with this. Or maybe electronica in some cases As stated before,most modern funk acts you'll find in the R&B section are almost all linked in some way with hip-hop. So the present and the future of studiocentric live band jazz/funk will likely lay with groups like Incognito.s,keyboards and harmony vocals improvise in,over and around the funk and create it's own little grooving instrumental universe.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was told I wouldnt be able to put this book down.  It ws true as I kept waiting to see if it was going to get better.  I was disappointed at how the author portrayed the main character as a weak young woman who allowed the man she was dating to contol what clothes she wore, what she ate, when she ate, followed where she went, kept track of her when she wasnt with him, who spoke to her as if she were a child, ...all making it looked like this was weird put acceptable because she was falling in love with him.  This was early in the relationship which had red flags all over it but becaues he was good looking and wealthy she allowed for his poor, selfish behavior.  Not a good example for our young woman!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I just started playing and I am fighting to put it down. I have played a few games with the same concept, but I like this one so much more.

B001U3ZMHW|1.0|This toy is really overrated.

There are many Lego sets that are fairly priced but this is not one of them.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society came through my front door, another one of my friend Ginger's recommendations.  Truth to tell, my #1 daughter-in-law, Ariane, recommended it to me first by a couple of months, but she failed to actually put the book into my hands and so it slipped by me.<br /><br />The second book in a week I've read focused on a writer trying to figure out what to write, like Once Upon A Tour, GLPPS is not truly about the writing but about the people around the writer who influence and inspire her.  In this case, the author in question, Juliet, living in 1946-London receives a query from a complete stranger living on the isle of Guernsey, a little bit of England off the coast of France, one of what are known as the Channel Isles.  Unable to expend the resources to protect it, the UK allowed Germany to overrun Guernsey during the war, and its inhabitants lived under Nazi Occupation for five years.  The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is formed as a spur-of-the-moment ruse to cover illicit activities from the Nazis but ultimately grows into a group of people who use literature and camaraderie to help one another get through the hardships and heartbreak of the war.  This book is about how Juliet comes to know and love what once were complete strangers and how they change her life forever, as she does for them.<br /><br />A cast of enchanting characters populate Guernsey:  a quiet stone mason/pig farmer, quite common but the backbone of the group; a senior lady who mothers everyone and lends the disparate group an air of respectability; an aging fisherman who is forced to send his grandson to England to escape the Occupation, then loses his daughter and her newborn on the day the Germans roll in; an eccentric free spirit rumored to be a witch who sells her herbal concoctions in a market stall; a drunken valet impersonating his absent lord of an employer and draining his wine cellar; an orphaned love child in desperate need of a mother; a holier-than-thou busybody who condemns everyone and everything; a courageous young woman, the heart of group, who binds them all together with love and self-sacrifice.  Juliet is courted by a rich, pushy American, is doted on by her editor, supported by her girlhood friend, and embraced by the good people of Guernsey.<br /><br />I find \\"correspondence\\" novels somewhat gimmicky and often strained, especially because letters between friends tend to rely a great deal upon previous mutual understanding which doesn't translate well into storytelling.  Either the reader is forced to accept that the correspondents write tomes filled with unnecessary (to the recipient) minutiae with each and every letter they send, or the details feel too sketchy, unsatisfying, or even confusing to the reader.  However, Mdms. Shaffers and Barrows weave an engrossing, heart-warming, and sometimes tear-jerking tale with just the right balance between plausibility and necessary narrative.  The voices of each character are distinctive, humorous, and natural.  The tone is light and generous, albeit sad at times.  This is, after all, a story about the privations of war, starvation, oppression, betrayal, and brutality, but also about hope and courage and love and sacrifice.<br /><br />The book ends with joy and victory.  True, the war is over, but life is still difficult.  Shortages abound and the healing is slow.  Europe still reels in the aftershocks of pandemic destruction.  But, the new day is dawning, Guernsey is picking itself up and dusting itself off, setting about the work of rebuilding, as is London and the rest of the UK.  Hope gleams brightly and love, if not able to conquer all, overcomes a great deal.  It inspires hope and infuses fresh courage and determination in our friends.  Happily ever after becomes a glorious new beginning.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Read this book.  I borrowed my copy, but I want to own it.  It's on my read and read again list.of a mother; a holier-than-thou busybody who condemns everyone and everything; a courageous young woman, the heart of group, who binds them all together with love and self-sacrifice.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|After I saw ads for this when it came out I was upset because \\"it was all on green screen\\" and up to three minutes before I watched I kept calling it \\"Sky Captain and the Amazing Green Screen World of Tomorrow\\".<br />I even had this sitting in the \\"B-Movie\\" section of my Netflix instant queue and intended to give it the same love as the members of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But I have to admit... I liked it.<br /><br />Sky Captain uses green screen in the same way old action film serials and features used matte paintings, model effects and cardboard sets and they got the same effect.<br /><br />If you take it for the action film it is it's worth a watch. Although, I did tune my TV's color to black and white about halfway through. (IMO it should have been presented that way)<br /><br />Anything I have to say negative about the film is only nitpicking.<br />They got the feel of the 30s-50s style down with the exceptions being that the acting wasn't hammy, and if they where going to use CGI they could have made it look like the model effects and puppetry used in the 30s & 50s, and it should have been in black & white.<br />However, those nitpicks aren't enough to detract to the film and should be over looked if not ignored.<br /><br />At the end of the day it's simply great adventure cinema and fun for the whole family.

0307951529|5.0|With our current economy forcing so many people out of work, the biggest trend for earning a living is the entrepreneurial spirit. Similar to the crash of the early 1900's, when there is no corporation to earn from, we have to figure out new ways to earn a living, and that means finding a niche that needs to be filled.<br /><br />Chris Buillebeau tells us his own story of having to find a niche, and then provides many more. These are inspirational as well as thought provoking, but he doesn't stop there. Next he provides a path for us to follow to help us find our passion as well as a niche. After all, how many times have we heard that when we do something we love, money will follow? So he helps us find what we love, or at least find what others need that we can provide. He also provides \\"reality check\\" items along the way to keep us grounded including a \\"one page business plan\\", advertising ideas, fundraising ideas, and much more.<br /><br />This is an excellent guide for anyone wanting to get away from the corporate world and start something new, but it is also inspirational work for the rest of us showing that ingenuity is still out there.
0345803493|1.0|I am at a loss for words on these three books.  I am not sure how they got on anyone's best seller list.  Absolutely no story plot.  Just smut from the beginning to the end.  I did finish the third book because I always finish a series but I can assure you I will never buy anything else from this author.  It really is a shame when so many people think this is literature.

B007XH6BPG|5.0|\\"Squackett\\"  sounds like it could be the name of an exotic bird or the name of an Indian tribe.  In fact, it's a hybrid that refers to a musical entity composed of Yes bassist Chris Squire and ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett.  The name \\"Squackett\\" may not be music to the ears, but this partnership certainly is.<br /><br />Both Squire and Hackett are on something of an artistic roll.  Hackett recently released \\"Beyond the Shrouded Horizon,\\" which manages to be accessible, melodic, inventive, adventurous, and sublime all at the same time.  Squire's band, Yes, recently came out with \\"Fly from Here,\\" their most rewarding effort in ages.<br /><br />Squackett is a collaboration that will almost certainly delight fans of both Genesis and Yes.  There are no grand concepts here or epic-length songs; just consistently excellent tunes with some great grooves, strong melodic hooks, interesting arrangements, and exemplary musicianship.  Songs like \\"Sea of Smiles,\\" \\"Tall Ships,\\" and \\"Can't Stop the Rain\\" are ear candy in the best sense; you'll want to listen to the music again and again to savor the effervescent melodies, the rich sonic textures, and the imaginative interplay between two master musicians.  This partnership is what musical chemistry is all about.<br /><br />Scott O'Reilly<br />Author of \\"Yes and Philosophy.\\"

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Ridley Scott's \\"Prometheus\\" is the yin to \\"Avatar's\\" yang. Both are high-budget, visually stunning sci-fi films. But while James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" was a crowd-pleasing affair, creating a vibrant, almost psychedelic world, \\"Prometheus\\" is a somber, cerebral and ambiguous piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />Two archaeologists, Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) discover cave paintings around the world, all from different civilizations and eras, which point to a moon far away in space which has the ability to support life. The two are convinced that the creators of human life (or \\"Engineers\\" as they refer to them) are from there, and that the paintings are an actual invitation to visit. They find a corporate sponsor (Wayland Corp.) willing to bankroll a trillion-dollar space mission to the faraway moon to investigate (although it's clear from the beginning that they have their own motives beyond just the archeologists' fantasy of meeting humanity's creators). So off Elizabeth and Charlie go, along with an entire crew which includes android David (a spellbinding Michael Fassbender) and Wayland Corp. administrator (an icy Charlize Theron).<br /><br />And so it begins. Anyone who's seen any of the \\"Alien\\" films will have no doubt that the crew is not, sadly, going to be meeting up with a benevolent, advanced civilization that created humanity and welcomes them with open arms. The film is called \\"Prometheus,\\" which refers to a Greek myth about a god who is punished for helping humanity by being forced to have his liver eaten, and then regenerate in order to relive the ordeal day after day. In my opinion, the myth of \\"Oedipus\\" would be just as fitting a reference for this film; Oedipus' fatal flaw, his relentless need to learn the truth, is what caused his downfall and suffering. Similarly, the main characters in the film mostly share a need to find the origin and meaning behind human life, and suffer greatly for it.<br /><br />\\"Don't we all want to see our parents die?\\" asks David at one point, which is a strange question coming from an android who doesn't actually have parents per se. But the film explores, on many levels, the oftentimes antagonistic relationship between parent/child and creator/creation.all want to see our parents die?\\" asks David at one point, which is a strange question coming from an android who doesn't actually have parents per se.

0345803485|1.0|This book is awful. I don't understand how a woman could possibly like it unless she has serious emotional damage when it comes to sex and relationships. Don't waste your time, even the writing is awful.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|Safehouse has great cinematography and some really well filmed action sequences with the Borne trilogy type twists, this is the best action thriller to come along in awhile, Denzel is at his best and Ryan Renolds is solid not to mention the supporting cast seals the deal, a can't miss for those who like the genre. I will always tell it like I see it good or bad.<br />Scott M
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|When I saw the commercials for the movie I pretty much knew what to expect, a comedy that was just going to be for general fun.<br /><br />Which pretty much sums it up - put it in the mid range Ben Stiller or Eddie Murphy comedy, probably higher than mid-range because of some very good scenes and the fact that the cast is great in general.  Though it could have been a bit better in places, overall there was enough to make me laugh and have fun.<br /><br />If you go in not expecting \\"Trading Places\\" or \\"The Sting\\" in terms of this type of movie, variation on \\"getting even,\\"  you will enjoy it.

B007P6VM04|5.0|Love the show and the songs chosen are as if I hand selected them myself...love it! Cannot wait until next season!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I read this book in two sittings and was barely able to put it down. Being the first novel I have read by David Baldacci, I can guarantee there will be several more purchased on my Kindle. With such a complex series of events and unpredictable character structures, Baldacci continues to have you on your toes until the very last pages of the novel.<br /><br />The main character, Will Robie, finds himself in an unnerving string of events. As a professional killer, he is forced to confront his hidden sense of humanity as the world conspires against him. The relationships that build around the top secret life of Will Robie have you second guessing every next step that he takes.<br /><br />Exciting crime thriller with an up to date political twist. A must read when you have a solid block of time to finish it!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I enjoyed the story enough to download the next two.  However, it took awhile to get past the first person POV.  It's just weird to say \\"I carry the stick...\\" rather than \\"I carried the stick...\\"  Very, very strange way to write this story.  Had it been done in 3rd person, it would have been a great improvement.  Otherwise, it's a good story line I just wish it had been written by someone like Koontz who could have given it meat.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have really enjoyed this Blu-Ray set, and I have only just started delving into the extra material included.  The box itself is very appealing to the eye, and is packed with so much quality extras its ridiculous, and the new HD restoration of the movies looks amazing!  I highly recommend this set.
076790382X|5.0|Entertaining, and right on. One doesn't have to be away<br />from the USA for twenty years to wonder what has happened<br />to the country. Bill Bryson does a great job keeping the<br />reader's interest.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|This cover gets a lot of use, as I use my 'Fire frequently.  However, after about six months of ownership, I see that the elastic strap that secures the cover is becoming a little weak.  I wish the strap was more durable.
1601253788|4.0|Bestiaries are one of the most important tools a GM has at hand. Monsters and villains are the most important factor in a game. Too much of the same monsters, and players get bored. At the same, a very weird mix can truly unbalance the game and make the players feel like a Scooby Doo show, a different monster each week.<br /><br />Some other people have stated in their reviews the different components in the book. If you are a player, move on, these books are better left at the GM's hands. If you are a GM, you must have a bestiary already, so there is little we can say in terms of presentation.<br /><br />Paizo has been producing book of the highest quality in terms of materials and presentation. Expect the same thing here.<br /><br />As far as content go, this book offers such a mixed variety of monsters that is next to impossible to not find something that is useful for your campaigns. As well, the mythology mix in this book certainly helps you get creative in thinking in new ways to spice up the encounters in your games.<br /><br />I stringly recommend this book. For me, the oriental creatures were the deal breakers and as soon as I saw an example of them, I knew I had to have this book.

B0081KTI0E|2.0|The atmosphere infusing every scene and setting for \\"The Woman in Black\\" is so heavy, unrelenting, and smothering, that it is hard to just watch the movie or delve into the story. I've never seen a film that so unrelentingly reminds its audience of its intention through such a thick slathering of motif, artifice, lighting, and gloom.<br /><br />Yes, this is a ghost story, a horror tale that should be frightening. There are long hallway shots in the haunted mansion that mimic Kubrick's corridors in that mammoth hotel in The Shining, shots that should build even more dread and anticipation than they do. The rooms are filled with so many oddities and antiques (someone really had a thing about monkeys, perhaps a homage to those flying terrors from the \\"Wizard of Oz\\") that these inanimate curiosities stole the scenes from the actors.<br /><br />The actors---chiefly the male leads, Daniel Radcliffe and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds---all seem to be walking through the sets as though they had been dropped into a carnival fun house and left to improvise reactions and lines. The ghostly woman in black startles more than she frightens, and most of the remaining characters seem stricken with dread and grief, making one wonder why they did not leave this dreadful place.<br /><br />The plot trajectory, alas, moved in a straightforward, if slow, line to the inevitable conclusion, which suggests that the studio was more interested in potential sequels than telling a good story the first time out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a game with a lot of games on it :). you get points and stuff. but some really hard. :( . there's. about 10 games and you to beat them to unlock others or u can buy them

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|As horrible as the situation that happened to her was it was a great book. It made you see and feel everything that happened to her. She was a brave young girl and is even more now to be able to share her story with us.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Everyone else in my office is reading it and raving about it. That alone should have warned me. I forgot that I work with a bunch of happily married ladies who find the Housewives shows shocking. I thought I was in for a good read. Well, I no longer need a thesaurus for blushing, flushing, biting a lip, climaxing, etc. I started reading it a week ago. I'm trying to finish. I really am. But Anne Rice did it better, and I couldn't stand Twilight. This terrible excuse for Twilight fanfiction might be shocking for people used to vanilla all the time, but for those who've read erotica--or at least decent romance--this just comes off trite and repetitive.<br /><br />Okay, a twenty-one year old virgin with no clue about sex, the internet and men in this day and age. In some far corner of the world, okay, I could accept that. But in America? That pushes at my belief a little too hard. The eligible billionaire who has eyes for only the shy, blushing virgin. Yawn. The fact that she thinks of herself as plain, and yet every person with a Y-chromosome is in love with her. Are you sure this is Ana, and not Bella? The intro to bondage? Type anything to do with bondage into your favorite search engine. Remove the safe-search setting. Whatever comes up will be infinitely more shocking, interesting and believable than this book.<br /><br />If the sex wasn't painful enough to get through (in every sense of the word), the main characters are completely lifeless. They perform the same robotic actions in every interaction with each other. He says something. She blushes, flushes, bites her lip. He says something else that starts the reaction over again. And then they have sex.<br /><br />If you're desperate for a read or stuck in the airport for a while, go for it. Otherwise, grab any of the recommendations from the other reviewers and save your sanity.
0756405890|5.0|Name of the Wind is nothing short of epic. It has everything a great fantasy book should have and more. I couldn't put it down and am eagerly awaiting the second book in the trilogy! Get this book!
B007MDB71O|5.0|Loved the film, couldn't wait for the dvd and didn't mind paying top dollar for bonus features/etc.--- but Disney did a bonehead move with it's 'second screen' feature--- while there are SOME extras- basically the extended extras/other extras are ON-LINE (like the John Carter diary, production sketches, etc.), rather than stored on either the dvd or the bluray (which would have had plenty of space to store this)... AND made a deal with Best Buy to have a limited bonus disc exclusive to the 3D bluray--- which was sold out in 4 stores in the area on the first day.<br /><br />If Disney is fighting lack of dvd sales, they should think far more about INCLUDING these exclusives and extras to fans of a particular movie who don't mind paying more money to be able to KEEP the extras- not view them with an internet connection, or have to run to BestBuy and fight for a limited amount of copies for extras that are ok, (the bonus disc had a couple of two-three minute extended scenes and a SHORT featurette on the making of.... there's more on the website, but who cares? Wanted these included in the bluray).<br /><br />Anyhow.... if Disney is listening, there are fans who don't mind paying more for extras included ON the disc.<br />If Amazon is listening, I'd fight Disney to get extra exclusives for some of these films.

B006VFLIYK|2.0|From the very begining I found the book hard to put down. Prior to the story's ending, I was certain I had found another author whose books I could explore and digest with great enthusiasm. The story was very well told and organized - it immediately drew you in and moved along at a compelling pace. However (and this is a huge criticism for me) I found the book's ending to be a major disappointment - unworthy of the craftsmanship that went into the rest of the book. With numerous important loose ends and unexplained character relationships, the author ended the book by simply dismissing them all with a set of brief and grossly unsatisfying statements (statements made at the conclusion by the book's characters). The facts and angles revealed in the ending to the book were critical aspects and should have been worked into the story for the reader to discover as things unfolded - they should not have been presented simply as a pile of facts lumped into a few short summary sentences at the story's end. It was as though the author got tired of writing and just wanted the book to come to an end - a real let-down. I have not read any other Baldacci books and with this as my first Baldacci experience, I am not sure I will be in a hurry to do so.

B003DNN0L2|3.0|This isn't the worst movie in the world but I didn't feel engaged by the story telling or the characters. As a consequence I was bored through out the whole film and couldn't wait for it to be over. I also thought the character designs and animation were off putting- their facial expressions never seemed quite right and they all looked like they were put together by an amateur taxidermist. All and all- bleh.

B0088RQ4X4|2.0|I for surely say I was.  I have read all of the 1 star reviews and found they concurred with my own thoughts very well.  I had no idea that this was based on any book series.  After reading that ALL 11 books were in one film I now understood why there was no plot line, no depth to the story and no character development.  The CGI was not very good.  The dog like creature was the only thing enjoyable in it.  Comparing it to a B movie was a bit unfair cause at least they have far more thought placed into them.  Each to their own enjoyment I am sure however the 5 star folks here I imagine do not see many other movies.
B004RE29WW|5.0|I don't know why people have so much disdain for this film.  It was brilliantly directed, and acted as well.  Sigourney Weaver was amazing, as usual.  It was different from the others, and that's fine.  That's why it's NOT THE SAME MOVIE as Alien, Aliens, or Alien Resurrection.  It stands firmly on its own.  Bravo, all cast & crew!

B005LZW8FO|5.0|\\"Another Earth\\" is truly science fiction as art, and certain to be one of my favorite movies of the year, possibly even entering my all-time top 10 (putting it in the company of \\"Donnie Darko\\", \\"Babe\\", and \\"Blue Velvet\\"). I highly recommend it; it is beautiful, profound, touching, melancholy, and sad.<br /><br />I will often get goose bumps when experiencing a work of art that truly moves me, be it music, a painting, a movie, whatever. I got goose bumps more often watching \\"Another Earth\\" than any other movie I have ever seen--and I watch hundreds a year.<br /><br />Some have complained that \\"Another Earth\\" isn't truly science fiction, for example because the gravitational affects of the other earth aren't shown. If you read about the production, you'll find that there was indeed a scene exploring that, but it was cut out of the film. Good, I say, and I saw the perfect response to that complaint on some blog somewhere (or possibly left as a note on another review here): Metaphors don't have gravity.

B004J4WKTW|2.0|After reading the reviews of this book, I was very disappointed while reading it.  The book did not live up to the reviews.  It was somewhat tedious.
0345803507|5.0|Fifty Shades of Gray is an exciting and moving story of love overcoming the effectsof an abusive childhood.The plot twists and turns keep the reader engrossed throughout the trilogy. I was glad I bought all 3 books at once, so I could go immediately to the next one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you were like me and became totally enamored (and ultimately disappointed) by the Swan Station story arc in Lost, then you NEED to read this book.  Where Lost dropped the ball, Wool takes it, runs with it and does not disappoint.  A mysterious underground dwelling, hidden secrets,  computers, protective suits, lies, strong characters, technology and hidden pasts - this book has it all!  I will continue to buy all of Hugh Howey's Wool books.  I'm a fan for life!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I loved the book. It certainly keeps the suspense going & I can't wait for the next book to be out.
1613822286|5.0|Thematically written, this novel about young women treading their way through womanhood seems mundane and axiomatic to a 21st century reader - but one must remember that the author of this novel was born in early 19th century.  So, the boy-meets-girl/boy-loses-girl/boy-gets-girl/boys-drops-girl/boy-regets-girl theme overplayed against girl-can-get-anyone, but-chooses-the-wrong-one/girl-loses-guy/girl-becomes-ostracized is something we have read numerous times, and seen too many movies culture; but was novel to this author's generation.<br /><br />This writer, influenced by the British greats - Dickens-like irreverence seems to be the most easily found - makes this parody both poignant and sharp in its criticism of English high society.<br /><br />There is the good girl -  Amelia Sedley - who befriends the not-as-good girl - Becky Sharp - and the two enter womanhood with the Napoleonic-feared world while watching their husbands going off to save the queen.  One ends up a widow, and the other a wife to a potentially wealthy man.  One lives high and mighty while the other has to deliver her son to his grandfather to assure that he can live a life better than their poverty which Dickens brought to our attention around the same generation - Dicekns and this author were born in 1811 and 1812.<br /><br />As much as Amelia can be abundantly written about as an angel, literary censures could only allow suggestive statements about Becky who is played as a prostitute and murderess.  Neither of Becky's stronger character traits is graphically evidenced nor proven by actual fact, but the hints are there.<br /><br />Writing styles of this author remain as impressive today as they did in his years of old.  The impressively articulate method of descriptive analysis of personalities, characteristics  and scenery with ornate use of the language can only be seen too infrequently in today's literature.  So, as old as the story line may seem to be, the writing seems ageless.<br /><br />Arguments exist that this novel, unlike its peers, uniquely is devoid of a hero.  Amelia is just a survivor benefiting from others, Becky is a Scarlett O'Hara without a soul, and their husbands are young rich kids who are either killed at too young an age (and not an angel upon his death) or fail to use the financial and social advantage received  in life to be anything more than a gambler or huckster.<br /><br />Like great war novels this has many layers.  [[ASIN:B004ELAHJA War and Peace ]] or [[ASIN:1451635621 Gone with the Wind]] may be the ultimate novels of this genre, but each author must have been influenced by this work written almost one century prior to Gone and more than three decades before War.Arguments exist that this novel, unlike its peers, uniquely is devoid of a hero.

B0064JGWYY|4.0|Wanna see Castle having all the fun, while being missed by Beckett (who has to work with \\"Irongates\\" this time... and kinda likes it, but not as much)?  Then this is your episode of \\"Castle.\\"  I like it enough to watch very, very seldom, as the Beckett-Castle moments aren't as interesting or endearing.  This episode belongs in with the ones in the first season more than the more mature and sophisticated ones in the fourth season.  However, I can give it a pass.  I didn't regret viewing it, but I won't see it again in a while.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great app from people who like challenges. this way you have something to do for lunch break.
B005UKPHEY|5.0|This time, centered mostly on Ryan, with remarkable performances by Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion as Beckett and Castle.  To some it's too dark (and a critic even referred to it as a \\"bad\\" episode), but to me this one allows the actors to show their dramatic skills.  I like it a lot.  Image quality and sound were very satisfactory.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the game i think it is really fun and most of all addicting. I know this is not in the subject but I think that they should make NBA JAM for the kindle fire.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Product came quickly and in great shape!!  The movie was very inexpensive.  This is a childhood favorite and can't wait to watch it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was so not worth all the hype.  Trying to figure out why it would be banned at the library.  I have read much hotter adult books and this sucked in comparison.  I will not buy two or three.  I've read steamier Harlequin romances.  If you really like erotic read all of the Zane novels.<br /><br />Not very many women are lucky enough to go from virgin to hot orgasmic queens in a matter of weeks.  I felt compelled to finish to get to the good part.  Never really found the good part.  Oh well, haven't paid $10 for a book in a long time, especially a Kindle edition.  You live and you learn.<br /><br />A movie version, really?  I'll see that when it hits cable.  She should enjoy her money.  Laughing at all the suckers who jumped on the bandwagon.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me. It is a good book. It was basically stuff I already knew but sometimes you need to refresh on it.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Michael Connelly is the best detective writer on the scene right now, with his Harry Bosch character leading the way through the riveting and emotional descriptions of the many complex situations a detective could face.  Thankfully I'm retired, or I'd have another work day following an all night reading session.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderful book! Couldn't put it down!<br /><br />Impossible not to feel Greysessed after reading it. I fell in love with the story and now I feel as if I've lost a good old friend. The writing was compelling and easy to follow, the characters has depth and were lovable.<br /><br />My friend recommended me the book and now I'm doing the same thing to everyone I know. Ms. James certainly deserves her success!<br /><br />I can only say: I want MORE!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I love this app you should download it. It reminds me of Mario. It has a lot of levels and its awesome.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Fun free puzzle game.  Good for all ages. Perfect for filling time in the car or a quiet afternoon of no Tv!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game and if you think it is not a good game get it and then play it see if u like it and what r those things chafing uswhen we start!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!q q
0486284735|5.0|I read the bad review which were generally about the errors in this version. Any errors aside, this book is incredible, one of my favorite books of all time. Readers will fall in love with Elizabeth Bennet, a young girl with a big personality and an insufferable family who learns that love can mean learning to accept the person you choose, flaws and all. If you are a fan of subtle romance novels that are well written and hold messages about the nature of mankind, then Pride and Prejudice is the novel for you.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|The lack of character developement regarding Travis's violent behaviour and Abby's selfish immaturaty, make it hard for the reader to respect these main characters. The content lacks intrigue and fails to stir emotion within the reader. The author has aimed to create a great love story but fails by depicting a love which is obsessive and unhealthy. True love is not driven by lust or proved by being hopelessy dependant on eachother. It is proved when one is able to stand alone, but chooses to stand together with the one who inspires them the most.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is the best game ever and on the movie theater you have to watch the movie then get the money
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game glad its on kindle fire addicting and fun. great game. super awesome love love it play all the time
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a beastly appp it is wicked and fun u should get it best app in the store by far
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I love how the movies look on Blu ray. Amazing color, sound and quality that gives you the best picture. It would be 5 stars, if it wasn't the box I didn't like. Believe me it looks really good, and I'm proud to own it. But the Blu rays are really hard to get out, and I fear of scratching them trying to. It's like a really thick paper box that you slide the blu ray in and out. You have to like pinch the disk to try to take it out, so far haven't scratch them, and I don't trust anyone else taking them out for that reason.<br />But for $29, it still was a great deal!
B0031RAOVY|3.0|WARNING! WARNING!<br /><br />Do NOT see this movie! Sounds nice, right, a family movie even.<br /><br />Holy crap.<br /><br />Bawlied like a loon! Major tear jerker!! Like my whole face hurt, tear jerker! I am going back to my movie rule: it must have any or all of the following, space ships, lot's of blood and explosions, or lot's of music. Done!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's super dynamic and entretaining. Great and Scratz it's crazy and super fun. Also, the other villages are super cute.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|this game is pretty fun. my daughters love getting on their fires and playing this game. I would buy more games like this. and @ 1.49 u cant bet the price.

B007VGXS8M|2.0|This game was fun in the beginning and then the harder levels were frustrating and impossible. I wish I had not biught this game.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is fun I am really really good at this game I like how you can choose your characters you want to be and I also like the coins and how you can get power ups
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|Spock should have stayed dead. Robin curtis is/was hotter than pre-scientology kirstie alley. Could have had her with a bigger role in voyage home instead of spock walking around san fran in a robe. But I digress.... Khan!!!!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It's the perfect combination of every effective principle out there to build muscle and burn fat. It debunks all of the major fitness myths and replaces them with proven strategies and a simple formula for getting where you want to go. If a friend was looking to seriously increasing their fitness level and get into great shape, this would be the first book I'd recommend; it's concise, unpretentious and most of all makes sense.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|it sucked I liked it but you always had to upgrade it and it took up to much space and things were to expensive
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Such a great album. I can feel every song and that each one means so much. Her voice is so beautiful. I don't know how I found Emeli, but I'm glad I did, I'm happy I did. I only had to hear one song and I was hookedand instantly bought the entire album for $5. Thanks Amazon and thank you Emeli Sande!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book will change your LIFE! Liesel just moved in with her foster parents on Himmel Street.What happens? A boy who never stops trying, a jewish fistfighter, a whole lot of german curse words and quite a lot of thievery.This book will make you laugh,smile and cry at the same time.This book will change your perspective of life.
B0086700CM|5.0|easy to advance levels with a little practice. no need to spend real money for tokens. you can earn enough over time.
0802473156|5.0|The main idea behind this book is that just as people have unique personality preferences, we all have unique preferences for what we find satisfying and motivating when it comes to love.
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is hard and challenging and fun I would regimens it to all gameers and people who just want fun.
B005HSL626|3.0|I love this game I play it all the time on my friends phone and I loved it but this one has way to many ads right in the middle of my game or at the beggining or end it will sho an ad so I am not imppressed
B003K15INU|2.0|I'm an author and an acolyte for e-books. This is the most poorly converted text I've ever read on a Kindle. \\"They'll\\" is often rendered as \\"They 11\\", \\"It's\\" as \\"It ¿5\\". Paragraph breaks are missing, words are mis-transliterated (\\"oi\\" for \\"of\\" \\"sevens-five\\" for seventy-five, \\"lite\\" for \\"life.\\" Sentences end in the middle and pick up who knows how many words, paragraphs, or pages later? Comically, the book's title is randomly inserted into at least two sentences: \\"But he could not see how even the coldest calculation could help american pastoral him here.\\" \\"In the few american pastoral moments I spent with him in my life, I felt better about myself...\\" I'm pretty sure that's not how Roth wrote it.<br /><br />And this is not isolated. There are examples on almost every page. Great book. Do NOT get the Kindle edition.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app I play it every day and its really addicting. My brother also loves this Imangi Studios did real good job.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My favorite app!  There have zero problems and I love the marvelous layout.  This is a great study tool for everyday purposes.
0307272702|5.0|This book was amazing.  Slow read at first but it's worth it! So much great information. we have always learned that Fat Free or Sugar Free Foods were the best choices.  No wonder everyone has weight issues.....This book dispels so many myths about how we look at food and weight loss.  He explains how food becomes fuel vs fat.  No gimmicks or crazy diets, or particular gym equipment needed.  Just shows us how things happen and how to avoid it. This book should be in every high school.  I wish I read it much sooner in life!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this really addictive game best game ever iv never played a game this fun love it everybody needs to try it u can get off easy
0071624058|4.0|The book is clearly written and gives good advices about how to well perform in the test. The CD included helps in preparing for the speaking and listening areas. It could have been even more helpful if it gave more possible practice exercises of speaking and listening. The CD is also useful to get comfortable with the way the test works and looks on the computer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book and the whole trilogy!! It's a love story that you must read! You won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />LOVE it!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone I spoke with told me this was THE book to read, and I must say it really did live up to all the hype! Fantastic read.
0345803485|4.0|I couldn't put the book down. And I'm embarrassed to admit how long it's been since I was engaged enough to get through a whole book. So, I really loved the story. However, from a literary standpoint, it was awful. The author has a severely lacking vocabulary and apparently has never been introduced to a thesaurus. The publisher should also be embarrassed that it didn't make attempts to fix the gross overuse of the same words and adjectives. From that perspective, the book was a disappointment. Nevertheless, I read all three books in about 8 days and would recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love love this app. Learning to use it more and more. Thank you for making it so accessible in so many versions.
0679805273|5.0|Bought this as a graduation gift for my friend's granddaughter who graduated from high school.  She loves the book.  I will be purchasing this for anyone I know who graduates.
0060254920|5.0|My children loved this book when they were small.  Had to get a copy for my granddaughter.  The day it came I had to read it several times.  Each time we finished my three year old granddaughter said, \\"One more time GG.\\"  She is so entertained each time we read it together.
0553577123|5.0|Published in the year I was born, but somehow that did not intrigue me to read it,<br /><br />Recommended by many for reading during high school, but that did not inspire either,<br /><br />Discussions and recommendations occasionally throughout my life, neither,<br /><br />The tragedy, and the level of gravity that this \\"story\\" (if you will) somehow always struck me as \\"in the past\\" when I was first aware of it, and then later it was just too \\"unpleasant to think about\\", or too \\"tragic\\", etc., and (not for nothing) naturally, all these things are true in varying degrees.<br /><br />I avoided the movie, the tv specials, etc. Recently, however, I learned of the new \\"Frank Family\\" volume by Mirjam Pressler and ordered it. Before reading it, however, I decided, FINALLY, that I needed to read \\"The Diary\\", and I learned of the excisions etc. in the original edition, and of Pressler's and Otto Frank's edition, and obtained a copy (above). I read it in 2 days, and have since gone through it a second time., and surely will be reading or refering to it again.<br /><br />Simply put, I am amazed that it really took all this time for me to get to this...I almost feel ashamed of myself, and yet, at the same time feel that I was at last ready to embrace this sad (and yet SO uplifting) collection of thoughts, etc., of Anne's during those 2 years she spent in the Annex as she called it, and to then, so very close to when she would have been liberated, with her family and those who accompanied them in hiding, to have been discovered, arrested, and shipped off to the camp(s) and to their deaths....heartbreaking, indeed...so tragic, so sad.<br /><br />Amazing in the level and quality of her writing skills!

B0086700CM|4.0|I love love love the game. But, when I got 5000 coins, I decided I wanted the wall paper. When it was done downloading, it said look in your gallery. So I did. I looked and NOTHING was there.<br /><br />If you have th Kindle Fire, DONT GET THE WALL PAPERS. THEY TRICK YOU.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK/KINDLE READING DOWN.<br />IT GRABBED FROM THE GET GO AND I DID NOT THINK<br />I WOULD LIKE THIS BOOK.

B0064ORVCQ|1.0|3 d effects so bad that i adjusted the settings on both my projector and blu ray throughout the movie .  i thought something must be wrong.  but no.  finally got the idea to put in \\"hugo\\" as a reference 3d disc and everything was great.  all i got out of this movie was frustration.  that said, the 2 d version was great but don't waste your money here.  i'm shocked that 3d is still so early in it's development when i see a product like this.  i expected a blockbuster like this to command the best technology has to offer.  i was wrong.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is entertaining and difficult enough to keep you interested. The only thing I have issue with is the angel wings. You buy them, put them on but if you don't die in 30 seconds they vanish. Otherwise, I love it. So does my 10 year old son.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|loved this book ,hated that it ended and bought the second one as soon as i was finished .i would reccomend this book to women of all ages !

B0025UHKNS|2.0|I purchased this item for my Dad for Father's Day and although I thought this product was great easy to use my Dad did not.  He found it to be very difficut to program and set up, he was always lost in some screen and could never exit out.  He is a big man with big fingers and at 65yr old could never get to the screen he needed.  Just became to frustrating. So saddly I am returning

0425263908|5.0|I can't wait for the next installment to see what happens.  I really liked the characters and thought it was both better written and a better story than 50 Shades.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|Only this masterful work could be as exquisite as it is if it weren't for the painstaking rapport of many, many geniuses!<br />While it very easily could have been done with an extremely large amount less graphic blood-letting, it is the only flaw.<br />The Blu-ray brings out the macabre and the infinite dark but incredible definition of the bricks of the buildings and it is mesmerizing! One of the great masterpieces of musical theater done by a masterpiece of collaboration.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain is right: the world can't stop talking. But until I read her book, I thought I was the only one who observed this. It felt so good to hear someone else observe that most things these days (even attending church!) are organized around the extroverted ideal. The book was a joy to read. I'd recommend it to anyone who grew up being called \\"the quiet one\\", \\"the homebody\\", or \\"the smart one,\\" in the context of trying to \\"explain\\" your \\"odd\\" behavior. Be yourself!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a fun read I liked all three books the sex parts was very steamy at first but then became maybe a little boring but the storyline was quite good

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I must warn you all this is a movie for only the original Alien fans. This film is amazing in 5 ways: Story, Special Effects, Musical Score, Acting, and Visually. This is a truly is the #1 Sci-Fi film of the year!!!! But....SPOILER ALERT..the original alien is not present, but the other creatures make up for it! I only recommend this to Ridley Scott's Alien fans, forget the other films, because this one kicks them in the balls!!!!!

I downloaded the book using the kindle cloud reader liked it but it could not figure out how to read the book on my other devices and the kindle cloud there is no way to increase the font either.

1594202842|1.0|I was hoping for some useful information that I might incorporate into my own parenting techniques. I think it never hurts to read about how other folks are raising kids, whether a book is about an individual's methods or about cultural generalizations.  This book is truly about just one individual's parenting method  under the guise of what she considers to be the Chinese cultural norm. To me, it would have been much more authentic if she had just claimed, this is the way I was raised and this is the way I am going to raise my kids instead of throwing a billion other Chinese strangers into the mix and claiming this is how they do it too.  I suspect it is not how most Chinese raise their kids and thankfully many Chinese and other Asian parents have written reviews stating emphatically that her broad brush statements on Chinese parenting are totally unfounded.<br /><br />What I gathered from this read is that Ms. Chua is a very, very driven stage mother and she justifies her parenting via her ethnicity. There are parents like this in every culture. Ms. Chua's stage is music and grades and there is nothing wrong with wanting your children to be good students but her tactics are downright disturbing. She has written a book that pulls away the curtain on her family and yikes is what you get.<br /><br />I got the feeling that if Ms. Chua hit a dog with her car while running late to one of her children's music lessons she would be inclined to leave the dog suffering in the street, with some perverse justification that it was the dog's fault for not being smart enough to avoid her car.  She makes Chinese people look like mindless automatons how follow their leaders without question, obsessed with winning at any cost. \\"We Chinese do not question authority\\" Chua iterates again and again. Ick.  Furthermore, not once anywhere in the book does she mention anything about teaching morals to her children. Win, win, win. There is no room for charity or philanthropy or empathy. Sheis an intellectual bully. Nothing wrong with being smart and working hard but clearly all of her efforts are for her own sense of self-worth, not her daugthers.<br /><br />If you are looking for a comparative book that is well-researched try \\"Bringing Up Bebe\\" by Pamela Druckerman.  It is written by a journalist who performed countless interviews and provides voluminous citations in describing French parenting techniques, often-times compared and contrasted with Western methods but without the contempt of Ms. Chua.

1589795474|5.0|This book is not a how-to-become wealthy book.  It is a statistical look at the rich in america.  The data speaks for itself and there are many lessons the reader can take away from this book.  But readers wanting a secret formula will be disappointed because this is not a get-rich quick book.  I found it fascinating and highly recommend it for several reasons.<br /><br />1) Again, the data speaks for itself.  The rich aren't bankers or doctors, they are self employed individuals and professionally (lawyers, accountants, etc).  Self employment is a big factor in becoming wealthy, but the author also notes that many businesses fail. So being self employed isn't guaranteed to bring wealth.<br /><br />2) The social commentary about our consumer society is subtle, but definitely there and so true.  American's do a great job about generating income (playing offensive) but a horrible job with spending (playing defense).  The secret to wealth creation is maximizing both.  Unfortunately, we live in a consumer society with lots of pressure to buy new cars, nice card, borrow money, buy nice homes, takes vacations, etc and it is destroying wealth for most baby-boomers and our children.<br /><br />3) While the lessons of being frugal are important, I found the pattern of becoming wealthy and failing to pass it on to our children very powerful.  Many business owners struggle to become successful and don't want their children to suffer a similar path as they did.  Therefore, they encourage them to get educated and pursue high paying professional jobs.  As a result, they teach them to earn a lot of money, but also expose them to high spending lifestyles and neighborhoods.  Private school, professional jobs, all support a consumption lifestyle to fit it.  The result is that wealth-producing mindset isn't being pass on to our kids and its our fault.<br /><br />4) The car buying habits of the wealthy are boring!.  It could easily have been summarized in a few short paragraphs. If you are in any business related to a network, buy from a dealer and network for referrals and repeat business.  If you are not, buy used and know what you are buying.<br /><br />5) The advice about gifting money to children if also powerful.  Too many people support their kids and subjugate them to a life of financial struggle as a result.  I would not have understood this if not for the data.  I am guilty of this.  My father regular give me money and I use it to support the lifestyle my wife and I want.  He's subsidizing a lifestyle I would not be able to afford otherwise.  He's enabling the spending and a consumer lifestyle.  yikes.<br /><br />6) One big factor in becoming wealth is your spouse.  The statistics made this very clear. If you are a saver and your wife is not, you're in trouble.  You both need to be on the same page and have goals.  I'm going to send my newly married brother-in-law this book.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want to learn about some of the characteristic and qualities of people who have become wealthy, this is an excellent book.  Its a statistical look, so the number and percentages are a bit dry, but very powerful.  The insight into our society is also eye opening.  It is a not a guidebook on becoming wealthy.  You do not need to be a high income earner to benefit from this book.  There are numerous examples in the book of people with modest income that have saved for retirement.  Living below their means is a big factor, but so too is their attitude towards money & wealth. If you can forgive the dull parts and heed what the data indicates, a lot of people could benefit from this book.<br /><br />I've read a lot of financial books.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this perfect for study or just reading. me and my wife enjoy it much. it works well for us and what we need was a family

B001TH16DI|5.0|Star Trek is one of my all time favorites.  Although the movies are not quite as good as the original series and follow on TV shows, they are still very good.  I watch them over and over.  Good stuff.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I'm a fan of books, movies and documentaries about Naval Special Warfare and am a former member of an Army National Guard Long Range Surveillance Unit (LRSU).<br /><br />\\"Act of Valor\\" nails the genre of inspirational films about the current U.S. military's special operations role in the Global War on Terror. In the same way that Ray Kellogg's \\"The Green Berets\\" presented a patriotic view of U.S. Army Special Operations in the Vietnam conflict, \\"Act of Valor\\" depicts Naval Special Warfare in the Global War on Terror. One significant change is the movie making is much better in \\"Valor\\" since the craft has advanced so much.<br /><br />The depictions of Naval Special Warfare capabilities are as accurate as they come in the public media, with thrilling take-downs at sea using Mark V Special Operations Craft and what may be the first good look in popular media at the previously classified Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) miniature submarine. You also get a look at the often unrecognized Special Warfare Combatant Craft Crewman (SWCC) operations in their riverine boats. Because of the involvment of the U.S. Navy in the production of the film and the use of Naval Special Warfare personnel in the cast the look and feel are real and authentic. Much of this is because of the role of SEAL Captain Duncan Smith, a long time public affairs asset to Naval Special Warfare.<br /><br />The storyline tracks similarly to the recent Tom Clancy novel \\"Against All Enemies\\". This is no coincidence since Clancy's name appears in the credits for \\"Act of Valor\\" as an advisor to the film.<br /><br />For a young audience considering a role in the armed forces and especially Special Operations this is an inspirational resource. It is a genuine flag-waver and performs perfectly in that role.<br /><br />As a film there are a few things about the visual mise en scene or style of filming that are interesting and unique. The gaming/simulation visual influence on \\"Valor\\" is apparent from camera angles that put the viewer behind the weapon of a SEAL operator in the same way games like \\"Call of Duty\\" do in game play. This would be an easy technique to over use, but the production/direction cast of \\"Valor\\" makes smart use of the tool to create suspense and perspective without seeming too \\"gamy\\" or contrived. Camera work with complex aerial, marine and land based scenes range from excellent to good with a lot of the former. There are only a few scenes in the movie that lack sophistication and there are more with jaw-dropping authenticity.<br /><br />In any film depiction of the military intended as a tribute and inspiration the perspective of the movie is unabashedly glorious. It speaks of devotion, honor and sacrifice- as well it should- and it does so very well. This film isn't about balance, it's one perspective and presents that perspective of the Global War on Terror brilliantly. For a little literary balance on the tedium of any military experience you can enjoy a survey of the many great titles about Naval Special Operations in the Global War on Terror such as Marcus Luttrell's newest title \\"Service\\".<br /><br />If you want a thrilling, action packed, well written and filmed accounting of Naval Special Warfare operational capabilities in the Global War on Terror be sure to include \\"Act of Valor\\" in your survey. It earns a five star rating with fast paced action, good story line and strong filmmaking using many current techniques in the craft. It is also one of a growing number of fitting film tributes to the many women and men who have sacrificed so much in the difficult task of defending liberty of all free people around the world.
0307951529|4.0|I'm a long-time reader of Chris Guillebeau's blog, and I've purchased several of his products, including his last book. Because of that, I found most of the material in this book to be just a rehash of things I'd read elsewhere from him.<br /><br />That said, this book is a great introduction on starting a small, bootstrapped business. It doesn't dive too deep into the details, but it's enough to help a business newbie start sketching out some ideas and testing their concepts. I've already recommended it to a couple of people and gave a copy to a friend who's starting up a new venture.<br /><br />While the book seems geared mostly toward new business owners, it also gives loads of case studies that are inspirational even for seasoned entrepreneurs. I recommend it!
0345803493|5.0|Took me a few days before i decided to read this book.  It was a gift for my bday and my friend was worried i was going to be offended by it.  Easy to say this was not the kind of book i would buy for myself.  However, once i started reading it, i was not able to put it down.  Took me a day to finish the entire book.  After a few pages into the book, i was already on Amazon ordering books 2 and 3.<br />Different, refreshing, captivating... Made me blush, laugh, cry... I finished all three books and read them two more times.  Any other book you'll read after this series will feel empty and slow.  Can't wait for more.
B005THRU0C|5.0|This album is very refreshing! I love to hear artists who write and play their own music. Looking forward to many years of Ed! I was very pleased with how quickly I received the cd.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Even though the series have been a bit melancholic and with few joys to be had among the characters, it is taken down a notch further again in the last chapter of this trilogy. It still makes it all the more powerful whenever something good, bad, exciting or tragic happen throughout the book. It is not easy to predict, at least not everything that happens. A bit of what happens you might guess along the way, but you can never be completely certain what will happen or how. And while it often tends to go into parts that seem dark and hopeless it always keeps up your hope.
0307454541|4.0|A page turner, could not put down. However i kinda guessed the ending.  Just not nearly dramatic as it was written.  20 pages to go then i'm starting the next one.
B0079J28NW|5.0|First off let me say that it's about time this film was put back into print, now more generations can discover it's glory. I'm watching the Blu-ray version and I must say it's beautiful (if you have surround sound speakers it sounds incredible). All the free stuff that comes with it is nice (cell reproductions, stickers and booklet). I recommend this product 100%
B007KDFWRG|2.0|I like the song selection, but not the performances on this album.  I understand one of the main facets of a jam band is to perform songs in an extended format and often differently than previous performances, including studio recordings.  I also know Derek Trucks infuses a lot of jazz in his jamming, and some is actually quite good, there was just too much here.  This was very loungy.  2 1/2 stars at best.  I don't expect, nor want to hear songs played exactly the same live, but whoever picked these recordings, for the most part, was just way off.<br /><br />As another reviewer referenced, I also really like \\"Midnight In Harlem\\" and I was really looking forward to hearing it but the band seemed to sleepwalk through it.  There version performed on the 2010 Crossroads Guitar Festival was much better and more passionate and the band and song were still forming then.  Perhaps that is why \\"Coming Home\\" wasn't included here - it will be hard to beat Warren Haynes and Susan Tedeschi singing it together.<br /><br />I have never seen Susan Tedeschi in concert and would like to.  I have seen Derek Trucks with the Allman Brothers and saw firsthand what a talented guitarist he is.  All members of TTB are very talented, unfotunately it wasn't highlighted as well as it could have been here.  I have the chance to see them in concert this summer, but after hearing this album I must think long and hard about spending the kind of money demanded for concerts these days.<br /><br />Based on previous music (live and studio) by all the forms and members of TTB, I automatically figured this album would also be really good. I must say I was disappointed and probably won't listen to it much.  The only real highlight for me was their cover of Stevie Wonders' \\"Uptight\\"

B007JMW46U|5.0|I really like the Sherlock Holmes stories. Of course I knew about the characters, and have seen references to them in other books/tv shows, but I had never read the originial stories.<br />It's nice to 'see' the characters the way they originally where, and to learn a bit of how these stories got together in the first place.<br /><br />Sherlocks deductions are believable (much more so than often portrayed in other works), though this is partly because a lot of the details Sherlock uses are very specific to his own time-frame and you simply have to accept that those are indeed the logical conclusions because you don't know any better. I'm not a native English speaker -though it's been part of my education and everyday life so much that I'm fluent- and enjoy learning a new word once in a while. The stories include a lot of words/names for things that aren't mentioned any-more now (like names for different kinds of coaches) so it's fun to learn what they mean. This is very easy as I'm reading the kindle (for PC) version of the books and it automatically finds the dictionary entries for you.<br /><br />What surprised me was that the stories are relatively short, but it doesn't bother me as they are nice stories for reading in between of other things.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Ignore the pretentious sci-fi geeks. This movie is a great, thought-provoking picture that adds genuine depth to the \\"Alien\\" universe. Alien is a haunted house movie in space, Aliens is a terrific sci-fi action flick, and Prometheus is a brilliant piece of modern cinema. Thrilling, scary, and beautiful.

0439796636|5.0|Oh my god this movie was amazing, I was upset it did not take a award home, it should of won something, the critics just dont know what they are doing. AWSOME MOVIE !!!! Buy this movie.
B007B6T3K4|4.0|Neverworld's End is a step away from the old Xandria sound.  Their new lead singer, Manuela Kraller has a great voice and makes them sound more Nightwish-like (Tarja not Anette).<br /><br />The whole album is good in my opinion, but the tracks that really stand out for me are, Forevermore, Blood on my Hands, Cursed, and Valentine.<br /><br />A very good album, I would recommend it to anyone into this kind of music.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the series on everyone's reading list this summer.  If it's not on yours, it should be.<br /><br />Great characters are what makes it all work.  Sure, the setting is interesting, the predicaments troublesome -- but if the characters didn't grab your attention and make you care, none of it would matter.  And you'll find yourself caring about some you wish you didn't care about!  Hugh Howey allows the place and people to unfold slowly - bit by bit.  The storytelling itself matches the world of which it tells.  Beautifully done!<br /><br />Give the first 10 pages a try, and I bet you'll be as hooked as the rest of us.  If not, I offer my personal apology for steering you wrong.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It shows layers which makes it very useful. in addition it has tip just in case you need.it when you go out to eat. it is amazing. by the way it is FREE
B0079XPUOW|3.0|As a confirmed Scalzi fan, I have to say that this is the second outing from this author lately which has disappointed me. The other was _Fuzzy Nation_, and both imply a certain laziness or uninterest on the part of the author for his later works.<br /><br />_Redshirts_ starts out with an intriguing premise but never develops that premise beyond the most superficial treatment. Instead of a brilliantly executed completely resolved convoluted plot, such as in his _Android's Dream_, _Redshirts_ adopts a tone which can best be described as all participants shouting at each other constantly while on a rushed through poorly explained resolution.<br /><br />Even the resolution isn't fully expressed within the body of the plot. Instead Scalzi resorts to the lame gimmick of 'codas' which aren't really different endings  or variations, but rather tacked on plot resolutions two of which are reasonably interesting (if uninvolving) to read but one of which is more shouting cranked up to 140 dB. Yes, these elements add to the story but they also could have been worked into the main plot bringing a good deal of added texture to this shallow novel, but that would have taken some effort. Instead, (refer back to laziness) they are just thrown on at the end to lengthen the book by about a third and it's left to the reader to shoehorn them into the main narrative.<br /><br />I have enjoyed previous Scalzi works so much I will surely give him another try if he chooses to produce another novel, but I doubt I'll pre-order as I did this one. I held off reviewing this work because I feel rather sad having to give two three star reviews in a row from an author I have always held to be a solid five star, but that's the way I see it.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I got this today for $0.99 for my Kindle Fire, and at that price it is OK. This software has a number of problems, which I guess are rather typical of these wannabe MS compatible suites. Word and Excel files have subtle formatting issues, but not bad enough to be a show-stopper. Of course, it chokes on really complex spreadsheets, but you weren't serious about using them on your mobile anyway, were  you? Things get more wobbly with Powerpoint presentations. Even moderate complexity causes trouble of various sorts, including failure to render essential items, making this a hit-or-miss experience. Worst, however, is the PDF viewing. It is simply inadequate. Even relatively simple files fail to render properly. Frequently, a message appears that the \\"page contains objects that cannot be displayed\\" - and one sees only a blank sheet. Or graphics are somehow corrupted, showing thick black paint in some places where line art is supposed to be. Also, the PDF viewer is very slow. Neither the Kindle Fire's built-in PDF viewer nor the one in Quick Office Pro have these issues. So, fail mark on that one.<br /><br />Another turn-off are the constantly present upsells: buy a \\"font package\\" for $4.99 to \\"improve the look of your documents\\". Buy a mediocre dictionary for $21.99 (!!!). Please - get lost!<br /><br />As I said, it's OK at $0.99, but I would not spend any more on this bug fest. Quick Office Pro is better, especially for PDF viewing, although not great either. Face it: you still need a real computer to work with office docs.
B007JLCO34|5.0|What a pleasant surprise it was to read this classic about 4 daughters and their mother carrying on despite the hardships of deprivation and war.  The very different personalities have a deep love and respect for one another.  The book is in many ways timeless and worth the time taken to read it.

B0081KTI0E|2.0|I rented this movie from Redbox because the trailer had looked interesting. The acting and premise of the movie were promising, but the story seemed underdeveloped. Daniel Radcliff ventures to a mysterious small town where the people seem to want to get rid of him as quickly as possible. We learn this is because of a local superstition that results in the death of the town's children. Sounds interesting enough, but the story tends to drag, and there isn't really anything to differentiate this movie from others in the genre. Throughout the movie we see similar sequences played over and over--a good portion of the movie is just Radcliff walking around a house.<br /><br />The story falls short and does nothing to invigorate an already stale genre. This movie is worth a rent at best, which is unfortunate because I was looking forward to seeing Radcliff in a new role.

B002IFT1ZA|4.0|The only bad thing about this is the packaging is complete overkill.  Besides the actual folder that houses the DVDs, there is a box that goes over that and ANOTHER box/slip cover that goes over that.  I know that this is how most serial DVDs are being packaged, but maybe there is a different way.  Ok, the bad out of the way.  There is a poster-type fold out with a map of Westeros, and the major houses, very useful.

B002QW7ALM|4.0|Films like this, Event Horizon, The Descent, or any film that, on the surface, looks to be nothing more than a trite and shallow straight-to-bargain-bin pointless sci-fi ripoff of better films, seem to always get the short end of the stick with critics, invariably, for the aforementioned reason: All they look for is what's in front of them, not what's *actually* happening as the story unfolds and we realize more and more exactly what's going on, until everything coalesces and creates something truly beautiful, original, and intelligent.<br /><br />What most will probably see, as critics decided to focus on, is nothing more than a cheap gore-fest with monsters and a whole lot of amnesia with a tacked-on plot that doesn't sound interesting to begin with. Well, if you only watch this film a single time without knowing what you're getting into and not expecting anything more, that's what you'll see, too.<br /><br />But just like Event Horizon and every other very violent film that's loaded with psychological themes and a *WHAM* of a twist ending, along with a lasting impression to those who like these sorts of films, critics are so distracted by how seemingly shallow it all is, which is only enforced by the fact that they simply aren't paying attention to anything else that's happening, or the philosophical tie-ins that go with it. Event Horizon had this in spades, particularly with the main protagonist and antagonist, making it something you either hated as being stupid--as critics did--or saw it as something else, as I and some others did, as being, dare I say it--brilliant and profound. Event Horizon remains a film that is typically either known for \\"cheap and stupid scare tactics with a shallow plot and extremely excessive violence\\" or \\"psychological mindf*** of the century that never makes sense no matter how many times I watch it\\" to pretty much everyone.<br /><br />The point here is that Pandorum, while not as enjoyable to me as Event Horizon because the monsterslook too much like the ones in The Descent (one of my favorite films, at least the original version), is an extremely competent sci-fi psychological thriller that uses its plot and setting to wonderful effect, tying it directly into the characters, rather than superimposing it onto them. Watch it once, you'll see lots of violence and a twist that'll leave you wondering what the hell you just watched the entire time, since now nothing makes any sense at all. But watch it again, and it all comes together as something very highly deserving of your attention.<br /><br />The fact remains that critics just don't like these types of films. There's already a massive list of what some people call \\"cult films\\", but I just call them \\"underrated because they step outside most peoples' comfort zones.\\" As far as I'm concerned, critics should be completely ignored, as they often just don't know what they're talking about, rushing through film after film and writing review after review, not needing to think too hard about what they just saw. Hence, we get Oscar-fishers every year getting all the attention, one of the most noteworthy being the horrifyingly-racist-in-retrospect \\"Crash\\", a film completely out of touch with reality that was praised for portraying the exact opposite; and absolutely \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", which was an almost 100% fictitious account of both schizophrenia and John Nash's life, very obviously designed as an Oscar-fisher that succeeded in its exclusive goal of winning Oscars, despite failing disastrously to portray mental illness, John Nash, or absolutely anything it says it represents at all correctly. Note one of the most important similarities of the two films: Both involve taking a touchy subject (racism in the former and mental illness, as well as the mental healthcare system, in the latter) and exploiting it, while in actuality, is a completely unrealistic and insensible portrayal of anything it says it's \\"revealing\\".<br /><br />To put it short, most movie-watchers turn their brains off when the film starts, which does not exclude films that claim to do the opposite and \\"make you think\\". That's why films like Pandorum get practically zero attention and virtually no positive reception while trash like A Beautiful Mind gets accolades all around. Pandorum is actually more accurate in its portrayal of the effects of mental illness (even a fictitious one, but still one that makes sense as one that could exist and its reasons for existing at all) than A Beautiful Mind, which took schizophrenia and turned it into nothing more than fun entertainment, glossing over any real portrayal of the illness.<br /><br />Kinda makes you wonder. Still, when a fictitious condition like pandorum makes more sense than schizophrenia does in the exploitative A Beautiful Mind, you should know something is seriously wrong with the critics who maintain the rights to say which films are good or not, despite understanding nothing about the source matter.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially on Blu-ray, on which it looks gorgeous.
0380977273|4.0|This review pertains to \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", Hardcover, ISBN: 978-0380977277.<br /><br />BEWARE!!! This book has an unadvertised DECKLED EDGE. Five stars for the book's content, three stars for the surprise deckled edge. The publisher feels that Bradbury's work does not rate a finished, standard-grade binding. If you like to be frustrated every time you turn a page, then this book is for you. If you relish the tarnished image people have of you when they see you own DECKLED EDGE books, then have at it. Also, the cover is different than shown in the product description, but it's OK.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read! I have always been a Stephen King fan; but, 11/22/63 was truly outstanding. It was unlike his other books in so many ways! This book grabbed my attention and held it to the very end. Everyone thinks about key events in their lives they may want to change. 11/22/63 sure gives one pause to consider the repercussions of changing any event.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|[May contain mild spoilers]<br />I used to watch The Muppet Show regularly, and loved the first movie ([[ASIN:B000ATQYTM The Muppet Movie]]).  The Muppets manage to produce a blend of entertainment that is funny and engaging (and appropriate) for kids, while having another layer that makes it equally entertaining for adults.<br /><br />For example, in this new installment, during one of the opening song and dance numbers, the crowd of singing/dancing people and Muppets move down a backlot city street, and they pass a hippy who looks very much like Willie Nelson, who pipes up to sing the word \\"high\\" in the song.<br /><br />Now, for our toddler daughter this meant nothing (other than a funny looking guy singing), but my wife and I cracked up.<br /><br />Similarly, during the finale when the Muppets are putting on a show, there is a number performed solely by chickens, and it's a cover of Cee Lo Green's song 'Forget You'.  Sung by chickens.  Chickens who cluck.  As in, cluck you, which is remarkably close to the uncensored version of that song.<br /><br />Again, that will fly over younger kid's heads, but I had to pause the movie and LOL for a bit, then rewind and see it again.  Classic Muppet stuff.<br /><br />And it's not just about the subversive bits, or the cameos, either.  The film feels true to the sensibilities of the Muppets, and, frankly, I've been worried about them becoming assimilated by Disney and turned into...well, who knows what, but not what they were.  I am happy (and thankful to Disney) to report that these are the Muppets, as we know and love them, updated for today's audiences but without losing their character or personalities.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|Very entertaining movie.  I thought it was as good as the first two in this series.  Lots of action and well acted.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Read this series of books after my niece recommended.  They were very intense and not my usual style.  However I did read all three for they have a way of hooking you into the characters. I liked them especially the first one.  I will wait to see how the movie turns out ...as I am sure there will be one. Always like to see which was best the book or the movie. It may not have been the best book I have ever read, but have I did enjoy them.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game for kindle. hours of enjoyment for me and my son. would recommend game for any. very simple to learn
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good way to pass time. Nice layout when turned around. Not sure if you can change design on the card deck ( which would make it kinds cooler ) overall good game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderful. I found all three books were amazing. Yes I think book two was better then the first book. However, book one gets you started and sets the mood and tone for the series. For all those who are giving bad reviews go back to your murder mystery books. I hope Mrs. James keeps it up I will contine to by her books. I read all three books in five days and thats with workimg ten hour days... If you are romance reader at heart you should enjoy if not love this series.. The books kept you wanting more you laugh you cry and yes even a little angry. Again to all those who leave negative comments go back to your murder mysteries..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the most engrossing fictional series I've ever read, and I've read a lot of them. Unique, lots of twists and turns. I wish it hadn't ended!
0060558121|5.0|Good price and in fine shape. Haven't read it yet, but I assume the review is supposed to be about whether the book was in the promised condition or not (it was), and not about the writing.
0307454568|4.0|This was the riviting ending to a wonderful trilogy. I fully enjoyed each book separtly.  From the start, when you first pick up the book to read, you can not put it down.  You have to read the next page far into the night.  Then, after you finish the first, you have to get the next book, and the next till it's done.  I wish Mr. Stieg Larsson were still alive it would be a treat to read his next.
B0057ZEMF2|5.0|I find everything Anoushka touches turns to gold. This is Indian music with the flavour of Spain. Just wonderful music.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The ebook was easy to download.  One click and you are done.  The book was awesome and I can't wait to read the 3rd book.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This is the only Rocky movie I've seen in theaters. We have all of the other Rocky movies, but I didn't watch them till yesterday. My husband is the Rocky fan. We've had the movies for many years. I don't know why I never watched them before. They are really good movies.<br /><br />I really enjoy this movie. It was crazy seeing how much time's have changed going from the first five Rocky movies to this updated, bright, clear movie. What a nice change. Rocky won at the end of this movie. But in the Deleted Scenes he lost the fight. I think him losing is a better ending. But I guess Rocky wants to live on in peoples mind. I guess he didn't want them to think he is too old to fight. No matter what age he is he can win. I guess that's what Sylvester Stallone is saying.

B002IC10Y8|4.0|Yo Yo Ma Plays the cello beautifully.  If you like beauty, you will like this collection. The surprise for me is the wide variety of situations in which his music appears.  I liked the Bach solos the best for understanding his facility. The hardcover book enclosed with the collection is a kind of anthology of his work, with plaudits by the wide variety of people he's worked with.  It's also very enjoyable.
B000003N7K|5.0|Trane is always great to listen to, and with this recording he put Johnny Hartman on the map ! Johnny has a great crooners voice but Trane just makes him great to listen too !
B0086700CM|5.0|A very addicting app with a lot of unique upgrades and very exciting. I have hare ups and downs because I have wasted some coins on some upgrades that I thought was a little over-priced. A very good paced and exciting game overall.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Late in the table coming to this film but as an organic eater and grower, I felt I needed to see it. It was horrifying to see how much control lies in so few hands of our food supply. Particularly appalling is that Monsanto make criminals out of innocent people who choose to grow their own seeds (and presumably organic farmers too).<br /><br />Easy to see how the poor are disadvantaged in this situation. With the food supply being so grotesquely altered, and then subsidised, is it any wonder that illnesses like diabetes are going through the roof.<br /><br />A wholesome reminder on a personal level to adhere to a healthy, organic (when one can afford it) diet, and to always take a sceptical view of the authorities.<br /><br />Wholly endorse the sentiments at the end and would encourage everyone to take responsibility for what they put in their mouths, demand organic and demand that the government, the FDA and the multinationals like Monsanto GET OUT OF OUR KITCHEN.
B007UQRW62|5.0|Yes I have read about the 4K transfer on Blu-Ray. 4K is supposedly four times sharper than Blu-Ray. But, I am sure the transfer ISN'T 4K. My TV goes up to 1080P and I assume the picture using the 4K master should be an improvement even if it isn't possible for 4K viewing yet. Now Korea supposedly is working on 8K DVDs. When will this end? Of course some titles were purchased on VHS, then Laser discs, then DVD, then added 5.0 soundtracks. How many times will the public re-buy the same title? And if we need a new TV to play 4K, how many will do that? 3-D has apparently dropped off too. People just buying their first flat screen TV sure aren't going to re-buy one for 3-D, a novelty in the fifties that will soon grow old today. The price of SINGIN IN THE RAIN is too expensive. If a person just wants the DVD and not interested in a book about the film, they should have the opportunity to buy the renovated improved transfer from a 4K master. Of course 4K could eliminate the 3-D glasses too with both eyes seeing 1080P? Save your money because there is always something new on the market, high priced then lowered when the sales increase. Some of those who spent an extra $1,000 for 3-D, should have waited for the glasses free TVs in 3-D.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Out of all 3 films, this is the best. Its a bit on the long side but it is an extremely good movie. Some of the scenes gave me chills because of the perfect placement, visuals, and the music to add the gravity to the scene. No special features which was disappointing, but the film itself is worth it. On blu ray the movie looks great and sounds beautiful.<br /><br />Easily 5 Stars.
B00881VLCE|5.0|if you like puzzles and cute pics this is the app for you . it has cute puzzles.this game is fun. but if puzzles frustrate you don't get this game.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I am not sure why everyone is so negative about this timeless classic.  Yes there are no big car chase scenes, no unusually attractive female that makes everyone go \\"gaga\\", or  large scale destruction.  If you can get away from this and look at the story with a open mind and conscience, you will get a story that is moving and just right for just about anyone.  I loved it and I think that it never gets old.  Slow is the way and steady is the hand that created this masterpiece.
B005D6O0IO|5.0|Now that we all take our shoes off at the TSA checkpoints...  These are great, they are small and lightweight, and they have \\"Handles\\" on the back,  so you can just grab them so easily, when you are hustling through security,  and they don't take up any room in the conveyor belt box, or crush anything in the box. Or get crushed.  And they are crocs so they are comfy when you fly and run through airports.  They are not my style really but I bought them as my airport shoes, since I fly so much,  and they are dressy enough, with your jeans, that when you fly with co-workers you don't look all sloppy,  but your feet feel like they are in your sneakers, without all the sneaker bulk, at security.  So perfect for me.  If crocs are your style then these should be perfect for you.  True to size for me.  The seller was fast on the shipping.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|THIS is a fantastic movie. I am not going into a detailed review here, as others have done a much better job.<br /><br />What I am going to do, is pose this question: WHY did a movie this good have to fail? Why? It's senseless!<br /><br />Would love to see what you guys think in the comments. I had not been following the leadin to the release of this movie, so I don't know what kind of \\"hype\\" it was/was not getting, so I would love to hear from you all...<br /><br />Just get this movie. If you had reservations because of poor reviews: then know those people were morons, much like the idiots who would give Prometheus a poor review: they simply didn't want to use their brains...there are more and more of these \\"critics\\" around nowadays...
B0019N8P2W|5.0|The DVD was amazing, It arrived in perfect condition & it worked really well. I love it. I really recommend it if you are a Daria fan.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Yep, the \\"wonderland\\" kid is growing older, growing wiser, and growing better - the nod to Neil Young in the first cut tips off the rootsy, timeless direction Mayer's aiming at. The musicianship, melodies, and lyrics captivate even a music-snob geezer like me. Put it on and let it spin - every track works. This guy's getting real interesting and will be fun to watch in the years and decades ahead.
B007SGM084|2.0|I am not a love story fan in general..,  this book is a love story gone porn.  Not my cup of tea.  It is the first time I had wished I had purchased a hard copy instead of on my kindle.  At least I could have given the book.

B007KCG7MQ|2.0|I have been a huge Joe Walsh fan since I was about 12 or 13. I purchased the James Gang albums as new releases. I have everything I can get my hands on that Joe Walsh has done. Zachariah album, all solo material, albums he was a hired hand on such as the great R.E.O Speedwaggon Riding the storm out, etc. etc...<br />I have seen him live as often as I could over the last 40 years.<br />I sadly say that his new C.D. is a huge disappointment. I hate that it is. I have been waiting just like all of his fans for something new. I have looked at the few places that still sell C.D.'S a couple of times a month for anything new from the great rock bands that I grew up listening to.<br />I don't get it. Joe was so original, so unique, so cool ! What happened??<br />Why didn't he call in some fellow rockers that he respects and likes to help him make this C.D. something special? Look what Leslie West has done over the last few yars.. He just did not sit down and make a hum drum record.. he went out and brought in other talents to make his songs have some kick to them! Would it have been a big deal to see if someone like Stephen Stills would sit in on an acoustic song? Maybe a few Barnstorm style songs???? Heck Leslie West would have been great. When Joe was on someones albums you knew it !!<br /> Can't a C.D. have about 80 minutes of music on it? I about fell over when I saw my new Joe Waslh C.D. had 47 minutes on it. One would think that Joe has hundreds of hours of recordings.. Maybe some demo's, songs that didn't make past records, etc.. I just don't get it. He has the eagles to get his paycheck from. His solo world should be to get away from anything like the eagles and play what we all loved hearing. He could have filled the rest of the C.D. with old James Gang live stuff that didn't make the album. ANYHING !!! It would not have cost anymore to throw some music from any period on it. Heck, he could have got his brother in law and former band mate to do a song with him!Howcool would that have been!<br /> Most of the people who leave an Eagles concert know Joe from listening to their local soft FM staion. They are not Joe Walsh fans. They do not know a thing about Joe other then he is an Eagle. This Album should have been for his real fans.<br />Not to sound like a jerk, I think one song about getting a new wife, getting clean, and loving his home would have been just fine. I loved his Barnstorm days songs about family etc.. They were great and made us all think about our family. These new songs are like bad Halmark cards. Great for the one you are talking about but not so great for others.<br /><br />Joe has played and helped out so many other artists and bands over the yars. I wished this new album was his best work ever. It is not by a long shot.<br /> This was his time to let it all out. I guess he has just been with the group with all the easy listening favorites too long.<br /><br />I wanted to hear some new Joe ( my rock hero) I heard a little, but I mostly just heard music from an Eagle.<br /><br />Maybe in 20 years he can do it all over.

B004EPZ06Q|1.0|*<br />*<br />***************SPOILER ALERT***************<br /><br />How humorless is this movie? Here's one example that pretty much sums up this whole, unfunny mess. At one point Ed Helms' character learns that while he was under the influence of some memory-erasing drugs, he willfully participated in an unprotected sexual act with a pre-operative, male transexual. (whose \\"equipment\\" we have the displeasure of actually seeing) We find out in graphic detail that while the thankfully unseen act itself involved a \\"happy ending\\" for both participants, as it turns out, Helms' character, a heterosexual, was on the receiving end of this act, if you know what I mean. There is no humor in this revelation whatsoever but Helms' character sings about the event later on in the movie as though it were something he thought to be amusing enough to actually joke around about. Really? That's funny?! Can someone, can ANYONE tell me when sad and disturbing became an acceptable substitute for actual humor because I swear, I did NOT get that memo.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is great. my kids and I have a blast with it. it works great on my kindle fire as well. impressive!!

B005K17RU0|4.0|This app provides all the basic weather information I need.  It doesn't have tropical weather or very good severe weather notification, but until Weatherbug or another provider puts out something better... this meets my needs.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I heard a lot of great reviews on this book so decided to purchase book one. I immediately saw the similarities to Twilight. I commented about it on my facebook and someone informed me that it was indeed a former fanfiction story. I'm a Twilight FanFiction author and reader and I have read a lot of stories these past three or so years and this wasn't the best. It was a good read, but I would expect more from a best seller seeing that some stories on fanfiction sites are much more original. Different plot, same characters - not interesting to me.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game<br /> would recommend to friends I was impressed. cant. wait to see if they have a sequel. thanks game makers

B007ZKY7XO|4.0|The latest release by The Scissor Sisters is one that displays a diversity of styles.  It is informed by both the retro and modern.  There is retro disco, 80s Latin freestyle, 90s house, contemporary electro-house, 80s pure pop, Mexican ballad, late 90s pop, techno here. You can tell each song from one another. This is, sadly, not too common in popular music. And that's a quality I like.<br /><br />That said I wasn't that excited about this album the first time I listened to it. I might have been excited about it 3-4 years ago, when I was more into campy pop. Campy pop is not a genre into right at the moment.  With a second listen though, I liked it better.  Most of the songs are good, although there are also very few high points.  For those who like campy or retro pop, I think most will be satisfied with this album.<br /><br />There were some tracks I enjoyed quite a bit. \\"Baby Come Home\\" is a pretty good opener.  \\"Inevitable\\" is a well-crafted retro disco track that has a contemporary R&B edge. It is produced by Pharrell.  \\"Only The Horses\\" is Calvin Harris-produced track that doesn't sound much different than the Harris produced songs on the top 40 charts. Which is good, because is an infectious house/pop tune.  \\"Year of Living Dangerously\\" sounds like late 80s pop (one of my favorite periods of music). And whoever produced it really replicated that era's sound well. \\"Shady Love\\" features Azealia Banks.  Banks is one of the hottest new artists of the year, so naturally her guest spot is excellent.  \\"Best In Me\\" reminds me of late 90s pop.<br /><br />A few on the songs I find annoying. \\"Keep Your Shoes\\" and \\"Let's Have A Kiki\\" - really annoying lyrics.<br /><br />(3 ½ out of 5 stars)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I never thought these words would come out of my mouth - but this book is WORSE than \\"Twilight\\". Here's the best way to explain it. Picture, inside your mind, the horror that is Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\". Now take the vocabulary and writing skill and lower it by about 50%. Then imagine Bella and take away her book smarts, and drastically lower her common sense. Add a pinch of additional annoying. Take Edward and subtract his vampirism, then change his high school career and moderate riches for a CEO business career and insane riches. Turn Forks High into a giant corporation HQ, and you've got it.

B000NQRE1E|3.0|So this is my question. In order for me to get most, if not all, the bonus features, I have to own blu-ray? It seems as though the 2 disc DVD version doesnt have all the bonus features.<br /><br />I was thinking of buying the Blu-ray/DVD combo set since it says DVD but it seems that the movie will be in DVD and Blu-ray while the bonus features will be in blu-ray :(
0142403873|5.0|This book has great a story, the words flow perfectly, and the drawings are amazingly.  This is one of my son's favorite books for me to read to him.  He is always finding new things in the pictures.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've tried many different styles of camera cases over the years, and I know what I like.  Maybe it's a personality thing, but I tend to prefer the style of case that lays flat and features adjustable dividers.  Other styles like the top-loading variety tend to frustrate me more than help me when I'm on a video shoot.  And the thrifty side of me wants a well-designed, versatile case that opens up and lays all my gear out for easy picking.  The AmazonBasics camera backpack is a pretty good choice for the thrifty lenser on the go.<br /><br />There's three attributes that immediately jump out at me about this bag -- it feels well-constructed, it is thoughtfully and intelligently designed, and it's tiny.  Yes, it's a very small backpack.  For someone like me with -- shall we say -- ample carriage, this backpack looks like a fanny-pack on my back.  That said, it packs a lot of stuff and is a breeze to carry with me all the time.<br /><br />The pack zips open and lays flat, and features a good selection of velcro dividers, allowing you to customize the layout of your gear and keep it protected.  With the size of video and photo gear shrinking more and more all the time, you'll find room for your camera, memory cards, power and data cords, plus plenty of other accessories.  If you're a Flip-style camera fan, you could pack enough cameras in this bag to cover an NFL football game!  There's two zippered pouches inside that are clear mesh for easy reference of stored goods.<br /><br />Turning to the outside, there's a handy tripod mount on one side, pouch pockets on both sides, a couple deeper zippered pockets and a bungee corded tether on the outside to stuff even more stuff.  On the back of the pack and the shoulder straps, you'll find nice gel cushioning which makes this pack comfortable to wear.  The straps are adjustable far enough to allow someone like me to carry it, but the straps that buckle around the waist are a tad short for the pudgy shooters like myself.  I'll likely either tie these off or just outright clip them off as they do me little good.  Most of the time, I just find myself carrying it around by the handle at the top.<br /><br />The construction quality is great, especially for a pack under $40.  I was amazed how much I could pack into this bag, but be aware that the backpack is a little shallow if you're intending to tote longer items like a 300mm camera lens.  You may have to lay those items in sideways instead of top down.  The interior dividers are a little more \\"cushy\\" than the sidewalls, so bare that in mind if you're toting sensitive, delicate items.  On the whole, I feel this is a bag that can take a moderate amount of abuse and keep the contents nicely shielded.  Don't go dropping it down the stairs or anything, but the occasion bump and jostle from everyday transport shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />If you're an organizational freak who wants a well-made and well-designed camera bag that's just as easy to carry to a shoot as it is to carry on a hike, this may be the bag for you.  It's a great entry-level bag, or an affordable camera bag for your all-purpose social multimedia pro.  It's made for Amazon and comes in their \\"frustration-free packaging,\\" which essentially means it comes in a plain brown box without tags, twist ties or extraneous packaging.  It's a great value and a case I feel I can count on for years to come.<br /><br />PROS<br />Solid construction<br />Thoughtful design<br />Durable materials<br />Customizable layout of contents<br />Ample storage for a variety of gear<br />Padding on the back and shoulders for comfortable wearing<br />Compact size<br />Affordable price point<br /><br />CONS<br />Compact size may be too small for larger owners<br />Would like a couple more dividers for greater separation of items<br /><br />ADDENDUM TO THIS REVIEW:  I don't think the item description mentions if it is water resistant, but I have come to find it pretty darn water resistant.  I stood out in the middle of the driving rain of a severe thunderstorm out on a pier, trying to catch lightning strikes on a bridge.  While I was mortified at the thought of my gear getting wet and ruined, I decided to stay out and keep shooting.  When I got back to my car, I zipped open the case while saying a little prayer.  Luckily for me, it kept 95% or more of the rain out, even though it was driving down directly on my back as I was wearing this backpack.  Obviously it's not \\"waterproof,\\" but absolutely none of my gear got wet whatsoever.  I wouldn't buy it for its water resistance, but I can attest that it had enough protection to keep me high and dry in this foolhardy one-off trip of mine :)  I still wholeheartedly recommend this pack!he middle of the driving rain of a severe thunderstorm out on a pier, trying to catch lightning strikes on a bridge.

Her campaign slogan? \\"Yes we did!\\" The moon mission crew was picked for racial diversity, not skill.  The movie is way over-the-top and often laugh-out-loud hilarious. Some of the key plot points could have been fleshed out more, and the F&uuml;hrer had few lines. He is the only actor in the movie you'll recognize (Udo Kier - the head vampire from \\"Blade\\"), and is really under-utilized.<br /><br />The special effects are great, the space battles and invasion have some insanely funny moments.<br /><br />The NAZI's are at home in the deadly lunar environment, most of the moon population is oblivious to the real moon-NAZI agenda and WWII history, and purity laws govern all procreation. There is actually some subtlety here, especially the way a population can be manipulated when the ruling class controls education, entertainment, news - everything.<br /><br />I really don't want to ruin the movie with spoilers. Get it - watch it. The only thing that really ticked me off was the soundtrack. It was the identical Wagner music (Ride of the Valkyries and the Immolation scene from G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung) over and over - fine the first couple of times. The 20th? Now way. What happened to Laibach? There was no metal anywhere in the soundtrack. I was picturing a head-banging Laibach score complimenting space battles and the invasion of Earth. Nope. Wagner. I like Wagner. But not on what felt like a repetitive loop for the entire movie!<br /><br />Music aside, you'll really enjoy this movie. Julia Dietze is hot, Peta Sergeant is made up as a Russ Meyer inspired dream, the president is, er, bizarre.<br /><br />The same company produced the indie film \\"Star Wreck\\" - a Star Trek / Babylon 5 mashup. Much of Iron Sky draws from this, and I wish it did not - if you're tempted to see Star Wreck, wait until after you see Iron Sky.

B0085Z8F4A|1.0|3D! As Dave craddled the earth in his right hand during one of most awing inspiring scenes in recent date for a movie, Ridley Scott crushed the life out of this movie in his left hand with a misguided effort trying to tie two movies together that didn't need to be. This movie truly needed to be a stand alone story. Had it been it wouldnt have been crushed under the weight of expectation.<br /><br />This was worse than Alien Resurrection due solely to the pedigree that presented this newest work. While the movie looks astonishing it managed to offer no coherent storyline and lacked any true character. The actors were stellar, they we all very convincing in their roles. That said this film is an utter disaster in directing, writing and editing. However I am still going to buy it just for the 3D.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Came across this gem of a series based on the high reviews and wanting to get a respite from my normal diet of non-fiction.  Can't help but think it would adapt extremely well to film.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|I have almost all of the Derek Trucks Band CD's and three from Susan Tedeschi, so of course I also have the Tedeschi Trucks Band CD Revelator. Susan Tedeschi is my favorite vocalist, so I really like this live CD.  The live versions of the songs from Revelator are much better than the studio versions.  The other songs are very good too. I did not give it five stars because I think this band is too big.  If they would lose the horns and one of the drummers, this would be my favorite band.  This is good live album, but it is not as good as The Derek Trucks Band live CD Roadsongs.
B00881VLCE|5.0|great graphics. very easy to manuever the pieces.  I don't usually. like jigsaw puzzles.  this is the exception. I love it.
0307951529|5.0|Chris has been inspiring me ever since I discovered his website, and his book, all about the [[ASIN:B0042L3ZJQ The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World [Paperback]]]. At that point, I'd been an artist, entrepreneur, and self-employed for the last decade. So, while I was well-versed in the liberation of living my life the way I wanted, Chris amplified my passion with a practical toolkit for taking it to the next level.<br /><br />As his new book, The $100 Startup, hits the shelves, it finds me on the founding team of an incredible startup, where I not only get to do what I love, but I'm in the business of improving other people's lives.<br /><br />I'm fascinated with the intersection of passion and work, and this book dives deep. Once again, adding fuel to the fire within me, and providing a practical toolkit for getting out of your own way, going out there and making your dreams happen -- all while changing the world.<br /><br />Kudos, Chris. You are changing the world, and I'm honored to know you!
1612130283|2.0|I'm not seeing all of the hype around this book, you can find a better romance/erotic novel in paperback at the grocery store.  These characters are not even remotely believable.  I understand that its fiction so the hero and heroine are usually somewhat fantastical compared to their real-world counterparts...but this is nuts.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I know some people complain about this app but I absolutely love it. it's cute and addicting. All you have to do is access. the options menu and the home bar pops up. I would suggest downloading it.
0553103547|5.0|Subtlety makes this book.  The characters are well developed and the plot if nuanced and engaging.  This is more than a fasntasy novel.  The politcal aspects are great and the \\"no character matters more than a good story\\" attitude of the author is refreshing and serves to keep the reader on their toes.  I highly recommend.
B002IE2JF0|3.0|Some good action in this film, but the content was a bit beneath the acting caliber of Caveziel.At least the film had a specific ending.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I usually don't like Glu games, but I have to admit, I was pretty impressed. This one will actually let you advance without purchases using real money.
B0086700CM|5.0|i'v been searching for this app or anything alittle like it and found nothing ever since i got the kindle fire,i didnt find anything.And now finally i find it with over 2000 reviews and mabey 50-100 are 3 stares and im giving tthis an easy 5 stares
B005IY3CMQ|2.0|These remixes add nothing to the original songs.  I know not everyone liked King of Limbs, but listening to these remixes, I'm reminded what geniuses the Radioheads are.  The remixes generally ruin the soundscapes the band created, offering nothing in return.  Waste of money.
0307592731|4.0|Definitely a biography and not a hiking book, but a fun read anyway. While I personally can't condone someone stupidly and dangerously undertaking such a venture without any preparation, she was lucky to make it through. It was a nicely written personal struggle and growth story.
0634049011|5.0|I started playing guitar back around 1967, so I have read a pile of these books over the years with most being so much less than what was hoped for. This workbook was one of the few I have picked up that is definitely the exception. It was quite informative, presenting its contents in an easily understood style. Yes you will find some boring generic stuff in there (I'm sure the more novice will find it fascinating though), but there is also some useful information that can help make the fret board come alive for experienced players. I would definitely recommend this workbook to anyone serious about expanding their knowledge of the guitar fret board, from beginner to seasoned performer.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it is addictive and fast pace. my only issue is the tiny bit of lag. other than that this has to be a must have for any kindle owner.
B00006L6YG|5.0|I love this CD , while it does have some Audio noise on the base of the tracks it's understandable and not a huge distraction. Now if only I could get my hands on a Sinatra/Jobim SACD .
0439023521|5.0|Before reading The Hunger Games, I had heard tons of people rant and rave about this book. The Hunger Games does not disappoint. The book is fast paced and you won't be able to set it down.<br /><br />Katniss is a great character who really doesn't want to kill anyone in the games, but she's a survivor. If it comes down between living or dying she's going to do what it takes to make sure she comes out on top. I really felt that she grew into her own as the Games progressed and she really discovered that she's the hunter, not the hunted.<br /><br />Peeta is a really charming character that grew on me through out the book. He is really different from the other tributes in the books, he doesn't set out to harm anyone and doesn't want to kill anyone.<br /><br />Once the Hunger Games began, you really got to see how twenty four kids fought for their survival and you can't help but feel helpless as the winner emerges and tributes die.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you read this book that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat and questioning the world that these kids live in.
B00008WT49|3.0|This CD had gotten a lot of reviews that said that it was one of the best SACD disc out there but I have to respectfully disagree.  I<br /> Know that some people enjoy hearing that record/tape fuzz/noise but I don't. I can understand when it is intended to be apart of the song but this was not the case with one as it is everywhere through the disc. Also the levels of the mix were just not good or me. To each their own but this was not much of an improvement over the normal version.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it really had a lot and I mean a lot of fun games to play. I would definitely recommend it
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very addictive.  I don't think the coin store is needed because it's so addictive that you'll probably be earning lots of coins. On the other hand- sometimes when I swipe to turn it makes it a jump or sliding under.  Even with its annoying mishaps it's still fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible! it is so amazing. u should get it! it will help u understand the past. so I hope u can get this app
B0015HOFZI|1.0|Bought a lot of things from Amazon and never complained, but this was pretty bad. It belonged in the trash. I can believe anybody would ship something like this. Believe me if I can't return this its going straight into the garbage.[[ASIN:B0015HOFZI Sony PS-LX300USB USB Stereo Turntable (Black)]]
B00881VLCE|4.0|its lots of fun kinda like puzzled hearts on fb with just the puzzle card. if u like puzzles u will become addicted
B0086700CM|5.0|IT SHOULD BE WORTH $50 BUT IT FREEEEEEE GET THIS APP YOU WILL LOVE IT CAPS LOCK MEANS ITS AWESOME!!!!!
0345803485|2.0|I purchased the book on my Kindle and bought all three books at once.  Had I bought one at a time I never would have bought two and three. I read them all and two and three were definitly better then the first one.  I am no literary critic however I have read hundreds if not thousands of books and this book is very poorly writen.  The story line out side of the sex gets better in the second and third book and that is what kept me reading it.  Ana is suppose to be intellegent yet she is anything but!  Potential was there for it to be a good book but the writing was just too poor quality. There were so many irritating things about the writing style that it distracted from the story.  I am not sorry I read it, I am sorry I spent $30 to download it all, definitly not worth $30, maybe $10 for all three would have been worth it.
B007L4T234|5.0|I stumbled onto the books by accident after watching the Twilight series. It surprised me a lot with the amount of erotica I did not expect. As I read, I got sucked into the emotional relationship between Christian and Ana. I love how the author has him \\"work\\" his issues out.  At the same time, how Ana matures from a completely innocent and ignorant girl into a woman. It was VERY hard to put the books down. Great read!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is very poorly written. I could barely make it through the first three sample chapters that I downloaded and I am willing to read just about anything. The simplicity of the sentence structure and awkwardness of the flow of words made it very difficult to read. The only emotion these characters evoked was annoyance. Although I was getting a little creeped out by the repeated description and action of the hero's long index finger.  IMHO, the only reason this book is a best seller is because it started out as Twlight fan fiction. How did this get picked up by a publishing company? Don't waste your time or money.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I bought all three books on several friends' recommendations. The racy subject matter is the only interesting thing about the series. The writing is very amateurish and dull. The author definitely needs to invest in a thesaurus. If I never again read the words \\"grin\\", \\"mutter\\", or \\"smirk\\", I will die a happy woman.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|If youre a fan of myst or other clue searching games, you will enjoy this. The scenes are beautiful ...I couldn't put my Kindle Fire down.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is so fun.... I downloaded it after the frenzy behind it ONLY because I was going on a road trip and wanted to keep the kid occupied.  I ended playing it the most! Go figure!!
B007R41E8O|4.0|If you love clue search games like Myst then youre going to enjoy this game. The paths snd goals are not always clear...I used the &quot;?&quot; button a lot. Still, I couldnt put it down.  The ending is worth getting to.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a blast.  I was really happy to see it come out for the Kindle Fire so I didn't have to steal my wife's iPad all the time, but unfortunately, (like most things) it works better on iOS than it does on Android.  On Android it constantly glitches at just the wrong times causing horrible death to my runner; on my wife's iPad 1, it's perfectly smooth all the time.  So 5 stars for the game, but it's actually a lot more fun on an Apple product.
B007712XAU|5.0|The first set (season one) left me eager to watch the rest.  Every detail, down to the coat hangers, looks authentic. The actors are gifted, the sets, décor and costumes are eye candy.  The plot has interesting twists and turns.  Alas, the second box, although labeled Season Two, contained the same discs as the first through no fault of the vendor; a packaging error.  I contacted the vendor and am very satisfied with the way my claim has been handled by the vendor.  However, the Amazon return page is not user-friendly.  There is a tiny, pale-colored (and unnecessary) box that has to be clicked on before the process can continue and since it is hard to see you go round and round in circles and get more and more frustrated, especially considering that there is a time limit for returns, until you finally stumble upon the tiny box without any assistance from the website.  Amazon, please take note and improve this feature.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have to preface this by saying I don't write bad reviews as a rule (sorry in advance to EL James). However, this novel was so horribly bad and I'm so frustrated that I spent my hard-earned money on it, that I feel like I should say something.<br /><br />The writing is terrible. I felt like hitting someone every time I read \\"Oh, my...\\" (which was often) and only 3 chapters in, I had to finally abandon the miserable journey.<br /><br />It's sad to me that so many of these books are being written, sold and read. There are so many other truly amazing erotica authors out there that you should be looking into. I truly don't understand how this novel got into print.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great season. Very suspenseful. I do find myself feeling awful bad for Clay. Is that strange? Does anyone else feel bad for him? He seems to have lost everything. I hope he comes back strong!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This is a brilliant album.  There is not a single track that is bad.  Love Love Love the bonus tracks.  They really complete the \\"darker\\" side of the album and they showcase that wonderful voice that Adam has.  The first half of the album is more upbeat and geared for dance club vibe - really great feel. The second and darker half of the album has a more mature, rock theme to it.  Wish more people would give it a listen - they will not be disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is one of the worst books I've read...if a woman loved Twilight and swooned over the characters in there, this is the same thing only with lots of bad sex.  The author tries to make the characters seem secretive and multi-dimensional.  Reality?  The characters are transparent, one dimensional and boring.  I read the whole book in two hours, hoping it would get better since it was on the best sellers list but sadly that is two hours of my life I can not get back.
B007R41E8O|2.0|this games is quit annoying.  you have to go back and forth between scenes constantly to only get one or two items per scene.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The story line is promising but it mostly deals with the heroine's struggle with the men in her life, namely whom does she really love.  In that sense, its a chick book but those who like a light read (men or women) can easily finish it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|awesome game but hard to get out of it but that is not a bad thing.  I want to play even more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game sooooo addicting! cant stop till I unlock all of the games but getting coins takes forever! I recommened it!
B004R0Y2DU|5.0|There are so many excellent reviews of Patrick O'Brian's works that there is little that I can add.  Those reviews are what enticed me to give these works a read...and I'm so glad that I did!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is amazing! !! I love this app!! can only afford the free ones but still its awesome!!! get it if you LOVE puzzles! :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this like all my &quot;mobile&quot; devices. works lovely. always a good way to keep from being bored. love it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love it but you have energy you wast one. and you have like 15 of those left.and It is annoying.
B0086700CM|5.0|i was so surprised when i was playing arojns in the search engine and actually found this app. thank you sooo much!!!
B007IE4DSG|5.0|Sure, it could probably use another 3-4 tracks, but what we have here is outstanding.  \\"Woman Don't You Cry For Me\\" alone is reason enough to pick this disc up.  There are many other highlights on top of that such as \\"Let It Be Me\\" and \\"Run of the Mill.\\"  Demos of \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Awaiting On You All\\" strip away some of that Wall of Sound from the \\"All Things Must Pass\\" album and \\"The Light That Has Lighted The World\\" is one of my favorite overlooked Harrison songs.  I have several \\"Volume 1\\"s in my collection where no Volume 2 ever materialized.  Let's hope this isn't the case with George Harrison.  There is a lot of music he left behind.  I'd like to believe this is just the beginning.  An excellent release!
B0086700CM|5.0|Easy to learn and fun to play.  I haven't gotten that far yet but its a great time.  Just download it already.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|Some of the disks \\"stall\\" if you will and some episode won't play at all. Not a lot of them, but none of them should. Whomever created these discs and sold them should have to go good for them! Don't buy this collection!
0345803493|2.0|I purchased the Fifty Shades of Grey because I heard about it from everywhere.  So I decided to buy Fifty Shades:Darker and Fifty Shades:Freer and couldn't believe it was such a waste of time.  Christian and Ana were looking like to be great characters in the first book and then they just swirl into nothing but sex.  How many times a day can you do that? The characters should've been developed further. Christian could've been alot more open.<br /><br />a
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple run rocks! Great graphics and so addicting! The only thing is... you have to turn the brightness up to see and it drains my battery. But aside from that it is a awesome game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|excellent app kills time quite well and that's why I downloaded it word word word I hats when people try to tell me how much I MUST say
0345803485|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time!!!<br />And book 2 & 3 are even better!!!<br />Can't wait for the author to have another series!!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I highly recommend this movie! As well as all of the other animations by Hayao Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli. I didn't receive any issues with the product nor the seller. It came in a few days earlier than expected.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Pacifiers tend to disappear. They fall and roll under a couch, get lost, or snatched by aliens (who knows). This one is attached to a toy monkey. It's fun for our daughter to play with and soothing to suck on. It stays put and doesn't get lost. She likes chewing on the tail, the paws, and tag as well. It's great. We have the frog version too. When it gets all slobbery, we just toss it in the laundry.
0765356139|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is one of the most amazing authors. His action packed stories are filled with wonder and excitement with never a dull moment. Very few authors can write like he can. By Far my Favorite series and one of my Favorite books
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I loved the Maze Runner and of course was going to read its follow up, but I think I liked this one better than the first. We are given some answers to why these things are happening to this group of teenagers, which is what I was hoping. And the whole plot just moves a lot faster than the first book. Really enjoyed the way the dynamic changed between some of the characters in this one and again would recommend to a young adult and like me and Adult reader.
B005HSL626|2.0|it is a so so app but it like EGGS broke my friend's (Lilly) kindle fire. she gotta fix it the kindle is not working right. I bet u woonder y I gave it 2 stars well I'll tel ya. win I got the app.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I just loved this book. I am a fan of the young adult novels and wanted a new one to check out after the popular ones that I have already read. I just really liked the change of persepective to be a teenage boy than a teenage girl. It was a breath of fresh air. You definitely are left with the ahh! I want to know what happens next! at the end of this book which I love and what kept me reading the series. I recommended this book to my coworker for her to read and also her 13 year old son. And he seems to really like it!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows ever. The picture & sound quality was amazing. Highly recommend to any fan of the show. Was definitely a step up from the DVD versions in terms of quality.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My job is books, books, books, books, so many books so little time! So I had this dumb thing in my hands-curiosity killed the cat you know. So I read about a page and a half, thought to myself, this is not erotica, not sexy, not a turn on, not anything! And so I slammed it shut (kind of what I did with 'the girl with the dragon tattoo' only in that case, I saw only two words! Gross!)<br />\\"He hit me again?\\" Hit is not an erotic word. You can hit a home run, make a hit record, hit the mark with a new idea, hit the bullseye, it goes on and on but in this case, hit usually means that someone punched you in the nose, or gave you a black eye, or socked you in the arm. But hit as an erotic word? Nope, it just doesn't work here. This is stupid and the fact that there are two more books to follow and a movie deal is terrible and gonna turn what could be a lot of good minds, into mushy garbage, bleech! Phooey, this is complete and total crap and a waste of all the enthusiasm that it has supposedly generated. Make your own decisions but there are much better books to read than this.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This was a great help to me! Explains everything in step by step fashion.  My next step is to help my child publish her own book.
0345803485|4.0|Very interesting and peaked my interest.  Hard to put down.  Looking forward to the next 2 books.  And the movie!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I could sum up this book in two words, they would be: \\"domestic violence.\\"  (Well, that or \\"triple crap\\").  This book is incredibly offensive... let me count the ways.  So many well-written reviews (loads better than the actual book, I might add), have castigated the writing, and they are spot on.  Aside from the horrid writing, the completely unrealistic sex scenes (he need only to command her to orgasm and violia!), and the god-awful dialogue, the entire tale is a love story between a passive girl and her controlling abuser.  Hot!  He literally commands her to \\"sit\\" like a dog on several occasions, and she happily obliges.<br /><br />Intentional or not, perhaps the most profound part is in the last bit of the book,  where Anastasia (really?!) is, spoiler alert, nursing her first broken heart.  She, having been physically abused for the pleasure of her Dom during the course of their \\"relationship\\" decides that the physical pain of that abuse hurt less than the emotional pain she is feeling having finally left the bastard after he beat her too hard.  You've got to be kidding me.<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" reinforces about every tired  and terrible cliche you can think of.  To name just a few:  this girl will be the one to change the bad boy, he beats her because he loves her, she wants \\"more\\" out of a relationship than he does (and knows one day he'll want the same!), the virgin turned nympho, the rich bachelor who can have anyone but really wants a shy co-ed virgin... the list could go on.<br /><br />I suppose with a better writer, a better editor, and a stronger central character, this book could have been an interesting comment on the fine line between pleasure and pain and love and hate.  As is, however, it's just the story of an incredibly hot billionaire who enjoys beating women to work out his issues with his childhood.  (But have I mentioned he's hot?  And rich? God knows the author makes sure we're well aware).  As one reviewer aptly put it, I wish I could unread this.  If I never see the phrase \\"hooded lashes\\" again in my life, it will still be too soon.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very addicting and fun. There are lots of different games and try are fun for everyone! Trying to unlock the other games is entertaining.
B006LSZECO|4.0|After Nick and Amy Elliot Dunne both lose their jobs and leave New York, their marriage begins to deteriorate. The couple moves to the small community in Missouri where Nick grew up, where his mother is dying of cancer and where his father suffers from Alzheimer's. With money borrowed from Amy's trust fund, Nick and his twin sister, Margo, or \\"Go\\", who has also returned to her hometown, open a bar. Then, one day, Amy disappears.  Signs of violence in the Dunne's home lead to the conclusion something very bad has happened to her.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl:  A Novel\\"  recounts the relationship between Nick and Amy, leading up to, including, and after Amy's disappearance. And a strange relationship it is. One that made me shiver. Switching back and forth from chapters that focus on Nick's thoughts and feelings with chapters that contain sections of Amy's diaries, Flynn creates a portrait of two individuals whose best and worst qualities play off of each other until...well, I don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />Flynn reveals brutal truths about her characters, misleads them (and the reader), and generally does a great job of generating both repulsion and fascination for these characters and the lives they lead.  Rest assured Amy and Nick are not the only strange characters in the novel and their marriage is not the only strange situation.<br /><br />Had me hooked.<br /><br />Four stars.
B000FS9FCG|1.0|This is a putrid and shocking example of irresponsibility and plain foolishness.<br />This kind of garbage calls for censorship.<br />Liberals, typical academia, the common celebrity, Democrats ad nauseum are all at fault for degrading America and preparing it for destruction.<br />How foolish.
B007SGM084|5.0|These naughty little morsels were the best books I've read in a long time, and I am a pretty avid reader.  However, they are not for everyone! Read the synopsis carefully to see if you dare enter the world of Grey. But be careful, as you may find yourself unable to set it down.  I purchased the bundle of the entire trilogy on my Kindle and loved every page-turning moment.  Mm Mm Love me some Christian Grey!!!
B005REXEPW|1.0|Bought this Kindle edition thinking that the latest must be the best. NOT TRUE. This one has none of the notes, and almost none of the formulas are readable. Formulas come through as sequences of squares, even when imbedded in the text. After getting through most of it, I discovered that I could complain to CS, which I did. They refunded my money (kudos to Amazon!), then I bought the edition with the picture of the factories. Notes? Present. Formulas? Present and clear.<br /><br />Don't buy this edition, buy the other one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app is a good time waster. I really like it. works all on the kindle fire. very easy to use<br /><br />thanks for it being free!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I saw the two original Alien movies when I was young enough that they would forge my lifelong love of movies. These films transcended the science fiction I was used to seeing and offered a grown-up, more cynical and dangerous version of Star Wars, Star Trek and the like. So I was one of the first in line to get tickets to Prometheus which I hoped would reboot the franchise and erase the memory of the later inferior Alien films.<br /><br />Overall, there are moments of supreme cinematic greatness combined with a few gaffs of bad science and plot logic but largely it's a fusion of some of Ridley Scott's most brilliant themes.<br /><br />*** Potential spoilers ahead ***<br /><br />First, the weaker parts: scientists discover a drawing of 5 dots in a cave in Scotland which they've seen in other caves throughout history - they take the massive leap of logic to presume that not only did these come from aliens as a map, but these same aliens were the creators of humans. These scientists use this flimsy thesis to convince a death-obsessed rich guy to funnel one trillion dollars into developing the technology to reach the dots.<br /><br />The really bad science doesn't end there. Once we reach the alien cave, they continue to make one bad decision after another despite some very scary things happening. This is where it lurches more into the teen horror flick genre where characters disband, poke around the dark and inevitably meet their Alien-oriented grisly endings.<br /><br />There are also some weaker moments of dialog that seem like a tack-on from test audience screenings not understanding what's happening: one has Shaw discussing her infertility with her partner in a conversational segway that's really off. Later, Charlize Theron reveals her true relationship with Weyland which is a little tired. I'm probably being a little harsh because I expect so much from this film.<br /><br />But on the plus side, this is an excellent movie in any regular context but also a welcome addition to the Alien universe. There is so much overlap from Alien and Aliens that there is a sense of having seen much of it all before but large parts of the idea do stand on their own. There are some truly great horror moments that are simultaneously gripping, revolting, disturbing and original, and it's these handful of scenes that stand out after watching the whole thing.<br /><br />The visuals have never been better, featuring an alien landscape that's seductive, fluid and organic, supported by the invisible use of first class CGI - and it looks even better in 3D. Whereas Alien pulled back from the full sexuality of H R Giger's designs, this film doesn't pull punches in the creature designs and attacks of the face-huggers. The design of the engineers, the creative use of holograms and look of the ship are all extremely well conceived.<br /><br />This is also an exceptional cast. Noomi Rapace reminded me of how great Sigourney Weaver was and delivers ferociously in this role. Similarly Michael Fassbender crafts a delicate performance as the ship's android, treading the line between its appreciation of the beauty of life's designs and the psychotic nature of something that can think but not feel. His character is essential in connecting the themes of death being a part of life and the desire to meet and sometimes destroy your creator.<br /><br />This is all wrapped in a very, very complicated backstory about how the engineers spread life around the universe like space-travelling gardeners. There are mythical connections to Prometheus (wiki it to see) and some not-too-subtle religious parallels (Shaw is a barren woman made pregnant by God?). There are strong themes of selfishness and self sacrifice, natural death and immortality, and many many references to other science fiction works.<br /><br />It's worthy of five stars since it's a league ahead of anything else I've seen this year and it's good to see Ridley Scott at the top of his game.addition to the Alien universe.

B0056C6XIA|5.0|After becoming separated from the group during a winter snowshoe tour last February, I must say this kit lives up to its billing. When stuck in a survival situation for few hours with any of Bear Grylls' products, your primary motivation becomes living long enough to get your money back from that smug bastard. Hours of scraping the firestarter instead of remembering to bring a simple butane lighter fueled my anger. When the flashlight died barely halfway through the first night of peril(4 hours? really?), I was able to keep warm in the dark with thoughts of revenge. Survival is 90% mental and this kit really gives you a reason to persevere.
1607053551|5.0|My interest is textile design as an art form and not producing lots of yardage for sale or home use.  That said, I found the book to be very useful. My favorite section was how to create a block design that will repeat correctly.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|It's a shameless Mario ripoff but fun nevertheless.  Some bugs in performance, such as the level when he ran the whole way w/o stopping. Want to know a cheat? The trick is, don't hit resume after you die (instead go into task manager and end the app). You will start the same turn over again while you practice and get farther. I can't stand playing the same 3 levels a bunch of times cause I die near the end of a chapter.

B007CIQ4B2|5.0|What a fantastic listen Ben Howard's \\"Every Kingdom\\" was to enjoy. I let it soak in a while before writing a review, letting it marinate a little more to get the right flavor.  His first song \\"Old Pine\\" kind of forces you to sit back and enjoy the ride. It takes a good 1:30 minutes before it really kicks in but you know it's coming. Can't say enough about Old Pine and the video that was made for it. musical and visual candy to the senses. \\"Diamonds\\" and \\"The Wolves\\" show no sign of slowing down vibe of the album they both get your toes tapping and your head bobbing.<br /><br />Other stand out tracks for me are \\"The Fear\\" and \\"Keep your Head up\\". These tracks I found really motivational and uplifting. The Fear is about living your life how you want to be remember, \\"I will become what I deserve.\\" \\"Keep your head up\\" has the same vibe delivering the line \\"Keep your head up, keep your heart strong\\".<br /><br />To close it out are the more subdued but great songs of \\"Gracious\\" and \\"Promise\\". Mellow they may be but beautiful none the less. A perfect way to close out an all around great album.<br /><br />For Fans Of:<br />Brett Dennen and Matt Costa<br /><br />Check out the Music Video for \\"Old Pine\\" on my blog at...<br /><br />Harpelli.blogspot.com

B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it! It is so cute. I love the Ice Age movies and am thrilled that I can play with the characters from the movies.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I wish i could get this version sans ads..super anoying!  But other than that, no other performance issues that I have found.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|This movie I must admit took me 2 times to view to like it. At first the characted appeared to bungle his way thru to the final clue, and what a very smart dog. Infact the dog was the better investigator. On the send view I took in more of the graphics and just relaxed and enjoyed the non-stop action. I would recommend this movie but you must first remember that the story line goes back years when the major entertainment was radio.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I'm Proudly married to a Marine, who volunteered for special duty, Drill Instructor.  He successfully completed his tour in 2006.  It may not seem to be a big deal to civilians or those who don't know any better but  it always irritates my husband & myself when we read an awesome book or watch a movie and find these mistakes!  (I'm sure it bothers others too!)  I found a few things to be wrong in this book.  One of my biggest pet peeves is how Marine is not capitalized.  It should ALWAYS be capitalized.  I also dislike when the Marine drill instructor is named/called a drill seargent.  In the Marine Corps it is Drill Instrutor(s).  It almost makes me mad to see proper research is never done when writing about Marines.  If your going to task yourself with writing about Marines, do the research, ask a Marine.  Show your respect & get it all right in their honor.  It's the least you can do, to show your appreciation & respect.  I'm sure the movie might have these wrong too!  I havent watched it... I do have to say though I loved the story, it reminds me of how Marines are a different breed and I see it everyday in my wonderful husband :) I've also been a fan of Nicholas Sparks since Message in a Bottle.  Overall wonderful story, certainly fairy tale but still very beautiful!
0345803507|5.0|Order was sent promptly. Books were a nice quality. Couldn't put books one and two down, third was starting to drag some. I would recommend highly though to the \\"not your usual reader\\".
0345803485|1.0|Like many others I was pulled in to reading this book because of the rave reviews and I was quite surprised to find a best-selling erotic novel.<br /><br />From the very first page I was questioning the quality of the writing style. I later found out that this was originally a fanfiction for Twilight and the author admitted to being a poor writer. But what happened to her editing team?? Anywho, I continued to read because supposedly the author knows how to write really amazing sex scenes despite her lack of literary talent. Unfortunately, this book fails horribly there as well. The main character, Anastasia, is a complete turn off for me and her insecurity and naivety is nothing to fond over. Christian does nothing for me. He's so unrealistic and his dominating characteristics are lacking and seem to flop back and forth between wanting to be dominant and trying really hard to be \\"more\\" for Ana. It all comes off so sappy and unappealing.<br /><br />Overall, everything seems too perfect and then the imperfections seem so fake. As a reader, I could not find myself having any emotions for the characters' weaknesses or horrible pasts. The book is flat and there is not a mature or intellectual bone in any character, no matter how hard the author tries to make them seem that way by loosely tying in what she expects mature, intellectual, well-to-do people to say or do. It's so underwhelming and very often silly. Very repetitive dialogue, as well. With all the gasping, whispering, gaping, muttering...it's hard to take anyone's dialogue seriously. If Ana says \\"oh my\\" one more time I'm going to have to hit something. Is it true that they are planning to make this into a movie? PI can't even imagine...<br /><br />I will finish the book, but if nothing extraordinary happens at the end, I'm done.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Like the title says this is one of the best books I have read in a while. I work 3rd shift in a Datacenter so I have lots of time to read, and this was a excellent find. I can't wait for the next one!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome. it does the same thing over and over and never ends which makes it fun. it is really fun to compete with your friends to see who gets higher score.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|WARNING: Only geeks need apply.<br />If you were born in the mid-70's to early 80's, loved 80's music and pop culture, played video games (and still do), this may be the most relatable read you're likely to come across. Ready Player One is not only peppered with, but built on Dungeons & Dragons, Rush, 80's movies and modern MMORPGs & life sims (Second Life/PlayStation Home, etc). It is the purest definition of the \\"geek-gasm\\".<br />And the young-adult style only greater services the nostalgic warmth you will feel throughout the adventure.<br />A LOT of fun and not to be missed!

B000286RNY|4.0|\\"Shaolin Soccer\\" updates the traditional high fantasy martial arts movie that dominated the 80s by infusing it with modern sensibilities. It's gleefully dumb and knows it, filling the on-screen acrobatic antics with a winking nod to its predecessors.<br /><br />Arch villainous soccer league manager Hung (Patrick Tse Yin) convinced the soccer star Fung (Ng Man Tat) known as \\"Golden Leg\\" to throw a championship game. Hung now leads Team Evil - you read that right, Team Evil - and after years of service he fires Fung from his entourage. Disgraced and now lame, Fung plans to field a rival team. That rival team begins with \\"Steel Leg\\" Sing (Stephen Chow), a Shaolin Kung Fu master determined to bring the ancient system of martial arts to everyday life. Steel Leg sets out to reunite with his martial arts brethren and bring glory to Shaolin.<br /><br />The brothers include Iron Shirt Tin (Kai Man Tin), Light Weight (Chi Chung Lam), Lightning Hands (Kwok-Kwan Chan), Hooking Leg (Mei Lin Mo), and Iron Head (Won Yut Fei). All of them have a talent that is both humorous and breathtaking. Iron Shirt can hold any soccer ball in his gut. Light Weight can launch himself into the air despite his girth.  Lightning Hands' speed makes him an excellent goalie.  Hooking Leg can propel soccer balls at high speeds with an acrobatic twist of his torso. Iron Head makes a great header.  And of course Steel Leg is capable of smashing soccer balls with such force that he threatens airplanes.  It's what the Justice League might look like playing soccer.<br /><br />With such superpowers at their disposal the team proves unstoppable.  Buoyed by their success, it's not long before they (and the movie) acquire endorsements from Puma and face down Hung's Team Evil on the field. Team Evil is just as powerful as our Shaolin superheroes, only, you know, evil.  They have an evil counterpart for each of them, and worse, multiple copies: the jumping guy, the hard-headed guy, the powerful kicker, etc.<br /><br />Meanwhile Iron Leg's friendship with Mui (Vicki Zhao), a pimply-faced insecure girl who uses tai chi to make mantou, becomes strained when her overtures at romance are rejected. Dejected, she disappears, only to reappear at the eleventh hour when Team Evil brings out the big guns.<br /><br />Despite its goofy sensibilities, it's hard not to love this film.  \\"Shaolin Soccer\\" humorously embraces the usual chopsocky tropes and then exaggerates them even further with a dose of CGI. Although the movie is nominally about soccer, it's really about brotherhood, friendship, and beating the jerk who betrayed you.  Martial arts fans will get a real kick out of it.<br />Meanwhile Iron Leg's friendship with Mui (Vicki Zhao), a pimply-faced insecure girl who uses tai chi to make mantou, becomes strained when her overtures at romance are rejected.

B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Halfway through - nice game so far.  would definitely buy more games from this publisher.  I enjoy search and find games, and this has other kinds of puzzles as well - match, find differences, etc.
B001E25MBK|1.0|I agree with the review from dvc...I just noticed a slight difference in the wedding scene, the audio tracks were completely off in some scenes it was like watching a dubbed movie...i called Amazon they sent me a label and I am sending it back
B00846TTDG|5.0|One only wonders why the movie critics crushed this film. Amazon shows a strong 4.5 to almost 5 star rating from real reviewers - - yet the typical Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City film critics uniformly gave this movie a punishing thumbs down. Without taking a giant leap, I can guess why; the movie appears to be pro-war... at least in their twisted tiny elitist minds...  Sadly, today's entertainment industry is obsessed with anti-American movies. You know, corrupt cops, evil corporations, drug smuggling CIA or FBI, racism and anything else that can show America's horrible. Personally, I'm happy to see a movie that's patriotic. People were cheering at the theater. Now this is the type of 'change' we are all looking for.
0307592731|1.0|I hated this book!  It's not a \\"hiking\\" book ~ it's about a hard young woman who<br />uses vulgar language and has no morals.  If I could give it a \\"minus\\" review I would.
B003QO8TDC|5.0|Great movie! Great sound! Anamorphic (enhanced for widescreen TVs) and special features too! This special collector's edition fills the widescreen TV screen at 1.78:1 for those of you who care about this kind of stuff.<br />Awesome DVD.

It would be really great if I could get this game (and others) for free since I already own it for the PC... but I guess you can't have everything...<br /><br />Great game, by the way, and the publisher is the best!  Don't hesitate - you won't be disappointed!
B0063GORYU|4.0|We like playing this game on our Kindle and also on the computer.  It is a game that requires thinking so that helps us keep our mind working.  If we didn't already have this game we definitely would purchase it.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This is a really good game.Don't be fooled by the small price because it is worth it.The graphics are amazing, the story is awesome,  and the music is beautifully composed. to bring you a scare.I rate this a 9 out of 10.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Won't pretend I'm an intellectual or a pro critic...in hindsight, I'm pretty stupid to think anyone could, or would even try to, make a decent prequel to what is basically a space creature flick (Alien). I went to Prometheus simply based on the fact Alien is one of, if not the best, sci-fi movies ever made (partially due to its simplicity).  I was expecting something on the same vein, yet new...what I got was a generic back story, copycat bits and pieces from the original Alien, a fake Sigourney Weaver, another talking severed android head (couldn't come up with anything else?), a lame octopus and a blatant setup for a sequel.  I want a real ending...and a good one.
B007Z5WMCW|5.0|I love this app you get all you want Tv any shows or episodes all the time any time!!!!!bye I recomend this app to anyone that loves tv
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I will start by saying that as a child, I performed in the live performance of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in the local public theatre of my hometown for several years. In doing so, I saw the play many, many times.  This was the first movie adaptation of A Christmas Carol that I have even seen that evoked the deep, visceral feelings that I experienced as a child performing in the story.  The delivery of the lines, the almost imperceptible nuances of behavior at times, the atmosphere that came with each ghost... I haven't seen those in any of the other CC movies to date. This was the only one that I felt truly captured a live feeling, like I was immersed in the story instead of just watching it. In addition, the CGI allowed the ghost experience to go beyond what is physically possible in the constraints of the stage and turn into a true supernatural experience. I especially liked the ever-accelerating aging of the Ghost of Christmas Present. He only has one day to live in the novel as well, and this version really showed it well. The gritty yet romantic feeling of industrial, Victorian England was impeccably captured as well and and truly made me feel like I was there. The ONLY thing I didn't care for was the long chase scene. It wasn't true to the novel and went on for too long. But I usually just fast-forward through that anyway! What a great adaptation; I will be watching this for years to come!
B0086700CM|4.0|I highly recommend this game to people of all ages.it is a fun game that takes skill and sratagy as well as a brain

B007K3JCAE|1.0|Loved this movie in the theatres but this trend of only an Ultraviolet copy sucks. I will not buy this as a physical copy. I complained about Harry potter and now this one. iTunes is going to be the way I get it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The writing is AWFUL.  The book is awful. If you enjoy semi erotica that seems to be written by a twelve year old, this might be up your alley.  For the life of me, I cant figure out the hype behind this book or even fathom that there was enough of a demand to write two more of the ridiculous things.<br /><br />Hands down, the worst book Ive ever read and I read a LOT.  I couldnt even finish this one.  It is that bad.  Dont waste your money. If you are really curious, get it from your library or something. I want my money back, that is how bad I thought it was.
B005GUQIDC|5.0|First off, I am not a pop fan as such, but her style is quite different and good enough to draw me. I started off with a couple of songs but like 5 of them now, so I can say it grew with time. I have it on Rdio but considering ordering the physical CD now! The best ones for me are: Cameo Lover, Good Intent, Sally I can See You, Two Way Street, Old Flame.<br /><br />Recommended if you want to listen to something fresh.
B000KUD2G4|5.0|Had a problem with using a laptop on stage- whenever the AC adapter was in use, terrible noise.  DI boxes were a partial solution but didn't really do the job.  This thing works great- no noise, no signal loss.  EBtech Hum X is also a good choice, though at twice the price.  It's either spend less money but need more patch cables (Behringer) or spend more money but use fewer cables (EBTech).
B007J4T2G8|4.0|My friends told me to read this book with this warning \\"It's very erotic but a really good story\\" so I thought I knew what to expect. I was blown away but they were not wrong about the story, it is awesome and the fantasy and reality of the story mesh well. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a good read. It's just not for the weak of heart.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is  one of my favorite  authors of today. Having read all of her books, I love the way she creates  a  mystery from the persona of every day people. She really digs into the psyche of her characters, almost to the point of insanity. I had to put this book down a few times and really think about what was going on. Wow is all I can say.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|thumbs up. I love the different variety of games. I do not like having to earn points to unlock new games.
B000IVW25M|5.0|What else is there to say?  Best of the Disney films.  It was delivered quickly and in excellent condition by Amazon.  This is a must have for any collector or any family with children.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I know I'm in the minority here and that's ok. I enjoyed the originality of this story, the strong female heroine, as well as finally getting to the end and receiving a thoroughly satisfying closure. What I didn't enjoy was the laborious effort of getting from point A to point C while having to trudge through so many unnecessary pages of text. I felt that this would have been a higher star review for me if it was done more concisely in two rather than five parts and a lot of redundancies, tutorials, and other such over explanations were cut out. I felt as if I were literally dragging myself through thick mud while reading the majority of this book and the only thing pushing me along to finish was shear stubbornness of not giving up.

0062183591|5.0|I'm a fan of behavioral economics as I understand the subject - data about how people decide instead of a priori reasoning. Dan Ariely has written a great book about human nature as he has tested it. Our behavior stinks and we rationalize it beyond all reason. What do I mean? I remembered while I was reading this book something I had stolen. I then took comfort in deciding it was really dishonesty and not theft. Dr. Ariely differentiates the two. I used the book to join them together and then to plead guilty to the lesser offense. I took the present book to paint my past in a better light. Doesn't dishonesty sound better than theft as a misdemeanor sounds better than a felony?<br /><br />Why discuss this here? Because it shows how I use whatever is at hand to rationalize myself into a better self image.<br /><br />This book shows what people are really like. We have the image of original sin to deal with and we just pass it by. At least I do. And then in comes the evidence that we all deviate from the straight and narrow in ways we can paint in such a way that our behavior (bad) does not tarnish our (good) self image. I have this picture of myself and it's all made up. I select what I remember and I pretend it's the whole picture. And it's good. I'm not pushing original sin & neither is the author. I just want to point out that the image and idea of man's errant nature does not originate in this book. But the author presents a lot of data supporting the view that we all cheat a lot.<br /><br />I'm not a social scientist and I have no dog in this fight. But I think it is good to read a book dealing with experiments and the resultant data rather than subjective views. I felt a slight twinge of \\"what about cultural conditioning?\\" and in the end Dr. Ariely deals with that too.<br /><br />I'm glad to have this readable book available. I do have one reservation, the footnotes are hard for me (with my weak eyes) to read. Even one or two of the charts had runny ink smudging up the lettering. But I got the idea anyway.

B0007DAZW8|5.0|This is a great disc while not Top 40 material it does have some catchy beats. I picked this up after listening to Daft Punks' Alive release numerous times which included some of the material off this release. All of the tracks are artfully crafted.<br /><br />-Human After All offers a repetitive robotic voice saying \\"we are human after all\\", \\"After all\\", \\"Flesh uncovered\\",  and \\"Human\\". The catchy music underneath all those robotic voices is what makes this track so great.<br /><br />- The Prime Time Of Your Life offers the same robotic voice like Human after all but of course this time they are saying \\"Prime time of your life\\" and the track starts out as a slow repetition of the robotic voice then quickly picks up pace.<br /><br />- Robot Rock is, in my opinion, what makes this album pull the listener in a little more with a robotic voice repeating \\"Robot Rock\\". This is a really great track.<br /><br />- Steam Machine is a man saying at a low voice \\"Steam Machine\\" while the track moves along.<br /><br />- Make Love is just an instrumental with the music fading in and playing on and then slowly fading out. Its a really mellow track.<br /><br />- The Brainwasher is the track that throws you back into the loud bass and makes you feel a bit more primal. Very catchy I must say.<br /><br />-ON/Off is just someone switching the channels like we have all done when there isn't anything on TV but it lends itself to the next track.<br /><br />- Television rules the nation slowly comes in and repeats the title in their signature robot voice plays for a bit and then slowly fades out. This is a really great track.<br /><br />- Technologic starts off with a techno tongue twister robot voice and continues on with another robotic voice joining in saying \\"yeah yeah\\" Very catchy track.<br /><br />- Emotion is another amazing track but at a slower speed like Make Love, very smooth and mellow. A great track to close out the album.<br /><br />Personally I loved the robotic voice that was going on with most of the tracks. This disc is smooth with a bit of roughness like The Brainwasher but still an amazing disc. It's one to add to the collection. Daft Punk keeps their music fresh so that your not listening to the same thing as the previous album like so many artists do so that fans aren't disappointed.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|\\"The System Has Failed\\" showed Megadeth returning to their old heavier/more thrash-metal roots some. This album definitely explores thrash-metal with extremely fast and amazing solos and amazing musicianship over-all from all the guys. Not every song is thrash-based but this album is almost flawless except for one song that I found a little weak (\\"You're Dead\\").<br /><br />This album takes elements of Megadeth's thrash albums, \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" (the political jabs are extremely strong here, the lyrics are largely targeted at the UN), and \\"Youthanasia\\" (besides having a fresh different take on \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" with a female singer, \\"United Abominations\\" actually does have some of the same brooding heaviness).<br /><br />Megadeth would perfect their formula on their next album \\"Endgame\\", but this is an extremely good album that holds up with the older Megadeth albums.<br /><br />If you're a Megadeth fan, you'll be pleasantly surprised when you listen to this.<br />If you're new to Megadeth, start with \\"Rust in Peace\\" or \\"Countdown to Extinction\\".<br /><br />Buy.
B0052RCX0G|5.0|I started reading a hard copy of this book that was loaned to me by a co-woworker.  I never expected to like it or finish it, nonfiction is not my genre.  After the first 10 objects I was hooked!  The book was so heavy, I decided to buy it on my Kindle.  I really enjoyed the book and learned about the history of man to boot.  It was very interesting and the chapter on each object is 3-5 pages, so when you are ready to quit reading it is easy to find a stopping point.  The pictures are fantastic!

1843119560|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1ISYBCRUJP0Y2]]<br /><br />FOR TODAY'S PRACTITIONERS AND ARBITRATORS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />By its very nature, dispute resolution is always contentious; the `disputes' in question being quite frequently intractable.  Evidence is therefore always of concern, especially, as is usual, where there is a virtually insoluble dispute over the basic facts- in which case, evidence becomes the key factor which will enable those sitting in judgment on a tribunal to come to a decision.<br /><br />`In international arbitration,' says the author, Nathan O'Malley, an experienced practitioner, `it is no different.'<br /><br />Intended to provide necessary and helpful guidance on international arbitration to arbitrators, as well as clients and their representatives, this book, published recently by Informa, presents `a proper discussion of evidence in international arbitration,' which, as His Honour Humphrey Lloyd, QC observes in the Foreword, `is long overdue.'<br /><br />It's also pointed out here that O'Malley has structured the book around the 2010 edition of the International Bar Association's Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration, the IBA rules, being described as `a synthesis of good practice.'<br /><br />But as the author also mentions, the IBA Rules do not cover all aspects of evidentiary procedure', which nevertheless still means that tribunals have problems confronting it.  This book therefore started out as a research project aimed at identifying `common solutions to common problems regarding evidence,' and culminated in a commentary on the IBA Rules, with further examination of related rules and issues.<br /><br />The primary source material for this book is, collectively, the published and unpublished case law of international tribunals, the views of which are represented and commented upon.<br /><br />Additionally, the Rules discussed are also sourced from the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rule (2010) and to some extent the UNCITRAL Model Law (2006).  The book therefore is a rich, scholarly, informed and thoughtful source of guidance for anyone practising in this almost invariably complex area of law.<br /><br />And not for nothing is this clear and very readable volume referred to as an `annotated guide', which it certainly is.  Extensive and minutely detailed footnoting abounds as a rich resource in itself, plus - there's a detailed index and Table of Cases and Arbitrations, together with a Table of Legislation, Conventions and Rules. Usefully, especially in any international field of law, there is a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms.<br /><br />If you're in any way involved with international arbitration, whether you are an arbitrator, lawyer, or possibly a client, you'd do well to acquire this book.  The publication date is 2012.d from the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rule (2010) and to some extent the UNCITRAL Model Law (2006).

B00008CLOA|2.0|In a word... whatever. The Original Master Recording by MFSL is far better than this. The SACD formatting - to me ear - provides too much information and compromises the ambient naturalness of most original recordings. The resolution is too high, unnaturally high, and causes most of the higher frequencies to be abrasive. I played it on my hi-end system: Arcam FMJ DV139 source player, Arcam FMJ AVR600 processing and amplification, B&W 805s speakers, Velodyne SPL subwoofer.
B000JMKNZQ|2.0|It's sad to write a \\"not so good\\" review about this book being that it was written by Paul Coelho.  I read the Alchemist multiple times and really enjoyed it.  So it was with great enthusiasm I moved on to read Warrior of the Light, as I figure Paulo could do no wrong.  I figured there would be so many life lessons etc that I could apply to my own life.  I did encounter a few, however, i stopped less than half way into the book.  I just could not bring myself to finish the book.  I did not like it.  Whilst reading I felt like I was reading the \\"Art of War\\" by Sun Tzu.  I did not see much of a story line, just a list of things a warrior of the light would and would not do.  I had to stop reading as I was finding it difficult to continue.  This will not deter me from reading other books by Coelho, but I do hope I am not disappointed again.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Fantastic! Rarely have I encountered an author with such a capacity for engaging eloquent prose. Add to this the daunting nature of the subject and it makes Mr. Mukherjee's achievement all the more remarkable. With the deftness of a fiction writer, this book grips all but the most moribund of minds in its beautiful, often poignant, never dull descriptions of mankind's enduring struggle with the fearsome illnesses we collectively call cancer. Frequently dealing with scientific concepts and the seemingly convoluted logic involved in the pursuit of therapies, preventions, and palliatives, Mukherjee remains Sherpa-like in his steady, guiding narrative and enables us to scale the subject with ease and fascination.<br /><br />Although dealing with a largely clinical subject, Mukherjee's treatment is far from clinical. He brings the personalities to life whether they be the researchers, clinicians, politicians, industrialists or patients. Each is delivered to us as a real persona whose strengths and flaws bring him or her into vivid focus. I was moved, sometimes to tears. In drawing me to contemplate my own future and whether cancer might figure in it, the book gave me both hope and fear. Still, it's clear that this is not a book intended to deliver comfort to present-day cancer sufferers and I don't think it makes any explicit or even implicit claims to do so. However for those of us who are not suffering but still harbor fears about the possibility, it is a hopeful but realistic assessment of where we are today.<br /><br />As for readability, Mukherjee even pays attention to the cadence of the prose so that reading it feels as if the words carry their own lubricant.  He is a rare blend of scientist and storyteller who has mastered the art of distilling without losing the important details of this highly technical and widely relevant subject.

B000FCKC4C|5.0|I read the paperback version of this book about a year or so ago.  After it went On sale for .99cents, I got the kindle version.  There are so many lessons to be learned from this book.  The book overall gave me the overall lesson that one may go all over the world looking for something that was already right in front of their face....however, one can learn new lessons whilst searching for their personal legend.  I can relate.  My fianc&eacute;e and I grew up together and were childhood friends.  We left our country and travelled all over separately looking for love and our personal legend.  Only to end up back home (where we started) and found love with each other.  However, we sure learnt a lot from our experiences whilst traveling.  I whole-heartedly recommend this book.  This is the first book I read by Paulo and thus far my favorite.  I have went on to read other books by him.

0345803493|1.0|After reading the first book, I was pretty much hooked.  However, as the storyline unfolded, it became more and more unrealistic.  When I finished the book, I was ready for more.  At the beginning of the second book, the plot seemed as though it was going to thicken with the introduction of Christian's \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" and his deranged lover.  I kept reading it only to find out that the plot was pretty much at a standstill.  The problem for me was the fifty plus pages midway through the second book of them doing it over and over and over ad nauseam.  I became extremely bored and frustrated with the writing because it was so predictable.  By then, I quit reading it.  A friend told me what happened in the rest of the trilogy, and I could've guessed the ending.<br /><br />If you want to read about a woman who bites her lip and a man who twitches his palms that get together and do it kinky pretty much every five pages in these books, then read it.  I have a feeling when the trend of these novels begins to wane, many people will see through hindsight that these books actually suck.

B004R739LE|5.0|I love this bag! Exactly what I've been looking for to protect my DSLR and equipment.  Plenty of space and pockets in the top compartment for a day's worth of essentials.  I take this camping and on the trails with us and bought it for future travel to theme parks.  Plenty of space in the camera compartment on the bottom for my DSLR, a zoom lens and my battery charger.  It even saved my camera a few weeks ago on a canoe trip.  I had to jump into a river after my daughter had been thrown in when we hit a log head on with our canoe.  I had completely forgotten that I had the backpack on.  Once I realized that I did, after I pulled her to safety, all that could run through my mind was that my camera was ruined (in a rush that morning, I had completely forgotten to Ziplock EVERYTHING).  The bag was completely submerged when I jumped in.  Much to my surprise, the camera was barely wet! The bottom of it had a few water droplets on it.  I had napkins in the top compartment that were completely dry! The camera and all equipment are in perfect working order today.  The only negative to the bag is that it is difficult to get in and out of if you want to get to your equipment out or put it away when it's not in use.  You have to set it down or have someone hold it for you.  I knew that going into it though after reading other reviews.  My needs of a dual purpose camera bag (not just something that would hold my camera, but something that would hold other essentials as well) trumped the minor irritation of getting it in and out.
B0035G0U2O|5.0|I loved this movie for the nice side-stories, the great special effects, and the wonderful acting. It's one to watch with the date fast-approaching.
B00846REIS|2.0|The book started well enough, the first pages enticing me to read more but as I went on reading something nagged me. Gideon Cross had shades of Roarke, a main character from the JD Robb \\"In Death\\" series more than that he had lines from Roarke.<br />Further in the book a tertiary character had definitely more than \\"shades\\" of another tertiary character from one of JD Robb's books and almost the same name.<br />It was a major disappointment and a turn off.<br />There were enough small twists and turns in Bared to You to have me go on reading but now there was something missing; Respect for the book.<br />I didn't feel much of anything for the two main characters or their ordeal. I thought Cary was the more lovable character in the book.<br />Now to be fair to the author I have not read any other of her books and I will definitely read another but Bared to You was on so many levels a big disappointment.

B007A4SDCG|1.0|Honestly, this is one of the most useless and poorly written books I've ever had the misfortune to waste money on in a long time. The only good advice the author gives is to dedicate yourself to your art, and keep at it every day. Make it a priority. There, I saves you the cost of the book! The rest is nonsensical rambling interspersed with full and half-blank pages. Don't waste your money!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and want to recommend it to everyone. All of the references were great and Cline was great in explaining all of the things I might have missed. Any book that has Wil Wheaton as a master of the universe is great in my book. The main character could be a bit of an ass but you could relate to him. The addiction to communication where you don't ever see your friends but love them with all your heart is something more and more people are becoming familiar with. I would love to get the audiobook for this just so I could read it again. It is even better because Cline is now conducting his own Easter egg hunt to win a DeLorean! It is just amazing and this is a must read for all video game and 80's fanatics.

0061969656|4.0|This seventh volume in the highly-regarded \\"Saxon Tales\\" series is a turning point in the saga of the creation of \\"England,\\" which could so easily have become \\"Daneland\\" instead. Uhtred of Bebbanburg, born Saxon but raised Danish, has been King Alfred's war-leader for a couple of decades now, the victor at Edington and Benfleet, the capturer of London, the killer of Ubba (greatest Danish warrior of his day), and all because he gave Alfred his oath. He has never much liked the unlikeable Alfred but he has come to respect him enormously. And all he really wants to do is to raise the silver to raise the army he needs to recapture his hereditary seat in Northumbria. Now it's the Fall of 899 and the king is dying, and Uhtred has carefully refrained from swearing allegiance to Edward, the young heir. But then Alfred, on his deathbed, coerces him into it, and Uhtred knows his destiny is to continue to fight the Danes and support the Saxons of Wessex. And then Alfred is gone and Edward (later to be known as \\"the Elder\\") is trying to figure out how to be king. He's not his father but he has promise -- if he can only learn to make decisions on his own and not under the thumb of the Church and his mother. Uhtred knows full well the Danes have just been waiting for Alfred's death, for the chaos that will follow and the opportunities it will present. In addition, Aethelwold, Edward's drunken cousin -- who yet has a better claim, technically, to the crown -- has gone over to the Danes. And the Kentish leaders aren't happy, either. The thing is, the enemy doesn't seem to be doing anything. Why aren't the Danish armies invading? Uhtred can't figure it out and, as the months go by, the new king's advisors are sure there won't be a war after all. The reader, of course, knows better, and the last third of the book provides Cornwell his opportunity to do what he does best -- to follow Uhtred into battle, this time in East Anglia, which settles things for a time and removes a number of players from the game.<br /><br />This volume doesn't have quite the pace of the previous couple of episodes, but that's largely a result of the history the author has to deal with. He never changes history for the purposes of the story, but there are plenty of gaps in the narrative of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ into which Uhtred fits very nicely. We already know he's going to live a very long time, so this series could, in theory, become as lengthy as the author's \\"Sharpe\\" series. England isn't safe yet!players from the game.<br /><br />This volume doesn't have quite the pace of the previous couple of episodes, but that's largely a result of the history the author has to deal with.

B00005YW4H|5.0|It's been almost a decade since Norah Jones released \\"Come Away With Me,\\" her sublime debut effort. And despite the passage of time, this collection holds up beautifully... almost too beautifully, in fact, because everything Ms. Jones has released since then fails to measure up. Jones' greatness lies in her anti-diva approach to singing, with a voice as clear and bombast-free as any you'll ever hear. It's a perfect match for the ethereal arrangements and delicate piano playing that define the entire beguiling album. How recordings can be so simultaneously sparse and impactful is musical magic. Best cuts: the fetching \\"Don't Know Why,\\" the country-classic-(Hank Williams)-turned-Great-American-Songbook-sound-alike \\"Cold Cold Heart,\\" and the timeless standard \\"The Nearness of You,\\" which is so breathless and light that you may find yourself levitating. This collection is not to be missed.
B005I4JG80|2.0|My main points of contention<br /><br />1) Her husband sounds like a total toad and she let's him away and encourages him being a toad.<br /><br />2) Her charming attempt at making feminism in America sound outdated and \\"unsexy\\" while at the same time supporting the inequality and oppression of French women is atrocious.<br /><br />3) The miracle parenting advise comes down to simple, basic things that American parents do. Her extrapolation of her own failures as a parent to \\"American parenting\\" is silly.<br /><br />4) Breastfeeding is important. France has that wrong and we all know it, but while the author makes a big deal out of making sure she herself nurses, she excuses all of France with stupid reasons like it being unattractive and time consuming.

0345803485|5.0|Honestly people...be a little more open-minded.  I don't think this book was written to be a literary masterwork.  It was written for fun!  I do admit there are phrases that are somewhat overly used, but it doesn't take away from the book.  I read it in about a day, then ordered the other 2 books in the trilogy because I enjoyed this one so much.  It is a good quick read that is full of \\"action\\".
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This concert may be the best thing ever put into film. I can easily say it was the best hour and a half of my life. Not only does Adele's voice give me goosebumps, but she really connects with the audience.<br /><br /> I see some reviews about bad editing because it shows the band members, the concert hall, and the fans singing in the audience. That's ridiculous. First of all, it's not about how the dang thing looks, it's about the music; Adele is one of the most talented people of our generation. Seeing the audience was great. You get to see how they were feeling. It makes it seem more like you were there, it's like you're standing in the audience and you're looking at the person next to you. The shots of the concert hall make it even better by showing off the dramatically beautiful venue.<br /><br /> I also see complaints about her language, and people complain that their kids heard her \\"potty mouth\\". JUST GROW UP. It's a part of life! They're going to be exposed to it. Oh, and why are you showing this to your child in the first place?! It's Adele. Not Barney. She's an adult, talking about adult things.<br /><br /> Overall, I think I would bay $300 for this. I've watched it probably nine times now. So five stars seems perfectly fair.

B0002V7O3S|5.0|I remember watching this movie in '93 and it was scary and I've never forgotten it! I have always wanted to see it again, but I did forget the exact name of the movie for the longest. I called my sister and asked her could she remember the name of it and she said \\"Fire down Below.\\" I knew it wasn't the correct name but was similar,so I had to get online and look until I found it... This is an awesome movie and will scare the crap out of you!! I hope you like it as much as me,my two sisters and our friends did. It's been years since I've seen it but just bought it on Amazon so I can't wait until it gets here so I can watch it again, although it does scare me.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is my first time to write any kind of Amazon review, but I felt compelled to do so for this book.  I was at first astonished to find this book for $1.50 (Kindle version) and when I read the description thought it was cost effective enough that I would give it a try.  Wow!  Anthony Ryan is to be commended.  He did an oustanding job of developing characters with depth and passion on an epic scale.  I had a day off and read the book all day, couldn't put it down because I just needed to see where he was going and what would happen.  Now Mr. Ryan just needs to get busy and finish the second novel.  I will be first to buy the next one and anything else this from this talented story teller.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I bought this book for my IPad using the kindle app.  It's the only way to go as you can share it between all your devices that have the app.  Ibooks can ONLY be read on your ipad....w/ kindle I can at least read the book on my Imac.<br /><br />*note this is not DRM free but you can at least use it between your devices.<br />I think i paid $15 which still seems kind of high but that goes to show how attached to the series I am.  Watch the show on HBO...if you like it you'll love the books.

I am by NO means a prude..but good lord..it's just lame. I should re-write this and make it a real adult book. Pathetic ...I want my time and brain cells back that it took to attempt this.
0307730697|5.0|Eric Blehm has written the book that cannot go unread. The story is told the way the SEAL's want it told...from their perspective on why they are who they are and do what they do. If you seek an inside view of what these men do on a daily basis, this is a tremendous read. Unique in this story is not how much pain a man endures in BUD/S, but shows how one man progressed from high school, to the lowest part of humanity, to meeting his future wife, and finding faith through her to become a loving husband, father, and member of SEAL Team Six. The author made me feel as if I knew Adam and now his family he left behind. Although gone, Adam Brown challenges me to be less comfortable, more sensitive to the needs of others, and recommitt to my faith. As a SEAL's SEAL, Adam Brown lived to be tested in all he did and lead through his willingness to accept the toughest assignments. Thank God for men who are willing to risk all as warriors who protect,defend , and keep us safe from those who are willing to take away everything we have.<br />Lastly, I'm committed to participate in the Adam Brown Legacy Foundation and hope you will as well.<br /> Read this book...I assure you you will be better for it...just like Adam would have wanted.
0345803485|5.0|I never read.  My boss has a friend who called and asked if I would order these books for her. She told me a little about them and got me curious,  so once she was done with them, she passed them back for me to read. I am on the third book and I must say, I love these books. So glad I decided to read them. You can really get caught up in this love story. My husband says he will be glad when I am done, so things can get back to normal around the house, laundry, dishes and even down to sweeping and mopping has been neglected. I would tell anyone who loves to read and even those like me that don't like to read, these books are awesome!!! You will not won't to put them down. I hate that this story will end for me in a couple days. Boo Hoo!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm more of a historical fiction type of person, but this series drew me in from the HBO series.  It's not all D&D like you expect and that's what I like about it.  Sure there's some dragons and the Starks are closely tied to some direwolves, but in essence the series doesn't overdo it like so many others.  Too bad Amazon recommends so many of those types of books when relating to this one.  I'd love to find another series that could do for me what this one did.  Give me the intrigue, the sarcastic but witty drawf, and the courageous but sullen bastard son.  I would have liked him to tone down his descriptions of what types of food a person ate.  There were times when you could go through an entire page and it was like reading a grocery list.  All in all though, great work.

B004HW7JHE|5.0|I don't understand all the negative commentary I've heard about Season 5. Critics have said that the pacing is too slow and that many of the characters behave erratically. People, this is \\"Mad Men!\\" It's subtle. Things progress slowly, and that's not a bad thing. As for people behaving out of character, I think that's inaccurate as well. Many of the characters go through major changes this season: changes in their relationships, changes at work, changes in their priorities. All of these changes are things that our leading man, Don Draper, is dealing with this season. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that he has created a whole new life for himself this season, and he is determined to make it work. That means he tries to make changes in his life, and some of them are more successful than others.<br /><br />Other characters evolve as well: Peggy grows continually frustrated with her work over at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Joan deals with a lot of major changes in her personal life, and is faced with some very difficult decisions that may shape her future. Roger is...well, Roger! There is an awesome episode that is really all about Roger, and it's one of the best episodes of the season by far. Betty also deals with some, ahem, pretty big changes this season, which are downright hilarious, in my opinion. Pete kind of enters an early mid-life crisis this season and gets punched in the face a lot, which is always a good time. Sally, one of my favorite characters on the show, continues to steal every scene she's in. (When the show eventually ends, I hope we get a Sally Draper spin-off somehow.) And then there's Lane, a character who spins off into a direction I didn't expect, and as a result, the third-to-last episode of the season is the most shocking and jarring of the show to date. The final two episodes deal with the fallout of what happens, and while there isn't a super dramatic cliffhanger, the audience is left wondering which side of Don Draper's personality will shine through in the opening scenes of the first episode of Season Six.<br /><br />All in all, Season Five was outstanding and completely met and exceeded my expectations, as is usually the case with \\"Mad Men.\\" My only disappointment is that the season flew by too quickly, and it's going to be a looooooooooong wait for Season Six.nality will shine through in the opening scenes of the first episode of Season Six.<br /><br />All in all, Season Five was outstanding and completely met and exceeded my expectations, as is usually the case with \\"Mad Men.\\" My only disappointment is that the season flew by too quickly, and it's going to be a looooooooooong wait for Season Six.

And Tom Cruise may not sound like Bon Jovi does, but he does pretty well! This movie has gotten me more jazzed up and excited to go see this movie! I love the 80's- let's make it popular again!

It also reset my 'old school' mentally which I was taught about 'study, job, future!). I believe it is not too late for me to determine my financial future. I especially praise My God for His divine intervention into my life that made me pick up this book and read it. Now I finally purchased my own copy.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best I'm so glad its on the kindle fire.I got the highest score ever.If u never try this game before try it its fun!;)
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I am so glad to see  the SMDM finally on dvd. Season one has the pilot, and 2 made for tv movies. AWESOME! I would recommend this to anyone, but as for myself, I bought the box set with everything in it. I do not discourage anyone from buying season 1 or any other seasons, and its fine for those of you who only want a little taste of TSMDM, but I wanted it all, thus I bought the $200 box set, and glad I did. So, if you want a little taste, and want to buy this awesome show, season by season, or want to skip a season, or whatever, thats your thing, but I had to have it all, because this is my favorite 70's show ever. I highly recommend the BOX SET, and be done with it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read/listen to audio books constantly but rarely go out of my way to write a review and especially not a bad one because I understand everyone has their own likes and dislikes and I appreciate anyone who works at being an author and is willing to put themselves out there but I couldn't help myself here. After hearing general hype about these books and the intriguing story line as well as the very funny SNL Mother day short of it I downloaded the audio. I tried over and over to listen, but was utterly surprised at the horrific writing using expression like \\"holy cow\\" or \\"warm and tingly down there\\" when she see's Christian Grey naked. It really sounded like a child wrote this which was especially disconcerting joined with the content that just made me cringe over and over again. This book series was obviously written with the author who is supposedly in her 40's not at all caring about the quality of work but obviously hoping to attract completely ignorant masses of young girls which makes me even more frightened that this will be something they hear is good and may influence their reading appetites. Have we as American readers in general really become so dumbed down over the recent years to consider this readable material and worst a best seller? I hate to ruin this book for those of you who have not had the chance to compare and somehow enjoyed it but I sincerely suggest those interested to venture out and try reading some of the real classics in this genre or even erotica for that matter. Check out authors like Giovanni Boccaccio, Anais Nin, Anne Rice to start with a few and I promise you won't be able to read 5 more minutes of this. Your reading taste buds will be changed forever and you will thank yourself for comparing and seeing the clear difference in quality and content.

0307594165|3.0|I sat down this past weekend to read \\"Home\\", and I must say that I have to keep reminding myself that this is Toni Morrison, and not Walter Mosley. Like Mr Mosley, Ms Morrison tells the story of Black life from a historical perspective, meaning that she reminds us of how things were for the 'lesser' of us in our day-to day-lives (having to use the back door, the dialect, the examination of white life from a Black person's view). Unlike Ms Morrison's previous novels, I am not having to circle back, highlight character names to remember who is who,  digging deep to find the reason why a character acts a certain way; which is to say for me that I find Frank (one of the main characters) to be more like a Walter Mosley character- strong, silent, having to live the life that is thrust upon him by virture of his skin color, but overall being protective of those who share his history (his sister, his two childhood buddies who are killed in battle). Think Socrates Fortlow or Easy Rawlins.<br />I enjoyed \\"Home\\", but if the reader is a first time enjoyer of Toni Morrison's novels, they may be sorely disappointed that this is a much more 'easy' read than her previous novels. Less depth, but all in all, an ok read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book made me want to cry, not just because it was poorly written but because of all the publicity and praise it is getting. I had not heard of this book and I have not read a romance/erotica novel before. The explicit sex, though, isn't what bothered me per se.<br /><br />All my friends were raving about it, so I thought I'd give it a chance. I read a few reviews, saw the criticisms but figured it couldn't be that bad. I saw that it was based off Twilight fan fiction and, since Stephanie Meyer is not a great writer herself, I thought this couldn't be much worse. Possibly better. It's on the best sellers list and all. Oh, but it is. It was even worse than other people said. Popular =/= good. I read all three books, hoping it would redeem itself and that, maybe, my friends were right.<br /><br />What happened to the editor for this book? Whoever it was should be fired. The repetition was the worst part of the book. Someone in one of the comments on here took the time to count how many times certain words were used in all three books, including \\"murmur\\" (770 times) and \\"whisper\\" (828 times). So, on average, each of those words was used about once every 2 pages throughout the whole series. Some other words/phrases that were overused in all 3 books are: inner goddess, oh my, his long fingers, pursed lips, press(ed) lips into a hard/thin line, jeez, smirk, biting her lower lip, flushes, blushes, and so on.<br /><br />It should have been one book, not three. In fact, the original fan fiction was apparently just one story. On a related note, I read that an analysis of the published series and the original fan fiction showed that they are 89% the same.<br /><br />The author takes one, fairly standard, premise and splits it into three books. I suspect this was done largely for monetary reasons: why sell just one book when you can sell three? As it is, the story is agonizingly drawn out and over-extended. The series' editor should have cut at least 200 pages from each book, then combined all three into one. Then, they might've been left with an okay novel. It would lose the repetitiveness and actually have a coherent story, instead of 70% sex, 30% story/character development/everything else.<br /><br />Each book should be able to stand on its own. They don't, though, which is another reason I think the trilogy should've been condensed into one book. I understand that people are drawn to these novels for their adult content but, when you have very similar sex scenes over and over with little story between them, it seriously detracts from the tension and the anticipation.<br /><br />I started quickly reading through the sex scenes as they are repetitive and, really, not that hot (even borderline comical). The female character, Anastasia, who climaxes on pretty much every page, starts out as a virgin. She is willing to jump right into kinky, S & M sex just because Christian is hot. Plus, they never just do it once per session. It's always back to back to back. And she orgasms every single time. Sometimes she orgasms just from him touching her nipples. And the only time she complained about being sore was her lips from kissing or being spanked.<br /><br />Despite copious amounts of exceedingly rough sex, she never complains once or even mentions \\"intimate\\" soreness. Somehow, her vagina is both super-humanly sensitive and the toughest part of her body. To be fair, I know the author wasn't going for realism. However, this feels, at times, like it was written by someone who has read about, but never actually had, sex. For me, at least, making both characters into sexual gods, rather than real, relateable humans, detracted from both my ability to connect with the story and the \\"hotness\\" of the sex scenes.<br /><br />A lot of the book was far fetched. I like to read to escape but this was just too unbelievable. For instance, she orgasms at his command and at the drop of a hat. She's an intern for a week before the boss is fired and then she's promptly given his job. Christian is a billionaire, can fly helicopters, play the piano, sails, looks like a Greek god, etc. The way he's described is so over the top that, rather than making him sound \\"dreamy,\\" it just comes off as silly.<br /><br />The voice of the character of Anastasia sounded like an old lady trying to sound young. What 21 year old constantly says/thinks \\"Holy cow!\\"? I know I don't and I'm 26. Don't forget the millions of times she thinks \\"oh my\\" during sex. I was just waiting for her to say \\"why i never\\" or some other outdated, \\"old lady\\" expression. She also calls her vagina her \\"sex\\", as in \\"he touched my sex.\\" She was always begging him to forgive her/have sex with her (it was desperate and sad). He wanted to own her and she allowed herself to be purchased. He's a stalker but he's hot so its okay (pretty much a quote from the book). Plus, her ongoing internal conversations with the \\"inner goddess and subconscious\\" are among the most annoying aspects of the book.<br /><br />I read this for free and am very glad I didn't spend a dime on it. If you want to read it...read it for free. She changed the names, but it's just a Twilight erotic fanfic.
0553386794|1.0|Yuck. Unless you like a \\"story\\" that introduces characters just to torture them and kill them off, that seems to revolve around how many female characters can be raped in a single chapter and how many children can be brutally killed or maimed; then I'd suggest you pass on this mess.<br /><br />This story fails on so many levels not the least of which is as a story. There is a plethora of subplots, but no actual plot. There is no over riding or driving conflict to be resolved. The number of POVs is not overwhelming as much as it is needless. Since the story is being told in third person omniscient, there is no need to have POVs alternate.<br /><br />The story fails as a fantasy. It is derivative and over-borrowed elements, nothing new.<br /><br />If this really is supposedly based on the War of the Roses or \\"The Cousins War\\" as it was known, this even fails on that front. Comparisons of the Starks and Lannisters to the Yorks and Lancasters is made on tenuous grounds. The closest similarity is between the name Lannister and Lancaster. The Starks don't contest for the throne and have no connection to the Yorks except for Lady Stark's family's \\"river\\" connections.
B007P06DO0|5.0|Graceland wasn't Paul Simon's first brush with pan-cultural music, nor was it even his first commercial success with such. But unlike the Jamaican, Peruvian and Latin influences of earlier hits, the South African bedrock of Graceland was as much a political statement as it was a musical adventure.

0393316041|5.0|I've been putting this book a way for quite a while, thinking that it should be full of physical equations, hard to understand definitions, etc. In contrary, it turned out to be the most relaxed and interesting reading I've had in last few years. Mr. Feynman talks about his own life experience and explains what motivated him in science. The book reminds me of Daniil Granin's \\"The Bison\\", which is another great and controversial story about Russian geneticist Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky, published in 1987.<br /><br />I would undoubtedly recommend to read Feynman's book to anyone who does science, whether he/she is a student, teacher or thinking to start his or her PhD program. This book sets the bar for all researchers and in my opinion is much more useful and important for young generation than many of class books.

Despite the joy evident in the performances, as well as in the audience reception, South Africa was still in the grip of apartheid, future president Nelson Mandela was still in jail, and Robert Mugabe had yet to reveal his later ways. The controversy surrounding the album is as much a part of its historical legacy as the music itself. The box set's live and documentary material, insightful commentary and memorable peek into Simon's work process add color and depth to an already rich work of art. For the millions who already own the album, the extras are worth considering, as the light shed by the annotation and detail turns the star into a supernova. [©2012 Hyperbolium]

B004GYU16Y|3.0|There are three helpful customer descriptions of this film's versions - Theatrical, Extended, and Director's Cuts. They run 1:39:56, 1:40:58, and 1:43:59 etc.  But Amazon sells deluxe, unrated and limited versions, some blu-ray some not sure. Confused, I had to go elsewhere for clarification.  Here's what wicki has to say, just to clarify.  I wish the marketers would use the producer's terms or the product listing was up front about the versions.<br /><br />Versions<br /><br />Director Phillip Noyce has said that due to the extensive usage of flashbacks, \\"there was always going to be a mountain of alternative material that would not fit into the theatrical version.\\"[32] The film ended up having two extra versions, the Director's Cut and the Extended Cut - which Noyce refers to in his audio commentary as the film's original cut - both included on the DVD and Blu-ray deluxe editions.[33]<br /><br />The Director's Cut was described by Noyce as \\"my own personal take on the material, free from the politics and restrictions of producers, studio or censorship ratings.\\"[32] Four minutes of film are added, leading to a running time of 104 minutes.[33] More flashbacks are added, and the violence is amped up - for example Mike being drowned rather than shot to death.[34] The ending is also different: in the bunker scene, Winter shoots the President instead of only knocking him unconscious,[10][32] and a media report during the final scene reports that the new US President had been orphaned on a family visit to Russia, implying he is also a sleeper agent.[35] Noyce has described this ending as \\"an ending yet just a beginning -- and it's an ending that turns the whole story on its head\\".[34]<br /><br />The Extended Cut increases the running time by only one minute, but rewrites the plot by removing, rearranging and adding scenes.[33] The ending has Salt escaping custody from the CIA and going to Russia, where she kills Orlov - his death scene at the barge does not appear in thiscut - and destroys the facility where new child spies are being trained.[35]

I had to read this book for uni but I was greatly surprised and I recommend for anyone who has even a slight interest in I.T or business.  What a surprise package.

I'm horrible at reviewing things other than \\"Yessir, I liked it\\" or \\"Nosir, I don't/didn't like it\\".  5 stars, I liked it very very very very very much.

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|James Watkins' \\"The Woman In Black\\" is a superb, bone-chilling return to the freezy tradition of Hammer Studios.  Daniel Radcliffe (of \\"Harry Potter\\" fame) turns in a fine performance as London lawyer Arthur Kipps.  An impoverished father haunted by the loss of his wife during childbirth, his employer gives him a make-or-break assignment by sending him to the remote village of Cryphin Gifford to examine the documentation of the Eel Marsh House that belonged to the recently deceased Mrs. Drablow.<br /><br />Mrs. Drawblow was a disturbed woman.  Her child was lost tragically, not unlike the protagonists', by drowning in a marsh.  The locals are particularly unreceptive to Mr. Kipps' presence and he is shunned by all but one man, determined to help him see the job through.<br /><br />The pacing and atmosphere of this movie are damn near perfect.  Reminiscent of much of Hammer's later work ([[ASIN:B000TUDBGG From Beyond the Grave]]), the cobwebs and impoverished area add to the suspense.  What really clinched it for me were the scenes in which Kipps is alone in Mrs. Drablow's house and reads her letters, the scary voice overdubbing and the creepy puppets moving all at the same time.  One thinks of a malevolent Emily Dickinson or something, it's just really fantastic.<br /><br />The only problem I had was with the ending.  While I won't spoil it for anyone, they should have let it happen raw without the fluffernutter.  That said, this is recommended for anyone who still cherishes Hammer's legacy, and just a fantastic horror film amongst the dross.

030758836X|5.0|We've all read the stories in newspapers - a woman goes missing and the husband is the prime suspect. And he loudly proclaims his innocence....even as the evidence mounts....<br /><br />Gillian Flynn put her own spin on this idea in her latest book - Gone Girl.<br /><br />It is the day of Nick and Amy's fifth anniversary. It is also the day Amy disappears. Left behind - the first cryptic clue in a treasure hunt Amy always sets up for Nick.<br /><br />The first part of Gone Girl is told in alternating chapters from Nick's present time viewpoint, with flashbacks to memories.  Amy's voice is heard from the pages of a diary, starting from seven years ago and building up to the day she disappears. The narratives each tell a completely different story. Who is telling the truth? The second part - well, I'm not going to spoil the plot for you, so I'll stop there.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of psychological thrillers and with Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn has crafted one of the best I've ever read. Really. The plot line is completely unpredictable. It's rare for me to be completely surprised at the direction a book takes, but I was this time. Flynn toys with us in a completely delicious and devious manner. You'll want to read carefully - there are lies, secrets and omissions scattered throughout the book and each revelation ratchets up the stakes just a little higher.<br /><br />While Gone Girl is a razor edged thriller, Flynn also explores marriage, attraction, family relationships and the media with that same sharp edged eye. Flynn's prose are are arresting, painting vivid images that crackle with intensity.<br /><br />\\"....the girl a man like Nick wants: the Cool Girl. Men always say that as the defining compliment, don't they? She's a cool girl. Being the cool girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she's hosting the world's biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want.\\"<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by Flynn, although I have since picked up her second book Dark Places. I loved the dedication to her husband....\\"What can I say about a man who knows how I think and still sleeps next to me with the lights off?\\"<br /><br />The buzz you've been hearing about Gone Girl? All true and more. This is THE book to read this summer. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

0743526937|5.0|\\"You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist\\" - Indira Gandhi<br />________________________________<br /><br />For a recent lecture on mediation, my professor spoke mostly on the simple art of negotiation which goes a long way in any type of dispute resolution- be it informally or formally- be it with your spouse at home, friends in school or colleagues at work. He recommended us to read 'Getting to Yes', which is a book written by researchers from Harvard in 1977. Despite it being published a long time ago, the topic is of current relevance today . It is worth reading for everyone- as 'negotiating' has become such an indispensable part of our life, but yet, not necessarily an easy one, and not one that goes accomplished as how we may want it to.<br /><br />\\"Although negotiation takes place every day, it is not easy to do well. Standard strategies for negotiation often leave people dissatisfied, worn out, or alienated -- and frequently all three.\\" - Getting to Yes<br /><br />We find then that some people choose either the soft or hard ways to negotiate. Often those who uses the soft way tries to avoid conflict at all cost; but yet in the end, this person always most often end up feeling exploited and used, the other probably take advantage of him and trample all over him, getting away with the better deal. On the other hand, we have those who like to play it hard, the natural aggressors who will not give in until he 'wins' it all.<br /><br />So, what is this book about?<br />This is where 'Getting to Yes' comes in handy- it explains ideals which are practical with clear real examples- which means it is not one of those books that talks beautifully about ideas detached from the reality of life. The authors introduces the third way of negotiating- that is the 'principled negotiation'- neither soft nor hard way. In a nutshell, this book is all about 'principled negotiation'- a method useful in many aspects of our day-to-day life. I feel that this method is extremely useful especially in today's litigious society, where for any fault/wrongs/misunderstandings, what comes to mind immediately is the thought of \\"'rights' and whether or not 'my rights are infringed', 'can I sue them'?\\" This book cleverly suggests us to look for mutual gains wherever possible, and that where interests conflict, we should insist that the result be based on some fair standards independent of the will of either side. This method of 'principled negotiation' is hard on the merits, soft on the people. Principled negotiation shows how one can obtain what they're entitled to and yet remain decent. It enables one to be fair while protecting oneself against those who would take advantage of that fairness.<br /><br />Why should I read this, what's in it for me?<br />For me, this book holds certain answers to questions that were never answered before- but questions which I never really pondered on for long, cos I'd dismiss it simply shrugging it of as 'that's just the way of life'. Or simply saying 'life is unfair' to myself.  But no- it's time to get up and see that there are simple key elements which holds the answers to many unanswered questions.<br /><br />1. Positional bargaining fails to meet the basic criteria of producing a wise agreement, efficiently and amicably. As more attention is paid to positions, less attention is devoted to meeting the underlying concerns of the parties. Agreement becomes less likely.<br />2. Learn the basic elements of principled negotiation -<br />People: Separate the people from the problem.<br />Interests: Focus on interests, not positions.<br />Options: Generate a variety of possibilities/options for mutual gains before deciding what to do.<br />Criteria: Insist that the result be based on some objective criteria/standard.<br /><br />Who is this book for?<br />\\"Principled negotiation can be used by United States diplomats in arms control talks with the Soviet Union, by Wall Street lawyers representing Fortune 500 companies inantitrust cases, and by couples in deciding everything from where to go for vacation to how to divide their property if they get divorced. Anyone can use this method.\\" - Getting to Yes<br /><br />\\"Be persistent in pursuing your interests, but not rigid in pursuing any particular solution.\\"<br /><br />I wish I knew about this book sooner!
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Even in paradise there are snakes in the grass. When Navy SEAL Lt. Commander Steve McGarrett is lured back home to O'ahu in pursuit of his father's murder, he's tapped by the governor to head up a newly established task force assigned to take on Hawaii's nastiest crimes. Never mind that McGarrett, at first, only goes along with it because it expedites his ongoing investigation. McGarrett's persistent digging into his father's murder proves to be a recurring sub-plot that threads thru all of Season One. But this hyper reimagining of HAWAII FIVE-O is so much more than about one man's obsession.<br /><br />Still, one decider is that the governor promises McGarrett full immunity and no red tape. McGarrett, you'll quickly observe, is like a bull in a china shop. It's what makes him fun. He's an intense, unapologetic man of action even more so than he's an investigator. Episodes are often fueled by McGarrett's wild, headstrong impulses, and this, along with his dynamic physicality, adds an electrifying element that's very much absent from the other, more plodding police procedurals. It's a good thing the Commander runs into his new partner, Danny Williams. Danny, six months out of Jersey PD and flaunting that abrasive, smart-alecky Jersey 'tude, is actually the more by-the-book detective. Danny (or &#34;Danno&#34;) and McGarrett immediately get on like pork sausage and a Vegan.<br /><br />Apart from the unforgettable, driving theme song and &#34;Book 'em, Danno!&#34; and Jack Lord's glorious hair and that it originated a slang word for &#34;cop,&#34; I don't remember much about the original series. I certainly don't remember the original McGarrett and Danno sharing this same tremendous chemistry. In every episode, this McGarrett and Danno engage in awesome banter and bickering and mocking, lots and lots of mocking. The scenes between Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan are what truly sells the show for me. They are so much fun and dictate the tone of the show. But, no worries, HAWAII FIVE-O trots out other elements that compel you to tune in like an addict. And I don't just mean the snark and the swagger and the laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />Daniel Dae Kim (LOST) and Grace Park (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA) make fantastic additions to the show, respectively playing disgraced cop Chin Ho Kelly and sexy ex-pro surfer and now rookie cop (and Chin Ho's cousin) Kono Kalakaua. Yeah, Kono is now a girl. Just like Boomer is now a girl. I love that the show explores Chin Ho and Kono's family ties and personal lives. In fact, the personal lives of all four characters comprise huge chunks of the episodes, something that didn't happen in the original series. And I'm a sucker for Danno's sweet interactions with his young daughter Monkey- er, Gracie. But, for Chin Ho Kelly, yeah, it's a pretty painful backstory.<br /><br />HAWAII FIVE-O is in large part forensics and police procedural. What elevates it above the rest of its genre competition is that it's an explosive action-adventure series as well; McGarrett tends to shoot first, ask questions later, and then shoot some more. Each episode also doubles as a lush travelogue reel of Hawaii, with each exterior shot serving as an inviting postcard. I wouldn't at all be surprised if tourism has shot up in the Aloha State since HAWAII FIVE-0 premiered. The gorgeous backdrops lend a vibrancy, inject an energy. You could say the state of Hawaii is the show's fifth major character.<br /><br />Although this incarnation separates itself from the original and rapidly constructs its own mythology, familiar names and themes crop up. Looming large is the presence of Wo Fat (Mark Dacascos), a remorseless crime lord who once more becomes the show's big bad. And don't be surprised if actors from the original show surface here.<br /><br />There's always that striking disconnect that hits you whenever you watch shady stuff going down in bright, sun-drenched environs. The Five-O unit routinely navigates paradise's underbelly,tangles with the more exotic sorts of crooks (high seas pirates, Samoan gangs, the Yakuza). There's that one case the Five-O had to solve while under the duress of an impending tsunami (in &#34;Kai E'e&#34;). And how about the charred corpse that was uncovered in the fire pit of a luau (&#34;Mana'o&#34;)? &#34;Ke kinohi&#34; is a volatile episode which provides impetus to McGarrett's ongoing investigation of his father's murder. &#34;E Malama&#34; isolates and showcases each member of the Five-O unit even as a federal witness, hunted by the cartel, races against the clock to testify at the courthouse. As a comic book fan, I always appreciate these shows' stabs at featuring comic cons, and &#34;Ne Me'e Laua Na Paio&#34; is a good 'un. &#34;Oia'i'o&#34; is the highly charged season finale that sends shockwaves rippling thru the Five-O team.<br /><br />This show has raked in such good buzz that A-list guest stars have flocked in. James Marsters (Spike from BUFFY and ANGEL), Kevin Sorbo, Dane Cook, Masi Oka (HEROES), Rick Springfield, and a surprisingly good Sean &#34;P. Diddy&#34; Combs are only a few of the recognizable names. And so why don't you catch the wave as well, brah? In what other detective show can you eyeball crimesolvers solving crimes in shorts and flip flops? If you're tired of the old forensics cops and robbers programming, give this a try. Thomas Magnum would want you to. So would his mustache. So would Jack Lord's hair.

0143038419|5.0|After I began reading this book, I asked my best friend if she read the book or saw the film, she said she was bored with the film after half an hour.<br />I didn't see the film but I'd like to say, I loved the book,even though some parts in the India part (really short, as it seems to me now) looked lengthy.<br />The reason why I loved the book is that I could totally relate to it, I also went through divorce, some of the things that the heroine felt or sought for are close to me, she even inspired me and gave food for thought.<br />Maybe, for someone who didn't go through the same it didn't seem as interesting or \\"close\\" but for me it was one of the best books I've read lately and usually I'm very capricious with fiction. So, I would like to thank you Ms.Elizabeth Gilbert for telling us her story which gives hope and which inspires, that maybe it will be ok but we must work for it and not give up. Thank you

0553801473|5.0|This morning I finished the last page of A Dance With Dragons and am left with an empty hole to fill. There a few writers that can spin this kind of epic fantasy stories without falling into cliche. My previous favorites like Raymond Feist and David Eddings are great and easy readings but they don't \\"influence\\" me like A Song of Ice and Fire or Lord of the Rings. A Dance With Dragons, like it's predecessors is not to be taken lightly. One does not simply read these books... Martin takes a wondrous children tale, shakes out the wizards and the black-and-white moral that forms the foundation of fantasy since Tolkien and describes a bleak, cold world filled with people in all shades of grey. The greyness only adds to the depth of the characters. Like reality, this is not a simple story of good vs evil. Rape is common, as is torture and decease is rife. You better not be lowborn in Westeros or you can look forward to fight for your life, virtue and/or possessions almost every day. The \\"real\\" dark ages weren't any different though so you can't blame Martin for depicting a realistic setting.<br /><br />It is the constantly changing storyline that makes the books so attractive. Nothing and nobody is spared failure. Ned Stark, one of the main characters in a game of Thrones has been killed which started a war that soon took precedent over the supernatural threat from the North. Even after five books the white walkers remain mysterious. Daenerys Targaryen is losing control of her dragons and finds out that there is more to being a dragon queen then just sit on a throne and rule. Jon is having trouble on the wall. Tyrion is as cunning as ever but finds himself in dire straits after being accused of killing his nephew and actually killing his father. He remains himself though and always knows how to make the best of a situation. Even Cersei finds that despite cunningly building her power-base for thousands of pages, it just takes a paragraph to change it. Nothing is sacred andas a reader you better not get too attached to any character in the book.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fairytale with elves and bearded dwarves and a magical ending, look elsewhere. If you like your dwarves without a nose and a grim story where courageous people fight and sometimes die, with endless intrigue and power struggles and twists and turns where you least expect it, invest some time and read this book. Be prepared to wait a few years for the next volume though as this one took 6 years!

Things start off routinely enough... but, after a bit, things become anything but routine.<br /><br />MOON is a perfect movie for DVD purchase... you can watch it again and again - indeed, you really need to watch it several times to pick up on all the subtle nuances.
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />On the surface, the American version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' directed by David Fincher, has a lot going for it. Despite the slow exposition, the story picks up when Daniel Craig as journalist-investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist, is hired by Swedish magnate, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve the mystery of the disappearance of Vanger's beloved niece, Harriet, who vanished from the family compound forty years earlier in 1966.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film is how Blomkvist, with the assistance of Goth-like computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander, partially solves the mystery, mainly by discovering clues buried in old photos taken at the time of Harriet's disappearance. One is reminded of Antonioni's 1966 film 'Blowup', which was released in the same year the murder mystery in 'Tattoo' is supposed to take place.<br /><br />There are other well done scenes in 'Tattoo', particularly the harrowing rape scenes where Lisbeth is violated by her court appointed guardian and later when she turns the tables on him, an example of vigilante justice. Equally as gripping is when Blomkvist is imprisoned by Vanger's serial-killer nephew, Martin, who tortures the journalist but is saved by Salander, who arrives in the nick of time.<br /><br />The acting is mostly excellent, including Rooney Mara, who plays the glum, rebellious 'damaged goods' ward of the state, with aplomb as well as the always solid Christopher Plummer. The bad guys are equally as menacing--only Daniel Craig, seems out of place, as he doesn't seem like he's from Scandinavia. To be fair to Craig, the script saddles him with a rather deadpan part, with Blomkvist the least interesting of the principal players. One unfortunate shortcoming in the Hollywood version is that there's mention of a number of characters with a 'Nazi' past, but the nature of that connection is never explored in any detail whatsoever.<br /><br />Despite a thriller that keeps one's interest to the end, nagging questions remain which tend to lessen the film's overall impact. For starters, we find out little about the nature of the lawsuit, which Blomkvist loses at the beginning of the film. Why is the crooked businessmen, Wennerstr&ouml;m, so evil? Vanger seems to think so, and promises to give Blomkvist the evidence once he completes his assignment. But Blomkvist tells Vanger at film's end that the 'evidence' is meaningless and we never find out what it's about. I realize that in a film such as this, which is already quite long, the scenarists don't really have a lot of time to explain all the, but still, the reason why the whole story is put in motion is principally due to the main character losing this lawsuit. And when Lisbeth hacks into Wennerstr&ouml;m's computers and steals all his millions, do we really care? And do we really care when he's murdered? In reality, Wennerstr&ouml;m is really a cypher of a character.<br /><br />I also wonder why Vanger hires Blomkvist in the first place. Wouldn't he have done better to have hired a private investigator or someone involved closer to law enforcement? I realize Blomkvist is an investigative reporter but he's also the co-owner of a hip magazine--hardly the type of person to take on such an assignment. Yes, of course, he's just lost his life savings and he's desperate but the entire arrangements seems a bit odd. There's also the issue of Blomkvist's competency--he's just lost that lawsuit and even though Vanger likes the idea that he opposed Wennerstr&ouml;m (who's a long term rival), the fact that he made accusations without proof, wouldn't have impressed a real life Vanger, who would have probably gone for someone whose past, in contrast, was squeaky clean.<br /><br />Even if one is willing to suspend one's disbelief regarding Blomkvist taking on Vanger's proposal, the whole idea that the brilliant Lisbeth would allow herself to fall into her evil guardian'sclutches more than once, seems pretty incredible. Just like Blomkvist, who stupidly \\"miscalculated\\" about the lawsuit, Lisbeth admits to misjudging just how sick (as she puts it) Guardian Bjurman really is. And what about Lisbeth running out of money? Wasn't she paid a fair amount by Vanger to investigate Blomkvist before he hires him? You would have thought she would have had some money left over to the buy that new computer. And since she's so clever, why couldn't she just go out and get another freelance assignment to pay the bills, instead of relying on her pervert guardian? If she's smart enough to steal three billion dollars from a mega-rich businessmen, couldn't she have hacked into a lesser fry criminal early on, put a few bucks into her account, and avoided being dependent on Bjurman?<br /><br />Regarding Lisbeth, there were a couple of other things that seemed a little 'too easy'--for example, Martin forgetting to lock the doors behind him when he went downstairs to torture Blomkvist. Lisbeth just walks right into the house (no alarm is triggered to warn hi-tech guru, Martin) and she then all too easily slips into Martin's torture chamber and saves Blomkvist from a horrible death. And wasn't it sort of a little too easy for Lisbeth, to hack into Wennerstr&ouml;m's accounts? But this is Hollywood, so anything can happen, no?<br /><br />Finally, I was curious about Vanger's assumption that Harriet had been murdered. He states that Harriet couldn't have gotten off the island since none of the boats had been used and the police had prevented everyone from leaving. But the next day, the police relented...SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD...and that's exactly how Harriet escaped--in the trunk of her cousin Anita's car, who had helped her. Why didn't this scenario occur to Vanger? Had he followed through on such an assumption, of course there would have been no movie!<br /><br />If you're not too picky about Tattoo's contrivances, you may find yourself enjoying this tale of suspense. For more critical and/or discerning viewers, you may end up with the conclusion that this is by no means a masterpiece.han once, seems pretty incredible.

B0087UN94E|4.0|One of the things I love about Neil is: If you don't like his latest album, just wait for next year's release. In fact, this year, we get two Neil Young and Crazy Horse albums. So you'll only have to wait a few months for more Neil. After several listens over several days I want to share my thoughts. Is this a great Neil Young album? In a word no. Is it a bad Neil Young album? Not even! This Album Is Pretty Good. Americana is comprised of covers of public domain songs performed by the band, who sound like they're having a blast. The production is very raw and visceral. Definitely not the way I learned these songs. It stands in bold contrast to Le Noise which was heavily polished by Dan Lanois. For me, some of the song choices were completely unexpected. I believe there is a purpose to the song choices and order (I'll let you figure out the commentary). The songs may be Americana, but the performance is pure Rock & Roll. Put simply, this is (To quote Neil) \\"the third best garage band in the world\\" ripping up some old American standards.  My only complaint is paying full rip for public domain works but I'm guessing that's why the videos are included. For you one star complainers out there, I'd suggest you examine why you buy music in 2012 and expect it to sound like the 1970's? Remember when you were passionate about music? When you listened for the excitement? Stop asking Artists to make the same album over and over again, you'll only be disappointed. It's OK if you want musical pablum, just don't expect Neil to serve it to you.

0071762345|4.0|I'm heading the marketing at a small business and was looking for something to give me ideas of how to use facebook and twitter better. We already have pages on each of these sites but I wanted improvement. Also, I am quite familiar with how facebook works. This book still gave me some great ideas and info. Yes, the author drops numerous hints about his company, but I didn't find it too intrusive, and there was only one time I skipped a few paragraphs about it. A piece of advice I'd add that's not in the book is to network with other similar pages on facebook in your industry (i.e. If you're a security system company, like some gun clubs, etc.), so when you do promotions, or want to join the conversation you can post in these groups as well. Overall the book was great, definitely not a silver bullet, but a silver bullet in marketing doesn't exist anyways.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'll admit it - I enjoy a nice spicy book and I'm not a prude.  Okay, so knowing that about me, you might assume that I liked this book - right?  WRONG.  My Kindle Fire told me I made it to 25% (labored would be the word I would choose).  I had no connection to either character and felt the writing was hokey and forced.  Lucky thing for the author that there was so much hype surrounding this book, because her writing skills are sadly lacking.

0307951529|3.0|Actually 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me rate it that way.<br /><br />First and foremost, I am a fan of Chris' work.  This book is inspiring in that it can help you think a little more creatively about how you can start something for yourself.  There's a lot of different industries and ideas discussed through numerous case studies.  Chris' writing style is casual and very easy to read.  As for the title - eh, come on - it should be obvious that the title is marketing ploy.<br /><br />The thing that seems to be 'missing' though is that little information is given on what exactly happened between the \\"idea\\" and \\"money coming in\\".  Also some knowledge on the background of the people would be nice - were they in that particular field before, was a network already established - things of that nature. There's some basic information on how to go about starting a business, but be mindful that it is very basic and not an in-depth discussion. Chris has it right though when he suggests to test your idea simply first before diving all in.<br /><br />In my experience no business just starts up off a brainstorm and instantly becomes crazy profitable.  We all love to hear stories about that and it can be done - but the path to that takes some time after groundwork is laid.  It still requires geniune work and planning.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|This book grabbed me quickly and I could not put it down. It was a fast and furious ride.  I did not stop reading until it was finished.  I complete a book every other day, sometimes every day.. so characters and plots have a tendency of running together... and I might be 1/2 way through a book before I realize I've already read it.. but not in this case.  This story will stick with me for awhile.  I keep checking to see if the author has written another book, but it will be hard to top this one.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I thought this was going to be like most kindle apps, that aren't games, simple and short lived on my device.<br />I couldn't have been more wrong. This is an amazing little app, with features that take about 5 minutes to fully figure out. the placing of nodes and then the placing of markers for the nodes to play, all on a tonnally scaled platform; then you get to choose the speed, proximity, and gravity. it's beautifully simple and complicated at the same time. as an adult I am intrigued by the combinations and possibilities, my young children love moving things around and playing the &quot;background&quot; notes.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I had previously read Gillian Flynn's first book \\"Sharp Objects\\" and enjoyed it. I saw a pre-release review of Gone Girl in The New York Times and it sounded intriguing. The book starts slowly telling the story of a marriage from the point of view of Amy (writing in a diary started seven years ago) and Nick (writing from the point of view of today coming home and finding Amy missing under mysterious circumstances). The difference is interesting because it shows a love affair, marriage, and the current situation where each person involved sees something different.<br /><br />I really don't want to say more as I am afraid that I will inadvertently include spoilers. Let's just say that the book builds to an exciting climax. I can see the point of those who would prefer a different ending, but upon reflection I don't see how it could have ended any better.<br /><br />I am about to go read Ms. Flynns \\"Dark Places\\", a book that I somehow had overlooked.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this book.

B000005RFL|5.0|A departure point for the band, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath has long divided their critics, but united Black Sabbath fans who almost universally love the album.  This is one of their most popular titles, sometimes because of, and sometimes in spite of the experimentation it presents.<br /><br />Tony Iommi still offers some of heavy metal's most classic riffs here, like on the title track and Killing Yourself to Live.  However, the laid back hard rock of A National Acrobat and Looking For Today, plus the upbeat rock n' roll of Sabbra Caddabra, show Iommi's growing versatility in the craft of songwriting.<br /><br />Also used prominently for the first time on a Sabbath album is the use of keyboards, like on the track Who Are You?, which takes a trademark heavy Iommi riff and translates it on a synthesizer.  Also, the keyboards give songs like Sabbra Cadabra, Looking For Today, and Spiral Architect a far more contemporary rock feel than any previous Sabbath tunes.<br /><br />This album might not have as dark a tone as the first four, but that prevented Sabbath from becoming caricatures.

A man lies dying in a bed with a serpent wrapped around his neck, naked demons hovering above him, the number 666 on the headboard, and a huge skull with webbed hands looking down.

It's definitely an album any serious rock or heavy metal fan should have.ould have.
B005FMFCSI|5.0|This book was originally released in 2001, and caught my attention as I felt caught up in the chaos of Christmas. While later it became more popular through the release of \\"Christmas with the Kranks,\\" I really enjoyed this simpler book version. It was not intended to be slapstick, it was instead intended to look inside and beneath all of the rituals that we go through at Christmas.<br /><br />In this tender tale, Luther and Nora (well, mostly Luther) try to escape the chaos by planning a trip to the Caribbean by using all of the money they will save by NOT having Christmas at home. After all, their daughter is gone and it is just them.<br /><br />However, the world around them finds it difficult to accept their decision and each individual tries to pressure them into meeting their expectations.<br /><br />With a funny and yet loving and caring ending, we discover that Christmas is about a lot more than just the hoopla that surrounds it.<br /><br />I reread this book every year around Thanksgiving. It reminds me to keep my expectations focused and in check.

0345803485|1.0|Sorry folks I was very disappointed.  The plot was very weak, the character were<br /><br />not very interesting and basically it was a weak romantic novel with a lot of<br /><br />graphic sex.  Not my cup of tea!

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|While we wait for the release of Season Two on Blu Ray, to which, I'm disgusted by the release date, bein' that it'll release just two weeks before Season 3, I must say, I love this show.  I really love zombies and they're really doin' a good job with this.  Season 2 needs to be released in July though.
0345803485|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and couldn't wait for the second and third. The characters were well described by the author which brought them to life for me and the story wasn't just about sex.  She told an interesting story that left me intrigued and wanting to learn more about each of them, especially Christian and his past. I'm totally looking forward to the movie. Hope it doesn't disappoint as some movies based on good books do.

B004HO6I2E|5.0|THE CHANGE-UP is one of the most hilarious movies I've seen. Yet, the critics say that this movie is 'lousy'. Maybe some people just don't have a good sense of humor. I watched this movie with my two daughters and we had to pause it numerous times because we were laughing so much and didn't want to miss anything.<br /><br />Everyone has their own opinions and that's fine. My opinion is that this is a 5 star comedy and I loved it.

B001TAJGO6|3.0|Women love this movie.  I'm a guy, an old guy and a smart guy, and it seemed like I was on LSD watching this film.  Or perhaps I should have been.  Must say that Carrey was good as ever, and Winslett superb, as always, and so beautiful.  The ending was very \\"nice,\\" (a word both characters are fond of saying).  The beginning was \\"nice\\" too.  It's the middle part that blew my mind, threw me for a loop, and got me in a tizzy.  You've been warned.

0385528752|5.0|\\"Switch - How to Change Things When Change is Hard\\" is an exceptional book with information that can be applied immediately to a problem area.  The authors base the entire book on the unlikely illustration of a man riding an elephant down a path that is no longer the desired destination.  The key question is how do you, as an outsider (or a consultant) institute change so that the elephant gets turned around and headed down the correct path?<br /><br />Using dozens of actual story examples, the authors examine each element involved in the process.  When do you appeal to the rider (the intellectual center) and what does that look like?  The middle segment of the book considers the elephant (the workhorse that is stirred by emotion) and the final section targets shaping the path in a way that is clear and attainable.  The book summarizes these sections as<br /><br />I. Direct the Rider:- Find the bright spots - Script the critical moves - Point to the destination<br /><br />II. Motivate the Elephant:- Find the feeling - Shrink the Change - Grow your people<br /><br />III. Shape the Path:- Tweak the environment - Build habits - Rally the herd<br /><br />The reason I would like to give this book 6 stars is because I was able to apply the information to personal situations where I found myself struggling and was able to immediately identify and remedy the problem.  I have also used this picture to evaluate work situations in order to enact change. It is seldom that one is truly able to read a book and make a difference by applying the information, but this is exactly such a book.

B00395ZYVS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and especially the writer's style.  I love reading a book that teaches me something new.  The journey was heart-wrenching and I kept changing my feelings on how I wanted the story to end.  I recommended this book to many of my friends who also thoroughly enjoyed it.  Will be looking for more written by this author.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a perfect game for any occasion. it works very well on the kindle fire. sometimes it dose glitches, but its nothing major.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I am sick of the predictable fantasy stories. This book does NOT fall into that category at all! It was such a refreshing read. Just when you thought you had it all figured out, something else would come out of nowhere and change your entire perspective on the book! I loved how the characters made it all seem so real, like that was actually going on somewhere out in the world. I highly recommend this book, it did not disappoint at all! Can't wait to see more books from this author she is great :)
B0086700CM|5.0|It is very easy to understand, loads great,  and always very fun to play.  My whole family loves to play this.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|One of my all-time favorite classics and a book I have read endlessly and will read many times more, so am delighted to have this on my Kindle as well as having several print copies around.  It means I can dip into it any time the mood takes me.  And it took me there this weekend so it was great to just curl up and relive the magic.<br /><br />I just love Jane Austen's language, her wry wit and acute social observations.  This should be compulsory reading for everyone!  What's not to like?
1401235417|5.0|I recently had the opportunity to get my hands on the New 52 relaunch of Batman, Court of Owls graphic novel. All I can say is wow. One hundred percent. Across the board. Total fanboy homerun in my opinion. This is great news considering I also had a chance to check out the New 52 [[ASIN:1401235077 Animal Man Vol. 1: The Hunt (The New 52)]], which was a trainwreck, in my opinion.<br /><br />But back to the Dark Knight.<br /><br />Court of Owls is a compelling story with terrific art. From the opening pages, the art and story team hook the reader and reel them in. Hard. There is so much that I'd like to comment on but there were so many cool surprises, I'm hesitant to go too deep into details. I enjoyed this book so much, that I would hate to spoil some of those reveals that just took me by complete surprise. The way the plot spun out, to the way the story was presented visually... it all kept me on the edge of my seat. The bonus features at the end of this compilation include alternate covers and a great analysis of one of the early scenes.<br /><br />I will confess that Bruce appeared to be drawn kind of young. Especially for this guy who has trained several young 'wards'. But Court of Owls a great addition to the Batman legacy and leaves you wanting more. Which, truly, is a mark of a great story no matter what the format. If you're a Batman fan, you've likely already grabbed this one. If you've held off for some reason, don't wait. Go and get it, now.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|When I began reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I thought surely the character would mature as I read on. Not so! All the hype praising this book alarms me..... what is the average reader thinking?  OMG, let's not even go there. Have we come to the point when we don't appreciate a writer who inspires one to re-read a paragraph simply for the pleasure of the words joining together in a beautiful harmony?
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|What a mess this movie is. It's not a prequel to the first Alien movie as most people think, so did I, but rather a re-boot. Even so, I had such high hopes and was looking forward to seeing it. It does have some truly excellent visuals and the story-line had great potential but it falls flat, and quickly. Here are just a few examples from many<br /><br />*****Spoilers Ahead*****<br /><br />On the alien moon the ship's crew enters one of the `pyramid' rooms which is really inside one of the Engineer's ships. David the android makes a quick comment that the atmosphere is `clean', and pretty soon everyone is taking off their helmets. This would never happen, especially with supposed field professionals; they only know about the air in one room. There's no regard for pathogens, no regard for trapped gases that are toxic and other things that might not show up on routine tests. This scene shows the incredible ignorance of the writer and Scott. Any team would first search and test thoroughly EVERY room before even thinking about removing their helmets.<br /><br />The Geologist and Biologist, oh my, the horrible writing behind these two. These guys are in the movie only to be killed and to provide Abbott and Costello style comic relief. First when they encounter a dead alien body they suddenly transform into whiny little girls- just awful. Then later while possessing a 3-D map of the whole area and being in contact with the Captain who also has a 3-D map (of a ship that's U-shaped!) these two somehow `get lost'- ridiculous. Finally the pair encounter a hissing snake-like alien that is OBVIOUSLY dangerous, but suddenly they've lost all fear (and intelligence) and proceed to try and play kissy face with the monster- then they get attacked and die- unforgivably bad writing<br /><br />The Engineer aliens themselves. This race is supposed to be an incredibly advanced people but when the crew finally encounters one he acts like a mindless rhino. Oh and the `Engineers' play little flutes to startup their ships- seriously. In the end Mr. super advanced engineer guy tries to fly away but the cartoon characters left piloting the Prometheus decide to ram his ship. So super advanced Engineer with his super advanced ship can't detect, evade, or stop this ramming and down he goes. His reaction is priceless, he knows there are other Engineer ships he can use, and perhaps even other survivors of his race but instead like a big moron he runs after our young Sigourney Weaver clone with the intention of killing her with his fists! Bad, bad, just bad<br /><br />How to get an Alien creature: so to get an Alien creature like in the other movies it appears there's a whole new process: first a human male must be infected with a near magical bio weapon black ooze. Then he must have sex and impregnate a human woman who in turn must give birth to a squid creature who then must parasitically infect an Engineer alien. Stir it all up with an exploding Engineer torso and 'B-L-A-M-O' you have the acid blood Alien we all know and love.<br /><br />This movie is a friggin mess complete with infantile dialog and derivative cartoon characters that insult the audience and expose the writer and director, with this project anyway, as being both incompetent and out of touch.

0752890069|4.0|A crime who-done-it with grizzled detective, a partner with a humane touch, and a love interest with a history. Interesting plot convoluted with false leads, red herrings, and the threat of massive chemical destruction. Detective Harry Bosch will not be distracted from his mission to find a murderer, despite insider politics and the typical conflict between local and federal law enforcement. Bosch filters clues and information, pushes aside concerns of the scientific communication and hones in on the facts of his homicide investigation. Well written and a good read.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a positive transaction. I purchased the e book for my amazon kindle fire and got it immediately after the purchase. I haven't had any issues with it. This was a good buy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book merely out of curiousity. On my Facebook page I saw grown women just gushing about this book and in the same respect I saw people write terrible remarks about it. So being the kind of person I am, I had to quell my need to know for myself and went out and actually paid almost $13.00 for this book. I would have been better off using that to put towards my outrageous weekly tank of gas. Anyway, I have to agree with most of the negative reviews I read. I honestly tried to find something redeeming in the book, but I could not. I didn't think a book could be more of a waste of time than Twilight was, but this book topped it. From the point of view of the main character, Anastasia Steele, it would appear she is more of a teenager than a twenty one year old woman who is attending college. I am not a critic or someone who reviews books professionally, so I have no idea how to completely break the book down to all it's faults. All I can say is it seems highly immature, even when the sex scenes are taking place, there is a highly immature school girlish description of events. No offense to anyone, but honestly if I meet a man who shows me his Red Room of Pain, I am hightailing it out of there ASAP! Especially if I am a gorgeous 21 year old virgin who has never been kissed. It is safe to say I would NOT recommend this book to anyone. I wanted to either throw it or myself (for having paid for this book) out of a window. I would like to thank E.L. James though for inspiring me. You see if she could write this gobbledygook and make a ton of money off of it (plus from my understanding they are making a movie off of it, so there is even more money)well then hell most of us stand a chance of doing just the same. It saddens me though that there are truly gifted writers out there, busting their butts everyday working 9-5 jobs and writing on the side and trying to make a living out of it and can't seem too. Yet there is this person who wrote a book that is 50 shadesof crap and got a paycheck for it.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is my first Amazon book review and I have been a Kindle owner since 1st gen! This book is BY FAR one of the best books I've ever read. My family and friends will tell you that is a high honor, considering how many books I own and have read.<br /><br />This is basically a smarter, savvier, and well-educated Twilight for adults. The best part is, VAMPIRES DON'T SPARKLE. Diana is a young late 20's Oxford-doctorate professor of history who loves to work out. However, she comes from a long line of powerful Salem witches, which she tries to forget and shuns her magic. She is on sabbatical, studying the history alchemy, the medieval search for turning other metals into gold. Diana then mysteriously happens to pull a magical book from the Oxford library archives. She plays off the magical-ness and puts in back in the archives.<br /><br />Cue in all supernatural beings. Vampires, witches, daemons...and thankfully no werewolves. And the vampire is so much less moody and morose than Edward. (Did I mention he doesn't sparkle) I will let you find out more on your own....the plot is great, but I hate it when reviews spoil it too much.<br /><br />Suffice to say the best part about this book for me, was the level of education in this novel. This is NOT your typical paranormal romance or YA fiction, for which I deeply appreciate! It's set in Oxford as well as France, which is a nice change of pace. This novel includes romance, history, paranormal lore, and even science!!<br /><br />Bottom line: GET THIS BOOK. You won't regret it.
B0086700CM|5.0|very fun and addicting game. had it only a few minutes and I agree I can 't stop playing now.
B004GIR0BE|3.0|The premise of \\"Arlington Road\\" is pretty good.  The neighbors seem suspicious, but surely they are not really involved in terrorist activity...or are they?  The problem is that you are bludgeoned with the probable answer throughout the movie.  However, there turns out to be a little bit more to it than that, and I must admit, I didn't see the final twist until the very end (but my husband saw it coming almost from the beginning).<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that most things are too obvious and predictable, and Jeff Bridges's character constantly does stuff that doesn't make sense.  In fact, there were many points that challenge reality, and that really detracts from the enjoyability of a movie.<br /><br />However, if you can ignore that, it's a watchable movie, and it might even make you think a little bit.

B005COO1X6|3.0|Not my favorite Stephen King story - a little too farfetched. I can't really say more without giving away the story but this one was way out there.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|There are plenty of positive reviews of \\"Hocus Pocus\\" out there, so I'll get straight to the point.  This movie is perfect Halloween entertainment for children because it has all the icons with no real terrors.<br /><br />After the brief 17th Century backstory, we see the protagonists in school in Salem on the day of Halloween hearing witch stories from the teacher.  The bicycle ride through the leaf strewn autumn woods that afternoon reminds one of many such days.  The scenes of the boy and his girlfriend taking his little sister Trick or Treating that night with flaming jack o'lanterns and other decorations in abundance is beautifully arresting.<br /><br />As for the 3 witches, notwithstanding their wicked intentions, Sarah Jessica makes for wonderful eye candy, Bette does a terrific rendition of \\"I Put a Spell on You\\", and Kathy is hilarious when she meets a hen-pecked husband dressed in a devil costume and believes that it is her master Satan offering her a Clark Bar.  Even the zombie is right out of your standard amusement park haunted house ride.  And the puns are a riot: Zombie to Bette, \\"Go to hell.\\" Bette replies, \\"Been there, done that.\\"  Add the talking cat to the mix, and it's all wonderful fun, with a magnificent coda where the sun rises the next day and sends our witches to their final destination and the exhausted parents home after a night of non-stop bewitched dancing.<br /><br />I don't know whether there will be any extras on the Blue Disc version when it comes out, but I can only imagine how the Blue Disc treatment will serve to enhance the gorgeous photography.  That by itself would be worth the purchase.<br /><br />There are a few other kid friendly films I would recommend: Ernest Scared Stupid (on blue disc since last year), Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (due out on blue disc 09/04/12), It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown (also BD), The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad (DVD only), and The Devil and Daniel Webster (Criterion DVD only), but Hocus Pocus takes the Number One spot.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Good Reads Choice Award?  Are you kidding me???  Holy Crap this is the worst book I have ever written.  Double Crap I am so glad I didn't pay for it...a friend loaned it to me.

B007SGM084|2.0|I am in the queue at the library for these books but I think I am 612 on the list currently. I no longer wanted to wait so thought I would grab it for my kindle instead. After checking the price I have decided to just wait to get it from the library. Way too expensive for Kindle books. Especially since I can't lend it out to my friends afterwards. If I wanted to spend that kind of money I would at least want some ownership over what I purchase.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Wow!  This is a lavish, beautiful production with fantastic performances from the cast.  Ramin Karimloo makes both a scary and heartbreakingly sincere Phantom.  If you like this musical, you should love this 25th anniversary performance!
B008AG3PK8|5.0|There are certain lines delivered in this episode which are absolutely true and absolutely deadly.  I think creator Matthew Weiner had been saving these zingers all season for us.<br /><br />says Mrs. Lane Pryce to Don: \\"You should have never encouraged a man like that to be ambitious.\\"<br /><br />says Meagan's mother to Don: \\"She has the full artistic temperament with none of the artistic talent.\\" (we get to watch her screen test along with Don so there is no room for doubt).<br /><br />I don't want to ruin anything for anyone so I'll stop with those two but it is obviously truth telling time after another season of being with the Mad Men, who make their livings by creatively lying about everything.<br /><br />We also get a reminder of the radical effects of electroshock therapy in the 1960s.  It is used in serious depression cases.  It is still used today but without the radical side effects it had back then. Today's patient may be a little fuzzy about the edges afterwards but that is about it.  Not so in the fifties and sixties.<br /><br />All in all it is a satisfying conclusion to this season's Mad Men.  I am under the impression that all of the Mad Men will be increasingly unhappy with their domestic and family lives even though they will be wildly prosperous.  All of them will continue to experience divorce and huge rebellion from their children as was seen throughout the late sixties and early seventies. Fittingly enough, as we move closer to women's lib, some of the women in the series are doing better all the way around, especially those who are working. Peggy's and Joan's lives are coming together rather well.<br /><br />This is a much more reflective episode than last week's.  We couldn't have closed with last week's episode though.  It would have been too jarring.  As usual, my only regret is that it is over.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game rocks it is soo fun .I would. recommend this app to people who enjoy puzzles and anyone who loves challenges.
098478280X|5.0|This is an awesome book to guide to find job. We just need to follow this book step by step, then could get a job.
B000001ELL|3.0|Yeah, I've heard all of the complaints that everyone has with this album - they've gone too commercial, they've gone disco, this isn't the KISS that we're used to... and maybe some of it is true. What the heck, it's better than [[ASIN:B000001ELN \\"Unmasked\\"]] - but then, almost anything would be.<br /><br />It is different from their previous works - and it does have a little bit of a disco twist to it, especially the costumes. But there actually is some good stuff on this album - it might not be hard rock like [[ASIN:B000001EL5 \\"I Want You\\"]] or [[ASIN:B000001EL7 \\"Love Gun\\"]], and it'll never match the full-on hard rock guitar-ripping of [[ASIN:B000001EL5 \\"Making Love\\"]] (nothing ever will), but there's some good rock 'n roll to be found here.<br /><br />\\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" was probably the only song from this album to ever get any airplay, and yeah, it does have a bit of a disco flavor to it, especially the lead break and the chittering guitar. But it still kicks butt, if not as seriously as previous albums. \\"Charisma\\" is another Gene Simmons masterpiece - good solid bass, some thrusting guitar... \\"2,000 Man\\" is a very good cover of the Rolling Stones song, and \\"Hard Times\\" and \\"Save Your Love\\" have some rock to them.<br /><br />\\"X-ray Eyes\\" and \\"Magic Touch\\" are a little weaker, but survivable. The rest of the album... forget it.<br /><br />This was a different album, sure... it'd be a few years after this (and a few member changes) before KISS would regain their rock sound. But there's a lot of stuff on here to like, especially if you include a few of these songs in a playlist of stuff from their first six albums (plus the two live albums). On a scale of 1 to 10, \\"Dynasty\\" probably only hits a 6 or 7, but it's worth it.
1609613937|5.0|Dr. McDougall is one of my heroes....His books show you how to eat to prevent and reverse many chronic diseases caused by the \\"SAD\\" (Standard American Diet) way most Americans eat...My husband has reversed his colitis and is keeping his diverticulitis and gall bladder disease at bay by eating a low-fat, plant based diet.  No more constipation with this way of eating...I know, TMI, but it's one of the many benefits of eating this way.  And Mary McDougall is a genius in the kitchen!  Her recipes make it easy to stay on track.  Thank you, Dr. McDougall and Mary!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. Whenever i get the chance i play this game. This game is beast!
0345803507|5.0|The trilogy of fifty grey 's is the best that I have read in a very long time. If you don't have it yet,, the best place to purchase it is at amazon.com. they have the best price for all three books.I rate the set as a 5 star. I can't wait for the next great read.
B0086700CM|5.0|If your planning on getting an app that has action and possible hand-eye coordination (?) then I believe this app is for toy! I know that I absolutley Luv it!!!!!!! &lt;:*)
B000000OU6|5.0|i think this is a nice album, ive heard better stuff from slash lately but this albun is still great, i took the time to read the bad comments on this and I´m wondering if all of them were left by AXL ROSE, an awful man full of envy...
B00881VLCE|5.0|l just got this app today and like it very well. Still learning to use the tray which is pretty small on my screen, but that is a small thing.  So I am well satisfied with this app as a new User.
B005K15XR4|5.0|If you haven't heard of Two Steps from Hell, DON'T WORRY, You've heard their music and just didn't know it. Every Hit Movie Trailer has Stolen from these GODS of Epic Music. From Star Trek [2009] (Freedom Fighters) to Inception (Infinite Legends), All the trailers from the MASS EFFECT video game series have snippets from this album. Even the UFC uses music from this album for their promo trailers. That is simply because Two Steps from Hell makes Awe inspiring & Epic music. I don't think I would've gone to see JUMPER in theaters if not for that trailer music called \\"Moving Mountains\\". For so long their music was not available for Public sale you either had to download it or know someone who knew someone who had it in order to get it, So this is a real treat to see this sold on Amazon.com. So everybody please support this great music and if you like it pass it on to new listener. I see they have a follow up album called \\"Archangel\\" and it is in my checkout basket right now. AAA++ and 10 thumbs up for this great music.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many games to choose from.  I don't think any other app haws this many games in one. I told everyone to download it on their kindle. at least everyone I know with a kindle fire.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Congrats to Hugh Howie on his 1000th review for Wool.<br /><br />I had friends and family members recommend this to me within a month.<br />Wool 1- This is the hook. It'll get you in, get you asking questions and seeking answers.<br />Wool 2- Does a great job at developing characters and enriching the story.<br />Wool 3-5- Leave a lot of spare time, I know multiple people unable to put the book down from this point onward.<br /><br />Well, what are you waiting for? Go get it!
0143121006|3.0|I found the narrative slow to get into--it took me about half the book to get interested. Even then, the story takes its time and readers are faced with every single failed investigation before even getting near the real thing. I agree that it didn't deal much with China per se, as I had been expecting. The romanizations of Chinese names was inconsistent, which made it confusing as well. Still, it was an interesting insight to colonial powers in China at the end of imperialism.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|superb acting and beautiful direction are the corner stones of the film, but the plot puts Prometheus on a pretty high level of sophistication. It asks some really complicated questions about human nature and our quest for answers and purpose, our fear of death, our lust for the unknown, and the dangers of these very human matters. It doesn't answer these questions, which is the whole point. These are questions that can't be answered, only considered, and they subtly imply this theme through situations in the movie.<br /><br />all in all a wonderful triumph for Mr. Scott hope to see many more in the future<br /><br />loved it
0439023521|5.0|This is the BEST one of the three books!  No two is good too, but No 3 isn't as good as the first two, but of course I read it, have to see how it all ends...
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I received the cd promptly via USPS in a bubble wrapped envelope. However, it was clearly not protected enough. I bought this as a gift and have no time to return it. The case has a crack across it. I hope the cd isnt damaged but again, this is a gift so I dont want to open it beforehand. A suggestion, make sure fragile items are packaged properly.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love how it lets u play the song slow then the next level for the is faster then the third is up to the speed the song should be it is an awesome app I I were u I would listen to me and buy this app
B0086700CM|5.0|my cousin recommended this game and when I tried I got a thousand meters. It also helps me concentrate. in class.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book to be smut, which may, of course, invite others to read it.  But it was repetitive.  I read 25% on my Kindle and then I quit.
B0052FG8KO|5.0|We have the W.E.T CD and wanted more information on the individual bands that comprise that band.  I purchased Work of Art, In Progress, and we love it.  Sounds like they were influenced by Journey and other bands of that ilk, but with their own twist.  Very happy with this purchase.
030758836X|4.0|To begin with, I highly recommend this book - particularly if you're the type who enjoys engrossing reads that swallow time. It may be a bit familiar if you read a fair amount of mysteries or thrillers but since I don't, it was a great discovery.<br /><br />My favorite part is that I don't see the seams in the puzzle box presented. Often, a mystery seems a bit too sanitized when you're finished reading it and you can see that a clever idea occurred to the author that had to be woven into the narrative after the fact to help escape a painted-in corner or walled-in garden. That does not occur with this story; everything that happens seems to have sprung up wholly formed.<br /><br />Again, I highly recommend this book and look forward to discovering Flynn's other work.
B007I0JHM2|5.0|I am shocked this doesn't have more reviews...This is one of the best books I have ever read. The author does an incredible job of keeping you guessing about the plot right up until the end. The story takes place in England and Australia, spanning many decades of time. A  young girl is found on a boat in Australia alone, in 1913, and later in life she tries desperately to find out where she came from. Her granddaughter also tries to find out her grandmother's origins, in the year 2005, which leads her to many family secrets all the way from the early 1900's. I couldn't wait to finish this book. It had me thinking about it when I wasn't reading it, and long after I finished, the lovely but sad story wouldn't leave my mind.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't understand all the hype around this book.  It doesn't have a plot and isn't well written, either.  If you want something titillating and fun, read \\"Outlander\\" by Diana Gabaldon.
B000EGCITG|1.0|The cussing in a few Explicit songs simply ruin this CD.  There is no wonder that the Clean version is more expensive.  Our advise is to get the Clean version like you've heard on the radio.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Get it now!  A great chance to save 14 bucks and to upgrade your fire to a full tablet PC :-)<br />Ok,  now it is the full price again... but still worth it!  (Edit : June 25.2012)
B000FBJAOG|5.0|For the critics who put this in the category of comedy. those people are going to be the first to die in the zombie apocylypse. i am prepared, are you
0345803493|5.0|Quick delivery and a must read!!! I started reading the first book which only left me wanting more. I do have to say it is very interesting, but sometimes I felt like I was reading a child's book by the way the characters in the book act. It does have twists and turns, alot of sexual and erotic type reading which I love.
B0055SJVPW|2.0|Ginnifer Goodwin is one of the more likable young actresses in movies and tv today, yet whenever she gets a chance to headline a film, it's in a predictable romantic comedy like Something Borrowed. She plays Rachael a lawyer who is struggling to find happiness and meaning in her life as she enters her 30's.  Kate Hudson who hasn't made a good film since Almost Famous plays Darcy, Rachael's lifelong best friend who is engaged to her law school friend Dex played by Colin Egglesfield.  John Krasinski plays Ethan, Rachael & Darcy's childhood friend.  The film focuses on Rachael & Dex finally realizing they were meant for each, having an affair and ending up together in the end.  Ms. Hudson is absolutely dreadful as Darcy.  The character is supposed to be extremely self-centered, but she plays her so over the top that you can't understand why her Rachael have remained friends their whole lives. Mr. Egglesfield is pretty wooden as Dex.  He is supposed to be the smart, sensitive type.  Based on what his character is supposed to be, you again can't understand why he would ever want to marry Darcy or be best friends with a shallow womanizer Marcus (Steve Howey) who uses a variation on an injured chipmunk story to bed women.  The scenes between Mr. Krasinski and Ms. Goodwin are the only reasons to watch this film.  They work great together and add a touch of heart to the film.  I'd love to see them act together again because they had some really good chemistry.
0345803507|3.0|Just got about half way through the last book and it seems that it is just repeating and repeating the same old stuff I have read in the last two books, but there is a twist that wants me to keep reading. Theses books keep you reading because there are answers that you need to know and if you stop reading you won't know. I think thats what hooks everyone to all three of theses books even though at times you get sick of reading the same stuff and the childish behaviors of the characters. I don't regret purchasing them nor do I regret reading them. They are erotic, suspenseful, surprising, and intriguing.
B001UHOWW4|4.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's holds up incredibly well after fifty years.  The Blu Ray transfer is amazing.  The film looks crisp and beautiful and watching it you're amazed that it was shot so long ago.  If you are a fan of the film, it is worth purchasing to see the masterful work done on the restoration.  The colors pop and Audrey Hepburn looks absolutely radiant.  The chemistry between her and George Peppard is excellent and Ms. Hepburn won a well deserved Best Actress Academy Award nomination.  The film is probably most famous for two things, Ms. Hepburn practically inventing the little black dress with the Givenchy number she wears in the open scenes and the song \\"Moon River\\".  If you can overlook (and it's hard to do) the insipid caricature of a Japanese man by Mickey Rooney, then Breakfast At Tiffany's remains a winner.
B0086700CM|5.0|i have been wating for the kindle fire to get this app. im sooo adicede to this game. i love love love this game. :-)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app for my kindle and computers. it keeps me very organized without lots of scrap paper around.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|The knife is a good knife for the value that it is it is a really good buy and from what i have seen so far it is good and balanced and is nice and sharp  [[ASIN:B0033H7VI6 Schrade SCHF9 Extreme Survival Knife with Fixed 1095 High Carbon Steel Blade and Black Kraton Handle and Sheath]]
B006IN2F10|5.0|We ordered the complete \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy on CD and it was a great purchase. The reader is excellent and the books are very engaging. I especially like that it is unabridged.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I just finished this book (at the insistence of my better half) and it was a message that came at the right time in the right way. I've read all sorts of self help/financial books and yes, they all made sense...but this one just hit home in a different way. The examples he gave made it easy to relate to and although the book is short, it's full of relevant financial advice.<br /><br />It seems like no matter how much money I've made, I've never understood the core principles of investing. I loved the example he gave of the gal that didn't have more than $1 to invest but how quickly that grew with her commitment to this process.<br /><br />The biggest revelation for me was identifying my own money blueprint. I never realized what a major impact it had on me emotionally until I read this. I AM that guy who has made a ton of money quickly and lost it over and over again in a seemingly never ending cycle. This book has hit me at a time where I'm on the top of the roller coaster and has helped me identify some very destructive thought patterns and emotionally charged financial situations that are self induced. This has opened up some good dialogue for us and for a guy that has a hard time 'expressing' myself, this book has given me a jumping off point to deal with my financial pitfalls.<br /><br />Would I recommend this? Heck yes.<br /><br />If there were anything I could say that was a bit obvious, it was his very loud and consistent push for his seminars throughout the book. However, if he didn't use this amazing book as a vehicle to sell more tickets, I'd be disappointed in him as a business man.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I play it all the time! I love it and I don't know what I would do without it! its new and exciting levels never fail to entertain and enchant thousands!
B0056C6XIA|4.0|I got this from Sears for about $55 as a gift for my little brother's birthday. We took it camping a couple of times last month and while we were able to use it (so far we've used the wood saw, pliers, bottle opener, screw drivers and flashlight), it doesn't feel like it's got a lot of life left in it. Disappointing considering what I spent on it. Some of the reviews say that it's bulky, and while I don't think it's all that bulky, I will say that it's not the easiest to pull out the tools. I would've given it 3.5 stars if it were an option, but since it's not broken on me yet, I'll stick with the 4 stars for now and update this if needed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is addicting. kids and parents like it. cute and very fun for the entire family. specially kid time
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this on a whim, and couldn't stop reading this.  I'm a huge fan of the dystopian future genre, and this by far kept me wanting to read to the very last page.
B0086700CM|5.0|when I lose I laugh so hard for my failer. I unlocked all characters in two days. (I would chose the chines girl for the maximum).
140053271X|4.0|The \\"newest model\\" is the Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight, and not this model.  It may be the newest without a light, but it's not the \\"newest\\".
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I would consider an opinion or review of this book very subjective.  If you are interested in S&M, you will probably love this book.  I am not interested in S&M, and didn't realize that's what the book was about.  I expected the book to be very sensual and slightly erotic.  The storyline was so unbelievable!  I have friends who enjoyed the book, however, it is not one I would recommend.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzles are easy and fun to pass time. Would help to keep youngsters entertained and is fun to work on together or alone. I give this 4 stars. Not perfect but if used for mindless entertainment or for brain interaction this works well.  The best part of this game is it would work well for adults to play and entertain the young ones together.  Spend time with your kids or grandkids while playing the game together.<br /> Morrisa Copley
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|The previews looked good, but within 15 minutes of watching the film, I had no idea whether the sequence I was watching was in the past or present.  The movie jumped around so much that, before long,  I did not care anymore.  There are plenty of passable action films out there.  This is not one of them.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|The short stories are just long enough to capture  my attention but short enough that I can read a story before bed. Awesome.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|To me,there is a connection to \\"Alien\\" so remember,this takes place 30 years before the Nostromo crew encounter.The movie did leave some unanswered questions and a sequel.The 3-D effects in this movie are awesome and there is a musical score from \\"Alien\\" that is played in this movie so I thought that was really cool.There was alos a part in the movie that reminded me of 2001:Space Odyssey when David the android was talking to the computer,kinda reminded me of \\"Hal\\".(LOL).Now for those who are not familiar with the Alien and \\"yes\\" Predator series,it all ties in at some point.Guy Pearce who played Peter Weyland is the son of Charles Bishop Weyland who was played by Lance Henriksen in AVP but that's another story and it still leaves many unanswered questions.Back to Prometheus.Again,a wonderful movie.The Prometheus ship looks awesome and the storyline was great.At first I gave it a 4 but now it's a 5.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I was enjoying this app until it FORCED me to allow them to email me! I was trying to play when it kept asking for permission to send me emails. everytime I said no it said login failed. so I decided to test it,  when I said yes,  it allowed me to login! I think I'll just uninstall! I'm so mad!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was so good that I literally got probably 4 hrs a sleep per night until I finished. I could not put this book down for anything.  I love the love of Christian and Ana.  I for one didn't see any similarities between them and Bella and Edward.  I cannot wait for the movie to come out.  Just don't know how they will manage all of the sexual nature in the movie unless it's on HBO as a mini series.  I will be reading this book again sometime in the near future because I did not want it to end.  I read the last book slowly so I could prolong it!.  Yes ppl it's that good.
B0086700CM|5.0|you should beable to watch videos to get coins not waist real money for fake money but I love it other then that!
B007PS0X0W|4.0|The story, to be quick and dirty, is that the humans have discovered that vampires and werewolves exists and are infecting the humans. As a result, the humans lead a massive purge of the vampires and werewolves. The rest, well, you'll just have to watch the movie for!<br />As for the movie itself, it is really PACKED with action. There are only a few scenes where something big isn't happening.<br /><br />All in all, it comes down to a cool action movie, but should not be watched for plot structure or character development or anything. It's just an hour and 20 minute adrenaline movie.<br />It is also way better than the other Underworld movies, imo.
B000FC10WU|5.0|Agatha Christie book \\"Body in the Library\\" is excellent. Was reminded when watching an old Dr. Who reminded me of the book. So I down loaded the book to re-read an old friend.
B003G4W49C|2.0|I can't see why authors like this can't manage to finish writing a book in a satisfying way. Why do they rush? Why can't they avoid telling too much, too many years in 2-3 pages trying to justify a non-sense final?<br /><br />Despite all the war-oriented plot (srsly, should I buy the cold-war revival?) the book could even gain 3 stars, but once again, the ending is horrible. Completely disappointing.<br /><br />Sorry, the author won't get another penny from me.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Excellent product and excellent series! The characters fit so well together that once you're done watching season two you'll want to order season three!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is by far the best Love story that I have ever read.  I know a lot of people couldn't read it or thought it was terrible but you have to have an open mind in order to read it.  You have to go beyond the erotica writing and look deeply into the love story.  I know she got the idea to write this from Twilight which I loved all the Twilight books but they were geared more towards teenagers, this book is definitly geared more towards adults.  I would recommed this to anyone who wants to read a great love story just be careful because you can become obsessed with it.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Excellent product and excellent series! The characters fit so well together that once you're done watching season three you'll want to order season four!
B008AG3PK8|3.0|Just when things started getting interesting, it gets bogged down in Megan's pursuit of an acting career. I am glad that Don contributed to her endeavor. It rescued this episode and puts the ball in Megan's court, where it belongs.<br /><br />Frankly, I am more interested in the business dynamics. I hope next season will address the gaps left at Sterling, Cooper and Draper created as both Peggy and Layne have \\"departed\\". I did like the highlighting of the missing talent in the partner's meeting when Joan repeatedly addresses fiscal matters only to find herself looking toward Layne's empty chair. And, as the creative team finds themselves struggling without Peggy to win over the panty hose account.<br /><br />Another interesting sub-plot is running regarding Don's, perhaps excessive, hardness as he may be starting to confront the damage it has created. The loss of his brother, Peggy and Layne. Will he address this personality flaw before he self destructs?
B004GYY714|5.0|I absolutely love this app on my kindle fire! Very easy to use. Great sound quality. I love being able to listen to radio stations from around the world. The app also streams podcasts of different stations and shows (including my favorite NPR shows)! So easy to find stations searching by location, type of station, music by genre, talk radio by main themes and topics, etc.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All this talk about this book I had to read it. I usually download a sample and take it from there; this time I didn't.  I made a wise decision.  Excellent and very addicting.  50 Shades darker is even much better! I highly recommend it.
030758836X|2.0|I was totally engrossed in this book in the beginning. I liked the way the story was told from both Amy and Nick's perspectives; it made it difficult to know what was really going on because I wasn't sure who to believe. In Part 2 several surprises are revealed that make the story even more engaging...until it isn't. Towards the end of Part 2 the twists and turns stopped being intriguing and just seemed over the top. The characters stopped being flawed and interesting and instead just seemed incredibly unlikeable. And the ending is just terrible. I cannot stress enough how much I hated the ending. I have never read a book before that took me from not being able to put it down to wanting to punch someone in the face out of frustration. So my advice is this: if you really want to read this book, check it out at the library. Don't do what I did and pay the Kindle price!
B0064SHI9I|5.0|customer service is outstanding! worth every penny. remember on New EVO, path is /sdcard not /sdcard2, if restoring from an sd card from old EVO.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator.  I can see and use the big buttons.  Simple is so much better.  Free is even better!!
0060558121|5.0|I was unsure if this was my kind of book, but was intrigued by the title and therefore decided to give it a shot. After finishing the book, it wasn't at all what I expected before starting the book--it was better. I'll admit that when I first read reviews of American Gods, I didn't exactly understand what the book was about, or what I'd be getting myself into. I now understand that the reason that the synopsis were so vague, was because there is no way to describe the plot without it sounding slightly absurd. The only way to know and understand what it is about is to read it.<br /><br />The tone of this book reflected the mood and feelings of the protagonist. Therefore, the language was a little crude at times. This is only natural and quite realistic in this modern day. This might bother some people, but if they get even a few chapters through the book, they will immediately see how amazing this book is.<br /><br />To get a better idea of whether or not you will like this book, the story and type of journey somewhat reminded me of Windupbird Chronicle by Murakamai. If you liked that book, you will definitely enjoy this book.<br /><br />No matter your taste in books, try out American Gods. It is a great read and definitely makes you think. I hope this helps someone :)
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|Ordered this for my mom for mothers day as she loved the hob series. She and my brother said it was awesome and they cannot wait for season 2 to be released.
B005LCECU6|5.0|Who cares if the sound quality sucks and the songs are a little rough. If your a true Rush fan then you will just appreciate this vintage find. The idiot critics are just spoiled with all the modern technology....They think every cd (or any music source) should be perfect. Well...the unique recordings on this cd are live and have a crude vintage sound. If your optimistic then you`ll appreciate the unique quality this cd has...Its not the how but the what that counts. Its Rush...vintage Rush and thats all that matters. If your an uptight snob...then buy something else thats technically perfect for your discerning ears. The cd completes my collection. A great find and buy on Amazon.
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is one of those novels that will mess with your head and stick with you long after you've finished it. The first half of the book lulls you into a false sense of familiarity. We've all heard the story a thousand times, a loving and devoted wife goes missing, this time on her fifth wedding anniversary. Who is to blame? Well the husband, of course. He's lied to the police, and come to find out their relationship wasn't doing so well. However, in Gone Girl, nothing is as it seems, and the second part of the novel will blow your mind. This story is told between Nick's present-day POV and Amy's diary entries from the past, so who can you trust? Flynn teaches the reader that sometimes you can't trust anyone... even the narrators.<br /><br />The first half of the book made me feel bad for Amy, especially, but also Nick (in some parts). These characters really played on my sympathies by telling me only certain parts of the whole story. In the second part of the book, it becomes apparent rather quickly that both narrators are big liars. At first I was kind of angry about this. I mean I trusted these narrators, and for what? So they could lie to me? But after I thought about it, I realized that the story would not have been half as intriguing if Flynn had not written it in this manner. Being unable to trust the narrators made it hard for me to believe anything that happened, though. So I finished the novel feeling unsure about what was real and what wasn't. Basically, no one is innocent and everyone is guilty of something. It's insane.<br /><br />The story was quick-moving, and I never felt like it lagged at all. It also didn't feel rushed, which is a good thing. However, the pages flew by, and before I knew it, the book was over. I was left sitting there staring at it, trying to recover from the intensity. The plot is scary, dark, twisted, and captivating. Once you start this novel, you will not be able to put it down until the very last page. I'm going to end my review here before I spoil anything for future readers of this book.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this novel to anyone who loves a good mystery/suspense. The book is wonderfully written, and the story will draw you in. Gone Girl is a horrifyingly intense roller coaster that you do not want to miss.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|Garbage is one of the powerfull band that I know.<br />I really like this album.<br />Perfect, well done, correct and it's only Rock'n'Roll dear.<br />Reminds me a bit of the First Album and Version 2.0. So, they continue good as heaven.<br />I'm really glad that they get back to work last year and this MASTERPIECE has been released this year.<br />Shirley Manson, Butch Vig, Steve Marker and Duke Erikson form one of the best Rock Band in World that appeared in mid 90.<br />I think that the long  \\"hiatus\\" of time was good and only when they have brilliant songs this solid album was recorded.<br />I enjoyed the fact that they produced the whole album via the band's own independent label, Stunvolume Records.<br /><br />Pure Rock!  Vintage and Modern at same time!
0307352145|5.0|Good book very informative, esp for someone who is in a relationship with a introvert and is not one. Introvertas have a great place in our society.

B0086700CM|3.0|this is a really fun, addicting game. I love playing it, but be warned: it lags frequently. at first, it used to be pretty fast, now everytime I try to jump ir slide it will freeze for a second or lag. Sometimes when I swipe it doesn't even recognize it, which makes me lose. other than the lag and the fact that it sometimes doesn't recognize when you swipe, it's a good, fun, addicting game.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|The voices sound a bit processed, and although this works for Brian Wilson, who hasn't sounded as good on his solo records as he does here, the over-all effect is that it often feels as if you're listening to a Beach Boys album, rather than really hearing the group.  There's no replacing Carl Wilson at the top of the harmonies, and the voice the band employs here in his stead annoys as frequently as it complements.  This is particularly so on the title track, the albums's weakest song, in part because of the grating soprano.<br /><br />Oddly, the album is backloaded.  But it does get exquisite at track 9, and becomes quintessentially Beach Boys on track 10, \\"From There to Back Again\\", which features Alan Jardine whose vocal chords have held up best.  Check the track's (uncredited) drum work, probably the sharpest instrumental part on the entire record.  The closing tune, \\"Summer's Gone\\", is a nod to \\"Caroline No\\", in both its sound and sentiment, and you almost believe it's 1967.<br /><br />Next time, if there is one, it would be nice to hear Bruce Johnston who seems present in name only.  Restoring him and putting Jardine's voice at the harmonious peak may result in less sonic fullness, but the authenticity will more than make up for it.<br /><br />\\"Summer's Gone\\" for sure.  So is autumn for the most part.  But if you listen for them you can hear the waves in winter.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|my daughter loves this game says it like the first Mario bros game. little hard on the kindle though only because if so big
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Excellent product for the price.  I highly recommend this Amazon Basics back pack.  It stores all my camera equipment and their accessories., as needed for my travel.

B0000047EC|5.0|After following Pat Metheny through the years of his electric guitar, this was a first acoustic collection that I happened to purchase (which was a few years ago). Wow! So beautiful. And I have always throught of his electric style as beautiful too. I was always used to the whole band with Metheny. But this is a spotlight on him and Hayden. The recordings are crystal clear of his delicate playing of the guitar. You can even hear his fingers gliding over the chords and frets at times, as well as the plucking/stroking of the strings with his other hand. Very beautiful and sweet interpretations of these compositions. Highly recommend.
0547572298|1.0|I've been reading Science Fiction (I hate the name) for the better part of the last 40 years, so I guess you can say I know a little about the genre.<br /><br />Ubik is one of those books that I've been using to keep doors ajar, to level tables. I finally burned it in a camp fire. It was a pleasure to see the book be slowly consumed by the fire, finally serving some noble purpose, namely, warming me and my family in a cold autumn night...<br /><br />Like most of Dick's work, Ubik is pretentious, high-nosed, the type or literary garbage that is admired by  pseudo-intellectuals.And, as it is always the case, there is some evil corporation involved in the plot. No wonder so many of his books have been adapted to films. To make things worse, it is extremely boring tedious, uninteresting.<br /><br />I hated it with all my guts!
B006VA57CY|5.0|This is one of my new favorite series to watch. The locations are beautiful and the cast is wonderful.  Really looking forward to season 3. I highly recommend this.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|After seeing the ratings and comments on this book I downloaded the sample and then immediately purchased the book.  The story was absorbing, the world well rounded and the writing was a pleasure.  If you are a fan of this grenre, I thoroughly recommend you read this book and I am impatiently looking forward to book 2.  There are a few typos but nothing compared to others I have read.
B0081KTI0E|2.0|The only good review I have about this movie is that Daniel Radcliff was great in it. He nailed the character!! As for the movie itself, it was a disappointment. Too many \\"scare tactics\\" to appeal to a younger audience. If the movie would have stayed true to the book, it whould have been much better.
B007MDB71O|2.0|A guy without a shirt goes to Mars.  He can jump ridiculously high.  He uses his high-jumping superpowers to end a war and win over the princess.  Yawn.  Oh, and it's over two hours long, too.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|its good angry birds has come far. I hope many people enjoy it thank you rovio<br />ok there is one thing the video for this is weird and stupid
B001TH7GT6|3.0|The cables appear to be well made and are actually kind of attractive but I found that with my older VCR/DVD player I still needed the older type RCA cables and I really couldn't tell any difference in picture quality.  Buy the cheaper cables or just use whatever came with the equipment you want to hook up. AS always with Amazon, the purchase experience and procuct delivery were just fine.
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever i couldnt wait til they got this game on the amazon app store amazing best game ever
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A wonderful story, and I will be waiting impatiently for the next book in the series. The only minor quibble is that it could have used some additional editing. However, the few typos could not distract from what was truly a well told story with engaging characters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is amazing, It has got me back in touch with using a Bible. It is very easy to use and I love the planner for daily scripture.
B0086700CM|5.0|take the temple if u dare well if you play this then challenge excepted. me and my friends have completions seeing who can get the highst score. well we dare.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really like the game I am addicted to it. my little boy loves it too.  enjoyable time for the whole family.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Everything that I purchased came on time and very fast. Shopping here is effortless. Keep up the good work.great job<br />Headphones were compared to the beats and out performed in many ways. The beats only had a little more bass. The comfort of these headphones is amazing.
1609613937|5.0|I found this product very informative with factual information. I think everyone should read this book, as it is life changing and will most definitely change the world.  Dr. McDougall is an absolute genius!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it because it has a bunch of different games and challenges me so I can move in the levels.Great game for all ages
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I have this app on my phone as well and it's nice to have the larger screen on my Kindle when trying to draw in more detail.  However, the Kindle seems to have a little lag to it so the line shows up a split second later than when I draw it.  Overall, the game is simple and fun but you run out of word options pretty quickly in the free version and it keeps giving the same choices over and over again.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This will go down and one of the best authentic movies released this year.  With real SEAL's and the action was intense and shows the supreme sacrifice these men give for their county.  A real American Classic
B007J4T2G8|1.0|42% into 50 Shades I asked why and I reading this poorly written book about two abusive people who don't like themselves and are addicted to sex and abuse.  I jumped to the end to see if Ana would finally get out of her abusive relationship with Christian, the answer NO.  Read the next shade and find out.  NO, I hate driving down I 5 through California's unchanging central valley, it is a long boring drive like this book, a long boring read.  If you want to learn about non-vanilla sex, this is your book.  Orgasm after Orgasm after Orgasm after Orgasm sometimes four or more in a chapter will make you as tired and as sore as Ana.  Ana get a life, Christian do the James the author, see if see likes abusive sex.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|When I read the Lost Hero, I loved the story and the characters in it. If you like action-packed books with people nearly dying, I totally recommend this book! The bad thing with this book is the greek mythology part of it. Greek muthology can be interesting, but it is hard to keep track of all the characters. In the end, this book deserves to have a 4 star review.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This writer keeps your attention and the story moves along. Delivered to kindle as usual. Not problem receiving the text.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Building Your Kindle Book is only part of the story and doesn't explain the entire process adequately.  After uploading more than 7 books to KDP, I had to do a lot more research about formatting, tips on how to avoid problems with creating a TOC and pricing.  Building does a poor job of explaining the TOC conversion and also fails to mention one persistent problem.  Once you've checked your book format in the Kindle Previewer and it meets all the requirements, that is no guarantee that KDP will convert your book in that same format.  In my experience, each book had to be uploaded, edited, uploaded again at least 4 times (for each of the 7 books) until KDP did the conversion I saw on the Previewer.  It wasn't me making the mistakes, it was the KDP software.<br />This book for obvious reasons does not include the issues around pricing books in the context of this format - knowledge about this important issue can only be gained by conducting extensive research including tracking down the experiences of other digital book authors.  Even with research, it often takes 6 months of actual sales to start to understand the pricing issues and other topics around pricing and competition with other digital ebook formats.<br />It will help if you read this book at the start of your research and several times again before you begin to understand what's good about it and what's missing and a lot of info is missing!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|excellent, the buttons and controls need a little more documentation but very effective piece of equipment<br />For the price you hook up a whole band to one amp for basement jam sessions.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I must agree with all the others 5stars best book I've read in the last few years, you will not regret your money at all.<br />It reminds me something of David Gemmell best books
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter and I enjoy this app together.  I honestly don't know who enjoys it more; just remember that you will have to spend a few dollars!!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Dexter is a wonderful series that keeps you gripped and watching until the very end. No disappointments this season for sure
0345803493|3.0|The writing in the Fifty shades books is terrible! However, they do possess a somewhat addictive quality. The characters are very, very poorly developed. I did not become attached to Ana or Christian at all. A good analogy for these books is cotton candy. Sure, it is fun to eat but at the end it leaves you hungry and slightly nauseated.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it is so much fun!!!  I'm so glad that the kindle fire finally got it. and even better: ITS FREE!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like Mario bros. if you played Mario bros and enjoyed it you will enjoy this as well.  great way to waste time. lol

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little Smith's Pocket Pal packs quite a punch for it's size. The diamond tapered sharpener is a wonderful touch, and the carbide and ceramic blades bring new life to any and every blade I've put in it's path. I've sharpened Bowie knives, machetes, and the Ka Bar my grandfather carried onto Gudalcanal in '42. This little wonder is well worth the money. Do yourself a favor and get this sharpener.

B004HO6I2E|2.0|From the time I saw the previews on TV for this movie, I wanted to see it. The movie was funny, and had a good plot line. The problem? The F word is one of the only words the two male characters know...I think that swearing has a place and time in a movie and it can make or break it. For me, it broke it. I would watch the movie again but I would prefer it to be the censored version. The other complaint I had about the movie was all the sex. It was almost like watching a porno...Wow. How many times can Ryan Reynolds get laid????
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really enjoy this game. Good graphics, challenging . . . Over all a good game. . . . . .
B0042KC4VW|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of this show, but I watch it enough through my roommate (about one out of every few episodes when I happened to be making or eating dinner while she marathoned through it ) to have an opinion.  This is basically just a successful attempt to cash in on the vampire craze... it's Twilight: The TV Show.  It's pretty well-done for what it is -- which is to say there's high production value for a cable tv show, everyone's very attractive, and most of the actors do a decent job in delivering their lines.  The plot gets pretty convoluted, though (I get the sense they weren't expecting it to run as long as it has when they made it) and most of the romances don't hold water if you stop to think about them.  This is the kind of show that I have to make a conscious effort not to poke fun at when it's on, lest I incur the wrath of the ladies enthralled by it.<br /><br />If you're into supernatural romance, you'll probably love this show.  If you're not, the plot probably won't be enough to keep you interested, but the experience is bearable.  I personally wouldn't pay $1.99 an episode for this, especially since I'm pretty sure most of it is available on various streaming services or On Demand, but I can understand why a fan would.
B0086700CM|5.0|perfect for a laundry Sunday lounging kind of day....is it cool not to do your dishes because your too busy thinking about coin collecting?!...in other words, fun &amp; addicting!
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Great app for analyzing and helping troubleshoot wireless networks. it will show you the best channel for your router, as well as all in range.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|great app. does what I need it to do. so far I have no problems with this app and is quick and simple to use.
B003L77G10|5.0|Acting, story line and characters all wonderful; they keep out the soap opera feel.<br />The DVD's are my sisters favorite way to watch a show.  A rainy day marathon.
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|This was a rather odd movie in many ways.  It stars Halle Berry in a horror / suspense movie where she does not really fit into, but maybe that was the point.  This is a movie about mental illness, about dirty little secrets, and what happens when your paranoia comes true.  Supernatural goings on, settling vendettas, etc. are such hackneyed topics.<br /><br />Halle Berry plays a psychiatrist who is living a rather ordinary life.  Then, one day, she wakes up as a patient in the very psychiatric hospital that she was working in.  What happened?  One night she drove home and murdered her husband, but not after seeing a ghost of a teenager exploding into flames.  From there, this goes into a rather predictable murder mystery complete with enough secondary characters, photographs and newspaper articles to fill in the gaps of the story that we were blissfully unaware of.  Robert Downey Jr, however, does add a little sass into his secondary role which is somewhat a breath of fresh air.  An astute movie watcher and lover of mysteries will figure out exactly who done it (but I won't say here of course).<br /><br />Maybe what the biggest message in this movie is is when she is in the rec room with the other patients as a patient.  Her former patient (now peer) Penelope Cruz, sits down and tells her \\"People think you are crazy, don't they?\\"  \\"Are you scared?\\"  When Halle says yes, she says \\"You should be\\".  What happens when you are suddenly thrown into that circle?  People who once trusted you no longer do and put you away with \\"those people\\" because you are a danger to yourself and others?  Has it ever happened when no one believes you or they don't want to believe you?  And there's nothing you can do to stop it, they will just ignore or dismiss you because you're crazy.  You are wrong and they are right, no matter how much you cry or beg or demand that your voice be heard, the answer is always no and you are helpless.  In that case, we should be scared.  Because it could just as easily be you.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|I'm impressed by how much they packed onto these 3 BluRay discs.  There are alternate & deleted scenes, an Extended version of the Season Finale, Cast & Crew commentaries for each episode, 8 featurettes on the behind the scenes action of Breaking Bad, 21 episode of \\"Inside Breaking Bad\\", Video Podcasts for each episode, all of Odenkirk's hilarious \\"Better Call Saul\\" Commercials ,and even more that I can't think of right now.  Besides all that the picture and sound quality is the best I've ever witnessed on a BluRay.  You have to add this to your collection if you are a \\"Breaking Bad\\" fan.
B0019OP0GU|4.0|The BBC's Christmas offering for 2007 was this charming version of BALLET SHOES, based on the Noel Streatfeild novel which I remember with particular fondness from my own childhood.  Despite a few shortcomings, this is a well-scripted and beautifully-cast production which I'm sure will capture the imaginations of all those who remember the original story.<br /><br />World explorer Great Uncle Matthew (or \\"Gum\\"), played by Richard Griffiths, brings home a few extra packages from three of his trips - namely three orphan babies.  Raised by his niece Sylvia (Emilia Fox) and her Nanny (Victoria Wood), the babies grow up into charming young girls with definite ideas about their eventual fates in the history books.<br /><br />Pauline (Emma Watson) wishes to be an actress, Petrova (Yasmin Paige) is crazy about aeroplanes; whilst Posy (Lucy Boynton) wants to be a dancer.  But when \\"Gum\\" disappears without trace on one of his expeditions, money becomes tight.  Sylvia arranges to rent out some of the larger rooms in their house to lodgers, one of which, Theo Dane (Lucy Cohu) is a teacher at a children's stage academy run by the formidable Madame Fidolia (Dame Eileen Atkins).  The school doesn't charge tuition fees for its working-class pupils, instead collecting a small percentage of the wage when a child is hired out for a stage engagement.  Pretty soon, Pauline and Posy are caught up in the exciting world of show-business, and, realising that there's no such thing as a 14-year-old aviatrix, Petrova half-heartedly tags along.<br /><br />The main issue with this BALLET SHOES is length.  Screenwriter Heidi Thomas had a tough assignment in condensing down the events of the book into a 90-minute film (the original book does cover an awful lot of ground) and there are perhaps too many subplots to weave into the narrative; including Sylvia and Mr Simpson (Marc Warren), and the other lodgers Dr Jakes and Dr Smith (brilliantly played by Gemma Jones and Harriet Walter).  The ending feels particularly rushed.  There is an earlier 1975 miniseries (which featured Emilia Fox's mother Joanna David as Theo), and I feel that the 2007 film could have been stronger if it was presented as a longer miniseries, allowing all of the characters the chance to expand and have their own special moments to shine.<br /><br />Fans of the novel will probably lament at what has been left on the cutting-room floor but this is an altogether-delightful film version of BALLET SHOES, despite its shortcomings.els particularly rushed.

B002ZG99QS|4.0|The quality and condition of the DVD are excellent. It plays as expected. No frills inside the case. Just a slip of paper detailing the chapters of the movie. DVD box opens and closes properly. The DVD stays secure when snapped in appropriately. Satisfied with this purchase
B003T2TP70|5.0|In short, this is the only book I have ever read that made me laugh out loud. An absolutely extraordinary tale of good and evil actually working together! Or at least trying too. I believe everyone should read Good Omens at least once in their life, or they will be missing out on something fantastic!
B005LAIHGI|4.0|The Dictator has many hilarious moments where we are asked to look at how warped our values and beliefs are, and the discomfort we feel for being pointed out as huge hypocrites makes us laugh at the realization of how skewed our society really is.  From Megan Fox giving away her body for a goodie bag at the beginning to the ending when we see The Dictator in his supposedly purified state this movie will have you cringing, laughing, and wondering 'how can people really believe this idiocy the main character is saying?\\"<br /><br />I loved this movie, and found it to be very funny even though it wasn't outright comedy.  It's social satire of the finest kind.  It's not as good as Borat, but it's very good.
B0086700CM|3.0|Gets old and after 5 min.s of running it just drags... I give it a 3 star review based only on the look of the game.

B007TNS6JI|2.0|I downloaded Dungeon Hunter 3 on my Kindle Fire, because I had heard so much about the Dungeon Hunter series. This game, however, was terrible. Combat was extremely boring and repetitive, and the villains looked exceedingly lame. Armor purchased for you hero, which is absolutely required to keep beating new levels, is ridiculously expensive. It yet another app trying to make you spend real cash for a \\"free\\" app. This game also required a huge download that was not listed on the product description. Gameloft is trying to take a page out of the worst app developers in America's (glu, in my opinion) book. Graphics were okay, but the maps were barely passable. I mean, you can run on water, but not on spikes? Please put a clearly defined line of reality, Gameloft. All in all, this game is a fail of epic proportions.
B007N31YFW|4.0|Saw this at the 2010 Seattle film fest and have been waiting for a region 1 dvd or blu ray release ever since. Well, it took a couple years but I can finally watch it again :P The fact that I've checked periodically for this release for years should tell you it's worth watching.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally! I have been waiting for this game to come out! It took so long for it to come out on the kindle fire!

B00881VLCE|4.0|I actually love this app. It's really cool how you can buy more puzzles or download more for free. Sure, the last few pieces are hard to get out, but that's one of the only reasons this isn't a five star review. I recommend this game!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have now read all three books in the series. I am an author myself and my 13 year old son encouraged me to read \\"The Hunger Games.\\" I was reluctant at first, I had a hard time as a mother with the intial storyline. So, it sat on my night stand for a few months...and I finally said \\"I have to read this.\\" Once I started I couldn't put it down. The plot is so well paced, her characters, writing, and imagination are all beyond brilliant! She has set the bar for other dystopian novels. As an author, I'm jealous! I truly enjoyed the series and will read Suzanne's other books.

0316017930|1.0|I don't have much to say about this book, because honestly, there's not a lot of anything here. This reads more like an overly long op-ed piece instead of a real work of nonfiction based on logic and research. The author starts with a premise or two, and then writes page after page of supposed \\"facts\\" to support his claims. I think any of us could do the same to support our own arbitrary biases. I was not impressed.<br /><br />I'm always interested in learning why certain people achieve success, and easily read this from cover to cover in one evening. Despite being a quick read, the writing is endless and repetitive. It's also very pretentious. I breathed a sigh of relief when I finally made it to the last page, but by then, I was utterly bored and remained unconvinced by the author's arguments. What's more, I felt depressed, too. I guess I wasn't born in the right time or place, so according to the author, I'm pretty much doomed. I'm sorry I ever read this.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|The sound can't be beat.  Envy me I bet you do when you get the earforce headset you'll no longer feel like going boo hoo.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|I was just on the cusp of missing the old show.  I was alive but too young to watch 21 Jump Street while it ran and I only caught a few reruns.  I had no idea what to expect from this movie revival, but heard it was incredibly funny.  Funny?<br /><br />The story opens with Jenko (Tatum), a jock, and Schmidt (Hill), a nerd, in high school where they don't get along.  They come together as they go through the police academy to share their strengths.  Unfortunately, they suck at being bike cops and get reassigned as undercover cops who will go back to high school to expose a drug ring.  Jenko again screws up and gets their cover identity backwards once in the school.  This might have been a problem, but it turns out that things are much different in high school a decade later.  What was once cool is now verboten and being a tree-hugging hipster is mucho cool.<br /><br />This movie was a riot.  Jonah Hill is always excellent at physical humor but Channing Tatum is able to hold his own.  When they take the new designer drug and proceed to freak out, I laughed so hard I almost cried.  The physical humor is also balanced with some witty dialogue and sarcastic humor.  Add in Ice T and David Franco (James Franco's adorable younger brother) and you have a great cast you connect with.<br /><br />This movie will keep you satisfied whether or not you saw the TV show.  It gives an appropriate nod toward the show without relying too heavily on inside jokes or old storyline.  I truly enjoyed having a good laugh.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It is fast read.  Some interesting parts will keep you from dropping the book.  The connection with the first book of the trilogy is fast and clear.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|My wife has this case and loves it.  In the amount of time I've had to play with her case/phone I've noticed a few things.<br /><br />Pros: First off, it's beautiful with the white iPhone 4S.  It is great for showcasing the elegance of the iPhone and has some concentric raised circles texture on the back that enhances the Apple logo.  The included screen protector is nice as well.  The case has a little bit of a lip to protect the screen when face down, also, so that is nice too.  It completely encloses the glass edges too, so side impacts should be protected a bit.  Indeed, my wife recently dropped hers on a tile floor, but the case absorbed the impact.  No problems thus far!<br /><br />Cons: TIGHT fit.  It takes a bit of work to get the iPhone in and out of the case.  This may not be a problem if you're the sort of person who doesn't care about dust and other particulates getting in the case.  I've had too many devices get scratched from the occasional particle rubbing between case and device, so I pretty frequently remove my case to clean (see my review of the [[ASIN:B005SUHPO6 Otterbox Defender Series Hybrid Case & Holster for iPhone 4 & 4S  - Retail Packaging - Sun Yellow/Gunmetal Grey]]).<br /><br />Summary: As indicated by the \\"AmazonBasics\\" branding, this is a basic case with basic protection for those who aren't in risky environments.  It has a nice elegance and seems to be holding up well over the past month.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Canada is the story of an American family driven apart by the father's sociopathology and the mother'e inability to stand up for her beliefs.  The father determines to solve his financial problems by robbing a bank with his wife.  As a result of this poorly planned and executed crime, the 15 year old fraternal twins are left to fend for themselves. As you may imagine, the twins do not fare well on their own, with consequences that last for their entire lives.<br /><br />This book is well written and the narrator, the boy twin, is quite sympathetic.  However, there are few surprises in the plot as everything is heavily foreshadowed throughout.  Even the title foreshadows plot! I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys reading about interesting characters who will always remain outliers.

I first had this album on vinyl when it first came out, then I bought it on c.d.to listen to it without the wear in sound that eventually happens with vinyl, and now I also have it on MP3 for convenience. I play through the whole album when I listen to it. It's great rock music and vocals from a great rock band. Though this album came out in the 80's and different formats come and go, the music has stood the test of time!

0765318741|1.0|I didn't like this book at all.  Most probably because I watched the movie first and I am a big Will Smith fan.  I realize the book was written first but there are a lot of people like me who bought the book thinking it was an adaptation of the movie, considering the jacket has a big picture of Will Smith on it. Well, since I thought the movie was awesome and I wanted to read what I thought would be an in-depth and detailed version of the movie, I settled down to enjoy, only to be surprisingly disappointed.  I quickly realized that the book was almost completely different from the movie.  First and foremost, the Neville that Will Smith plays in the movie is worlds apart from the wimpy, out of shape, slob of a guy in the book. Will Smith's character was strong, both physically and mentally and he was a scientist of some renown, doing expert tests and analysis to find a cure for the disease. The Neville in the book was an emotional un-kept wreck who smoked and drank himself into oblivion.  Yuck! And it's obvious that he doesn't have a clue about the disease because he has to drag himself out of a drunken stupor to go to the library and get books to learn about it. However, one of the biggest differences is that in the movie, Neville has a dog.  It wouldn't be so bad but the dog (Sam) plays such a major part in the movie!  I mean, a big part of what makes the movie so good is Neville's relationship with his dog and she (Sam) is not even in the book!  And on top of that, the mannequin (Dave) in the movie is actually Neville's next door neighbor, turned vampire leader in the book. In the book the vampires actually talk and they attacked Neville's house on a nightly basis.  In the movie, they were more creatures than vampires and they didn't even know where Neville lived, at least not until the end.  I understand that there are those who read the book first and because the movie was so different, they can justifiably complain about that, but the fact remains that this book was sold with Will Smith on the jacket.  That, and the fact that this is nothing but a compilation of short stories that have nothing to do with each other is a gross deception to the consumer.  I could go on and on about all the various things I found wrong with this book but why bother.  Suffice it to say that the book was just boring.  I couldn't even finish it.  What a big disappointment...k was sold with Will Smith on the jacket.

B0085Z8F4A|3.0|When is a prequel not a prequel? When a studio, let's call them 20th Century Fox, concerned about limiting the audience for their latest, big-budget science-fiction/horror film, PROMETHEUS, sidestep the use of the word prequel in their marketing materials and ask the director, Ridley Scott (KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, BLACK HAWK DOWN, GLADIATOR, BLADE RUNNER), and the screenwriters, Jon Spaihts (THE DARKEST HOUR) and Damon Lindelof (LOST), to sidestep direct or indirect questions about the connection or connections between PROMETHEUS and Scott's second film, ALIEN. We've been told PROMETHEUS and ALIEN share DNA. We've been also told that PROMETHEUS occurs in the ALIEN universe, but not a prequel to ALIEN. PROMETHEUS is indeed a prequel, albeit an indirect one, meant to launch another trilogy before reaching its inevitable endpoint: ALIEN.<br /><br />In 2089 C.E. (or A.D. if you prefer), two archeologists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), a true believer of the Judeo-Christian time, and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), Shaw's colleague, lover, and the skeptic to Shaw's believer, discover 35,000-year-old pictograms on an island off the coast of Scotland that seemingly confirm their theory that aliens visited different civilizations in the past. Shaw and Holloway believe the aliens influenced or otherwise directed cultural and possibly biological evolution, an idea that seeped into the pop culture mainstream forty-four years ago when Erich von Däniken published his factually challenged bestseller, \\"Chariots of the Gods.\\" The pictograms contain a star map that Shaw and Holloway interpret as an open invitation for renewed human-alien contact. Shaw implicitly believes in their benevolence. Holloway doesn't seem to share Shaw's optimism, but doesn't completely slip into negativity either. Shaw's optimism proves woefully unfounded we're in the ALIEN universe after all).<br /><br />Shaw and Holloway's evidence proves sufficient to convince Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the octogenarian CEO of the Weyland Corp., to fund a trillion-dollar expedition to the star system where Shaw and Holloway hope to meet the aliens and get the answers every child or teen asks once or twice: Who are we? Why are we here? Who made us? And to what or for what purpose? Shaw answers, somewhat naively, with religion, but she's still a scientist and as a scientist knowledge, regardless of whether it conflicts or not with religious belief, takes precedence. Holloway is far more the skeptic, the empiricist, the non-believer, but he's just as eager to meet the godlike beings that presumably created us. The science vs. religion debate isn't really a debate, not in a film with a $150 million dollar budget. It's just enough to suggest depth without in fact providing anything approaching depth.<br /><br />Weyland sends Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), a cold, calculating corporate executive with her eye on the CEO's chair (when Weyland passes into the great corporate beyond, of course), to keep tabs on the expedition. The ship's 17-member crew fulfills its primary function in the ALIEN universe: As fodder for the inevitable outbreak of something or other that decimates the crew. The script gives the secondary and tertiary characters names, but they could be easily called Generic Character No. 1 through Generic Character No. 10 or 11. Even worse, the characters that are coded as \\"smart\\" (because they're scientists) make fatally idiotic decisions at the worst possible times, presumably because Spaihts and Lindelof ran out of ideas and decided to rely on standard horror-film clichés. Only a few characters make any kid of impression. That's less to do with the screenplay and everything to do with the actors, like the Prometheus' captain, Janek (Idris Elba), who gets minimal screen time or character development, but whose actions suggest a heroic, self-sacrificing nature.<br /><br />With his dyed blonde hair and mannerisms lifted from his favorite film, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA,and a secretive, ambiguous agenda (again typical of androids in the ALIEN universe), David (Michael Fassbender) easily emerges as PROMETHEUS's most compelling character. He's first introduced watching over Shaw in her sleep chamber, picking through her childhood memories, a choice that's simultaneously creepy, because it's voyeuristic and a violation, and comprehensible as an expression of David's loneliness. David isn't supposed to have wants or needs, but he evinces them in practically every scene. He also evinces a dry, droll sense of humor that's often misunderstood or ignored by other members of the crew. They treat David less as a valuable member of the crew than a personal valet or even worse. When David makes consequence-heavy decision, he's simultaneously following Weyland's orders and engaging in payback for real and perceived slights.<br /><br />David, however, can't carry PROMETHEUS alone and either can Shaw as a proto-Ripley action-heroine. While Scott gives Shaw one of the most disturbing, squirm-inducing scenes in the ALIEN mythos, one that easily rivals a similar scene in ALIEN, she doesn't charge in any noticeable way until late (very late) in the film. Rapace's slight stature doesn't help, but Scott could have worked around Rapace's physical limitations with a script with a stronger focus on Shaw. Vickers exists primarily as a link to her predecessors (or rather successors) in the ALIEN universe, as embodiments of the amoral corporate ethos critiqued strongly in ALIENS. Vickers serves another function, but to say more is to spoil one of PROMETHEUS' few remaining surprises. It feels superfluous because, in fact, it is superfluous.<br /><br />PROMETHEUS suffers from the failure to meet the outsized expectations of ALIEN fans that expected and wanted, if not a carbon copy of the first film in the series, then something substantially similar, yet uniquely different to ALIEN. ALIEN centered on the crew of the Nostromo, a commercial freighter in the not-so-distant future. After the Nostromo's crew responds to a non-human distress beacon, they discover a long-dead, non-human pilot, the Space Jockey, and derelict spaceship's deadly alien cargo. ALIEN's lone survivor, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), appeared in three subsequent films of uneven quality. Only James Cameron's ALIENS matched ALIEN's ambitious scope and scale. Both films are justifiably considered genre classics if not outright genre masterpieces. Returning to the ALIEN universe and answering the questions surrounding the Space Jockey, the derelict spaceship, and the mystery surrounding the ship's cargo spurred Scott, working with Spaihts and Lindelof, was always a problematic, even controversial choice. Was answering the questions surrounding the Space Jockey worth exploring or answering? On the strength or rather weakness(es) of PROMETHEUS, the answer is, at best, a qualified one.<br /><br />PROMETHEUS, however, doesn't offer any ideas, intellectual, metaphysical, scientific or otherwise, that could be described as fresh or original (because they're not). Arthur C. Clarke's CHILDHOOD'S END, Nigel Kneale's QUATERMASS AND THE PIT, Clarke and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (among many others) all posited alien visitors for more than just cultural tourism or anthropological explorations of primitive cultures (ours), but also to prod cultural and sometimes biological evolution (ours, again). It's a pity then that Spaihts and Lindelof, following Scott's lead, don't develop the idea beyond the merely functional (to setup sequels to the prequels), but it's hard to blame them or Scott too heavily if PROMETHEUS, a film made by a Hollywood studio specifically to kick off a new, hopefully commercially lucrative franchise, fails to provide narrative or emotional closure, but instead tapers off into an semi-satisfying, sequel-ready ending.<br /><br />Narrative problems and shortcomings have been morethe exception than the norm in Scott's work and while PROMETHEUS is no exception, it's also another example of Scott's strengths as a visual stylist. Scott always seems to have a clear vision of what he wants to achieve cinematically and PROMETHEUS is no different. To that end, Scott shot in Iceland to capture the harsh, unforgiving landscape of the alien moon. Scott's longtime production designer, Arthur Max (BODY OF LIES, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, BLACK HAWK DOWN, GLADIATOR, SE7EN), and his cinematographer, Dariusz Wolski, bring a palpably believable, not-so-distant future into the present, a present made all the more credible thanks to subtle, immersive 3D. It's clean, pristine, and antiseptic, filled with the floating transparent screens filled with colorful data streams that AVATAR made de rigueur three years ago. The alien structures owe a great deal to H.R. Giger's seminal contribution to ALIEN, expanding on Giger's design work organically, if, at key times, no less repulsively. Scott fully embraces PROMETHEUS' R-rating, crafting several unforgettably repulsive scenes that would make even David \\"body horror\\" Cronenberg simultaneously recoil in disgust and applaud in appreciation.<br /><br />Cross-posted at VeryAware.com.

Guys.\\"<br /><br />Shut up!<br /><br />I honestly cannot fathom the universal adoration that the masses have for The Goonies. It's one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen in my life. Only the Von Trap children and the brats Spielberg cast as the Lost Boys in Hook have irritated me more than The Goonies (with the exception of Chunk). Before I get into the movie I'll give you a run down of the cast.<br /><br />Sean Astin as Mikey: seems as if he is phonetically reading off cue cards (a-la Peanuts) rather than fully understanding what he is saying.<br /><br />Josh Brolin as Brand: a constant damper on the adventure as he does nothing but attempt to diffuse the fun with his constant 'grown-up' perspective.<br /><br />Short Round as Data: so lovable in Temple of Doom, in the space of one year he managed to become the most annoying characters in movie history. Very little he says can be understood. His inventions are cartoonish, out of place, contribute nothing, and spoil many scenes. Whenever he opens his mouth I just want to grit my teeth down to the gums.<br /><br />Corey Feldman as Mouth: would be tolerable if he stopped screaming so much. This applies to the whole cast, but especially Mouth. Is better when he's serious instead of sarcastic, which isn't often unfortunately.<br /><br />Kerri Green as Andy: again, she would be bearable is she just shut up. Her random petrified rant about looking after her body is completely un-called-for and spoils the scene.<br /><br />Martha Plimpton as Stef: likable, but doesn't have much to do or serve any purpose.<br /><br />Jeff Cohen as Chunk: adorable, and the best (and youngest) actor of the bunch by far. Cohen's talent is infectious and it's a shame that the rest of the child cast undo his effort. In the scene where he confesses his previous misbehavior you can see that Robert Davi is loving it and cannot hold in his laughter.<br /><br />John Matuszak as Sloth: also adorable, but his \\"Hey, you guys\\" moment spoils everything.<br /><br />The Goonies was the second of three films in a row that Chris Columbus wrote for Amblin. If it had the shades of darkness and horror of Gremlins before it, or Young Sherlock Holmes after it, then it may well have been a true classic. Richard Donner (a loud, monstrous director who I really like) even used darkness to great effect in Scrooged a few years later, but here he seems to be really distracted by the fact that he's laughing at the antics off-camera and unable to see that, as a finished film, it's not as funny as he thinks it is. I mean what teenage kid, in the 80s, played with marbles or pretended to be James Bond? He directs these kids as if they were 7 or 8 instead of 13-ish. A film depicting more realistic teenagers would have won me over right away.<br /><br />The titular gang themselves live in Astoria, Oregon and are failing to enjoy their last weekend together before the rich folks tear down their houses to build a golf course. That is until Mikey suddenly remembers the treasure map up in the loft. So off they go to find the treasure of pirate captain One-Eyed Willie against the wishes of downer big brother Brand. They soon discover that the entrance to the subterranean world where Willie lies waiting begins underneath an abandoned restaurant used as a hideout by the Fratelli crime family. They only just barely manage to sneak into tunnels without being noticed, leaving Chunk behind to have his own sideshow adventure. Once inside the tunnels they encounter a gauntlet of traps set by Willie to prevent anyone getting his loot.<br /><br />Sound good right? And it would be if handled by a different director, or was scored by someone other than Dave Gruisin, who turns in a fully generic effort with no standout themes or melodies. Silvestri and Goldsmith were very busyin 1985, but nobody Gruisin, who I have never heard of before or since, was the wrong choice. I fully believe that Columbus' script was worthy, as I have read the novelization and it's far superior to the film, but for above listed reasons it doesn't work for me as a film.<br /><br />A lot of The Goonies has been rudely forced into pop-culture too. How exactly is 'The Truffle Shuffle' funny? Why do people fondly remember this? It's...nothing. Why do people always quote Sloth's \\"Hey, you guys!\\" as if it's hilarious. It isn't. It is absolutely not funny at all. By the end Donner allows the action to become campy and farcical, disrespecting the story and pathos. There are moments towards the climax where I honestly feel like switching the movie off.<br /><br />Stick with the novelization, and be thankful a sequel was never made.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features an above-average 2.40:1 1080p picture with Dolby TrueHD sound. All of the extras from the 2001 DVD have been ported over with no new material.in 1985, but nobody Gruisin, who I have never heard of before or since, was the wrong choice.

B00846TTDG|5.0|I think the media has portrayed our troops as warmongering beasts that care about nothing and nobody. Here we see them -- the real soldiers - as loving parents, husbands, friends . . . and the highly skilled and dedicated men and women that are willing to sacrifice life and limb (and do) for our freedom and safety - and for those around the world. Most of the time we never hear about what they do - and they like it that way, because it means their missions were successful. I am so thankful for them and for all they do.<br /><br />I'm also glad this movie was made so we could have a chance to see and appreciate how awesome they are. Our prayers are with you.

B004HW7JH4|5.0|NO SPOILERS<br /><br />Mad Men (MM) has generally been a show of layered subtlety, which often caused the show to go off on too many tangents.  As a result, IMHO, I found that in past seasons episodes were uneven with what seemed like filler.<br /><br />I see that some reviewers who are likely MM \\"traditionalists\\" may be of the belief that the show has deviated off of the \\"formula\\" that made it great.  I respectively disagree. There are a number of scenes in season 5 that offer dramatic effect like a baseball bat to the head!<br /><br />Coming off of an 18-month hiatus, I sensed immediately that this season was going to be something different.  The first clue was the elimination of the running historical commentary re: the advertisers.  This was kind of cool for the first couple of seasons, though I was ready to move on.<br /><br />There is still the political incorrectness of the time, marital infidelities and even a character battling weight gain!  Season 5 adds drug use, public sex and even a musical performance!  The difference is the direction towards greater shock value.  For those purists that loved the last 4-seasons, the season 5 finale ends with traditional MM subtlety a la 007!<br /><br />What make this series good is that there is simply nothing like MM, foreign or domestic.  What makes the show great is the writing and acting.  What makes this season possibly one of the best of all time for a drama series, is the writing, acting and added visual shock value.<br /><br />With all the TV that I watch there are very few series and fewer episodes where I find myself constantly checking the time because the episode is so good that I simply don't want it too end!<br /><br />MM Season 5 gets my highest recco for a drama series.

Brandon Sanderson brings clever originality to fantasy, a genre that can sometimes be predictable and formulaic. The characters are charming and believable, the plot is fast-moving and has plenty of great twists and turns, but the real highlight is the awesome magic system! A real pleasure to read and would recommend to anyone with an interest in fantasy.

B005LAIHXQ|3.0|It is 2093 and the scientific exploration ship Prometheus is approaching the distant planetoid LV233. The crew are hoping to unlock the secrets of mankind's past, but they soon come to realise that some secrets are best left alone.<br /><br />So, some thirty years on, Sir Ridley treats us to another installment in the [[ASIN:B006MGB31Q Alien]] franchise: Prometheus is intended, not as a prequel to the travails of the ill-fated crew of the Nostromo but rather as a prelude, exploring the origins of the Space Jockey race that was introduced (briefly) in that film.<br /><br />Let's start with the good bits... there's no denying that this is a jaw-droppingly, eye-crossingly, mouth-wateringly good looking film. It's classic Ridley Scott; atmospheric, sumptuously detailed, gorgeously lit - easily up there with Lord of the Rings, Star Wars and Close Encounters as a visual spectacle par excellence. The CGI is plentiful, as one comes to expect with modern cinema (especially in the scifi/fantasy genre) but it is used with great artistry and panache.<br /><br />The story is, given the circumstances, original enough and the panspermia origins idea has an interesting modern resonance that will delight or annoy. Much is left unsaid, allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions (whilst simultaneously paving the way for a sequel), although the story is somewhat confusing, making a second or third watching essential. The details do let the film down a little though and my guess is that amateur biologists will have many a bone to pick with the film's writer. It has already been noted that some of the other details are a little off kilter (to be generous), for instance spending a trillion dollars on such a huge space mission and then manning it with a bunch of (let's be honest) incomptetent amateurs just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />The acting is... adequate. Wheras Scott managed to crew the Nostromo with some excellent performers (I'm thinking of Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton and Ian Holm), the best he can do here is Charlize Theron and Noomi Rapace, neither of whom will win the film any Oscars, I'm afraid. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing particularly egregious going on here, but neither are there any stand-out performances. OK, perhaps I'm being a little unfair: Fassbender's depiction of the android David is rather tasty, but I would say that he steals the film, highlighting the ordinariness of his co-actors rather than lifting their performances.<br /><br />My main complaint is that Scott, despite his protestations that Prometheus is NOT a prequel to Alien, has simply warmed over many of the themes, images and ideas that he adressed in that film.

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing particularly egregious going on here, but neither are there any stand-out performances. OK, perhaps I'm being a little unfair: Fassbender's depiction of the android David is rather tasty, but I would say that he steals the film, highlighting the ordinariness of his co-actors rather than lifting their performances.<br /><br />My main complaint is that Scott, despite his protestations that Prometheus is NOT a prequel to Alien, has simply warmed over many of the themes, images and ideas that he adressed in that film.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I liked the movie.  Wasn't bad at all.  Sure, some cliches and old formulas abound but the movie was entertaining.  I wish now that I had seen it on the big screen, some of the scenes would, with out a doubt, look even better.  But, alas the horrendous doomsday press told a different story - doing its part to keep people away.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I had to go back to Amazon after reading this to see if maybe it was in the young adult category and I just overlooked this.The story was absolutely  ridiculous . The characters so juvenile, I was sure I was reading a book geared for adolescent girls. Lesson learned. Just because others give a book 4-5 stars doesn't necessarily mean it's a worthy read.
1469984202|5.0|I could not put this down - nor could my mother, father or husband. If you want a novel that transports you and captivates the imagination - here it is !
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book! I couldn't put this read down.  If you like readig about bondage and sex, this is the book to read! Not to crude, very sensual and interesting.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a very intriguing book. It was much more intense than I had imagined. If you are looking for a book that is erotic, this one is so much more. And it has a good story to go with all that. A must read.

B003Y5H542|5.0|I dislike American animated movies with a passion. Not because they are poorly made, but that they are made for children only. The level of writing, character design, its all very family friendly. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I strongly believe that animation shouldn't be just limited to kid friendly movies. It can be used to tell stories that cannot be done in live action.<br /><br />Look at the animated movies coming out of Japan, they have action, science fiction, romance, all sorts of movies in animated form and yet, we are still churning out Shrek and Toy Story. So I was genuinely surprised when Rango came out.<br /><br />Here's a movie that is not cute, it has ugly, creepy, and down right disgusting character designs. It has a story trope, usually found in action or western movies. Now, I'm not going to talk about what's the plot or who's playing in it. At that time now, almost everybody knows that.  What's so groundbreaking about this movie is the fact that this is a movie that actually treats you like an adult. It has references of movies ranging from such noir classics like Chinatown to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. Movies that your kids or today's attention deficit teenagers won't enjoy one bit.<br /><br />It is also the first feature animation movie created by ILM, George Lucas's special effect power house and it looks like Pixar should be worried. For the animation is so crisp, so detailed, that it borderlines photo-real. It is truly a visual spectacle and another proof that if done right, a 2D animated movie can be as good as a 3D spectacle, in animation off course.<br /><br />Much kudos to Mr. Gore Verbinski, to elevating the genre that I believe has limitless potential but is limited in its ambition. So if you consider yourself a fan of good, well written, well made and gorgeous to look at movies, then do yourself a favor and go buy it right now.
0345803485|3.0|I just finished the books and to be honest it does get better on the second part (second book). I wanted to stop reading the 15th time Ana bit her lower lip and blushed. It was just repetitive, her character never developed, other than going from  being a virgin to a wild woman that could orgasm as many as three times in 45 seconds. But I kept reading because there was so much potential in Christian Grey's character, trying to find out what shaped him is the real page turner here; not the sex which is laughable sometimes and plain ridiculous others, not the billions he throws around because at the age of 27 he has a fortune that is unclear how he made. Overall if you are in for some fantasy world and you've never being to Seattle WA this may be a good summer read.
B0084LQHN6|4.0|We see this new artist making her way in the industry, after already conquering Europe, she makes her forray into the music in the US with her debut EP \\"1991\\". My friend told me about Mrs. Banks, so I checked out 212. After listening to it, I was hooked. I bought the EP, when it came out and i really enjoyed it. It blends rap and electronic really well. Please give her a chance. I do like both Nicki Minaj and Azealia Banks, so I am not gonna choose a side. But there is something undeniably fresh about Azealia that she brings to the table.<br /><br />We start out with 1991, a house kind of song. You hear a bustling coffee shop, then you transition into her voice. Talking about the older times and about other things. Then you go into Van Vogue, a track about fashion. This song has a jungle kind of theme to it, I really like it. It also showcases some real vocals from her. Then you go into the smashing 212, the pounding beats and bass. This song stands out, i really like this and it is my favorite. It does have some trash talk, but revolves around her life in New York. Then we polish off with Liquorice, a song about guys and sex. I like this one too. A catchy chorus and fun little beat.<br /><br />Overall, Azealia Banks is marking her territory with her new EP. She does really well with blending electro and rap beats. I enjoyed this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this is a fun but real difficult game I think you should get this game to if you enjoy unlocking. stuff
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I was hoping for way better.<br /><br />I had immediately placed this pre-order in my cart when I saw it.  Having now seen the movie, I'm only interested IF they included what they obviously must have LEFT OUT from the theatrical release.<br /><br />Even with an \\"extended\\" edition, if it not >45-minutes< or more, I may not even bother!<br /><br />For a trillion dollar mission, and THE most important mission Man could ever undertake, I think they could have found a more intelligent and mature set of folk for the task at hand, not the handful of bumbling fools seen here.<br /><br />For any movie to be successful, you have to develop your set of characters and show how they each deal with the situations presented to them, in the hope that you begin to care about them and perhaps identify or bond with them.<br /><br />I didn't hardly care about these characters at all, and unfortunately, it appears the movie didn't care about them either.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was just like Twilight with a dom/sub twist.  Poorly written for the masses. What else can I say? Oh, my, I'm turning 50 shades of bored.
0307730697|5.0|This is the second Navy SEALS biography I have read. Both books were great, but both were very different. This is a story of tragedy - triumph - tragedy. Adam Brown's life was not normal, by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />The first part of the book shows his early life - A carefree loving kid with a lot of energy and bravery. From jumping off the roof of the house to protecting his siblings, he had a very strong character.<br /><br />Then things changed. Becoming a drug addict, his life spun out of control. He became a thief, a bum, and a liar. Stealing from his parents and anyone else he came in contact with, he moved from jail, to rehab, then back into drugs again and again. He knew he had to do something with his life.<br /><br />Even after turning to the Lord he still struggled with addiction. He learned that some people are addicted to crack cocaine after just one try. He then decides The Navy, especially the SEALS, was the place he needed to bring structure to his life.<br /><br />A friend's dad helps him into the Navy despite his terrible police record. From there, he goes through some extremely hard training.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the whole story. It is both a triumph and tragedy. It is one of the most emotional biographies I have read.<br /><br />I consider this one of the best biographies I have read. You will not be able to put it down. Reading it makes me proud to be an American and especially proud of our troops.<br />Pray for our troops.<br /><br />I recommend this book.<br /><br />*This book was provided free by Waterbrook Multnomah for a fair review.
0345803485|2.0|Okay, I'll start with this: yes, I read the book all the way through and yes I was ready to shoot myself if the main character, Ana, said Christian has \\"amusement in his eyes,\\" \\"a wry smile,\\" if either one of them \\"scuffed\\" or scowled\\" one more time or if she had another all-time explosive orgasm. (Was she faking them?) This type of writing, with not a thought to at least use MS Word's thesaurus is distinctly difficult to wade through. Each page irritated me more and more ... and yet, I couldn't seem to put the book down.<br /><br />The question arises: how can a book, written like this, with a lack of grammatical skills and one dimensional characters be so damn popular? It's a one star book with a five star addiction rate. Admittedly, I'm one of the thousands of women who are hooked.<br /><br />I've started Fifty Shades Of Darker and am irritated as hell with the writing, but Christian Grey is rich, gorgeous, a sexual expert and a great seducer. Yes, he may be a stalker, a sociopath or even a broken man but all and all, I'll bet he's one good time.
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is super fun but. I had to redown load it. because it suddenly stopped working on my kindle. but all I had to do is redown load it. fun for all ages!! also adds are destracting but I overcame that glitch.so to all the bad reveiws I get what your trying to say.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|After a long 7 year hiatus, alternative rock band Garbage finally returns to the music scene with Not Your Kind of People. Unlike the previous 2 Garbage albums, Not Your Kind of People is a solid album (for me) from \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\" to \\"Show Me\\". Despite the lengthy hiatus, the chemistry amongst the band members remains solid. The album kicks off to a raucous start with \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\". It is my current favorite song. I just love the pop hooks especially during the chorus. My all time favorite song on the album is the title track which is a beautiful ballad. I also love the shoegaze sound of \\"Bright Tonight\\". I definitely recommend buying the limited deluxe edition which features four bonus tracks. Not Your Kind of People definitely was so well worth the wait for this fan. I have been listening to it every day since I got it last month.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is the best book I've read so far this year and it's going to take a lot to beat it. Grissom presents her story from all sides through the narration of two characters - a black (actually bi-racial) slave and an Irish indentured servant (who is only 7 years old when the story begins). We get the story from the \\"Big House,' to the house slaves, to the field slaves. From the prologue, I was completely hooked. Grissom brings a Virginia tobacco plantation to life, vividly illustrating the joys and sorrows that comprise the daily lives of its inhabitants. There are the usual issues that are common to all slave stories - the abuses and hardships, of course - but there are also moments of happiness - couples jumping the broom, babies bringing new hope, holiday celebrations. We also see the conflicts of the 'Big House,' where the master of the plantation lives. Ultimately, this is a story of family. Grissom shows that blood is not the only way to make a family, and she makes her reader love each and every member of the family she created. Grissom does an excellent job of combining history with her story line and showing the differences of all the classes of slaves and their place within the plantation. I wasn't able to put this book down, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in an intelligent story filled with wonderful characters.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is cooler than cool but the bad thing about it the characters cost so much money they could have reduce it a little
0316098329|5.0|I was hesitant to start this book because I didn't know if I'd like the narration from the perspective of a child. It took some getting used to, but in the end it was a really effective way to tell this story. Donoghue does an amazing job of getting into the head of a five-year-old, relaying his thoughts in a way that makes your heart break. The Room in [[ASIN:B003YFIUW8 Room: A Novel]] is its own character, one that Jack is understandably very attached to. Parts of this novel made me cringe - I still feel sick thinking about some of it days later - but that's a testament to Donoghue's skill in getting into the minds of her characters and her readers. She also does a great job in portraying the mother is the story, herself only a young adult when she was abducted. This is not an easy book to read, but it is one that will keep you thinking.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I love Epic stories and this one did not disappoint!  Even though religion is a integral part of this story, it doesn't overshadow the story line.  I really enjoyed this story and loved being able to follow the main character from a young boy to the manhood.  The story has many different levels without being overly complicated.  I thought this was a fantastic read and cannot wait to read more!
B004SQS9FA|5.0|I don't understand why people use these reviews to bash those who don't think like them. If you don't like Radiohead I really don't care. I love this band. They are my personal favorite of all time. Ever since Creep came out in 92' I knew my taste in music had evolved to something I could never even dream of.<br /><br />This album was not what I expected, but I learned after listening to OK Computer to not expect the expected from Radiohead. Every new album from them I listen to with an open mind and just wait for me to love, like or even dislike a song. On this album I love all songs and listen to over and over again at work (bet my coworkers are glad I wear the head phones). I love that they aren't like anything I hear from America or on the TV (radio sucks here). I think Thom Yorke's voice is just amazing. I hate that bands like Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones are old and gross and still making music, but Radiohead can do that and I will be grateful because their music was ment for my ears (I do hope Thom Yorke gives up the red skinny pants in a few years though).

0765316994|3.0|I'm a huge John Scalzi fan, and I've anticipated this one since the day it was announced. After reading it, I came away feeling decidedly mixed. The author's fast pace and clean prose remain intact -- I finished this sucker in two sittings -- as does his sense of humor. I probably laughed more reading this book than any of his others, and if you've read \\"Agent to the Stars\\" and \\"The Android's Dream\\", you know that's no faint praise.<br /><br />The reason I only gave the book three stars is because it lost me when the big twist was revealed just over a hundred pages in. Without revealing anything, I'll just say that it took me out of the reality of the story in a way the book never recovered from. It was a perfectly valid decision to do what Scalzi did, it just didn't work for me and the rest of the novel suffered as a result.<br /><br />I will say that, aside from the prologue, the codas were my favorite part of the book. They gave the novel's story some badly needed emotional weight and pathos.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addicting! We love it! We all cant wait to get more coins to see how the other characters to on the maze.

158234082X|4.0|I knew little about anthony bourdaine before i saw now reservations and i loved it. This book pretty much tells you about how he climbed the ladder in the culinary business. he talks a lot about the behind the scenes of what goes into running a restaurant. from how drunk and high him and his co-workers were in the kitchen, to when and when not to buy fish in a restaurant. i liked this book because he is brutally honest and tells you anything you want to know about the culinary business. it also has some good tips you can use in the kitchen! i would recomend this books to anyone who likes bourdaine wether your a cook or not.

B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I suppose this is a spoiler, but most reviews allude to or frankly state that the main character doesn't survive the story.  Even though I knew it was coming, it really got me down.  That said, the film was worth seeing.<br /><br />The acting in this film was of very high quality.  William Hurt played such an ass that you really understood why his son wanted to find a different path.  I don't often like the characters Catherine Keener plays, but she really impressed me in this film.  While I am just mentioning these two, the rest of the cast was equally good.<br /><br />Finally, all the visuals in Into the Wild were beautiful--not just the Alaskan wilderness.

Instead of trying to complicate things and confuse his readers the author gave great, short, to the point answers to all the get in shape questions.

B0058YPG2K|4.0|It's fairly typical to say each season after the first of \\"Breaking Bad\\" was a game changer but, in this case, the fourth season IS.<br /><br />Blu-ray review (although the contents for the DVD are very much like that for the Blu-ray, they aren't exactly the same). I'd give the season 5 stars but the BD itself 4 because of some transfer issues.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />After the cold blooded murder of Gale  (who Gus had hired to eventually replace Walt and Jessie) the unlikely dynamic duo found themselves once again in demand from an increasingly unhappy Gus who STILL had plans to replace them at some point. The murder of Gus pushes Jessie into a dark place he's been before but never quite so deep. Skylar decides that she and Walt must have a way to funnel the massive amount of money he is making and decides to invest in a business.<br /><br />Walt must find a way to get Jessie back knowing that he NEEDS him in particular to eventually put Gus out of the way. He also realizes that as long as Gus can get access to Jessie he man not need Walt any longer and that will put Walt, Skylar and his son in harm's way as well.<br /><br />Gus makes Jessie feel important and takes him in one of the stunning set pieces of the season to the home of a drug kingpin in Mexico where Gus has plans for ultimately eliminating his competition not realizing that Walt has similiar plans of his own.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />\\"Breaking Bad\\" continues to be one of the best written shows on television and that's saying quite a bit given some of the competition out there both on AMC and other networks. Creator/producer/writer Vince Gilligan continues to craft a dark, compelling TV series. This isn't \\"lite\\" entertainment by any stretch of the imagination and those looking for something that will entertain without asking difficult questions and taking characters we like and sometimes admire down the road of temptation should look elsewhere.<br /><br />While the Blu-ray doesn't look as stunning as I'd hoped, it looks quite good. There are issues with banding that occur and are particularly noticeable in just about every episode. Most of the previous seasons didn't have this issue that I recall (I'll have to take a look at them again to confirm it)which is why it's perplexing that it's a problem here.<br /><br />The 5.1 lossless DTS audio sounds quite nice with good use of directional effects present throughout. Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish for the Blu-ray.<br /><br />The special features are quite nice on this set including videopod casts, commentary tracks (13!) on every episode that are usually quite informative. We also get extended and alternate scenes as well as the \\"Inside Breaking Bad\\" featurettes. We also get \\"Better Call Saul\\" commercials from the series, an amusing gag reel and a variety of featurettes on the production of the series. We also get \\"uncensored\\" versions of episode as well as an extended final episode for the fourth season.<br /><br />The fourth season brings us to the brink with Walt's final descent into the madness of the world he's adopted and the final shot of the episode demonstrates how desperate he is and how that madness consumes him, Jessie and everyone he comes into contact with.<br /><br />Highly recommended.look as stunning as I'd hoped, it looks quite good.

0156030470|4.0|Considering all the labels and praise and criticism that have attached themselves to Virginia Woolf and TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, it can be difficult for the new reader to formulate a nonpartisan - though still subjective - opinion.  The book is supposed to be this; it is supposed to be that; feminist literature and experimental stream-of-consciousness literature and ground-breaking modernist classic and member in-good-standing of the Western Cannon and so on - any one of which may wear like a loose, or very ill-fitting, garment, depending on the proclivities of the individual reader.  But if one approaches the book looking to validate (or attack) any of the issues on which its reputation rests, then it seems to me that that is a separate thing from whether Woolf's writing impinges upon the reader in any non-ideological, personal way.<br /><br />I have always favored books that have struck me as startlingly apt in their representations of certain events, or people, as well as those works which bring about a sort of epiphany by framing familiar images in surprising ways.  TO THE LIGHTHOUSE succeeds on both counts, at times, though at this point in my life, there are also many aspects of the book that fail to strike those chords.  I say at this point, because TO THE LIGHTHOUSE is one of the few books I've read that seemed particularly well-suited to grow and evolve as the reader does.  I like Mrs. Woolf's writing; I admire it intensely; yet at the same time I was often uninterested in the narrative.  It wasn't till the final chapters of the first section and some of the third where I felt the pull of those qualities I mentioned before.<br /><br />In this annotated edition, editor Mark Hussey snips an excerpt from a letter from Woolf to her friend Robert Fry, in which she had this to say about symbolism: 'I meant _nothing_ by The Lighthouse. One has to have a central line...to hold the design together.  I saw that all sorts of things would accrue to this, but I refused to think them out, and trusted that people would make it the deposit for their own emotions - which they have done...I can't imagine Symbolism except in this vague, generalized way.'  I especially appreciate this - to restrict the elements one finds in a novel to exact dimensions chokes the life out of it.  And I think it is precisely this unattached sort of symbolism that makes the book so malleable, so suited for multiple impressions.  The idea I attach to The Lighthouse, because I am who I am, is that of a platonic ideal, a thing that is sensed but unattainable, much like the feeling of nostalgia for the past.  And if by some effort one forces that ideal to submit to reality, then it loses all mystique, all power.<br /><br />When reading Leon Edel's introduction to Henry James' [[ASIN:0395051371 The Ambassadors]], I came across this excellent statement that applies as well to Virginia Woolf as to James: 'There are readers for whom certain books will always remain closed; and others for whom the same books cannot be opened too often.'  In this case, I believe a book like TO THE LIGHTHOUSE should be read again after a time - that it is like the proverbial river that cannot be stepped in twice.  At this reading, it suggests connections and ideas that are relavant to me now, and will quite likely suggest entirely different things at a different time.<br /><br />Does it deserve its status as a classic?  I think that is an unqualified yes, and I suspect it also fits all the other labels it has accumulated throughout the years, though I am not really in a position to comment on that.  But rather than because of its reputation, TO THE LIGHTHOUSE deserves recommendation for revealing unexpected facets of familiar scenes through its unique style.  Somewhat challenging (but much less so than a Faulkner, a James, or even Malcolm Lowry), TO THE LIGHTHOUSE is as adept today at underscoring the melancholy delights of human interaction as it was in the early part of the last century.<br /><br />This annotated edition contains a rather lengthy introduction by Mark Hussey that I might suggest one skip till the end if they haven't read the book before.  Also included is a short biographical preface, a chronology of major events in Woolf's life, suggestions for further reading, and notes to the text which I thought was mostly unnecessary.  While I enjoyed the introduction - which I read last - I found little value in the other sections.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|This series is a must have in any second world war buffs collection. Unbiased and not revisionist unlike more contemporary documentaries on the subject, this series gives a detailed account as eye-witnessed by those at the centre of the conflict. There is little narration done which leads to a more objective interpretation of the events that happened. Too many current documentaries on the subject stereotype the participants as either good (in the case of the Allies) or bad (as in the case of Germany). The world at war shows that the events that occur in  \\"the fog of war\\" are  neither neither black or white but lie somewhere in between. You wont go back once you have seen this series. A masterpiece.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read for a long time, and I read a lot. This is a book I will pass down to my daughter when she is a young woman. The book a very emotional read for me. Strayed does not hold back and I appreciated her honesty and depth.<br /><br />I also appreciated the honest depiction of her mother. So often, we are not given a reliable picture of who our mothers really are as people.<br /><br />\\"We were her kids, her comrades, the end of her and the beginning. We took turns riding shotgun with her in the car. \\"Do I love you this much?\\" she'd ask us, holding her hands farther apart. \\"No,\\" we'd say, with sly smiles. \\"Do I love you this much?\\" she'd ask again, and on and on and on, each time moving her hands farther apart. But she would never get there, no matter how wide she stretched her arms. The amount that she loved us was beyond her reach. It could not be quantified or contained. It was the ten thousand named things in the Tao Te Ching's universe and then ten thousand more. Her love was full-throated and all-encompassing and unadorned. Every day she blew through her entire reserve....She was optimistic and serene, except a few times when she lost her temper and spanked us with a wooden spoon. Or the one time when she screamed F**L and broke down crying because we wouldn't clean our room. She was kindhearted and forgiving, generous and naïve. She dated men with names like Killer and Doobie and Motercycle Dan...\\" -Cheryl Strayed, Wild

If level one two and three are all too easy for you- IF YOU CAN GET THROUGH LEVELS 2 AND 3 WITHOUT SWEATING man you do not need this work out video! I just had a baby 5 months ago, when i weighed 240 level one hurt my knees, so i lost 20 pounds with dieting and then tried again, i've been on level 2 for 5 days and have lost 10 pounds on level 2 alone!!! If level 1 gets too easy, do level one as a warm up before level 2- man level 2 is SO HARD! I love it! I remember the first time i tried level 2 i couldn't even get half way through it- i thought all 3 of the girls in the video had to be androids or something to be able to do the work outs but now i am right there with them! When you first do this you will be DYING PANTING SWEATING YOUR GUTS OUT laying there on the floor yelling at Jillian, man it feels impossible but once you catch up to them it feels amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also, weight maintenance is even more important than weight loss! I did a little experiment, I did level 1 every day and ate like a pig and i gained ZERO POUNDS. as long as i was doing level 1 every day my weight stayed the same! This work out dvd is wonderful, i love it so much, i am recommending it to everyone left and right! Love it love it love it love it. This is the only work out dvd you will EVER need!

B005MMY5RK|5.0|I'm going to state something right upfront, and it's gonna be seen as snobby and uppity.  If you do not like character studies, black-n-white video, or stories that are always slow or, at best, on a low simmer, then you will most likely not enjoy this film at all.  So if you going to hate and be a troll about it, then go ahead and waste you time and life doing so.  Also, some people think this film is supposed to be a detailed and disguised bio-picture for the news-magnet William R. Hurst.  It is not.  The main character, Charles Foster Kane, has characteristics and a few parallels to the real-life Hurst, for sure, but the fictional character is his own unique voice and person.  Yes, Wells based parts of Kane on Hurst, but that does not mean they are equivalent.<br /><br />Why do I enjoy Citizen Kane and think it worthy of being in my personal top-twenty film lists:<br /><br />(1) I think the black-and-white cinematography is simply awesome in terms of eye-candy.  However, this type of candy isn't bad for your little gray cells.  Orson Wells, along with his team of film-makers, make this a perfect film to look at and get caught up into.  The spirit and tones it evokes are memorable to me, the two most outstanding ones being the Kane family log-cabin and the Kane mega-mansion Xanadu.<br /><br />(2) Soundtrack is great, evocative, and moody, ranging up and down the scale.<br /><br />(3) I actually like the character of Charles Foster Kane.  I find him interesting.  You see him boasting and standing on the  pinnacle of the world of success and power, and you also see him all the down the ladder to the stages of despair, rage, and despondency.  Basically, you actually see a normal human being in a unique position in life that most of us could only dream of achieving.<br /><br />(4) It's quasi-historical.  It shows you an aspect of a time period of the world and the United States that seems to be left out or forgotten by most media.

B007Y36K46|5.0|Just saw this and I must say I enjoyed this movie very much. There have been comparisons to Avatar and I get that. I liked this over Avatar though. You can easily say John Carter had cliches and it takes from other movies, but you can also say that about Avatar too. I guess the marketing people at Disney didn't know how to sell this and that's why it bombed, but give it a chance.  This should've made more money. It doesn't set itself for a sequel so I guess I won't be disappointed that there won't be another one but oh well. Cast was great. Special effects were good. Really liked this.<br /><br />And another thing totally unrelated. The whole time I was watching this I thought, man, Lynn Collins would make a good Wonder Woman.<br /><br />Edit: I'm not familiar with the source material, but I guess there is more story to this. Man I hope there are more sequels to this but after the box office performance it looks unlikely. Shame. I totally would've paid to see more.

B00846TRHY|5.0|(Contains minimal spoilers, but not much more than the trailer shows)<br /><br />Violence, Drugs, Alcohol, Obscene Language, and Sex. Just what every sold out, on-fire, Bible-thumping, Christian looks for when they want a good movie. Well, not exactly. When I first saw the trailer for Machine Gun Preacher my first instinct was, \\"Great. Another lame attempt to make a Christian movie.\\" But as I followed a little closer, I began to see that this movie was going to be different--way different.  Machine Gun Preacher is a movie based on the life of Sam Childers (played by Gerard Butler of the movie 300), a rough-around-the-edges former biker, former druggie, former convict, former woman abuser, former you-name-it. If you could conjure up something evil in your mind, chances are Sam Childers was involved in it. And the first twenty minutes of the Machine Gun Preacher film demonstrates this quite well. In fact, the movie introduces Sam as he is being released from prison and the very next scene shows Sam having sexual intercourse with his wife in their automobile (no nudity is shown). Next, we hear a battery of F-words uttered by Sam and then we see him belittling (and almost beating) his wife because she is no longer a stripper and has decided to change her life since she met Jesus. The next fifteen minutes or so of the movie can only be described as a hard-core, drug and violence filled drama that would send chills down the spine of every God-fearing Christian with any sense of morality. If I was to review just the first half-hour of this movie, I would say that it is absolutely unfit for anyone to watch. But thankfully that is not the end of this story.<br /><br />As the movie unfolds a little later, something happens to Sam and he has an encounter with the Lord, is baptized, and his life begins to change. We see Sam living a very different Christian life and loving his wife and daughter like a Christian husband and dad should. Then the moment that changes the film's direction even more comes into play. A missionary from Africa visits Sam's church and Sam is so impacted that he decides to go to Africa himself and volunteer to help build shelter for victims displaced in the region's civil war. But Sam never imagined what he would see on his short journey in war-torn Africa; it is absolutely unnerving to watch even a fictional version of what really happened...<br /><br />For example, Sam sees kids and women hunted down like animals for fun.<br /><br />He sees lips cut off of children and body parts blown off by explosions.<br /><br />He sees kids that were burned alive.<br /><br />The movie shows Sam being visibly shaken by the human-connived chaos that surrounds him, and rightfully so. As Sam contemplates what he has just seen, he makes a decision that will change his and his family's lives forever.<br />Upon his arrival back to the US, Sam tells his wife that he believes God has called him to make a difference in Africa. She is reluctant but ultimately gives him her blessing. When Sam returns to Africa and finds that he can't help the incomprehensible situation there by simply preaching or teaching or building village homes, John Rambo (oops, I means Sam)--the Machine Gun Preacher--puts on his cape and begins moving into action--but in a slightly more controversial manner.<br /><br />At this point, I won't give you any more adjectives to describe this film. All I can say is go rent or better yet, buy this movie. But beware; you may also be tempted to leave your life of comfort, grab your AK-47 and go kick some evil A%# (I mean booty--but if you can't handle reading an soft-edited A@%, then you definitely shouldn't watch this movie.)<br /><br />I am a prison minister and I will definitely be showing this movie to the guys at the prison. I am confident that they will be impacted for Christ.
0547569653|5.0|I'm a casual runner and competitive dancer. I had been a vegetarian for about 6 years and was thinking of going vegan. Scott convinced me. I loved reading how someone, thinks, eats and trains for extreme competition. I loved the personal stories of what he went through growing up, his relationship with his parents and how it helped shape him as an athlete. The stories of him and his best friend Dusty made me at times laugh until I cried. I felt I could identify with so much of his story (except I don't know if I will be running more than 10 miles anytime soon ;)) Bonus- His recipes are awesome! I made the Western states trail \\"cheese\\" spread today. Delicious!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|THis book was obviously written for sensationalism. At first I was intrigued  and shocked---but kept on reading out of curiosity- then it became \\"oh not all this sex again  where's the story ? \\"It does end wanting the reader to continue with book two-if only to see if the story line picks up.  It just seems so fairy tale, most handsome,  very, very rich, can fly a plane,sail a boat, own tons of houses, big business etc. yet he falls for a not too attractive shy non sexually active young woman--shades of Cinderella !!!! I know the authoress will make bags of money from this--and good for her-in fact if made into a movie (it will need tons of censorship) I  could see  the Aussie actor  Hugh Jackman playing the main role.  Any other suggestions from readers??????
B000XR4OC0|2.0|When I first got these toms, I was super excited. I had ordered a half size smaller than my size, and they fit perfectly. They were comfortable at first, but after walking around in them for a day or two my feet started to hurt because they have no arch support whatsoever. I put insoles in them, and they were fine again, but they quickly wore out after about the first week. The toms logo on the back is fraying, the soles are wearing down, and the canvas on the top is getting thinner and thinner. Maybe I just demand a lot of my shoes, but I am not happy with these and I won't buy them again.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Very useful free app. It will accurately show the strength of your wireless network in and around the house.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was curious to read this book since it is in the best seller list and so many people ask \\"did you read...\\"  I did not finish it because it has so much repeating of the same thing - okay I've got the idea.<br />I don't enjoy books where people are being mean to other people and this fell into that category for me. I also found it disturbed me, nor do I have any interest in reading the rest of the<br />trilogy. I am quite surprised at the huge appeal of this book, it is not particularly well written.

030758836X|5.0|I found this on Amazon while on vacation; actually was looking for something else good to read and looked for recommendations based upon other books I had read. I think this one came up as a book others who had bought Stephen King's 11/23/63 (which I also loved). Wow what a treat this book was. I can't add anything more than what others have written. The plot is unique and I really had trouble putting it down. Fortunately I'm on vacation!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had to read it after all the hoopla.  Interesting story, exciting to read and not nearly as offensive as some reviewers portrayed.  I have read more offensive books written back in the 70's. It left me wanting to know what happens next and was a quick read.  Yep, I bought the next one.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow. I just finished this a little while ago and I'm having trouble forming coherent thoughts. I have read a lot of books. Hundreds upon hundreds. And Slammed, is, without a doubt, one of the best I have EVER had the fortune of picking up. I expected this to be a good read- the reviews are gushing and I've been seeing it (and its sequel) everywhere for weeks now. But I honestly did not expect to find a new favourite. I don't think I'll be able to get this book out of my head for a long time.  It was phenomenal.<br /><br />The less you know about Slammed before you read it, the better. I was so delighted that the description didn't give away the main point, like so many descriptions tend to do. The mystery is exactly what is needed. When the revelation did come about- I was shocked. Stunned. I put down my Kindle and just tried to take it in. I hadn't seen it coming at all and that feeling was awesome! I definitely recommend not reading any spoiler-y reviews before starting this one. It's powerful to feel the full effects of the situation.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into a lot of detail. I will just say that this book is positively heartbreaking and it blew me away. I had barely started the book and I was already incredibly emotionally invested. There is so much going on in this novel, it was breathtaking. There are so many characters and they're ALL worth getting to know. Layken, Will, their brothers, Julia, Eddie... everyone. I felt so connected to them all by the time I finished the novel. It's like they were all old friends. They're all described and developed amazingly well.<br /><br />Obviously, I would recommend this to everyone! I'm so glad I decided to give it a go. It really is a complete gem of a book that left me amazed. It's sad and happy and hopeful all at once! I'm really looking forward to getting a start on the second book but I think I might need a little break first. This is one powerful book that seriously packs a punch! 5 stars doesn't even seem like enough!
1451627289|3.0|The idea was great and so was the research done, but the end left me wanting more of a resolution on time travel. The book ended on a more personal note than on the effects of time travel. It was surreal at times then down right too plain sometimes.
1609613937|3.0|I am reading McDougall's 1996 book about the same diet.

When youthful health peaks at 25, health is downhill gradually 'til death as hormones decline.  Many persons are now getting their hormones balanced and maintained at youghful levels, which helps them live healthy longer.

030788743X|3.0|'Ready Player One' is a decent book but by the end it relies too much on the reader delighting at the explicit references that pepper almost every page instead of concerning itself with deep characters or subtle themes. You could probably think of it in terms of being like \\"Who framed Roger Rabbit\\" in the way it tries to namedrop everything from \\"Back to the Future\\" to old D&D sourcebooks, but that film made the various cartoon characters feel like part of a larger, organic world; Cline's usage of external pop culture ends up feeling like little more than mechanical listings of Cline's favorite stuff or shoutouts to his friends. It actually gets annoying when, instead of creating an original environment, the book goes into page after page of how the character has found himself in the police station from \\"Blade Runner\\". You could say it's necessary to the book's feel but if you removed all the movie and videogame references, the whole work seems a little shallow. It doesn't help that one of the best parts of the entire thing is an unattributed riff on the soul crushing future presented in \\"Brazil\\". Cline has a  good grip of actual writing mechanics but expects the circular logic of the book \\"being like an 80's film\\" to cover up it's lack of a deep story or character development. A \\"shocking\\" reveal for a few characters is meant to substitute for depth in a few instances and the result is that the most interesting castmembers are one who barely appears and another who's dead long before the book really begins.<br /><br />This would probably make for an excellent gateway to other sci-fi books for kids but it's not the second coming of ambitious or even well-developed works in the genre. It also suffers from shamelessly being written to justify a film adaptation at times, something that can get kind of grating in its blatancy. 'Ready Player One' isn't a bad way to spend an afternoon or two but people can get blinded by a reference to their favorite piece of 80's apocrypha into mistaking this for something truly great.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is now one of my favorite apps! First and foremost, it's searchable, a crucial capability the dictionary that comes with the Fire lacks. But it's also a cool learning tool.

Thank you for such an excellent app!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Star Trek fans have chuckled for years how, on any away mission, you can be pretty certain that the red-shirted crew members aren't coming back to the ship (at least not alive).  If someone's going to die, it won't be Kirk and Spock.  It'll be poor Ensign Jones in his red shirt.  Scalzi pokes good-natured fun at that in Redshirts.<br /><br />The novel begins with the newest crew members coming aboard the starship Intrepid to begin their tours of duty.  At first, they notice how everyone seems to obsess about away missions.  Then, they realize that the more-veteran crewmen seem to vanish when the officers show up to staff an away team.  They also realize that a disproportionate number of their kind seem to be dying on away missions.<br /><br />Rather than sit back and wait for their numbers to come up, these crewmen set out to figure out what's going on.  Why are there so many deaths for low-ranking crewmen on the ship?  Why does a particular officer always get injured severely, and show up a week later completely healthy?  Why do enemy weapons always seem to strike particular decks on the ship?  These questions, and many more, are answered in the book.<br /><br />Once the main novel is finished, Scalzi present three \\"codas\\".  Each is written using a different literary point of view (first-person, second-person, third person), and presents a wrap-up of the story line for one of the minor characters mentioned in the book.  I can't tell you more without spoiling the stories, suffice it to say that they tie certain loose ends of the main story line up very neatly.<br /><br />Redshirts doesn't deliver wall to wall laughs, but I did laugh several times as I read it.  There are moments in the book that are touching, suspensful, silly, and dramatic... much like the shows the book pokes fun at.  I recommend the book.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I read a lot of fantasy but this is the first time that I have felt the need to write a review.  Not because I think my opinion is going to sway anyone's views (the book is only a buck-fifty, read it and decide for yourself), but I want to give credit where credit is due.<br /><br />  This story was wonderful.  Both the character and world development were well thought out and conveyed beautifully.  The story was gripping and sucked me in from beginning to end.  The action was fast-paced and the magics within the story were inventive but did not dominate the story.  Refreshingly, it was the growth and development of the main character and his brothers.  Another thing that makes this story somewhat unique is that it is written from the point-of-view of a biographer/historian dictating as the main character tells the accounts of his life.<br /><br />  This story deserves every bit of acclaim that the readers have posted.  Ultimately, I believe that it should be 5-star across the board.  The reviews that have given it a 4-star rating seem to be focused on the editing instead of the story itself and letting that sway their review.  As I wrote before; this book is only a buck-fifty.  Download it, read it and enjoy it.  It costs less than a latte and will be enjoyable for much, much longer.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of my favorite games on my KF. I love the run away from death monkeys kinda thing, and my sister and I love seeing who can collect the most coins and get the farthest. The fact that you can play this on your IPod, IPad, and on your Kindle Fire rocks. You should definetly get this game. And it is free!
B0079J28NW|2.0|Wow.  I was really looking forward to viewing the Blu-Ray - I had not seen the film for over 20 years.<br /><br />Technically, the transfer is excellent.  Content-wise, it was like putting on a pair of paisley bell bottom pants.  You look at it and think \\"What the hell is that?\\"<br /><br />The colors and graphics are vintage Peter Max style eye-exploding visuals.  The story and dialogue are mostly mumbles and nonsense.<br /><br />You might want to consider renting this - anybody want to buy my used copy?  Just viewed once!
B0086700CM|5.0|TEMPLE RUN is interesting because it has monkeys and it is active and there are amazing backgrounds in this app so I would say get TEMPLE RUN is not just interesting its wonderful amazing!
