B0070Y46UY|4.0|Enjoyable and thought-provoking. This was my Hurricane Sandy read by Kindle light, and I read it straight through. The ending was particularly well done. Read it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|First, I'm glad JK Rowling plunged in with a non-Harry Potter book, and avoided anything supernatural.  And i think she is a good writer, all things considered.<br /><br />That said, I wanted to like this book more than I did.  It had what appeared to be a simple premise:  in a small English town, a very popular, nice man dies suddenly, leaving a vacancy on the local council.  There are two factions trying to gain control of that council, and the fate of the local drug clinic hangs in the balance.  As the story goes on, there are a lot of layers in intertwined relationships, as people take sides in the election to fill the seat.<br /><br />There are a lot of characters, too, and the the story is written in third person omniscient.  And it's simply too much.  The transitions between one persons POV to another's are clunky, and the narration has to constantly TELL you how and what a particular character is feeling because you'd never be able to keep them straight otherwise.  And because there are so many characters, some of them related, the author felt the need to have every single one of them interact in some was with every other character, which often seemed contrived.<br /><br />My main disappointment, however, was in the fact that not one of the characters was likable.  The teenagers were all spawns of Satan, the wives were gossips, the husbands were weak or abusive, and everyone secretly hated each other.  Everyone was sarcastic, mean, hypocritical, hostile, and insulting.  They were unpleasant to read about, and I did, from time to time, start hoping for a natural disaster to wipe out the village completely.  Maybe if the story were told from only one or two characters' points of view (letting the reader figure out everyone's biases and issues as the novel went on, instead of constantly being outright told) or maybe if the characters had at least some redeeming features, maybe then it would have been a good read.<br /><br />I was relieved when I got to the end,which was sad but entirely without emotional resonance. I can't recommend this book.
1452110581|5.0|This is hilarious, as others have said. But the author is missing a real opportunity--he should offer a \\"signed\\" version!
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Quick read, but in need of some editing. Mediocre at best, honestly, but still a decent enough storyline to draw you in. A bit much with the violence at times. So you may want to steer clear if you're not into that kind of thing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy playing these games, but some are not as easy as you might think!  Great way to pass time while waiting for an appointment, or just killing time at home, these games will make time fly.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I have always enjoyed Michaels music and now have a much broader appreciation of all of his talents and passions due to the writing of Dr. Karen Moriarty.  She obviously has come to know him through her research, much the way we would come to understand and appreciate any historical person who passed without having known personally.  Thank you, Dr. Moriarty!!!!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I saw this book and downloaded it on a lark.  It turns out that I really enjoyed the author's style of writing and his dry sense of humor.  Worth reading for a fun book.

B002VPE1WK|2.0|The size of the backpack is perfect for a couple lenses and body.  My complaint is the seam on the side of one shoulder strap has separated about 2 inches and I had only been using it for about 2 weeks.  Since it's on the side the pack still works fine I'm just concerned about the quality and lifespan of the other seams.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I love John Grisham books, have read everyone and waited patiently for this one to come out. However, feel this one not nearly as good<br />as the others. It certainly is not A TIME TO KILL or even PELICAN BRIEF, which wasn't my favorite. Took about 50% of book to even get<br />into it and then only mildly interesting. Will finish but very disappointed!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Visually stunning and dark version of the originl tale makes it intriguing, but not the best movie. Lots of drawn out sequences that aren't ery well explained but lead to some good special effects. My bottom line is it was worth the 4 bucks to rent, but not 5.

0525958002|5.0|John Taylor covers a large span of music evolution in this autobiography of his life and that of Duran Duran, the rock group in which he still performs.  It is that diverse, evolving story that speaks volumes for the success he has achieved.  Yes, the audience may change, but the \\"real\\" audience has evolved with his talent and musical styles over the years.<br /><br />Taylor knows how to grab an audience. Right from the beginning, the reader is charged from the opening account of a concert performance in which the song \\"Tel Aviv\\" was played and Taylor confesses to being scared out of his mind at the almost animal atmosphere of the screaming, violent crowd.  How does one play and what is it about the music that creates such a wild response to the group's music?<br /><br />We are then led back even further to the very start of his life, through his education, interest in music at first without any thought about actually becoming a rock star, and more.  The terrific part of this next section is that he chronicles how the music evolved from simple chord music on acoustic guitar through the time of the Beatles through to rock music...to punk rock...., etc. For those who are older, it will bring back some great memories; for those who are younger, it might make them curious to check out the \\"older\\" music.<br /><br />Then comes the beginning Duran, Duran, playing as introductory music for other more famous singers and bands....then comes evolving success.  Plenty of unknown and fascinating details follow about different and better instruments that were used, as well as how the other band members adapted, left, and joined, leading up to the present band members.  There's a very riveting section on how drugs and booze almost blew the whole success chance out the window and a very painful part of how it broke him down. Fortunately, it didn't end there...<br /><br />Absolutely great biography about a singer, composer, producer and band leader who clearly is \\"passionate\\" beyond belief about his art.  Read it and enjoy the music you will hear and the interesting guy you will come to know so much better as you read!belief about his art.  Read it and enjoy the music you will hear and the interesting guy you will come to know so much better as you read!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book! It was better then any of the 50 shades books. Gideon is a great character better then Grey.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I found the ending to be a little to unbelievable. Two murder's on the same night??? The boy should have stayed in prison as an accomplice. They didn't make any of the characters into people you would like either...I mean you gotta like at least the victims, right?! It kept my attention though right from page one and I had to finish it, so that part was good.

B001FW58D6|4.0|I really like FRINGE. The show is like a cross between the \\"Twilight Zone\\" and \\"X Files\\". Aliens, alternate dimensions, shape shifters, government coverups are just part of the fun.<br /><br />Starring (Anna Tory) Agent Olivia Dunham and \\"consultants and father and son\\" Walter Bishop (John Noble) and son, Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) and (Jasika Nicole)Astrid as Olivia's FBI counterpart/assistant and Dr. Bishop's Keeper/helper. Most notable is Aussie (playing an American)John Noble(Lord of the Rings/Denethor) as the slightly deranged, but brilliant and formerly evil (before his 17 year stint in the St. Claires Mental hospital), Dr.Walter Bishop. Noble makes the show, he's so wonderfully loopy and unpredictably childlike. LOVE him.<br /><br />The \\"Fringe division\\" investigates bizare crimes and \\"Walter\\" is always good for laugh, a cry or a snicker either in the lab (with Jen, the cow) or at the crime scene. There are some pretty grossed out scenes and crazy concepts, never a dull moment. (only watched  seasons 1 & 2, so hope the fun lasts thru the following seasons)
B005BY3XHC|4.0|Dr. Chopra definitely knows the scriptures but is clearly a non-believer. The Truth is the Truth no matter what you believe. He may gain all the Dreams of this earthly life and yet miss the biggest success of all-- the gift of eternal life. A great resource for believers who want to study Christ's spiritual instructions for us as long as they use discernment in their study and verify the advice given with the truth in God's word.
B008PNBU30|5.0|Allow me first to say that three days grace is one of my favorite bands and I guess some of these reviews forced me to write one myself. It would be hard to say that they have ever had a bad CD and in my opinion they have came a long way since their 2004 self titled album. That being said life starts now was good but, not great and when I first listened to transit I wasn't floored. One my second listen I was certain this was up there with one X and I didn't like the reviews of people saying they haven't changed their sound enough or anything, well to put it simply that is their sound. Everyone can relate to the songs on this album if you let yourself. Give it another try and see what you think. It's not meant to be complex just crank it up and listen.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just received my Kindle Fire HD in October and our church had been promoting people to use their Iphone type items to go to You Verison to follow along with the Sunday sermon.  I tried it with my Kindle, got right on, it brought it up with just a click of the zip code and I found that several churches in our area are using the same process.  I would recommend this product to all.

0060012234|4.0|This was a really fast and easy read. It reminded me of a gay Mean Girls. I could see this done as a movie with voice overs and fantasy sequences. And it is happening! I hope they keep it to the early 2000s and don't make it modern. I want some music from a decade back! I will definitely watch this in theaters. There are also sequels that I will have to read!<br /><br />I liked the progression of this book. I thought the main character of Russell went through some interesting changes and they were gradual and believable. I thought the high school environment was believable, although I don't think such bullying went on at my high school, at least not among my friends. I was a freshmen in high school when this book came out. I wish there would have been more pop culture references, but this book could have happened any time in the past 30 years, except any later than the early 2000s and cell phones would have been more prominent.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of this book was Russ's inner dialogue. I loved being able to see why he did something. there were many actions he went though that wouldn't have had the same impact had I not have known his thought process. I also liked the way he would playfully refer to earlier in the book. I like when books casually break that fourth wall. It was like Russ was sitting there telling a story of his life to me.<br /><br />This book is full of many characters, representing people of all different kinds. I really enjoyed how the Brian Bund storyline played out.<br /><br />I give this novel a 4/5. It is a very easy, fast read. If you like coming-of-age high school stories involving the less than popular students, you will enjoy this book.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|At first it took a couple chapters to get into it, but once it started diving into the storyline and characters, I was hooked. I loved the suspense. Some of the details in the book disturbed me but it wasn't in a totally negative way because it sheds light on real life situations that we may or may not personally relate to. I found it fascinating and hard to put down at 12am when I knew I should be sleeping. haha<br />I definitely recommend it because it is a great read and was written really good. Buy it! :)
B00785P2QC|2.0|I have been playing Virtual City for several days now and loving it, so I decided to try out Virtual City Playground. I was expecting it to be just a free build version of the original game. For the most part I was right. However the gameplay is severely slowed down in comparison to the original. This is presumably to exploit people's impatience to get them to spend money on in-game credits to speed things up. Not only that, but it constantly tries to get you to post things on Facebook for tiny rewards. The worst thing is probably the horrible user interface. It's completely cluttered and often makes it difficult to see what's actually going on in the game because it covers up so much of the screen (especially the two rather large buttons that open menus for purchasing &quot;city credits&quot; or &quot;investment points&quot; using real money).<br /><br />Overall, I was sorely disappointed by this game. The core Virtual City gameplay it there, but it's just too slow to be fun in this money grubbing mess.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Absolutely amazingly creepy!  One of the most original series (especially these days) that provides ample doses of horror, romance, and horrific romances!  Great show.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book really developed characters Gideon and Eva. I was sad when it was over and am excited about #3!

B000SEGUDE|1.0|The first story, in the Kindle edition, ends in the middle of a sentence.  I think there has been a mistake.  I wish I had gotten the print edition.  Now I am stuck not knowing how the first story ends, and I'm not going to bother to find the next error.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is amazing. It really brings you to feel how each demigod really is. It is also a wonderful adventure! (With a bit of romance to!!!)
0062127241|5.0|My perspective: As one of the millions of Baby Boomers, this book is just perfect. I love rock-n-roll. Remain a huge Beatles fan to this day. I began to appreciate The Who when I arrived at college and had a British room mate, who explained the Who's role in the British Invasion. Pete Townshend is an absolute genius. I sort of understood that before I read the book. But, in order to really understand, you have got to read it, cover to cover. If you love rock-n-roll, this is an absolute page turner.<br /><br />As a guy that has been talking about The Who's performance at Woodstock for the past 43 years, this book has provided me with the back story. I understand where it all came from.<br /><br />If you were blown away when the British rock groups invaded the USA, this book is a must read.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It has had a few weird twists so it will be interesting to see how this season ends. I would have taken the story down a different road. Interesting plots and some mind bending killings I wish had not happened but it is a thriller, horror, and suspense film.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I recieved this movie in perfect condition & thouroghly enjoyed watching it! I bought it as an inspiration for my paintings - I love the old scenes of the English Moors. The DVD is double-sided, one side for wide screen and the other side for normal viewing. The movie does not feature any behind-the-sceens footage or extras.
1416550534|4.0|In June, 1914, a fourteen year old naïve girl went to work as a housemaid.  Grace began her service at Riverton, Lord and Lady Asbury's country mansion, much as her mother had done before her.<br /><br />This historical and fictional novel was written through the first-person account of Grace Bradley, who at 98 was finally ready to confront the secrets she had been keeping for most of her life.  The opportunity to tell all arose when she was approached to share her memories for a documentary covering the lives and the tragedy of those living at this English country estate between 1914 and 1924.<br /><br />This project was the reason Grace decided to share the memories about her time at Riverton and the devastating tragedy that occurred there.  She was approached by a young woman by the name of URSULA from the US.  It is not initially obvious, but Ursula had familial connections to this English family.  To say more on that would reveal a very heart-wrenching part of the entire story.<br /><br />It is through Grace's eyes that the lives of David, Hannah and Emmeline Hartford are revealed in the course of her memory recordings for her grandson Marcus.  The House at Riverton has two timelines--one taking place in 1999 with the making of the documentary, and the other in the in the early 20th century, around the time of the breakout of WWI.<br /><br />This romantic tragedy breaks your heart and gets into your head. The characters come to life as this time and place in history unfolds. Among the mysteries and secrets Grace reveals to cleanse her conscience are who her parents really were, the torrid love affair of one of the Hartford sisters, and the life she herself led in silence.  Watch for the veiled genealogical connection between Ursula and the Hartfords.<br /><br />Class separation, tragedy, romance, and dulled humor are packaged into this novel and it draws you into a time period that we still romanticize to this day.  Just for a while, you will be living back atthe turn of the century and looking at life very differently than what we do today and from a very different perspective.<br /><br />What a great book to curl up with and dream the day away.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Cara Elder<br />Poolside Book Reviews
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I NEVER HAD MUST TIME, I THOUGHT TO SIT DOWN TO READ THE WORDS GOD LEFT BEHIND FOR OUR LIFE'S INSTRUCTION AND GENERAL KNOWLEDGE. WITH THIS APPLICATION I CANT MAKE EXCUSES
B004NOH9LC|5.0|Morning Glory is fun from start to finish.  Rachel McAdams plays Becky Fuller, a young, up-and-coming, newly hired executive producer of a morning show.  It's her enthusiasm that got her the job, even when everyone from the network exec who hired her down to the security guard in the lobby expects her to be just another throw-away \\"EP\\".<br /><br />McAdams' rendition of the Becky Fuller character contains so much gusto, positive energy and plain old determination that the audience is drawn into the story of this pretty young thing beating all the odds.  Of course, this is just a fairy tale.  Who would actually go along with such an upbeat concoction as Becky Fuller?  I mean, nobody in real life could keep standing up with a smile after so many punches, right?<br /><br />Well, that's what we tell ourselves.  We're simply too sophisticated to be suckered into a yarn about a punch-drunk heroine.  But that's just the point.  Becky Fuller speaks to each and every one of us who, deep in our hearts, wants to work hard, do the right thing, and literally turn the world around.<br /><br />To prove the point, Becky is pitted against Mike Pomeroy, played by Harrison Ford.  Pomeroy is not just a grumpy has-been news reporter.  A has-been is any star or starlet who has outlived his or her glory days and is kept around as an act of charity.  No, Pomeroy lives up to the title of the third-worst person in the world, so much so that he is in a class by himself.  And that is just how he wants it.  He would rather look down his nose at anyone not able to live up to his standards.  Quick to insult, willing to sabotage an entire production, he is content to gird himself in misery.  Nobody, but nobody is going to tell this award-winner what to do.<br /><br />This is a classic good-and-evil story.  Becky will do her best to make \\"The Daybreak Show\\" a success, while Mike will, with equal determination, refuse to do anything that might keep the ship from going down in flames.  We want Becky to win, as she has already won us over.<br /><br />But where she represents the best in us, Mike represents an equally believable opposite side of our nature.  We have all seen bitter people who would rather cut off their noses to spite their faces.  At some level, we each worry that we, too, could become such a whipped person who has no other purpose than to punish everyone we meet.<br /><br />Both characters are exaggerations.  Yet both speak to us.  That is what stories are for, to take small truths and magnify them into freakish oddities.  McAdams and Ford are up to the job as they play Becky and Mike to the hilt.  That is good acting.<br /><br />This movie is something more than good acting, however.  It's all meant in fun.  There is a quiet humor about every single thing in the Morning Glory story.<br /><br />Aline Brosh McKenna, the woman who wrote this story, knows television, and she knows humor.  It all seems so serious to the often pompous players in the industry.  But God looks upon all those trivialities and laughs and laughs.  Mostly God laughs at how serious they think it all is.<br /><br />So, watching this movie, you get to laugh.  And laughing, you get to feel a little bit like God.<br /><br />I hope you smile and laugh as much as I did watching this movie.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|My inital review of this show was one star, but I decided to give it another chance.  Glad I did.  Mad Men is very involving, and with each episode I watch it pulls me in deeper and deeper.  The fact that most of the action occurs in the office and few other places makes it seem like you are watching life inside a goldfish bowl.  The acting is great, although it sometimes flags a bit, but the writing is superb.  I already have Season Two waiting to be viewed after I finish with Season One.  I'm very glad I was wrong about Mad Men.  It's great.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Wes Anderson is hit-or-miss for me - I liked [[ASIN:B005HK13SG Rushmore]] and [[ASIN:B003MXD694 Fantastic Mr. Fox]], but didn't care for [[ASIN:B006C0AT9O The Life Aquatic]] or [[ASIN:B004LL86WS The Royal Tenenbaums]]. I even watched the trailer for this first, and wasn't sure I was going to like it. However, I was pleasantly surprised. \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is a really good movie - fun, heartwarming, yet quirky (as you would expect from and Anderson movie.)

B009A9BF5G|1.0|Just arrived via UPS and it went right into PS3 and I am literally dumbfounded how bad this is. I have Glastonbury recorded to my DVR and NONE of this footage even comes close to HD footage, in fact it is worse than some home movies I have seen. Very grainy and the video is jumping all over the place. What in the world were they thinking when they produced this with the video jumping all over the place every second, it is nauseating. The music is probably the biggest disappointment considering this is BluRay and it should sound exceptional. Why in the world did you turn down all the backround noise from the live audience? Not only that you turned it down so much that the lead singers voice is not even clear it is muffled. Another thing I noticed was some of the footage was not synced correctly, in other words the video was not matched up with the audio and you could tell by reading lips. Then during the Glastonbury footage the music is not the same as what happened in the concert, it is different from the HD video I have recorded from PaladiaHD. This is a gigantic embarrassment for such a good band that has such great sounding live music to try and sell such a piece of garbage like this. Do yourself a favor and record the Glastonbury footage in HD and pass on this junk. Attempting to pass this off as something a professional produced is just laughable. I  also tried the CD which is ok I guess but still would be better with no modification at all and replayed as if it were live. Returning ASAP.

1609611543|5.0|If you are on the fence about reading this, pull the trigger. Not only was this a great read (at times, a little scientific for a gal like me) but it was a HUGE eye opener to the detriments of wheat. As you can see by the length of other reviews, amazing results happen when you cut wheat out of your diet. As a pretty healthy, over 40 triathlete, I thought I'd read it for kicks to get healthier. I not only am the leanest and healthiest I've ever been, my skin issues (itchy scalp and back) and the arthritis in my neck are gone! After thinking it was shampoos, or sleeping on my stomach, the simple act of wiping out wheat had made such a drastic difference. I don't miss it! And don't miss this great information. Read the book and pass the information along!
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Better than most of the drivel coming out of Hollywood these days. Ironic, sarcastic, funny, biting, witty and enticing. \\"We come in peace!\\" - sounds like something we'd hear from certain parties who will be unnamed today \\"We come in peace!

B009WO7NQO|5.0|First off, let me say that I am not a hardcore mobile gamer, but I love me some Angry Birds. The first AB was simply amazing. But every other AB, excluding Space, used the same gameplay formula. It got a little repetitive. I guess the old addage held true: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. AB Space was the first to break the formula. And it was amazing. Let me just say, AB Star Wars is as ground breaking as it is fun. It mixes the gameplay of the original AB with that of AB Space. It a perfect balance of both. And the birds each have their own abilities. I won't go into that much detail about it though, you'll have to play it to see. And they used the Star Wars license perfectly. It tells (in a roundabout way) the story of Episode IV A New Hope, with Hoth coming soon, and includes the Path of the Jedi DLC. While I agree that $2.99 is a little steep in price, I must say that it is definitely worth it, especially to fans of past AB games and to Star Wars fans. Rovio has outdone themselves with this one.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Oh yah the good guys get it together and come out with lots of forethought and precision . Always enjoy John Grisham and this is no exception,He's done it again .This keeps you wanting more Love that the main character is Black and just another guy who has tried to do it the right way.It's a good read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I first got quell with the kindle fire first generation and I loved the game so much, I got Quell reflect.  I went through all the levels in Quell and was trying to get the  perfect score for each level. Well, I got the kindle fire hd and lost Quell.  It did not transfer.Broke my heart.  So I've been checking frequently for the past few months and I finally got it back a few days ago.  I'm in love with Quell all over again.  The game started over but that's fine with me.  An amazing game that truly keeps the mind pleasantly busy.  Love it!<br />Now that I reviewed it.......no more facebook and no more popups.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 keeps you on your toes and the edge of your seat! Can't wait to see more! The quality of the $1.99 version is just fine, so don't waste another buck just to get hd unless you truly care about that aspect.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Being a fan of the Angry Bird series, I was starting to think it was getting a bit repetitive.  Star Wars added enough to it to keep it interesting...Keep up the great work
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This was a fabulous concert DVD/CD; made me feel like I was almost there.  Having both DVD and CD, I can keep one at home and one in my car.  Adele is bloody brilliant.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching Downton Abbey. We will be sad when we've completed watching all of Season 1&2. I will be placing an order for Season 3 when it comes out in January. Great entertainment!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Like going to the different locations in this match three game and acquiring the relics on some levels can be quite challenging.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it's good for 5-10 minutes of play at a time. Don't think this will fill up your day. It's nice that your buildings produce income while the game is minimized.
0525953728|1.0|This rating reflects the book itself, not the real life actions that without, would have made this fictional.  It is also my rating on the people that brought this book to fruition.  What part of the Navy Seal pledge makes this book okay to write and talk about?<br /><br />\\"My loyalty to Country and Team is beyond reproach. I humbly serve as a guardian to my fellow Americans always ready to defend those who are unable to defend themselves. I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions. I voluntarily accept the inherent hazards of my profession, placing the welfare and security of others before my own.\\"<br /><br />The same holds true for helping Electronic Arts create their new game\\"Medal of Honor Warfighter\\".  Has selfishness escalated to the point of discussing training and tactics with folks not in the need to know?  This is a disgrace to all Navy Seals, the Department of the Navy and the U.S. military in general.  Personally I take some offense being a former active duty member of the Marine Corps.  The writer and affiliates should be ashamed and held responsible for their actions, these people have no loyalty.  Giving back four years of my life to this country for keeping me free for the prior 18 years was something I felt I should do.  At no point did I ever think I should share what I learned with anyone except those that needed to know.  I would expect even higher standards for those that endure and pass Navy Seal training.
0525478817|5.0|If you want to read a novel about two teenagers with cancer, this is the one for you. Although the subject matter is serious, John Green manages to occasionally leaven it with humor. The book had to compete with Hurricane Sandy for my attention the past two days and the fact that I couldn't put it down speaks to its excellence.<br /><br />John Green is the co-author of \\"Will Grayson, Will Grayson,\\" another fine book. I urge you to read that, also.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|Not as good as No.1 , but always interesting and fresh. They're great at what they do, but I confess, I'm a blues guy so to me other music is on tier 2.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great tool. It's ability to capture thoughts, ideas, web pages etc., really help me stay on top of things.
B0054N73EY|1.0|Yet another great set of songs hampered by terrible, ear fatiquing, inexusable audio quality. When oh when do we get to go back to proper recording 101? The sad thing is most people don't even know what good sound is or that the cd they are listening to sounds like sh!t. Recording/mastering in the last 5 years is worse than it has ever been. How can this be with so much technology? Why must we cater to a $10 set of earbuds? Systemic degradation just like everything else in this \\"circling the drain\\" country.<br /><br />P.S. The music is great. The audio sucks. Shame shame on the IDIOT in charge of the mastering on this one.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I personally felt the language was rather excessive. The same point could have been made without the overused F**** word.<br />The book got more interesting as the characters developed and interacted.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Probably around eight to nine years ago I picked this book up for the first time. It was my very first Dan Brown book and I remember thinking it was fantastic. It forced me to read all of his other books: The Davinci Code, Angles and Demons, The Lost Symbol,and Digital Fortress. I decided a few weeks ago that I wanted to start re-reading some Dan Brown's works, to see if they still interested me as much as the first time.<br /><br />If you have read any of his other books, with Robert Langdon, and anticipate the same sort of story telling, this is not the book for you. This book focuses on a much more scientific story involving a meteor that NASA finds. Combined with the science is a political storm for the presidency of the United States. As the title alludes to, there is a lot of deception and you honestly have no idea what is really true until the final chapters of the book.<br /><br />If you go into this book without the expectation of symbols and secret societies, you will enjoy this book. This book is full of so many plot twists, actions, science,and technology that you will likely not want to put it down.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a bigger fan of his Robert Langdon works over his independent books, which is why I only gave this four stars. However, I do really hope they turn this book into a movie at some point, like they have done with his others.
0345803485|1.0|Like everyone else a friend told me YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK. IT'S AWESOME. So she lend me the books (no investment on my part) and I read them.<br /><br />The Okey.<br />Super cliché story, girls falls for super billionaire and he loves her back despite of all of his twistyness . A lot of selfesteem issues for both parts and every one ends up happy ever after. The only reason I finish the books was curiosity. Oh, one thing I actually enjoyed was the emails. The titles and the signatures. (Not enough to save a book tho.)<br /><br />The bad.<br />Everything is repetitive, I was very close of slapping her inner goddess. Very unreal, and a lot of plot holes. The sex scenes may have been fun at first but then I found may self skipping them completely. The constantly use of the same words. I was \\"wanton\\" and the eye rolling, and the smirking and the grind and groans. Just ugh. Boring. And it's a very unrealistic book. No one can have that much sex. Just made me feel bad.<br /><br />Read it if you're bored and have tons of free time and don't want to use your brain for a couple hours.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This product was amazing. It contained all the material you need to see if you are into Led Zeppelin. It's amazing how much you can learn just from watching a band performing. I was particularly pleased about the Danish TV performance in 1969. It is actually one of the main reasons why I bought this. You can see the band developing and how the audience changes throughout the years. In this particular performance, you can appreciate how this group of unamused teenagers soon change into a rock n' roll mood, just by watching Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product. You will learn a lot from the band, both from the performances and from the interview. The quality is outstanding in my opinion (you have to take in account it was shot over 40 years ago. Definitely a must for a Led Zeppelin fan.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I've been following the recommendations in this book, with great results.  I own about eight books on nutrition, and this one does the best in explaining the science behind the foods we eat (good and bad).<br /><br />I'm on day 26 of the Whole30 program, and I didn't find it unsustainable or expensive.  I didn't feel the increased energy that other people have reported, but I do feel consistently better throughout the day, with no energy crashes after meals or in the afternoon.  Also, I have less aches and pains after workouts.  I've gone down a belt-size, and my workout performance has improved.<br /><br />I have never heard of these authors before buying this book, and only picked it up based on a co-worker's recommendation.  The book truly does deserve all the 5 star ratings it has been getting.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I did not like this app, but I think it is a matter of taste, it is free, so you can try it, and if you dont like it, delete it. I prefer Bubble Shoot, for example.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very fun and very addictive game. I too have been waiting for kinds to get this game. I am so glad they did. All my friends are so good at this game and now maybe I can be good to!!!
B005HSL626|3.0|You can try it, it is for free. I prefer Bubble Shoot for example. I tried this one, but many times it took very long to load and I found it quite boring. But this is a matter of taste, so check it out for yourself.
B001GQO50I|4.0|It's no secret that the sound quality on this CD set is only so-so. But despite the sub-par audio, I found this Matrix performance to be a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Many of these songs I have rarely or never even heard on any of the Doors other live performances. Songs such as 'Unhappy Girl', 'Twentieth Century Fox', and 'People are Strange' were a treat to hear in a live setting.<br /><br />What's especially neat is hearing a young and driven Jim Morrison. His voice sounds fresh and alive. In between songs he even thanks the audience members(the few that were there that night).<br /><br />Also the price of this set has remained consistently high relative to the audio quality contained within. Hopefully a better version of this energetic performance will be released soon.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'm extremely happy with this game plus it's free. It's just like perfect. I also like how it's like what you find at the game places without having to spend any real money.
1591841666|4.0|This very short book offers excellent insight on to how to decide whether or not something is worth pursuing, whether something is worth the effort, and our general attitudes towards the act of \\"quitting\\".<br /><br />I love how Godin systematically attack's Vince Lombardi's \\"quitters never win, winners never quit\\" quote, as that advice has never, ever made sense to me, even when I was young. In a world where the most successful businessmen (Gates and Jobs, specifically) were dropouts, the book appealed greatly to people who always felt there was something wrong with \\"the system\\".<br /><br />I would recommend however, that anybody who starts reading this book continue on to Seth Godin's equally excellent book \\"Linchpin\\", as some of the shortcomings of this really short book are adressed there
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Love this CD. It's upbeat, and I like to listen to positive music. There are some good messages in the lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Peacock\\" is one of my favorite songs. There aren't enough 'male-affirming' things out there, and it was refreshing this was put to such an upbeat tune. I don't view sexual things as \\"evil,\\" \\"dirty,\\" or \\"wrong,\\" so why should she? I don't understand the whole CD/person being judged just because of a song.
B006TQV4CW|5.0|Linchpin is a great call to action for passionate people who want and know how to make a difference in the world. It's calling out on the \\"sheeple\\" who merely go by with their day-to-day activities without aim or purpose, and it calls on everyone to make a difference in their work to find fulfillment and happiness.<br /><br />This book is a deeply thought-out anti-thesis to Michael E. Gerber's \\"The E-Myth Revisited\\". It posits that merely \\"showing up\\" and \\"doing what the boss asks\\" is the easiest way to create a mediocre product and business, and explains the motivations of people who are deeply successful with their work and career.<br /><br />However, the book is very, very difficult to read in its central section defining \\"The Resistance\\". In these chapters Godin tries to explain the reasons and root of the lack of motivation people face, and their hindrances to success, or a successful attitude. The problem with this part of the book is that you could literally feel the pain and anger Godin was feeling as he was writing those chapters. It was anything but smooth reading, on a subject about why people don't face smooth sailing through success.<br /><br />This does not in any way diminish the value of the book, however -- I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to have a deeper understanding about the dynamics of success and the motivations of people who want to make a genuine difference in their world.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Wanted Man started out a little slow and I wasn't sure where it was going. After the first few chapters it began to make sense and proceeded in true Jack Reacher style. This title wasn't as good as some of his others but it wasn't bad and kept my interest going to the end.
0321344758|5.0|Awesome book on usability, UI design, UX, without any specific target platform. While written primarily for the turn-of-the-millennium web, all the principles discussed in this book are soundly applicable to desktop, mobile, Web 2.0 and possibly even future user interface environments. Easy read for developers who aren't familiar with UI design either.
B00127RAJY|5.0|So here's my story: I am a petite 30-year-old woman. 5'1\\". All through college and my young adulthood, I weighed between 110 and 118 and fit into Size 2 and 4. Then I got pregnant. Luckily, I lost the pregnancy weight very quickly while I was breastfeeding. Seriously, the breastfeeding just seemed to melt the weight away. I was eating like a hobbit - two breakfasts, two lunches, lots of snacks, lots of sweets, whole-milk yogurt (which is the MOST delicious thing), and I wasn't gaining any weight. I wasn't working out while I breastfed, either; I guess making enough milk to feed my enormous baby burned enough calories to keep the weight off. (**Long pause while I gaze misty-eyed in the distance, daydreaming about the glory days of breastfeeding and how much I got to eat.**) THEN I weaned the baby when he was a year old, and BOOM, I gained 15 pounds in two months. I started working out again 4 to 5 times a week and moderated my diet, but I still wasn't losing the weight I had gained. I felt terrible; my clothes didn't fit, and I wasn't sleeping well.<br /><br />I have been doing the 30-day shred for 2.5 weeks. I have lost 5 pounds, and I am feeling so much better. My clothes fit again, so I know I have lost inches, though I did not keep track of that. And I am sleeping better too.<br /><br />I like the workouts. They are challenging but the moves are simple enough for anyone to do - no complicated routines that require a dancer's grace or a good memory. Jumping jacks. Butt kicks. High knees. Even my husband, who generally does not like aerobics, likes this workout. And seriously, they are only 20 mintues long! This is maybe my favorite part. I can roll out of bed at 6:15, toodle around for a while, start my workout at 6:30 and be showered before 7:00 a.m.! Hoooooooray!!!<br /><br />Also, I tore my right ACL in college, and I had the repair surgery, but I did not do enough physical therapy because I did not have insurance. My right knee still gives me trouble sometimesand gets stiff on long car rides, during movies, etc. and just sometimes gets wonky and painful. But so far, so good, while doing the 30-Day Shred. I have not had any pain or wonky episodes. So hopefully this means I am doing the moves correctly.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this workout.
1451648537|5.0|The life of Steve Jobs is bound to be fascinating, but the way it has been written down by Walter Isaacson can be defined by one word: honesty. With all brutal honesty we not only see how Apple's products became hit successes, but how the man behind it was wrought with pain. He was kicked out of the company he founded at a young age, and while he was able to return, it was replaced by the pain of suffering through an illness he could have defeated if not for his beliefs.<br /><br />If anybody wants to understand how Steve became Steve, and not just why, and how Apple succeeded despite his divisive, mercurial personality, then this book is a must-read.

0887307280|3.0|This book is great at explaining why a lot of small businesses never make the jump from small, self-employed operations to big corporations. Learning lots from it so far, and finding out what my own dominant persona is between \\"The Technician, The Entrepreneur and The Manager\\".<br /><br />While the central tenet of the book leans heavily on \\"creating a system for your business to be awesome\\", and while I agree that a system indeed has to be created, I found myself cringing quite a few times every time the \\"image\\" of a system comes into my mind. That's because our encounter with this business systems -- complete with the \\"scripted spiels\\" advice that is repeated several times in the book -- has largely been negative.<br /><br />Far too many times I've heard of a script being applied to me that makes totally no sense in the context of the problem I'm trying to solve, whether it's a support call for my bank, credit card, web host, or other products. These companies have \\"the system\\" that Michael Gerber seems to worship so much -- but they simply turn me off in knowing that a robotic scripted spiel is being applied to me.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I absolutely love my kindle cover! I am a lover of \\"old books\\" and this gives it that old world look that it so pretty! Protects it well also<br />Thanks!!!
0316017930|4.0|I love Oultiers in the way it confirms something that we've all suspected all along -- that certain people will be predisposed to our traditional notions of success than others. In retrospect this somewhat summarizes the story of human political structures -- why monarchies prevailed, and why they still exist in the form of political \\"dynasties\\" in certain countries, or why dictators exist. It's all the story of how a combination of environmental factors complements genetic lineage in an unexpected way, and how some people will inadvertently have a better shot at success than others.<br /><br />However a major \\"plot hole\\" in this book, in my opinion, is the way how some people who did NOT have any of those inherent environmental factors succeeded. While this book explains how the likes of Robert Oppenheimer succeeded, it does not explain how the likes of Manny Pacquiao -- whose lineage, environment and cultural inclinations are all stacked *against* him succeeding, was able to do his thing.<br /><br />Maybe that's subject for another book, but it doesn't make Outliers any less worth reading.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book is typical Grisham.<br />For me it was a good enjoyable read.  However, as much as I enjoy Grisham's books (and I have read many of them)I did not feel that it was one of Grisham's best.

0307592731|5.0|I was given Wild to read by a woman hiker friend of mine, otherwise, I had never heard of either the book, or its author (I also did not know this book had been previously posted on Oprah's 'recommended' bookclub list, as I lost track of Oprah, once her TV show stopped airing) Anyway, here's my take on it: The book was raw, honest and heartwarming, all at the same time. Strayed writes in such a way that the reader is instantly drawn into her world, and can put themselves into her shoes; I had heard of people hiking on the Pacific Coast Trail/PCT, but have never personally known anyone who has hiked it. After reading her book, I learned alot about the PCT, at the same time as being drawn into Strayed's hiking escapades, and learning intimate details about her past life. She talks candidly about both good and bad things that have happened to her, and I loved the way she weaved in PCT details with stories about her past life, and how her past life circumstances led her to take the arduous PCT journey in the first place. As a woman, I both admired and feared for Strayed for taking on such an incredible (and dangerous, in many ways), challenge, which was hiking the PCT by herself over several months. She also shares with us wonderful stories about all the different and colorful characters she meets along the way; it seems she somehow knew deep inside that embarking on this type of challenging journey would help her find answers and solace to many unresolved issues and conflicts from her past life-(she was just short of 27 when she began the PCT hike). I won't spoil it by telling you how it turns out, but I highly recommend you to pick up a copy of this book - You won't be disappointed.

1423140605|5.0|The Roman and the Greek camps have always been divided because the Gods and Goddesses themselves have been divided. In the third installment of The Heroes of Olympus called The Mark of Athena, Rick Riordan brings the biggest sections of the world's mythology together in a way no other author could.<br /><br />Now that the two camps know about each other, New Rome and Camp Half-Blood, the group from Half-Blood travel to New Rome in an attempt to collect Percy Jackson, their missing hero. They suspect the Roman demigods will have to team up with the Greek demigods in order to keep evil Gaia from reforming and wreaking havoc on earth, but convincing two sides who have always hated one another to cooperate is harder than beating Medusa, or two disco giants, or crazed sea gods who collect monsters. When New Rome thinks the group of demigods has come to harm them, they attack Leo's ship and send the seven from the prophecy running to escape.<br /><br />Once they are out of range of New Rome's weapons, the group realizes they have a bigger mission than Gaia- Hazel's brother Nico has been trapped and is quickly running out of time before he suffocates. They must find two evil giants who work for Gaia in order to get him back, but that is easier said than done. meanwhile Annabeth must follow the Mark of Athena, but any children of Athena who have gone before her were lost forever, unsuccessful in their mission. With so much riding on this journey, including Nico's life, the demigods begin to feel the pressure of their mission. Will they get to Nico in time, or will saving the world require some sacrifice?<br /><br />OK, it is absolutely no shock to anyone that anything Riordan writes is pure genius. If you made it this far, you are a total Riordan freak like myself and would read his grocery lists scribbled on old tissues if he let you. But there is more to  this series these days. So I won't convince you to read these books (because if you haven't already you are missing out!), but I will tell you about the interesting turns in this book.<br /><br />First, I loved how the mission became so much more serious. There were always issues with death and near death experiences, but the seriousness of this particular mission tangled with the relationships that have formed amongst the group make the stakes much higher. And Percy Jackson, who was missing from the first part of the series, really evolves in this book. He feels left out when other demigods go to speak to the ancient sea gods and is resentful of his inability to help the group. It was a realistic portrayal of this group's age and dynamic, and I think it really drove the series to a place it has never been until now: maturity. It has been fun (hilarious actually), educational (although is getting my mythology from these books like getting my news from the Daily Show?!), and exciting, but these books have always been a little young. Now they are growing up, and you had better get to them before they are gone!t!), but I will tell you about the interesting turns in this book.<br /><br />First, I loved how the mission became so much more serious.

B000VPUIA6|5.0|Just picked this beatles help deluxe edition dvd up 2 weeks ago at best buy for 99 cents, the price tag said $119.99 but at the register it rang up for 99 cents, it wasn't in a clearance bin just sitting on a normal shelf next to other music box sets. The person working at the cash register was shocked!  The box set has yellowed a bit due to sitting on the store shelf for 5 years. Very nice looking set that has the script, book, cards, and a huge poster. When I opened it up the dvds were not in the spindle holes and were just laying on the sides of the packaging, must have fell out, but they weren't damaged. Can't go wrong at that price!

1608871517|5.0|I am so impressed with this book. It has very high quality photographs on each page, along with stories about experiences that Michael Bush had with Michael Jackson. The stories are very interesting and well written. I laughed a lot while reading the antics M.J. had about how he would probe Bush to come up with innovative ideas for his clothing and accessories. I also enjoyed getting another person's perspective on Michael, especially someone who worked so closely with him and for such a long period of time. There are so many treasures in this book. It is a MUST HAVE for ANY Michael Jackson fan (or Michael Bush fan).
0385535147|1.0|Simply not a very good book at all.  I was disappointed.  It lacked any urgency.  Plodded along barely delving into Rule 35.  The protagonist was intensely dislikeable.

B0085RQLXK|1.0|Music From Another Dimension...is just sad. Not to mention bad. Like many others I had high hopes when I heard Jack Douglas was involved but then when I heard Carrie Underwood, Johnny Depp, outside songwriters involved, then the godawful American Idol debut of the first song, I knew. So I didn't buy it but listened to a (equally disappointed) friend's copy.  I saw them at the Hollywood Bowl recently...500 bucks for two tickets face value and just a lame, overblown self-indulgent gig--a bass solo! a drum solo! a brad solo! a joe solo! etc.  Tyler just repulses me at this point.  I would also add that I saw Joe Perry's solo band at both The Viper Room in Hollywood and out in the desert when they toured a couple years ago.  THAT was a rock n roll show! Joe alone with his own guys is like a punk band--faster and louder up the wazoo.  I'd fly across the country to see them.  I wouldn't walk across the street again to see Aerosmith.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|i dont like they way this app functions. extremely glitchy, hands down problematic app ever! You can press one thing and something else opens that you didnt put your finger on. shows wrong profile pictures next to my notifications. Its hard to believe facebook or amazon would even market this app as usable. please please fix!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Although AGoT is not THE best book in the ASoIaF, it is superb on an epic scale. The descriptive way GRRM paints the backdrop and characters literally transports you to Westeros. I initially digitally borrowed AGoT from library, but after reading it and subsequent books, I had to own it!  I am now rereading the whole series with a different perspective. GRRM alludes to so much, in dreams, flashbacks, and prophecies its easy to miss a huge amount given the size of the series and depth and relationships of constantly changing characters. I am seeing a lot more the 2nd time around.
1451695195|5.0|I seldom give 5 stars for anything but this book caused me to sit and wonder if Heaven is real. I think you will feel the same. The author puts it out for us to make the decision. Give it a try...I think you would agree with me.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I know a lot of the die hard Marvel fans say this movie wasn't any good but I disagree completely. I thought they did a great job making it a stand alone movie combined with all the necessary parts needed to set up the avengers with the intro of shield and the characters black widow and Nick Fury. Plus anytime you can see RDJ as Tony Stark its great! Also the intro of war machine was great. All in all I love Iron Man 2.
0525953728|5.0|Again, I seldom give 5 stars but if I could I would give this book 6 stars. It was the Seals of Seal Team 6 that got UBL not Obama. In fact, no one wanted to see what really happened in BenGazi (Libya) but when UBL went down everyone wanted to get credit. I can't wait to read what really happened in BenGazi.....No Easy Bay was a great read.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Is there really anything bad you can say about a Demi-god with a hammer that controls lightning? Hemsworth was terrific. Thor was great! I highly recommend it to anyone who's into the comic book/sci-fi stuff. And Tom Hiddleston was just awesome as Loki! A great villain I thought.
B00123IB32|5.0|buy this album. think about the thousands in hope of the hand of opportunity. and the boys of the n y p d choir . this album is simply great. then check out paddy keenan on pipes and john williams on concertina, and martin hays, seamus egan,paddy killoran, casey in the cowhouse, etc etc. you know look at the trad too. there is a lot to lift a heart up in the ridiculous twisted world. yeah i've fallen from grace and i cant get up. so i dance another loop and share a howl. cheers.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie was intriguing from the first scene. I was on the edge of my seat through-out this movie. One of the best movies I have seen this year. This movie was not too long nor too short. This movie realization makes one think about \\"What If\\" and how would earthling handle a situation like this. Would we actually react as a unified civilization, or would we simply not react to an alien invasion situation (???). I hope there will be a sequel to this movie, because I thoroughly enjoyed Battleship.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|If you were expected the dull and hum drum  of the tv series, do not get this movie. Even though it follows the tv series pretty good, it is quite different from what you are expecting, yet another fine movie from Johnny Depp.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|my friends and I are addicted to this game. we always are trying tonget more puzzle pieces then the other.
030758836X|5.0|I took a break from reading Dance With Dragons, to read Gone Girl and was glad I did.  I found it fast, thoroughly entertaining and unpredictable.  None of the main characters are very likeable, so I was able to distance myself from caring too much about what happened to them in the end.  Alot of readers didn't like the ending, but I thought it was brave and gutsy.  Great airplane read!  Loved it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am hard put as to what to say about this book.  In spite of it's content, it is extremely well written.  The characters well formed.  The story line is good.<br />However, I have deleted it from my Kindle because I don't want anyone to know I have read such a thing.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|If I were going to spend money on upgrading to a full game tonight, it would be this one. Although there were only three free levels, they felt like a decent chunk of gameplay - certainly enough to judge whether you want to buy the entire thing, and plenty to justify the free download for me.<br /><br />In addition to basic hidden objects, you also have to interview some witnesses, complete some small tasks (like reorganizing the forensic guy's tools) and find clues by tapping on areas of the scene. I was concerned that those extra bits would detract from the hidden objects, which is really the part I enjoy, but they were simple enough not to interrupt the flow and did add quite a bit to the atmosphere. The only problem I had was pulling the bullet out of the wall - but random finger movements seemed to do just fine, so there you are!<br /><br />The art style, character design, and dialog really captured the CSI-feel. I especially appreciated the not-quite-witty banter between the detectives - which is clearly designed to be just not quite witty and a little embarrassing for both of them. :)
B00633W614|5.0|Archer always gives us a good story with likeable characters that are multidimensional.<br />The Sins of the Father (The Clifton Chronicles) is packed with people who have strengths and weaknesses and manage to set themselves in our hearts.  We care what happens to them.  We don't want to come to the end of the book, because we will miss them. Oh wait!  There's another book coming.  We'll see them all again!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I'm sorry, but this story smacks of the old \\"new Age\\" thinking.  The story coincides with what was happening to him as his loved ones were at his bedside.  They all said that \\"he has to come back and that he is loved\\".  I attribute his family for bringing him back. His dreaming was interwoven with his family at his bedside 24 hours a day.  The author should and it does sound like it -- be thankful to God.  What was lacking in this story was the Trinity.  God Bless you and your family.
1449410243|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Oatmeal's comics. When I saw the title \\"How to tell if you Cat is plotting to kill you\\", I just had to pick it up. Being a semi cat owner I can relate to many of the stories portrayed in this book. Even if your not a cat lover you can still enjoy much of what The Oatmeal created. If you haven't I recommend you pick this book up immediately for yourself and to share with others. My book has passed maybe 20 hands as people are intrigued by the cover. Do it for the kittens, do it for the cats, but most importantly do it to save yourself! :P
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Racketeer was a fast and easy read. Typical John Grisham style. Interesting perspective on white collar crime. Fun to read, but not as good as A Time to Kill. I think A Time to Kill was his all time best!
B001B85QG8|5.0|I've been listening to The Used for 7 years now. They are the best in the style of scream/singing your heart out for everyone to hear. Taste Of Ink is still one of my all time favorite songs. No singer I've ever heard sounds like Bert. In case you're hearing this album for the first time, the silence gap in the song Pieces Mended lasts until the 8 minute mark. Love these dudes.

B0034G4OYK|4.0|My kids, especially my teenage daughter, loved this movie. The traditional monsters that we have known, (werewolf, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, mummy, invisible man, witches, gremlins, zombies, etc.) are not the evil beings that we are used to. Instead, they are just plain folks, but have been hunted and killed by human beings in the past. So Dracula has constructed a secret sanctuary where the monsters can come and chill out and he is a hotel manager a la Faultty Towers. Dracula is also superprotective of his daughter, Mavis, who has just turned (1)18 and who wants to go out into the world. Initially, the movie revolves around him being the hotel manager, and, in keeping his daughter safe.<br /><br />Enter a human teenage boy, who wanders into the place and initially believes that everyone is wearing a costume. He meets Mavis and they instantly fall for each other, much to Dracula's irritation. He tries to get rid of the boy without the guests realizing that the hotel has been infected by a human and I will say no more.<br /><br />Overall, it is a very good film, with only a couple of cliches here and there, with lots of visual and verbal jokes throughout. The werewolf, in particular, is hilarious. The film gets the conflict across very well of the dilemma of wanting to keep your family safe, yet realizing that the youngster must be allowed to spread their (bat)wings.
0525952926|4.0|I love the book for its family stories and their problems,,,, this book had way too , too much war pages.... on and on war stories..... at times I was tempted to not finish, however I did... the last l0 pages was what I was looking for, family info....

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I got into The Walking Dead only about 3 months ago when I decided to give season 1 a chance on Netflix and I am so happy that I did! When season 2 showed up on there I watched it all in a weekend and was geared up for season 3 to begin which was within a few weeks of my finishing season 2.I saw Amazon was offering the TV Pass and I jumped on it, best $2.05 I could possibly spend per week. This show gets better and better with each episode and I can not wait to see what else happens this season. Never watched the show? DO IT, I highly recommend this show to anyone and I'm not even a big zombie fan.
B003UHYSIK|5.0|LIVE INTRUSION is IMO the best live Slayer show out there.  This is during the Divine Intervention era, 1995.  NFL Films actually filmed all of this Mesa show.  The crowd has tons of energy while Slayer plays \\"Killing Fields\\", Venom's \\"Witching Hour\\", \\"At Dawn They Sleep\\" and \\"Hell Awaits\\" in addition to their usual setlist.  This show is excellent!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I liked this movie, it isn't the best I have seen but definitely not the worst. It has fantastic special effects, the story line is pretty good and the acting is pretty on point. Not bad if you're looking for a decent enough SCI-FI film to watch on a night at home.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I am really enjoying this series. This third installment continued the adventure for Clary and Jace and company with much excitement drama.  In this book we are introduced to the City of Glass and new characters that will influence the lives of the characters in way they could never have imagined!  Very entertaining.

159102594X|3.0|For the most part I enjoyed the book, but at times I found myself skimming to get to the next interesting bit.  The pacing felt slow and for some reason the shifts of perspective from character to character seemed clumsy.  It was good enough that I read the rest of the series.  Unlike many in my collection, this will probably never be a second time through.
1439102430|3.0|Fifteenth in the Temperance Brennan forensics suspense series revolving around a forensic anthropologist who switches between Montreal and North Carolina. This story takes place in Canada between Montreal and Edmonton.<br /><br />My Take<br />This was an okay read with a bit too much of the non-fictional thrown in from how a CT scan operates to kimberlite pipes to DNAWitness to Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, plus, plus, plus, and a bit of history on Edmonton's growth. Lots of snark between Ollie and Ryan when Ollie lets Ryan know that he and Tempe had been an item in the past. Reichs does provide a bit of explanation at the end as to why Ryan is blowing so damn cold with the occasional warm spots throughout this story. Reichs wants us to believe that Ollie and Ryan aren't getting along because of Tempe, but Reichs doesn't write it to make me feel it.<br /><br />I missed the warmer aspects I usually get in a Temperance Brennan story. This one was just too cold with too much stupidity slithering through it. I will admit that Tempe was bright enough to connect some of the grittier bits.<br /><br />Somehow, this isn't too believable when all three of them take off for Edmonton on Annaliese's trail. Then their casual talk in front of Aurora. What were they thinkin'? Another low point was the comment Nellie makes and...I just can't believe how long it takes Tempe to make the connection. Then again, I may be playing fair since I'm the one who gets to read the story and I'm not living it. Then again, Tempe is supposedly caught up in it and I should think those little bits of information would rise to the surface a lot faster.<br /><br />Hey! Tempe's reading Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus ([[ASIN:0312536925 Knots and Crosses]] starts this series off)!<br /><br />What is with these supposedly intelligent people who leave \\"important\\" messages with their allies but never tell them where they actually are. \\"Call me. Now.\\" is supposed to be what sort of help if you run into trouble? Personally, I prefer \\"58th and Maine. Tracking suspect.\\" Duhhhh. Maybe it's okay because Tempe left the same call me message on two phones.<br /><br />*Unghh, trying to pull tongue out of ch-e-e-k...unghhh...*<br /><br />The Story<br />It's heartbreaking when all the tiny bodies are found stuffed in different places in the apartment. The person Tempe, Ryan, and Hasty believe is responsible is on the run, heading west. And the three of them take off after her.<br /><br />It's a trail that reveals, conceals, and frustrates as the layers of support are exposed and Annaliese's character is disclosed. How can someone like her evade capture for so long?<br /><br />The Characters<br />Temperance Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who splits her work year between the Laboratoire de sciences judiciares et de m&eacute;dicine l&eacute;gal in Montreal in Quebec and Charlotte, North Carolina. Birdie is her cat and not with her in this story. He's stuck in Charlotte recovering from an infection. Pete is her lawyer ex-husband and Katy is her daughter with some unwelcome and surprising news---she's joined the army!<br /><br />Her fellows at Sûret&eacute; include:<br />LaManche has been a forensic pathologist for over forty years and is currently in charge. Autopsy technicians include Gilles Pomier, Roy Robitaille, and Lisa. Other pathologists include Jean Pelletier, Marcel Morin, and Emily Santangelo. Simone Annoux is in the DNA section.<br /><br />Lieutenant-d&eacute;tective Andrew Ryan is a homicide cop with whom Tempe has a romantic history. One that Ryan's heroin-addicted teenage daughter, Lily wrecked. The brusque, thinks-he's-all-that Sergeant Oliver Isaac Hasty is with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a man with whom Tempe had a brief, week-long fling some years ago. He wants back in. Together, Ryan and Ollie are good cop/bad cop.<br /><br />Susan \\"Foxy\\" Forex is a hooker with a heart of gold in Edmonton.

B000UW8596|3.0|I'm sure the movie was shocking in its day, and the story line is timeless. But with movies like Hostel and Human Centipede out there the scenes that were shocking in the 60's and 70's almost fall to the level of fetish play today.
0143054406|5.0|awesome, i paid very little for it and the book is in perfect condition. it had zero annotations and was not bended or written on or anything and i only paid 1 penny!! plus shipping and handling of course, super satisfied :)
B009GEAPYW|4.0|I enjoyed The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 very much. It was faithful to the original and I thought Peter Weller did a nice job as the aging Batman. The film did leave me wanting for Part 2, which I guess could be both good or bad for some viewers. However, it still felt like a complete movie. I would recommend if you are a fan of Frank Miller's original, but not for kids.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I finally got to watch the movie I decided to wait til it came on video and I'm so glad I did. Movies like this are why outlets like Redbox are so necessary because they don't live up to all the hype like Avatar definitely did to watch on the big screen. It did'nt explain anything about our origins as it was advertised. It was definitely an Alien prequel but thats not how they promoted it. It left more questions than answers and I just hate movies that make you figure out what they should be trying to explain. We got info about the\\" Alien\\" origins already from the movie \\"Alien vs. Predator\\" which made much more sense. This big budget catastrophe cheated us out of the big question outside the box of if God didn't create us then who did? Why? And where is this location in the multi-verse? It avoided the true subject matter and left us hanging so badly. The out the box subject matter is what interested me in the first place and not the fact it was an \\"Alien\\" prequel.It so sucked. If I could rate it no stars I would have. Please save your money on this one. It is not even worth viewing once. The best scene in the whole movie to me was when the woman manually gave herself a C- section. Wow. What a way to promote a so called block buster. No wonder this didn't stay in theaters long. I dig Ridley Scott too and he really let me down with this presentation. Doesn't deserve to be in my private collection or yours.

B000ESST6U|5.0|British mezzo Sarah Connolly gives a tour de force in the role of Caesare in this 2005 Glyndebourne production, directed by David McVicar and featuring William Christie conducting the Orchestra of the Age of the Enlightenment. McVicar's production follows the more recent trend of using modern theatrical devices to stage the work instead of the historically accurate (and sometimes frankly dull) dramatic conventions of 18th century opera seria. His approach is creating and engaging while not overwhelming the music or the drama and remaining true to the characters that are so wonderfully developed through Handel's lush score.<br /><br />The star of this production is Sarah Connolly. The honeyed hue of her voice is perfectly suited to the role of Cesare, and she sings the role in a way that can only be described as absolutely alluring and utterly beautiful. She conveys, both through her voice and stage presence, a full and richly textured portrayal of her character. I can't imagine how anyone could watch this performance and not be convinced she is the foremost Cesare of our time.<br /><br />The present fetish for countertenors has lead to many companies shying away from casting a woman as Cesare, and audiences are missing out because of this fad. Why cast an aging, technically inconsistent countertenor, (e.g., David Daniels, Andreas Scholl) as your Giulio Cesare when you could have someone like Sarah Connolly, or even countertenor Christophe Dumaux (more on him later), either of whom have both the voice and stage presence necessary to carry off the role. Having seen both David Daniels and Andreas Scholl in the role in past years, I have to say that Sarah Connolly's Cesare was utterly more convincing as Cesare and much more virile than either Daniels or Scholl, who come across as vocally weak and dramatically impotent, which is hardly convincing for Cesare, who is apparently strong enough to be dictator of Rome. In my mind, only Connolly's performance conveys this strength, which is essential to understanding Cesare's character in the opera.<br /><br />That having been said, the other real news in this production is the outstanding performance of Christophe Dumaux as Tolomeo--a role in which he is now quite comfortable, having given  over 100 performances in the role at major houses worldwide. Unlike Daniels and Scholl, Dumaux has a strong, powerful voice that seems fully capable and secure throughout his range, both in the highest notes and the lowest. Even at the top of his register, there is a certain resonance to his voice that gives it a strong, natural sounding quality that in no way seems forced or artificial. And there is seamless integration between his lower chest voice and the upper head voice. The solid timbre of his voice comes across as almost Podleś-like, but with a much more masculine quality to the voice and a more confined range. His performance as Tolomeo was captivating, and it has evolved considerably since the recording of this DVD given the number of times he has performed the role. Tolomeo is a role that can be played from a variety of angles with equal success, but the characterization he uses in this performance, as an immature, childish, sexually-frustrated tyrant, is both engaging and entertaining. While his voice lacks the beauty of Connolly's, Dumuax will undoubted make a fantastic Cesare when he decides to move on to that role.<br /><br />The murdered Pompey's wife, Cornelia, and son, Sesto, are sung by Irish mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon and Austrian mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager, respectively. Both deliver stunning and moving renditions of their arias and the pair of them lend real dramatic credibility to this production. While Danielle di Niese's flippant, dancing Cleopatra seems cartoonish compared with the rest of the portrayals in this production, the absurdity of her rendition is reigned in by the many poignant moments brought about by Bardon and Kirchschlager as they plot against Tolomeo to avenge the killing of Pompey. Christopher Maltman brings a certain Mozartian flare to his coy portrayal of Achilla, Tolomeo's general. Another young countertenor, Rachid Ben Abdeslam, also gives a solid performance in the role of Nireno.<br /><br />William Christie leads the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment a perfectly executed, and at times creative, interpretation of Handel's score. Christie's tempos are flawless throughout, and although some might be a bit unsettled by his choice of tempo in places (e.g., a very slow and deliberate \\"Va tacito e nacasto\\"), but these departures from the more conventional tempos are all well reasoned and result in an interpretation of his frequently heard score that is both thoughtful and a delight to the ear.<br /><br />McVicar's choice to set the production in British colonial Egypt is a clever twist, adding an additional layer of meaning and interpretation to this opera seria.<br /><br />Audio quality on this DVD is excellent with 5.1 surround sound available. Video quality is good for a DVD, but I do wish they would reissue this performance on Blu-ray as well.<br /><br />I have no idea if this is true or not, but I've heard multiple rumors that his performance is soon be released on CD and as MP3. If this audio release does actually transpire, this 2005 Giulio Cesare from Glyndebourne will be the definitive recording of reference of the opera.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie was pretty good.  But read the books first.  Much more actioned packed and movie just wasn't as vibrant as the book allowed your imagination to go.

B004S9AK3G|3.0|World Without End uses the setting of Pillars of the Earth for another medieval historical novel.<br /> Follet uses the same mix of character development, intrigue, suspense, romance and good historical research to create that \\"I can't put it down\\" effect.<br /><br />After reading Pillars of the Earth I felt a compulsion to research Medieval building techniques, and even to visit the real places that inspired the story. In the same way this time I found myself googling the Plague, but felt  he somehow didn't get it \\"right\\".<br /><br />While I have had a week of late night reading to finish this book, I am left with a nagging feeling it was more of the same, rather than an epic work in it's own right.<br /><br />So a good read, but not the same inspiration as  Pillars of the Earth.
B005FMZWD8|1.0|The watch arrived in the Invicta case, looked gorgeous and brand new.  Beautiful blue face, black canvas band- I was very impressed with the look of the watch.  I gave this as a gift, and within the first week of wear, the face cracked.  He hit it on something once, and a huge chunk of the face came off- it covers about 25% of the surface.  Shortly thereafter, the band began to fall apart; pieces of canvas have just worn right off.  The watch looks to be years old, although he's only had it for a couple of months.  Very disappointed in the quality, at least we didn't pay the $700 original price.

The story is not what I expected at all. I found myself reading any second I could. I could not put the book down. It had everything in it--action, a great story, a bit of love... it was perfect.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Really like my new ESV Bible. The larger print is easy on the eyes and it is one of the best Bibles I own for accuracy.
0545128285|5.0|I think it is very entertaining and just like muggle children stories it has lessons to be learned. Very good reading for young children, just like Snow white or Robin Hood. I enjoyed it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The series started slow, but really took on depth and power as it went along.  This was a well-written book, with a richly detailed world and an interesting plot.  I really cared about the characters.  By book 5 I was hooked and couldn't put it down.  Write more!  Please!!
0062127241|4.0|Pete tells a tale about his life, professional and personal, that I was familiar with, but the book made me feel like I now can claim to be intimate about his life.  Especially telling is his troubles with accusations of pedophilia, something that much of the media in the US failed to report EXCEPT for the sensational headlines.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I have read all of the books in this series.  The quality of the story is consistently deteriorating.  Scarpetta has become too self centered and  unbelievable.  It's time to wrap up this story line.
B000001FDK|4.0|I've had a copy of this CD for years, ever since I first watched the movie and became a little obsessed. I listen to it regularly - at least twice a month. And always enjoy it. I bought this second copy for a friend who had never seen the movie before we went to a \\"Grease Sing-Along\\"  - she came out humming pieces of several songs all strung together - so I couldn't resist getting her her own copy of this fabulous music.
1439148813|5.0|Wonderful read on the inside history of the US Space Program.  Kranz has a simple, but eloquent writing style that put me right in mission control.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|After the last two books who were not what expected from Patricia Cornwell and Scarpetta! This one is the return of how I like of the writing of Mrs. Patricia Cornwell and her Scarpetta! I like the plot and all the characters related to her family and close friends! Poor Marino who is against his will put in the wrong spot and Kay couple struggling but what a great book to read! Thanks so much for sharing with your talent!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best tv series ever! My husband and I can not get enough Walking Dead. This seasons endings are a bit different than the others. They end in plots that are for the most part cliff hangers but the writers for this show pull it all together and BOOM Walking Dead magic!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|It was a great movie.  The DVD worked great. I enjoyed watching it with my family.  We were thoroughly entertained and had a wonderful evening.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I remember playing this game on my friend's iPod touch and it was a great and addictive app. I've downloaded and played this for hours! Plus, its free! Why not get it?
B008VVT51U|2.0|This was a film I was really looking forward to seeing. It has some of my favorite actors and I love films which take place in India...so vibrant and beautiful. But the plot is beyond cliche' and so ridiculously sentimental, I found myself rolling my eyes again and again at the stupid lines actors such as the wonderful Dame Judy Dench and Maggie Smith had to say. If you want a mindless ride through India, don't mind the stereotypical characters, and silly predictable plot, then you'll like this film. If not, then rent it...don't make the mistake I did when I bought the film on Amazon Instant.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I got the DE version with 3 bonus tracks.  After some selective editing :-), I got down to about a 55 min CD-R's worth that's some of the best hard rock released in the last 5 years.  No, it ain't Rocks, but it's a heckuva lot better than the crap they released in the late '80's and early '90's.  2 thumbs up !!
0739333305|5.0|The CD's were purchased to entertain me in my car while driving the long road back home from work each afternoons. It exceeded all my expectations and beyond.  The sound was of very high quality so I could have heard while driving with or without the windows down.  The narrator's diction was clear and flawless.  Good product.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome because its an rpg game and I got 20 dimonds in a month and its such a challenge to fight 10 creepers at once but its pretty fun and that's all I have to say.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked up this Omnibus based on customer reviews.  One of the best science fiction/end of world stories I've read.  I could smell the grease, feel the metal steps and hear the ricochet of the bullets.  Not many books allow me to jump into them so completely.  Hugh has made my top 10 author list.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Thanks so much. We loved it! My daughter will be delighted at Christmas when she opens it. So glad to find it
1475143389|5.0|I read the book and it broke down some common myths that you always hear about in the locker room.  Seems like everyone has a new supplement to push, and Mike clears up the issue by discussing the good, the bad , and the useless.  My workouts have been WAY more productive and the diet is cutting me down in a way that has eluded me for a few years.  Buy this book!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Love this season much better than last year! Characters & storyline seem much more realistic..to a certain extent. Can't wait for new episodes!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|the book was a good read the characters were fun filled, and the ending had a good twist. hope there is a sequel.
B00A3OJ3CO|5.0|this show is .. as the kids say .. awesome!  this is what and the way a superhero should be and do...take out the bad guys (hopefully without collateral damage).<br /><br />as another reviewer stated, this is not the \\"smallville\\" green arrow.  this arrow is for the people/persons that have been hurt by the establishment and they need a voice.  green arrow is giving them a voice!  as in the pilot, those class actioner were glad to see a little change in their checking accounts after the bad guy was dispatch.<br /><br />in the 4th show, tying the guy to the train tracks, i could not stop laughing...it was so \\"feel\\" good.  my only concern is that the writers do not let the dig-man give olie a conscience.  he can not become weak or too thoughtful of the feelings of the ones who should be taken down.  this would turn this into another batman serial.<br /><br />personally, i am not a violent person and everyone has a day in court, but, between green arrow and john reese (person of interest), the streets will be safe for all of us (ha!)
B00020HEL6|5.0|This album is my first by Renee Olstead, but it won't be the last. The music and her lyrical performance creates a feeling of being in the Louisiana Delta.  I love her soft but sassy style, something you would find in a Southern Belle. So, purchase this album, sit back and enjoy a mint julep while listening!  I recommend this album as a welcome addition to any jazz collection.
B0002IQMKM|3.0|This compilation would be awesome were it not for the many skips and starts.  It has all the best Talking Heads classics.  18 cuts!  All danceable.  Just one of the best rhythm sections ever.  Love it!  But my purchase was diminished by the poor quality of the disc.  It had probably been played way too many times.  A good and bad sign.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|This album makes you feel as though you are at Rio de Janeiro or the the South of France. This feeling is entwined in both the music and lyrics.  It is saucy and sexy and reflects a subtle change in musical style, though maintains the undeniable artistic identity of Melody Gardot. If you have her music in your collection, I highly recommend this album as a welcome addition.
B00846REIS|5.0|This made my sex life wake up and have life again after 15 years it is still possible. It was  like reading good porn
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game for all ages. Various levels provide a challenge for all.  didn't believe the reviews that said it was addicting... but it is.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use on kindle fire. I like Calculator Plus Free. The large display is easy on the eyes. thanks for making it available in the app market.
B005FISBTO|2.0|I enjoy Dexter and the sixth season as on par with the others, but if you want to watch it, don't buy the DVDs.  It is incredibly annoying that every disc has a long list of Showtime ads that come up every time you put a disc in.  You can't skip them, jump to the main menu, or even fast forward.  That is really unacceptable for a product of this price.
B004SBX112|1.0|This new update pushed me back to version 1 of the game after all that I played even with the new Halloween update gone thanks a lot for nothing
B000HAB4KS|1.0|Saw the Matrix as favor to another mature friend. Good idea... what is reality?, but<br />poor execution.  Left the question to engage in too much violence that had no other<br />purpose.  Perhaps the move makers realized that the audience would be too limited,<br />excluding teen age boys and young men, and so switched to standard blood entertainment.<br />Even science fiction has to be believable within its context; Matrix isn't.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|One of the best novels I have ever read.  We can hardly wait for the third novel.  I love history in the novel form.
B004UID2LC|5.0|well, although it requires lots of updates to work properly, it is a super cool app! I never ever pay for music anymore!  I simply look up the song long press the video and hit download as mp3! love love love his app
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Very entertaining and a book the keeps your interest all the way to the end.  I will be reading the other books in the trilogy
B006YW6KX4|5.0|Di'zWi'z Review<br /><br />The information on the Twilight Time Blu-ray \\"Picnic\\" is INCORRECT!  It is advertised as full screen format.  The Blu-ray is most definitely in Cinema Scope/ Widescreen.  The print is beautiful and the sound is correct (as advertised).<br /><br />The film is directed by Joshua Logan from the 1955 play, \\"Picnic\\" by William Inge.<br /><br />So, if the movie is as important to you, as it is to me... (I grew up with film).  You will not mind spending the money.  All the performances are great; however, I am very partial to: Rosalind Russell's \\"Rosemary\\" - The School Teacher, and Verna Felton's -\\"Helen Potts\\" - The sweet lady next door.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This is very good and continues to push scifi to new levels. Its very well produced and is a collector item.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I needed to find something well addictive to play for awhile while my Sim games uploaded its self with new content. lets just say this game is now my most fave game I have ever played. although the concept is almost.. stupid it is quite good<br />-&#9733; star reviews &#9733;-
B008K8U13K|3.0|I was never really a Sonic fan but got excited to see this one offered on Amazon. With such good ratings, I did not expect to be dissapointed. If you don't know the layout- it's a huge learning curve before you start advancing levels. That may be a benefit for someone who wants their phone to raise and entertain their children, but I don't have time or patience. Some games should just be left being the nostalgic game that was.
B008NABUU8|3.0|I got stuck on the 4th level. I haven't really wanted to play it much since. It would be great if there was a tutorial or something.
0920236251|3.0|I couldn't help but laugh when I received the package.  Next time I will read the description better.  I thought it was going to be a regular size book, but it was a little book.  No problem though, it still worked for what I wanted.  I received product when promised too.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love it but&hellip; this is just my opinion you should get it just to try it I recommend this app it is addictive.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Great CD. Not every single single song is awesome but most are pretty good. And both my 3 year old and 5 year old love it! That is awesome that Adele can appeal to ages 3 to 41!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is so much fun. i do wish that it had more to do in the begginning. but i recommend it to you
B004HW7JH4|4.0|One of the best series on TV. I was nearly certain it would fall off the cliff or jump the shark but it remains fresh 5 years in.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every season of this show seems to bring something different. Many people complained that season 2 was too slow, but I feel it focused on new characters and let me see how they, inevitably had to become one, unified group.<br />Season three shows something I never expected, and it was amazing (and, as always; unexpected). I won't post spoilers, but I think this show is so good I hope it lasts for many, many years.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Good Story fast Moving. I like the way he writes, hard to put down, I have read many of his books
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Long book, but it was a quicker read than expected.  I enjoyed reading it, although I am not typically a Stephen King reader.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|The free version of this game is fun.  However, upgrades are available for I phones and androids that simply are not available to kindle.  I talked to them about this, and they promised to get one available.  This was about 6 months ago.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I bought this for a couple of reasons: The title was so intriguing that I couldn't NOT get the sample to browse; the markdown price was too good stop reading after I got to the end of the sample download.<br /><br />Once underway, I found it hard to put down.  The romp that the centenarian made through so many historical events with well-known people like Harry Truman, for example, were entertaining and sometimes almost plausible.  You ought to read it!
B0058SNLIC|5.0|I bought the shoes on sale to give a try. Next thing I know is I am wearing them every day.  They are so comfortable and they are washable.  I would recommend my friends and family to buy them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LPVE THOS GAME I HAVE THE X-BOX TYPE AND THE CP I WATED LIKE 2 YEARS FOR THIS TO COME OUT so I mist want to say THANK YOU Mojang.
B004IWF64Q|5.0|This movie was wonderful. It taught so many moral values and its great for kids and adults alike!<br />Amazon offered it at a great quality too. even though I was just streaming it from Instant Video, I didn't see any lags or breaking up of pixels.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was an easy read and even though it's a serious subject it was presented in a good way, you'll smile, laugh and cry but it's a good ride.
B0095R64AO|5.0|It is an interesting movie. This story line has been told many times from teenagers to mid age groups but this has an interesting plot that I love in a movie. If you wanted to see something that would be twisted up in laughs and weird moments you have found your movie to see or buy. I would likely rent this before I buy the movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is a must for anyone who uses facebook.  It works the same way it does on an iphone just bigger.  Witch I think is a very good thing, same format means ease of use across the platforms.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Steven Wilson's solo tour supporting 'Grace For Drowning' was an awesome sonic event.  I was very excited to learn that a show from that tour was going to be available on DVD & Blu-ray.  Steven's work is always engineered so well (by Steven himself), that the sound quality you get on his recordings is unrivaled.  That's probably why many classic progressive albums have been remastered by Wilson, like King Crimson and Jethro Tull.  Wilson has always surrounded himself with amazing musicians to complement his projects, and the 'Get All You Deserve' tour was no exception.  The camera work is very good too.  Not so many effects to make it seem like it was created in a studio, but a great representation of the live concert.  Hopefully, you have Blu-ray and a 5.1 surround sound system to take full advantage of this excellent collection of modern progressive music and visual artistry.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought the book was ok and I enjoyed reading it but it seemed a little drawn out.  I think the story could have told with about 50 less pages and not lost anything.
B008I43DYU|4.0|works exactly as advertized.  i use it as my only calculator.  all functions work correctly and the math is accurate.
1419381032|5.0|I love all of Diana Gabaldon's books! I have read them all several times, and I really love hearing Davina Porter read them.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|A racy espionage, terrorism series that keeps you on the edge a la \\"24\\"-like. I've always loved Claire Danes as an actress and she shines again here.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is freaking awesome..but I wish it would tell you the cost of upgrades..besides that I have not found any flaws..
1452110581|5.0|This isn't just a cute little throwaway gift for that cat lover in your life: the poems are truly well written. Their construction and syntax that add an extra layer of enjoyment to snapshots from a cat's life.  The effect is a book of vignettes that allow the reader to appreciate both a cat's point of view-- as well as that of a cat owner.  Somewhere, the author's English teachers are smiling.
B007EDYN36|5.0|First let's get this out of the way - I'm a hardcore pre-1983 makeup-era KISS fan and have been since I was a kid in the mid 70's who thought Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter could do no wrong so it might be helpful to read my thoughts on the book in that context. I'm only about halfway through this book but have to say it has really caught me off guard in a very good way and I can tell it's going to be that way to the last page. Ace has always been my favorite and inspired me to pick up the guitar yet I have yet to make it all the way through his book (sorry Ace). I can't seem to put this one down though. I've read all of the KISS-related books to date and agree with another reviewer that this is definitely one of the better if not best ones. Peter seems to be an honest, genuine guy who is incredibly happy with what he's accomplished and where he's at now in life and that reflects a lot in his (and his ghost writer's) writing and stories. It has a very upbeat vibe about it (so far, at least). Lots of good stuff in here.. a lot of things that we've already read or heard about over the years but it's really fun to hear it from Peter's perspective. There's the usual rock star ego to wade through but that's to be expected with someone who has lived his life. Definitely give this book a chance, you might be pleasantly surprised.
0316228532|3.0|I, like many others, was very excited about the release of The Casual Vacancy and was going to read it regardless of what it's reception was.  And my overall reaction is one that is hard to describe.  No, it did not meet my high expectations and no, this will never be confused with the brilliance of Harry Potter.  Still, I can't say that I regret reading the book.  It was worth reading and I do suggest giving the book a try.<br /><br />Pros- JK's writing style still shines through here.  She is a great writer that knows how to tell a story.  Aside from a slow beginning that introduces the characters, the book moves at a fast pace (even if it lacks direction).  I won't spoil the ending but I will say that it was effective for me and has made me think about it a lot well after reading it.  This book wasn't meant to be light hearted and she showed that with the ending she chose.  Also, she does a great job throwing some political themes into the book without being preachy.  I like the large number of characters that JK is able to balance and find a story for.  She once again shows a talent for making many different characters fit into a small story.<br /><br />Cons- This isn't Hogwarts, the content here was a bit much for me.  I had heard that there was language, sexual themes, and drugs, but it was worse than I thought it would be and it was not an easy book to read by any means.  Id go as far as saying that if a film adaption was made, there would have to be cuts from the book just to make it an R-rating.  All of the characters are detestable, it's really hard to root for anyone and it's even harder to find someone you like the least.  I like flawed characters that I can root for, not characters that have absolutely no redeeming qualities.  Not to mention HP again, but the Durselys would legitimately be considered the best and most respectable group of people if they were in this book.  Hell, even Voldemort had better intentions than many of the characters in this book.  It is really hard to relate to characters that have the kind of problems they have.  It gets to the point where it's too unrealistic.  That's why it's ironic (guess I can't help myself from mentioning HP) when people say \\"You guys don't like CV because you love HP and can't handle a realistic story.\\"  A story about a wizard has more realism than the town of Pagford.  While I enjoyed the ending, it was fairly predictable and doesn't bring closure to all of the vile characters that we have come to know.  I feel like if someone asked Rowling why she made the book she would have a tough time answering, there really is no message or moral that I could see.  Labeled a dark comedy, all I saw was darkness for the most part.  I don't remember many funny parts, if at all.  Topics like rape and pedophilia make it hard to generate laughs, and it is true even for a good writer like JK.<br /><br />The list can go on and on, but I will stop there.  All of these negatives, and yet I am still intrigued by the story told and found it worth reading.  I was expecting more from Rowling and I hope that the next book she writes is an improvement.  CV has not changed my perception of her though.  I will read the next book she makes as well.  This is a really challenging book and I don't know what to make of it just yet.  Judging by the Amazon reviews, I'm guessing many others feel the same.  I generally avoid any books under a 3.5, but this book defies odds by being a 3/5 and still worth reading.  My initial reaction is a 6/10, but when I look back on it in a few months I wouldn't be surprised if this is a 5/10 or if it's a 7/10.  Either way, I'm glad I made the trip to Pagford even if it didn't meet my expectations.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|well i got this, expecting a lot then i notice tht they only gave us two worlds and the third is $2 more, well i bought tht too and its only showing up on one of my devices when it says itd show those levels unlocked on all compatible, well i think another kindle should be compatible...what the heck rovio??? all this hype and you gave us minimum levels
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a nice app Cu's you can play variouse games but don't that you have to earn a lot of points to unlock &aacute; mew game.......
B003U6HQGW|5.0|This was a book I couldn't, put down. It is a  most fantastic story of courage and endurance beautifully written
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Probably one of the best albums I've listened to in a long time.  I was getting worried about the state of the music industry.  There is a bunch of crap out there these days, but this album is WORTH buying!!!<br />Sounds a bit garage band from the late 60's-70's.  Very cool.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|Having listened to the 15 track on the LP plus the 3 bonus tracks (this IS the deluxe edition review, after all) twice, this sounds like revisited tracks as been mentioned with a variation here and there. If you like ballads, power or traditional, there's no less than 7 to choose from.<br /><br />Thought the best track musically of the 18 is \\"Something\\". While I admire and respect the \\"Admiral\\" as a player and songwriter, singing lead vocals is his achilles. Leave that to the Demon of Screamin'. Other tracks I enjoyed are \\"Tell Me\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Sweet Jesus\\", \\"Lover Alot\\" and \\"Closer.\\" \\"We All Fall Down\\" sounds too much like \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\" from the Armageddon soundtrack. Oh, that's right. It was written by the same person (Diane Warren). The rest of the tracks I considered to be filler material.<br /><br />In closing, would recommend something to Aerosmith that the Admiral himself said on Page 447 in the Aerosmith biography, \\"Walk this Way\\".<br /><br />DON'T BORE US, GET TO THE CHORUS...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game...I am totally addicted to it! only wish I had this kind of luck at the carnival version! love it
B008ZTW7OU|5.0|What a great album, disc, download, whatever you want to call it. This collection rocks. Not a song out of place, or miss-step to be found. My only complaint is the length of the songs. They are too short. I enjoyed their earlier work but this, bodes well for their future. Awesome!
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|This is the best album since Rust Never Sleeps! My favorite group of songs since Everybody knows this is nowhere. The first 3 songs could've been produced in the 60's for all you know. Highly Recommend +++++++
B0081BU42O|4.0|The characterizations are very strong in this book, but I felt the plot line was a little questionable in places.. almost farcical.  Sadly this book also suffers from having an ending that felt rushed.
1439152802|4.0|Reading about a teen close to my generation - never interests me as much as characters from earlier time periods.  Laurel Nicolson is sixteen, tired of her family, dreaming of a boy, and hiding out in a treehouse.  I almost didn't keep reading; a typical girl's drama at that age doesn't interest me.  Luckily, I kept reading and heard about the murder, about the dramatic, self-centered girl that Dorothy (Laurel's mother) used to be.  I like Laurel so much better when she is an older character, a famous British actress.  The care, concern, humor, and love that all three sisters show for their mother draws you into their circle.<br /> As their mother's life nears its end, the mystery of their mother's life sends Laurel sleuthing into her past, into a time when England is being bombarded by German bombs.  It's fascinating (want to read about her, but want to shake her too) to read about Dolly (Dorothy), a self-centered, dreamer who imagines a much more interesting, important life than she actually leads.  Dolly's boyfriend, Jimmy, seems so wonderful - honest, caring, moral - that you want to shake him too - for putting up with Dolly.  Vivien Jenkins is a mystery woman, but the reason she often disappears for days isn't hard to figure out.  \\"Dorothy's\\" son's belief in his mother's goodness eases your heart when you start to think the worst of her.  The ending was wonderful...and totally unexpected for me.  I saw a write-up from another reviewer who thought Morton's writing was too transparent; I never saw the ending coming.  Total surprise!<br />Four and a Half Stars<br /><br />*Received a copy for review, this in no way affects my review*
0553801473|5.0|What can I say? In the may came a masterpiece, the quality of the book is really good, a hardcover that \\"feels good\\" to have and cary arround. The work of Martin is awesome as allways, the world, the characters, all is great. Waiting for the winds of winter.

B003JUGQ38|5.0|A very entertaining season! No love interest with this companion - just two travelers who enjoy adventure and each others company. I was a little apprehensive in seeing Donna as his new companion, but, she won me over and I miss her now that she is gone. A bit of a surprise in this season for our beloved Rose as well!
B001HLZMUE|5.0|Crazy, and a fun cult fan pic. If you haven't seen it, you should - just to make up your mind about it.  You either love it or don't get it.<br />Now I can watch it on the go.
B003G94BZC|5.0|After grieving Eccleston and growing to love Tennant I was not looking forward to adjusting to a new Dr. As leery as I was, I was soon won over by the sheer glee of Smiths' portrayal. His traveling companions too are pretty terrific! This season is a wonderful continuation of our Dr.'s adventures.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is very informative and helpful. It explains the inner workings of the human body and why the body reacts in certain ways to the foods we eat in lamens terms. The author explains how much (and when) we should eat what types of food to reach our desired goal.<br /><br />Eating extremely healthy has always been a bland boring experience in the past but not anymore, because I also bought his book \\"The Shredded Chef\\" which has a ton of nutritious meals which are full of flavor.<br /><br />Additionally, this author isn't just concerned about the profits from selling books! I emailed him asking a basic question and got a response quicker than I expected. You can tell this guy is dedicated to seeing others achieve their desired results! I plan on buying every book he's had published as result.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I really enjoy getting into a book.  You know really losing myself in a storty!  I can do that with the whole Twilight series!  And this book had me on the edge of the couch.<br /><br />I would recommend this for anyone 13 and up!
B004GJYRKA|5.0|Im a hugh fan of Bruce Lee and i will buy more of Bruce Lee's movies and i can't wait to buy box set so keep up the great work
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The book was great, one of his better ones. It kept me reading, and I was able to finish the whole thing in about four days.  It was really worth the ten dollars I payed for it.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I read it for a mystery book discussion group, and while it isn't a traditional \\"whodunit\\" mystery, it had enough twists to keep the reader guessing.  I liked the characters (well, the main character, anyways), and I thought Watson did a very good job of expressing the daily confusion and fear she felt.  It had a good premise and was well-written. The one criticism I have is I thought there wasn't enough tension in the middle part of the book, when she (and we) is reading her journal. I did figure out the twist about half way through. A good, not too deep thriller, just right for a rainy fall evening of reading.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|David Foster has created a collection of arrangements that actually contain some originality all the while allowing the vocal talents of Maestro Stewart to coming roaring through. Tracks 2-4 are worthless, very simliar to songbook stuff but the rest is actually either R and B inspired quality tunes or accoustic beauty. This was bound to be a big seller but Foster went the extra mile. Good effort. If you like Rod Stewart, you will like this CD, not EVERY track but more than half. See full review at rodstewartblog dot com.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I originally purchased this on my Kindle, and I ended up getting the hardback from the library to finish it.  The pictures aren't crucial to the story, I suppose; but they are very necessary for the atmosphere.  This was a great tale, and I cannot wait for the sequel. Creepy and mysterious, it starts out a little slowly; but in just a few chapters I was sucked right in and read it in 2 sittings!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good short period game. excellent when waiting for a appointment. great for when you really don't have time to get into your book. hats off to the designers great graphics.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book!  I didn't think it would take the twists and turns it did.  Was afraid for awhile that it might be a stretch to take the storyline further but Suzanne Collins did a very good job with this book.
B003PIS5XI|4.0|I think this is a great movie.  Being the first, or one of those, movies that used CG it is more known for the generation of bad movies that use CG as a cheap excuse for FX.  I just watched it and amazing enough the CG, although dated, is still better than many movies I have seen this year.(mainly cheap knock off movies but still it helps show the workmanship put into this movie)
B0086700CM|5.0|it is so fun my friends said I have to get it but I said no it looks stupid but when I got home I downloaded it have to have it !!!!!!!!!!!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|An intelligent movie that keeps you thinking the entire time. This film is visually a work of art, and the excellent cast makes it so engrossing that you forget you are watching a movie. The heavy plot is mixed with splashes of humorous dialogue, making it (in my opinion) one of the best movies of the year.
0453005071|5.0|I was beyond excited to finally find this book and read it. I am a huge King/Bachman fan and this was a great addition to my collection. The stories are amazing. I was enthralled.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I travel frequently and have always gladly picked the latest Grisham off the book rack for a trans-Atlantic flight, but The Racketeer is sadly disappointing.  It reads like a book idea draft.  The writing is sloppy and the plot is full of holes.  I am surprised that Grisham has gotten this lazy (the disclaimer at the end is totally unnecessary--the reader quickly knows that no research was done for this book) and I am stunned that the editor considered it ready for publication.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|JG spins a story, exhibiting his mastery of his art. He does acknowledge that for a change, this story is not drawn from a real life situation. Having said that, The Racketeer reads more like a thriller, with camouflages, deceit, sex and chases strewn all over, reminding one of the old Alistair MacLean books. A good read overall, although I missed JG's courtroom dramas and detailed descriptions of loop holes in the law.
B008S847X2|5.0|Once again John McLaughlin has given us music full of inspiration and passion. This album is not simply a follow up to To The One (a brilliant album inspired by John's love of Coltrane's music). Instead John continues to move into new territory, here aided by an updated band and a new PRS guitar. John's chops are legendary and he adds new flavors to his playing on Now Here This (did I hear some Beck inspired playing in there?).<br /><br />The fact that John continues to raise his own personal bar for musical expression is incredible. As always he surrounds himself with fantastic musicians. Barot's drumming is powerful and propels the music. Gary Husband's playing, especially on acoustic piano, is a great compliment to John's music. Etienne Mbappe's bass playin is simply stunning (Check out Call and Answer to hear him solo).<br /><br />In 1971, Inner Mounting Flame announced an amazing force in music named John McLaughlin. Now 41 years later, let there be no mistake, that force has not diminished. Thank You John!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app does exactly what needs to be done and that is calculate. I can't complain and it is convenient.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie is a must see for all Dr.Seuss lovers, I enjoyed every minute of it and you will too!
B0053O89YM|5.0|Alicia Florrick is back again :) couldn't be happier! This show keeps getting better and better! Can't wait to watch season four!
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is where I spend like most of my free time so of course I love it!! its easy to read and has so many great and easy ideas for practically everything! and if you ever need to laugh you can just go to the humorous secssion and get a good laugh!! hope this helped!!!
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This show is one of the funniest shows on television since Friends, it is one of my favorites and although there was more drama this season, I was very pleased!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I was finally able to purchase The Six Million Dollar Man on DVD! I was only able to get Season 1 & 2 because they were the only ones available. I will definitely NOT pay over $300.00 for the entire series, that's just too much. I am very happy with the DVDs! I recommend if you liked the series, pick up the DVDs seperately, not as a collection. Looking forward to season 3, 4 and 5!
B003TNM2K6|5.0|One of the greatest endings ever. It follows the book pretty close. We've seen it many times! I recommend this movie HIGHLY!
B004LWZW24|2.0|This movie was recommended by a friend whose opinions I no longer trust.  :)  I felt this movie could have been better if there was a larger budget and someone to punch-up the script. The story was okay, but the script just couldn't bring me into the story.  In the long run it came across as a bad \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" episode. I found myself frequently checking how much time remained on the movie and was not in the least scared, on edge, or spooked. It was a fairly boring movie.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Initial Thoughts:<br />I loved Bared to You (read my review here), and the BlogHer Book Club offered me free copies of both books to review. How could I say no to that?!<br /><br />The Pros:<br />This book is based around a concept that is really hard for a lot of people, especially me. Trust. Can Eva and Gideon trust each other through all that is happening around them?<br /><br />I identified with Eva. Love can make us feel like we're going crazy. There were many parts of the book that I was like, \\"Oh girl, I've been there\\".<br /><br />Bared to You was very Fifty Shades-esque. This one? Not even close. And I mean that it in the best way. This book is the older, more sophisticated cousin of Fifty.<br /><br />This was what I like to call \\"book crack\\". I couldn't put it down. The drama was a little outlandish at times, but this is a romance novel, when is a romance novel not dramatic.<br /><br />The introduction of rocker Brett Kline was an interesting plot turn. I may have been rooting for him for a few pages...<br /><br />The Cons:<br />Anyone else pick up on the is she pregnant/is she not story line? It was unnecessary and didn't add to the story.<br /><br />Although I understood what Gideon was doing, why did he have to do it in that way? Weren't there any other options?<br /><br />Both Gideon and Eva are addicts. I think that the psychiatrist's advice was warranted. They are addicted to each other, and it's not always in a good way.<br /><br />Eva \\"getting back\\" at Gideon with Brett. Her thinking he was cheating does not equate to her needing to kiss another man to prove a point. Childish much?<br /><br />Eva calling Gideon \\"ace\\". It was annoying.<br /><br />The Wrap Up: 4/5<br />Loved it. Although the book has some flaws, it is one of my favorite romances. Is it December yet? Entwined With You... I cannot wait to devour you.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"It's my place to stand beside you, and support you, and yes, just f^%#$^& look pretty on your arm sometimes. It's my right, my duty, and my privilege, Eva, just as it's yours in reverse.\\"es. It's my right, my duty, and my privilege, Eva, just as it's yours in reverse.\\"
0345803507|4.0|I'm a normal guy (by normal guy standards) and I enjoyed the FSOG trilogy. I must have!...it's really LONG and repeats its self a lot, but I never grew tired of E.L. James breezy writing style surrounding a yuppie couple finding romance and love. Of course what makes it unique is that he's a 27 years old super-handsome billionare who's into kinky sex and she's an intelligent and pretty 21yr old from modest means who is also a virgin and doesn't care about his money. In fact even after they marry she just wants to work everyday.<br /><br />I adored Anastasia's character, who was made so vivid to this reader by the audio book reader Becca Battoe. Battoe should win an award for her reading, even though her reading on a lot of the male characters mirrored each other, she nailed Anastasia to a tee, and her rendering of Christian Grey was sturdy throughout.<br /><br />Better than expected, I recommend Fifty Shades of Grey for a clear uncensored insight on young love and life in our modern time.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|This is a good book with lots of twists and turns.  It kept me interested in learning the outcome.  Deals with a lot of twisted issues and sadness and was quite unusual, but I enjoyed it.
B00448SE4S|4.0|I don't think my wife enjoyed this one. It's a romantic comedy to the extreme and with supernatural effects and rowdy Beck / Weezer-like music. It also took me back to the arcade fighting games I played in the 80s. Enjoyed it!  If Cera doesn't star in Love on the Big Screen soon, he's going to be too old. Is he already there?
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|GREAT ORDER PROCESSING AND DELIVERY.  I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THEE BOOK I PURCHASED.  I PLAN ON CONTINUING TO USE AMAZON AND ITS PROVIDERS FOR FUTURE PURCHASES. WELL DONE!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app! Its addicting, i had never played it before and downloaded it one day for my step daughter and BOOM i play it more than her
B0085RQLXK|4.0|This album has a little bit of everything.  Yes, it has a few ballads but these guys have always put at least one ballad on every album.  It's ignorant for anyone to bitch about this.  In time I believe MFAD could be compared to The Stones' &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;.  Not overly popular with casual fans, but regarded for its variety by the TRUE FAN.  Overall, I would describe the sound as a mix of Permanent Vacation and Draw the line.  I count 4 ballads on it, not 7.  There's a couple mid-tempo songs that are borderline but not what I would call 'ballads'.  Definitely not a dull listen, it grows on you the more you listen to it.  I suggest that the true fan should go back and listen to all of their albums before this, including HOB, and you'll find that this really fits in pretty well with the OVERALL vibe and mix of a good Aerosmith album.  Also, it showcases Steven's vocal range better than he has in a while.  Any 'good' rock band has a mix of different sounds on an album.  If you want an 'even' sounding album full of the same boring riffs over and over, listen to AC/DC.  This is the best thing they've put out since Nine Lives by far.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Beautifully written, the author sounds agile and convincing. Use of examples and little tests keep you from forgetting that, ultimately, this book is about you.
0060873175|1.0|I'm not saying the premise was bad - well, yes, it was, ridiculously unbelievable- a sci-fi version of:\\"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\\" or the \\"George Shrinks\\" cartoon aimed at adults.  Maybe in Crichton's hands alone it might have been a tad better, but the joint effort falls terribly flat.  It is rushed, sophomoric and boring.  I bought the paperback and didn't see at first that Preston's name was on it as well.  The first few pages were ok, then it just started getting silly and stayed that way to the end, with the gang of students having to battle gigantic snakes and rodents. Really -this got published?  I'm not even sure it would have fared better in the YA market.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|It served as a fun romp during the Halloween season.  It dragged a bit in the middle, but I enjoyed comparing it to the landmark movie of the same name that starred Bella Lagosi in the early 30s which spawned the vampire genre for future books, movies and TV shows.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Some interesting twists in this season ... some of the arcs were very thought provoking ... but, the end better not be another dream sequence or this whole season's rating takes a HUGE dip!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Another awesome cd from Mumford & Sons!  If you liked the previous album, you'll enjoy this one too.  Purchasing off of Amazon download was fast and easy!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the best of the &quot;story&quot; apps in my opinion. Gold is the only gift so you don't have to buy anything to get the good stuff. Nothing spoils if you can't check on it everyday. It's fun experimenting with combinations to breed the different dragons too. The dragons are just so darn cute!
B0067EKY9K|4.0|British writer Paul Torday has written a few best-selling and award winning novels.  His 2006 novel \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" was a winner of the 2007 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Price for Comic Writing and a Waverton Good Read Award in 2008.<br /><br />The story was so well loved in the UK that it would receive serialization on BBC Radio 4 and eventually receive a film adaptation in 2010 directed by Lasse Hallstrom (\\"Chocolate\\", \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\", \\"The Cider House Rules\\", \\"Dear John\\") and written by Simon Beaufoy (\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\", \\"The Full Monty\\", \\"127 Hours\\").<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The overall picture quality for this film is quite amazing.  Shot in London, Scottland and Morcco, Terry Stacey (\\"Adventureland\\", \\"50/50″, \\"P.S. I Love You\\") manages to capture the lush greens and the barren desert with efficacy.  Colors are natural, vibrant when they need to be and black levels are nice and deep.  I didn't see any banding issues, nor did I see any artifacts and the detail, may it be during closeups or the clothing of an individual can be seen.  If anything, the film looks great on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  As one can expect from a romantic comedy, the film is dialogue driven and is crystal clear, along with Dario Marianelli's (\\"Atonement\\", \\"V for Vendetta\\", \\"Pride & Prejudice\\") musical score.  But there is also good use of surround and LFE, primarily during the fishing scenes and you hear the fish jumping in the water to sounds of splashing.  These really come through the surround channels and just the boom from those scenes, it was a nice touch.<br /><br />There area few scenes with crowds and you do get ambiance but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack for \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" was quite appropriate and the added touch of the surround channel and LFE sequences were pretty cool to hear!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Miracles Happen: Making Salmon Fishing in the Yemen - (13:07) The director and cast talk about the making of the film.  From interviews with the fly fishing adviser, shooting in Scotland and what happened when a flood devastated the set and more.<br />  The Fisherman in the Middle East: Novelist Paul Torday - (3:14) Novelist Paul Torday talks about how his novel became a film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I have to admit that before I review a fishing-related film, I always wonder if it will be about another banal storyline of one trying to find their life through fishing.  Fortunately, this is not the case with \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\".<br /><br />In fact, I found this film to be smart, delightful and quite moving!  While fishing is an important part of the film, what makes \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" so original is that it deals with political spin, as viewers get to see how politicians try to deflect a crisis by trying to find another story that people will follow.<br /><br />In the case of this film, the Prime Minister's press secretary trying to deflect the crisis in Afghanistan and the death of soldiers by trying to build up British and Arab relations by a storyline of two sides working together to bring salmon fishing to the Yemen.  And the concept may seem like a bore when reading it, this film is definitely not boring, thanks to its characters and a wonderful performance by Emily Blunt, Ewan McGregor, Amr Waked and Kristin Scott Thomas.<br /><br />You have one storyline revolving around Harriet (Blunt), who not only has to emotionally deal with her boyfriend having to go to Afghanistan on a mission and not long after, having to deal with the prikish Dr. Alfred Jones (McGregor).  But the delightful thing about Harriet is that she embraces her job and Dr. Alfred Jones with humor and just wanting to make sure that she comes through for her client, the Sheikh Muhammed (Waked).<br /><br />And as for Dr. Alfred Jones, a man with Asperger's Syndrome but so qualified and knowledgeable when it comes to fish, talking with others who are not so familiar with fish and streams, he can be rather cold.  But what is interesting about Jones is that under that cold demeanor, he's actually a good guy.  He's just not good with his emotions but yet, Harriet manages to bring the best out of him.<br /><br />And this is where the conundrum begins because Harriet hears of her boyfriend's possible demise (news reports of no survivors involving British soldiers in Afghanistan).  Emotionally withdrawn, Dr. Jones knows that he needs her to complete this Yemen project, so he gradually warms up by being there for her, helping her through this tough time.  And through that tough time of adjusting, not only does he enjoy her as as a colleague, he begins to feel attracted to her.  As she does with him.<br /><br />And to add to the relationship between the two, you add the Sheikh Muhammed.  The Sheikh knows that there are people who will try to derail his plan to bring salmon fishing to Yemen (especially as there are groups who don't like the interaction with the British on working on a  project together).  But the Sheikh has a lot of faith, always positive and for Dr. Jones, he is unable to understand what faith is, but through being with the Sheikh throughout the project, he begins to change and possibly see where his life can be better used to help people.<br /><br />And then you have Kristin Scott Thomas as the press secretary Patricia Maxwell.  A woman who is seen primarily talking on her phone or on chat with the Prime Minister, and she provides a comical look at how the politicians work.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality is fantastic and the lossless soundtrack sounds great, especially for the salmon fishin scenes that tend to use the surround channels and LFE quite effectively.  While not special features heavy, you do get two of them.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" was indeed a treat.  Aside from the wonderful performances, the direction by Lasse Hallstrom is well-done, the cinematography of Terry Stacey is also fantastic and for the most part, Simon Beaufoy's screenplay of Paul Torday's novel manages to be delightful and makes the film quite enjoyable.  It's an original storyline which I don't think will ever be duplicated.<br /><br />If you are looking for a different kind of romantic comedy that is fun and very entertaining, \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" is definitely recommended!races her job and Dr. Alfred Jones with humor and just wanting to make sure that she comes through for her client, the Sheikh Muhammed (Waked).<br /><br />And as for Dr. Alfred Jones, a man with Asperger's Syndrome but so qualified and knowledgeable when it comes to fish, talking with others who are not so familiar with fish and streams, he can be rather cold.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Challenging thought-provoking game that I also found to be wonderfully relaxing.  Definitely one of my favorite game apps for my phone.
B007MDB71O|4.0|American author, Edgar Rice Burroughs, is well-known for creating sci-fi fiction and adventure books in his lifetime.  Best known for creating \\"Tarzan\\", Edgar Rice Burroughs is also known for his sci-fi tales about Mars known as \\"Barsoom\\".<br /><br />In 1912, he would write the novel \\"A Princess of Mars\\" which would introduce people to a new hero named John Carter and for five more decades, he would go on to write eleven more novels based on the character and many generations of sci-fi fans would grow up reading Edgar Rice Burrough's sci-fi stories.  And for many people, Burrough's \\"Barsoon\\" stories would inspire many sci-fi authors such as Robert A. Heinlen, Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury.  Including filmmakers such as James Cameron and George Lucas.<br /><br />And many would try to create a film adaption of the film for nearly a hundred years, but the technology to create something so ambitious with spacecraft, monsters and a large alien race was not exactly an easy film that studios could even consider, so many times, owning the rights to make a film based on John Carter fell through.  And in 2006, there was discussion of another attempt to make Burrough's \\"A Princess of Mars\\" a movie but with the title of \\"John Carter\\" and was originally planned to be directed by Jon Favreau and produced by Harry Knowles.  But Favreau would go on to work on \\"Iron Man\\" and so, the next man in line to work on the film was Pixar's Andrew Stanton.<br /><br />Stanton had written many of Pixar's blockbuster animated films such as the three \\"Toy Story\\" films, \\"A Bug's Life\\", \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", \\"Finding Nemo\\", \\"Wall-E\\" and since he grew up enjoying Edgar Rice Burrough's and he has done a magnificent job in writing films, as well as directing \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Wall-E\\", why not give him the opportunity to direct Disney's most ambitious sci-fi action film.  So ambitious that \\"John Carter\\" was budgeted at $272 million.<br /><br />The film's screenplay is by Stanton, Mark Andrews (storyboard artist for \\"Spider-Man\\", \\"The Iron Giant\\" and the \\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\\" TV series) and Michael Chabon (who wrote the novel \\"Wonder Boys\\" and the screen story for \\"Spider-Man 2″).<br /><br />\\"John Carter\\" would feature stars such as Taylor Kitsch (\\"Battleship\\", \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\", \\"Friday Night Lights\\"), Lynn Collins (\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\", \\"The Number 23″, \\"The Lake House\\"), Willem Dafoe (\\"Platoon\\", \\"Spider-Man\\", \\"The Boondock Saints\\"), Thomas Haden Church (\\"Spider-Man 3″, \\"Sideways\\", \\"Easy A\\") and Samantha Morton (\\"Control\\", \\"In America\\", \\"Morvern Callar\\").<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"John Carter\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  If there is one thing that videophiles can remain confident in Disney, is that they strive for perfection, may it be animated or live action films.  And \\"John Carter\\" does not disappoint!  The video quality is absolutely beautiful and vibrant.  The colors of the various costume design, the scenery of Mars to the detail of the skin and even CGI aliens and monsters are magnificent.  Black levels are nice and deep and the clarity is amazing.<br /><br />While watching this film, I detected no artifacts, banding or any major issues with the video.  If anything, \\"John Carter\\" looks magnificent on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />As for the lossless audio, \\"John Carter\\" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.<br /><br />As for the lossless track, \\"John Carter\\" like the video is just amazing to listen to.  This is an immersive soundtrack!  You literally hear (and feel) everything around you.  From the overhead ships, the many crashes, booms, blasts, you can feel confident that the surround channels are active, especially LFE.  This is a film that will definitely utilize your subwoofer.  Great direction effects, ambiance is also well-featured.  \\"John Carter\\" sounds absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"John Carter\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with director Andrew Stanton and producers Jim Morris and Lindsey Collins who go through every detail about the making of the film and everything you need to know about casting, visual effects and more!<br />  Disney Second Screen - If you have an iPad or laptop, you can sync the film and enjoy additional content.<br />  Deleted Scenes with Optional Director's Commentary - (19:02) Featuring ten deleted scenes including an alternate opening and with optional commentary by director Andrew Stanton.<br />  100 Years in the Making - (10:43) A fascinating featurette about Edgar Rice Burroughs and those who tried to bring John Carter to the big screen for the last hundred years.  Featuring re-enactments of Edgar Rice Burroughs, director Andrew Stanton, filmmaker Jon Favreau and many more.<br />  360 Degrees of John Carter - (34:33) A production diary featuring the costume and makeup department and following director Andrew Stanton through a day on the set of \\"John Carter\\".<br />  Barsoom Bloopers - (1:48) Gag reel from \\"John Carter\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"John Carter\\" on Blu-ray comes with a separate DVD featuring the film.  The DVD is presented in widescreen 2:40:1, English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital Language track and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Also, a slipcover case is included.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Before watching \\"John Carter\\", I am aware of how badly this film did in the box office and I have read the various news reports on the finger pointing of why the film failed.<br /><br />Was it because Andrew Stanton, who knew how to write and direct animated films for Pixar, was not ready to take on the job for such large scale film?  Was it because the concept of \\"John Carter\\" has been rehashed in so many other films such as \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Avatar\\", \\"Flash Gordon\\" and other sci-fi films?<br /><br />After finally watching \\"John Carter\\", I felt that part of the problem was that the film was not marketed well and while John Carter is a name that will entice Edgar Rice Burroughs fans familiar with his work, the goal of a lot of action films is not to solely market to the Generation X or the Baby Boomers but for the Generation Y.  A generation who are used to vampire films, big budget superhero films and sci-fi films such as \\"Avatar\\".  And \\"John Carter\\", while familiar to us who are familiar with Burroughs work, may sound like a politician to today's generation.<br /><br />And the problem that the film suffered from was an over-reliance on John's relation to the alien characters and not enough on the storyline about John Carter.  I know that there was a lot of trimming with this film, but I wonder how much important scenes were cut in order to make 132 minutes.  We are given flashbacks of John's wife and child, but it would have made a bigger visual impact if we saw what happened and how it would make things worse for John Carter.<br /><br />As for the war between the Heliums and Zodanga, one again...this feels rushed.  While we are given a narration at the beginning, it's not enough.  You need to build upon the antagonist and show why he is so evil.  And it's been mentioned many times before how George Lucas has borrowed from Burrough's \\"Barsoom\\" stories.  But one thing he made sure was to show people how evil the empire was and how Darth Vader was the ultimate evil, but also someone behind the scenes.  There was nothing that made us know the level of evil within the character of Sab Than, Jeddak of Dozanga.  All that was established was the Thern and how they love to instill chaos on a planet.<br /><br />For a sci-fi film, may it be a Predator, an Alien, an evil empire or whatever, the antagonist must be shown to be a great evil and thus, the viewer can root for the protagonist.  But it doesn't happen this way in \\"John Carter\\", why doesn't Princess Deja Thoris want to go back home?  It's because she is being forced to marry the enemy.  For today's viewers, they are so used to seeing the greater evil either kill a love one, destroying a planet or annihilating a race, there is just no way that an arrange marriage is \\"enough\\" to be believed for today's sci-fi fan.<br /><br />And this is the problem that \\"John Carter\\" has met with audiences.  This is story based on a 1912 novel which has been rehashed many times and because the people behind the film are great fans of Burrough's work and want to respect the work of his novels, there is no straying away from the storyline. Listening to the audio commentary, there was a moment where Stanton and others talked about how they were big fans, but sometimes a film needs to be changed from its original novel in order to make things modern.  And despite the fact that it may offend those who grew up with the film, the fact that we see this happening with super-hero films such as \\"The Avengers\\", \\"Spider-Man\\", \\"X-Men: First Class\\", to name a few, the writers get away from the original comic book series, maintain the characters but modernize the screenplay for a modern audience.<br /><br />The focus seemed of keeping the storyline intact, but giving today's technology a chance of bringing the story of \\"Barsoom\\" to a wider audience who may not be familiar with John Carter or the characters of the novels, is a major gamble.  And while watching the film, I realized more and more that the film was devoid of any emotional attachment to its primary characters until we reach towards the end of the film.  And this is surprising to me as Andrew Stanton has always made characters a priority, may it be in the \\"Toy Story\\" films, \\"Wall-E\\", \\"Finding Nemo\\", \\"Monsters, Inc.\\".  There was always an emotional attachment to the characters and in this film, it was geared more towards the popcorn action fan and showing that John Carter can kick some butt.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, as expected from a Disney Blu-ray release, the video quality and the lossless audio are fantastic and there are a good number of special features, including a fascinating audio commentary, a featurette on how it took nearly 100 years for a \\"John Carter\\" film to be released and other special features to keep viewers busy watching this Blu-ray for several hours.<br /><br />Looking back, especially having grown up reading \\"John Carter\\", not through the novels but the old '70s Marvel comic book series and my feeling when I heard of the film being made was more of a \\"would anyone care in this day and age about \\"John Carter?\\". While myself and others who grew up reading the novels or comic book series would say \\"yes\\"! , after watching this film, I felt that the staff did a good job in bringing Edgar Rice Burrough's sci-fi classic to the big screen and bringing life to the characters, monsters, aliens and air vehicles, but visual effects and action sequences can only go so far.  I still feel that Andrew Stanton is a talented filmmaker and an excellent writer, but there was a reason why this film was not made for so long and it's not just because of the technology, but it's because so many of the stories elements have been done on other sci-fi films, rehashed over and over and \\"John Carter\\" suffers from sci-fi banality.<br /><br />But by no means is \\"John Carter\\" a horrible film.  \\"John Carter\\" manages to have its fair share of fun and enjoyable moments and I felt it managed to be a sci-fi popcorn action film that was created to be nothing more than what it is meant to be.<br /><br />And while I felt that the storyline of the film was average, the overall quality of the video and audio is not. \\"John Carter\\" looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray and I'm confident that videophile and audiophiles will be impressed by this Blu-ray release.  I'll even go farther in saying that this Blu-ray release of \\"John Carter\\" is probably one of the best looking and sounding Blu-ray releases of 2012 so far!<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for a family sci-fi action film, \\"John Carter\\" may not have done well in the box office, but giving it a try on Blu-ray, you may find yourself enjoying it!ter\\", why doesn't Princess Deja Thoris want to go back home?

While slight layer of grain can be seen, there is a slight use of DNR as the film looks very clean and sometimes soft.  Fortunately, Touchstone Home Entertainment was able to find a balance and showcase the wonderful cinematography of Robert Richardson (\\"Shutter Island\\", \\"Inglourious Basterds\\", \\"Kill Bill: Vol. 1″).  Some of the scenery shots, especially the vignette shots look fantastic in HD.<br /><br />Overall, picture quality is very good and for those who owned the previous DVD release, will enjoy the HD upgrade.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Horse Whisperer\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.

Cinematographer Robert Richardson captures the beauty of Montana but also making sure the audience sees the interaction between the characters and the horses.  Along with the beautiful cinematography, the musical by Thomas Newman and Gwil Owen manages to capture the variety of emotions of the characters as Grace tries to get back to her life, while Annie and Tom develop a closer relationship.<br /><br />And as Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job of playing a mother who is not sure about being a mother (but trying her best now after her daughter's injury) and discovering life outside of the big city, the film showed great promise at the time with  actress Scarlett Johansson.  Scarlett manages to capture a teenager who has suffered amazing physical and emotional trauma and Redford manages to bring out her acting with efficacy.<br /><br />But while some people may feel the film is tool long and unnecessary, when I first watched this film many years ago and even now, I still feel the pacing of the film, to build upon character development was necessary and helped establish all three main characters.<br /><br />The character of Tom is quite content of living in Montana, while Annie is often wondering how anyone can be so far from the city and not having major restaurants, shopping, etc.  As for Grace, she is emotionally withdrawn and her injury and how long it takes for her to put her trust in Tom and getting the courage to get close to Pilgrim takes time.  Even Pilgrim took some time in order to get used to being closed to Tom.  If anything, the horse trainers on set, did a wonderful job in making the horses react to the characters.<br /><br />There is a romantic angle that involves Annie and Tom.  We know that Annie who was a workaholic had an unfulfilled marriage to Tom.  But as both she and Tom become more attracted towards each other, it's interesting to see how Tom's sister-in-law reacts to her.  She knows that Tom also needed some time to heal after the death of his wife and now with this amazing talent, the last thing she wants is her brother-in-law getting involved with a married woman.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, the same special features on the original DVD is included.

B007THA4FI|2.0|Ms Rowling writes well. I had a good grasp of all the characters' personalities, the places and the underlying problems, but after reading 40% of the book (Kindle version) I did not care enough about the outcome to continue reading.

B005LAIGWS|3.0|With the box office success of the 2007 film \\"Ghost Rider\\", a character based on the popular Marvel Comics supernatural anti-hero, there was no doubt that Columbia Pictures and Marvel would once again work on a sequel.<br /><br />But rather than work on a sequel, producers Ari Arad and Avi Arad wanted to go in a different direction, to focus more on a reboot of the character and showcase Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider.  So, for \\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\", the producers decided to bring in \\"Crank\\" and \\"Jonah Hex\\" directorial team Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.  Brought in to write the screenplay was David S. Goyer (\\"The Dark Knight\\", \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\", \\"FlashForward\\"), Scott M. Gimple (\\"Life\\", \\"The Walking Dead\\", \\"FlashForward\\") and Seth Hoffman (\\"Prison Break\\", \\"House M.D.\\").<br /><br />Actor Nicolas Cage would reprise his role as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider and Ciaran Hinds as Roarke.  Starring in the film are Violante Placido (\\"The American, \\"Che ne sara di Noi\\"), Idris Elba (\\"Thor\\", \\"28 Weeks Later\\", \\"The Wire\\"), Johnny Whitworth (\\"Limitless\\", \\"3:10 to Yuma\\", \\"Empire Records\\")  and Fergus Riordan (\\"Fragile\\", \\"I Want to be a Soldier\\").<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider: Spirits of Vengeance\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The great news is that the film looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  Shot on digital, the film features wonderful detail from the CG work of Ghost Rider, to the clarity of details of Ghost Rider's jacket, Johnny Blaze's transformation, the use of fire and flame effects and much more!  The colors are vibrant and videophiles should be pleased by the detail of the film.  With that being said, the weakness which many people felt about the film is shooting the film via handheld.  Many disliked it, I personally was not too bothered by it.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />As for the lossless audio, \\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" is presented in English, French and Spanish 5.1 DTS-HD MA and an English-Audio Descriptive track plus Catalan 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As one would expect from an action-driven film, this film is immersive.  The soundscape in you room is filled with audio from all over, thanks to its use of directional sound coming from the surround channels.  From the Ghost Rider taking control of various vehicles (including one behemoth vehicle), a chase scene with many crash scenes and explosions and windows and glass shattering, to the many guns being fired in the film, especially heavy artillery, the lossless soundtrack is fantastic!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Directors Expanded Video Commentary - A video commentary featuring filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.  While the two are shown frequently during the commentary, we also see a video of the film but also a smaller video section in the corner featuring the actual filming of a certain scene.  There is no doubt that Neveldine and Taylor bring a lot of humor to the audio commentary, but depending on one's taste, some may find it funny and others may find it annoying.  But it's an informative but off-the-cuff type of commentary that you usually don't hear in a film.<br />  Deleted Scenes - (11:20) A total of six deleted scenes.<br />  The Path to Vengeance: Making Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance - (1:25:00)  A six-documentary which can be watched in full or by each part.  Featuring \\"Blazing New Path\\" (8:31, Discussion of not wanting to make a sequel but a new film/reboot), \\"Patience is Not a Virtue: Pre-Production\\" (25:31, working on the script, hiring the cast and more), \\"We Will Burn This City to Bitter Ashes (8:50, about filming in Eastern Europe), \\"To Hell and Back: Production\\" (23:41, from shooting the film, makeup and more), \\"Walking in Both Worlds: Post-Production\\" (15:32, the digital effects of the film) and \\"The Fires of Hell Will Purify You: Release\\" (8:41, test screenings, promoting the film at Comic-Con and more).<br />  Previews - Sony Pictures Home Entertainment trailers.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />A code is included with the Blu-ray release to watch and access the full-length movie  via the cloud through Ultraviolet.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />As a comic collector during my child up to my college years, \\"Ghost Rider\\" was a title that I did purchase and collect.  And to tell you the truth, when this sequel came out, I was a bit excited because I thought the film would feature Danny Ketch and the character known as Vengeance.<br /><br />But instead, it was a film to showcase Ghost Rider, his powers (using newer technology than what was used in the first film) and showcase Johnny Blaze and the battle he faces each day with the demon inside him. And while I did like seeing the craziness of Johnny Blaze, thanks to Nicolas Cage's portrayal of the character, the film was all action with a storyline that seemed to be created around the action.<br /><br />We have the cool Idris Elba show up as the often inebriated priest Moreau, but unfortunately, his character was never fully developed.  We see the beautiful Violante Placido as Nadya, who was featured heavily in the first half of the film but yet she nearly disappears for the second half until the end.<br /><br />So, I was bit surprised because I expected a lot from David S. Goyer, who did a fantastic job with the screenplay of \\"The Dark Knight\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\", but the film seems to embody more action as his previous screenplays that he did for films like \\"Blade\\" and \\"Blade II\\".  But I wouldn't be surprised if the screenplay was rewritten and retweaked for budgetary reasons and molded for the directorial style of filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.<br /><br />Personally, having read the \\"Ghost Rider\\" comic books, the film really needs to take a darker step forward.  While the visual effects of this film was good, having a story with Ghost Rider around a young boy, just doesn't seem right.  It reminds me of Marvel comic books of the '80s when Spider-Man, Captain America and other superheroes would hang out with children (which was understandable as the demographic targeted was children), but in today's superhero films, I definitely don't want to see a superhero film that revolves around a child, especially with a dark character such as Ghost Rider.<br /><br />While the popcorn action will definitely entice those who expect Ghost Rider to kick some ass, the step to a more darker Ghost Rider was cool to see visually, but the action and visual effects can only go so far.  Personally, they need to get out of the Roarke storyline and possibly consider focusing on a storyline featuring Ghost Rider vs. another Marvel hero (which usually happens in the comic books), a hero that possibly Marvel may want to look into giving the character its own film.  May it be the return of Blade or Iron Fist/Luke Cage, Dr. Strange or even Ghost Rider vs. Vengeance if need be.  And both working together in taking on a greater evil.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, \\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" does look and sound great on Blu-ray, that is a major plus!  And whether or not you enjoy the humorous video commentary by filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, at least the guys are able to defend the film and even have fun joking around about the film despite how many critics disapproved of the film.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" was a step forward in terms of visual effects and going for a more darker feel, but its storyline was taking several steps backward.  To have a bad ass character such as Ghost Rider featured in a screenplay that revolves around a kid... what a way to dampen the enthusiasm for fans expecting so much from an iconic Marvel Comics antihero!<br /><br />Ghost Rider deserves much better, as has the other Marvel superheroes have received in their own films.  A better storyline to balance out the incredible action.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\\" will appeal to movie fans who love films (especially Blu-ray releases) with plenty of action.  Just don't watch this film having high expectations, or else you will be disappointed.with Ghost Rider around a young boy, just doesn't seem right.

1439153663|5.0|Wow - this book was so...what words to describe it...heart touching, heart wrenching...very very good.  So good I actually looked to see if I had mistaken it for fiction and it was biography but it is fiction.  The characters are so fleshed out and three dimensional that I truly felt their joy and pain.  At times I felt even truly sorry for Marshall for the environment that had made him who he was. It is so well rounded in showing the different sides to the lives of the slaves and the plantation owners - an exceptional read.

Video quality is very good as close-ups showcase the detail on the character's faces to their clothing.  Skin tones are natural, black levels and deep but the film looks like it has been cleaned up via slight DNR (which is probably going to be the case for a lot of studios in 2012, as most casual viewers have voiced their opinion against grain, versus the videophiles who prefer it).  But compared to the original LD and DVD versions, this is the best version of I have seen of \\"Ransom\\" by far.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Ransom: 15th Anniversary Edition\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and Frenh 5.1 and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  Lossless audio is what I was expecting for this older film.  While there are scenes that utilize the surround channels during the more action-intense scenes towards the final arc of the film, the film is primarily front and center-channel driven due to the film being dialogue driven.  Ambiance could have been utilized much more, especially with scenes involving crowds but overall, the lossless soundtrack was good but could have been much better.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Ransom: 15th Anniversary Edition\\" features the following special features:<br /><br />  Deleted Scenes - (3:53) Featuring four deleted scenes.<br />  What Would You Do? - (13:16) Featuring interviews with Ron Howard, editor Dan Hanley and the cast and crew of \\"Ransom\\".<br />  Between Takes - (4:00) Ron Howard, Rene Russo and Mel Gibson having fun between takes.<br />  International Theatrical Trailer - (1:06) The international theatrical trailer for \\"Ransom\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Back in 1996, with the success of \\"Braveheart\\", seeing the reunion of \\"Lethal Weapon\\" stars Mel Gibson and Rene Russo, was pretty exciting.<br /><br />And as these two talents were becoming big stars at the time, so was the career of filmmaker Ron Howard.  As a fan of \\"The Andy Griffith Show\\" and \\"Happy Days\\", I've supported Ron Howard's filmmaking career by watching most of the films he had directed, so suffice to say, I had high hopes when I watched this film in the theater.<br /><br />And at the time, I loved the film.  Enjoyed it so much that I would purchase the extended edition on LaserDisc and also the DVD.<br /><br />Here were in 2012, 15-years-later and \\"Ransom\\" (the theatrical edition, not the extended version) makes its debut in HD via Blu-ray.  And while ransom films usually do well in theaters such as the more recent films such as \\"Taken\\", \\"Munich\\" \\"Inside Job\\" or \\"Firewall\\" or a classic ransom film such as Akira Kurosawa's \\"High and Low\\", \\"Ransom\\" does have its place as one of the memorable ransom films out there.<br /><br />Mel Gibson and Rene Russo play two parents who are taken through a  degrees of emotions as they try to save their son, but with each mistake, they feel that they are more closer to losing him and getting their own son killed.  Both have amazing chemistry and both feed off each other's emotions.  Mel Gibson's Tom Mullen is a man full of anguish, a man that wants to be a ban and not give in to the kidnappers demands but is powerless, Rene Russo is the wife, Kate, who is pushed to the brink that we see her emotions start to turn its back on her husband.<br /><br />These are emotions that many past ransom films do not tend to emphasize.  A lot of tears, a lot of confrontational arguments and plenty of frustration, it's what I want to see in a ransom film.  True raw emotion of despair of one trying to get a family member or a child back from kidnappers.  And both Mel Gibson and Rene Russo are effective.<br /><br />And on the opposite end, Gary Sinise can always play a villain.  In this case, a detective who knows the law, but is also the leader of this kidnapping group.  He is remorseful, he is deadly and he will not hesitate in killing the young Sean.<br /><br />We do get to see a little Mel Gibson bravado in this film, as most people are so used to seeing him in action roles back in the '90s but for the most part, director Ron Howard is able to keep a balance between emotional drama and action that even 15-years-later, this film holds up quite well.<br /><br />While the Blu-ray release of \\"Ransom\\" features the film in HD and with a lossless soundtrack, slight DNR was used but as mentioned, this is the state of Blu-rays in 2012, as some studios are now trying to find a medium to appease the videophile who want grain or the casual masses who have shown their disdain towards seeing grain on films in HD.  As for the special features, these are the same special features from the DVD release.<br /><br />As for \\"Ransom\\", as thrilling as the film was back in 1996, the film is just as exciting in 2012!  Ron Howard does an amazing job as director, the acting performance by Mel Gibson, Rene Russo and Gary Sinise is fantastic and for fans of the film, this is probably the definitive version to own of the film right now.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for an awesome crime thriller, \\"Ransom\\" is one of the best ransom films made in America and worth owning on Blu!ng their own son killed.  Both have amazing chemistry and both feed off each other's emotions.

B007VYQ6DS|5.0|in the grand tradition of disney animal features, this film tells a story, with narrative propulsion, wonderful characters, intense conflict (Disney's code word used to be \\"Action\\") and a heart-warming resolution: so why is this film only being released in a Blu-ray combination? this seems to be the new test case for Disney, to force blu-ray sales, and they will probably only release DVD-only format just at (or after) christmas. i will refuse to be herded inti this promotional railroading and hope more people will let disney know this is a rude trick to play.
B007KUFDBY|4.0|Back in the late 1800′s, Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson penned the novel \\"Treasure Island\\" which was a coming of age novel based on Jim Hawkins, who works on a pirate ship in hopes to find gold.<br /><br />While \\"Treasure Island\\" has received several film adaptations as far back as 1918 and a talkie version starring Jackie Cooper and Wallace Beery in 1934, most people may be familiar with the 1950 version because it was Walt Disney Studios first foray into live action film.  And the popularity of Disney's \\"Treasure Island\\" would lead to a 1954 sequel titled \\"Long John Silver\\".<br /><br />Over 50-years after Disney's \\"Treasure Island\\" was screened in theaters, Disney would once again release go back to the \\"Treasure Island\\" storyline but give it a sci-fi adaptation titled \\"Treasure Planet\\" and the film would become the 43rd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics line.<br /><br />\\"Treasure Planet\\" would be co-directed by Ron Clements and John Musker (the duo known for their work on \\"Aladdin\\", \\"The Princess and the Frog\\", \\"The Little Mermaid\\") and a film that would feature the voices of Joseph Gordon-Levitt (\\"Inception\\", \\"(500) Days of Summer\\", \\"50/50″, \\"3rd Rock from the Sun\\"), Laurie Metcalf (\\"Roseanne\\", \\"The Big Bang Theory\\"), Emma Thompson (\\"Sense and Sensibility\\", \\"Harry Potter\\" films\\"), Martin Short (\\"Father of the Bride\\", \\"Innerspace\\"), David Hyde Pierce (\\"Frasier\\", \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\"), Roscoe Lee Brown (\\"Logan's Run\\", \\"The Cowboys\\") and Patrick McGoohan (\\"Braveheart\\", \\"Danger Man\\", \\"Secret Agent\\").<br /><br />The film would employ the \\"70/30 Law\\" which mean the film would feature 70% traditional artwork and 30% sci-fi and featured art that was promoted by illustrators associated with the Brandywine School of Illustration.  And that was to give a \\"classic storybook illustration\\" style utilizing a painted style with a warm color pallette.<br /><br />While the reviews from critics for the film was split, unfortunately, \\"Treasure Planet\\" was one of the few modern Disney animated films that did not do well in the box office but did very well in home video sales when the DVD was released back in 2003.<br /><br />And now, \\"Treasure Planet: 10th Anniversary Edition\\" has been released on Blu-ray courtesy of Disney.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Treasure Planet\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:66:1 aspect ratio).  And one thing I can say for this film is that it is very colorful.  Utilizing the 70/30 law of creating 70% traditional art and 30% sci-fi, while the CG renderings are good for its time and still manage to hold up quite well in 2012 (despite not having great detail as today's CG films), the film still looks good.  Colors are vibrant (with little banding and also mild artifacts are preset) and detail is present.  Having owned the 2003 DVD, I can say that the detail seen in this film is the biggest difference between the Blu-ray and DVD versions is the detail.  But the film looks incredible on Blu-ray, not perfect but still a major upgrade from its 2003 DVD counterpart.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Treasure Planet\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And this soundtrack is quite immersive!  From the ambiance of Jim outside his mother's restaurant, you can hear the thunder rumbling.  Or during the more action intense sequences as weapons are being shot at each other, the booby traps that cause severe damage sounds fantastic via lossless.  There are many action scenes in which the lossless soundtrack just sounds incredible and immersive.  Surround channels are used frequently, as with the LFE.  And also, the dialogue and music composition by James Newton Howard (\\"The Sixth Sense\\", \\"The Fugitive\\", \\"Unbreakable\\") are crystal clear.  Audiophiles should be happy with the lossless soundtrack of \\"Treasure Island\\".<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Treasure Planet: 10th Anniversary Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Introduction by Laurie Metcalf - (:57) Laurie talks about taking viewers behind-the-scenes of the making of \\"Treasure Planet\\".<br />  RLS Legacy: Virtual 3D Tour  - Featuring the technical virtual 3D tour (9:29) by the artist coordinator and the nautical virtual 3D tour (7:40) by the production designer.<br />  Disneypedia: The Life of a Pirate Revealed - (12:13) Featuring various mini-featurettes such as pirate definitions, pirate flags, real pirates, code of conduct, pirate ships, treasure: lost and found.<br />  Disney Animation Magic - (14:18) A featurette with Roy Disney talking about Disney magic.<br />  Deleted Scenes - (6:33) Featuring an intro by Laurie Metcalf and introduction of each deleted scene (a total of three including alternative ending) by John Musker and Ron Clements.<br />  Story - Featuring an intro by Laurie Metcalf (1:01) and the trailer of the film \\"Treasure Planet\\" was inspired from, \\"Treasure Island\\" (2:08)<br />  Music - Intro. by Laurie Metcalf (1:38) and featuring \\"Jim's Theme\\" music video by John Rzeznik of The Goo Goo Dolls (4:13).<br />  Art Design - Intro. by Laurie Metcalf (:48), The Brandywine School (2:24) and short feature about the 70/30 Law (1:39)<br />  The Characters - Intro by Laurie Metcalf (:48), Jon Silver the Hook Test with Glen Keane (Supervising Animator for John Silver) (1:00), Silver Arm Test with Eric Daniels, CGI lead animator (:37), b.e.n. intro by Laurie Metcalf (:48), 3D Character 2D world (1:05) with Roy Conli, producer and a feature on maquettes (3:11).<br />  Animation - Featuring an intro. by Laurie Metcalf (1:13), Delbert Doppler (1:09) with Supervising Animator Sergio Pablos, Silver Progression Animation (2:25) with Supervising Animator Glen Keane, Pencil Animation: Amelias Cabin (2:10) featuring Ken Duncan, supervising Animator for Captain Amelia, Rough Animation to Final Film Comparison (1:38) with Supervising Animator, Jim Hawkins.<br />  Dimensional Staging - Introduction by Laurie Metcalf (1:08), Effects animation with Neil Eskuri (Artistic Coordinator) and Kyle Odermatt (Artistic Supervisor CGI) (1:19), Pose Camera with Neil Eskuri (1:42), Layout demonstration with Neil and Kyle (1:23), Treasure Planet Found with Neil and Kyle (2:08) and Lighting with both Neil and Kyle (1:12)<br />  Release - Introduction by Laurie Metcalf (:35), Teaser Trailer (1:24) and Theatrical Trailer (2:22).<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Treasure Planet: 10th Anniversary Edition\\" comes with a slipcover case and also a DVD version of the film presented in widescreen (1:66:1), English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. Subtitles are in English SDH.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />A coming-of-age story.  A story about adventure.  A story filled with excitement, action and more!<br /><br />Disney's sci-fi animated film, \\"Treasure Planet\\" is indeed a Disney family film that is exciting and entertaining but sometimes there are films that you feel are good but yet don't resonate well with the audience.  This is one of them.<br /><br />In the case of \\"Treasure Planet\\", many critics enjoyed the film but yet many people didn't watch it when it came out and unfortunately, \\"Treasure Planet\\" has the distinction of being one of Disney's modern animated films that didn't do well in the box office.<br /><br />The film tried to be different by focusing on sci-fi action, space pirates and a futuristic alternate version of \\"Treasure Island\\" and I enjoyed the action and the visuals at the time.  And its storyline of a young man getting the opportunity to make something of himself and traveling through the universe is quite exciting.<br /><br />But then again...I realized that watching it ten years later, the storyline plot didn't have the Disney magic that people are used to. And the characters, unlike other Disney films that tend to lean towards fantasy or feature a younger or cuter character, there is an obvious trend of how animated films perform of those that stick to the Disney formula of being a family film that attracts people of all ages.  And then there are animated films that tend to reach out to not necessarily the young children but slightly older kids and families.<br /><br />The thing is, Ron Clements and John Musker are a directorial duo who are known for revitalizing Disney with \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Aladdin\\".  But they are also creators who are creative and think outside of the box and during this age of animated cinema where people are used to seeing Pixar-based films, both Clements and Musker have continued to go the path of creating animation the traditional way.<br /><br />From 1985 and working on \\"The Black Cauldron\\" (a film that did terribly for Disney but yet has its cult followers who appreciate it because it was different and also quite dark).  The same thing can be said with the duo's last film \\"The Priness and the Frog\\", a return to traditional animation, having a happy but also dark storyline and so different than what people are used to seeing from Disney.<br /><br />Both Clements and Musker are used to thinking outside of the box and its a great thing.  They revitalized Disney through the creation of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and I'm glad that Disney has let them continue.  But the problem is that compared to Pixar animated films which have been consistent moneymaking films for the company, these type of films that Clements and Musker make may be appreciated by their fans who appreciate their creativity and use of traditional animation.  I sure am a fan of the duo and their work, but I also realize, that Disney is an everchanging company that prides itself on big money making films.<br /><br />So, what could have caused people to not watch the film?  For one, Disney films tend to captivate their young viewers.  Yes, the films captivate people of all ages but the characters are important for a Disney film.  The majority of the people focused in this film are guys.  There was no princess, there was no female character aside from Jim's mother and Captain Amelia who are barely seen in the film.  And when watching the film with my nine-year-old, he thought the character of Jim Hawkins was cool but found the character of John Silver, too creepy!<br /><br />According to my son, when I asked him what he didn't like about the film, he felt that outside of Jimmy and his mother, everyone else seemed to creepy for him.  Granted, this is in an era where humans interact with alien species.  So, aliens that are not cute, may turn some children off.<br /><br />I also suppose that back then, I was drawn by the action and the special effects and overall animation a bit too much and I never really sat back and enjoyed the plot of the film. When you consider the children watching the film, the special effects are not what they are keeping an eye out for.  They care about how fun the film is, the humor, the craziness but also their desire for a captivating plot but most importantly, how likeable the characters are and I realize that although the creative crew went outside of the box of this film, the children who are used to seeing cute characters in Disney films were not getting that in \\"Treasure Planet\\".<br /><br />You had an alien with many extensions out of his body that makes flatulent sounds, you have alien pirates who are not exactly likeable, a lobster like antagonist who was not likeable and it leaves you with few characters that the children can get into.  Doctor Doppler and Captain Amelia are used sporadically and the film literally relies on Jim Hawkins, John Silver and Morph.  Jim may be cool, Morph may be cute and funny but John Silver, as my son would say... too creepy!<br /><br />I realize now that while I enjoyed the popcorn action aspect of the film, for a Disney film, the storyline was not as dramatic and it was missing a little of that Disney magic.  And when the film premiered back during the 2002 holiday season, especially with Christmas coming up, you want to see Disney magic in full force.  And \\"Treasure Planet\\" wasn't that type of film.  Dare I say, an animated sci-fi popcorn action film.  It's what it is!<br /><br />For parents who are concerned about the PG rating, the alien characters may frighten younger children but for the most part, the film is not scary.  The PG deals with adventure and peril, as these characters do risk their lives in finding the mysterious treasure.  And there are characters that do die in this film.  So, parental guidance is suggested!<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, there are a lot of special features included on this Blu-ray release of \\"Treasure Planet\\". Granted, if you own the original 2003 DVD, this is the same release in terms of special features but you do get an awesome transfer with a pretty solid lossless soundtrack.  Also, you do get a DVD included with the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, by no means was \\"Treasure Planet\\" a bad movie, nor was it great.  There are a lot of action sequences featured throughout the film but I can see if young boys dig the film more than girls.  But for people who enjoy watching popcorn action films, then definitely give \\"Treasure Planet: 10th Anniversary Edition\\" on Blu-ray a try!us trend of how animated films perform of those that stick to the Disney formula of being a family film that attracts people of all ages.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is one of the best I have ever seen.  It is very emotional watching it seeing the characters you love survived and died. The third season is the best so far. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00783NWB6|4.0|It has been nearly a decade since the release of the \\"Underworld\\" film.  The original film, directed by Len Wiseman (\\"Live Free and Die Hard\\", \\"Underworld: Evolution\\") and written by Danny McBride, the first film would receive mixed reviews from critics but would make over $95 million in the box office and would pave the way for two more films, a sequel and a prequel.<br /><br />And now the fourth film, \\"Underworld: Awakening\\" directed by Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein (the duo who worked on the film \\"Shelter\\" and \\"Storm\\"), join Len Wiseman (who continues to write the films) and reuniting with actress Kate Beckinsale (\\"Aviator\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\").<br /><br />\\"Underworld: Awakening\\" was presented in theaters in 3D and brought in over $160 million in the box office, becoming the first film of 2012 to break $100 million.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Underworld: Awakening\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) aspect ratio and you have the option of watching the film in 3D or 2D.<br /><br />With that being said, make no doubt about it, \\"Underworld: Awakening\\" is one of the better Blu-ray on 3D live action release.  Not only do you get the 3D depth but there are a number of moments where shattering of fragments, blood, artillery, debris and weapons are flying all over the place towards you.  And the great news is that the 3D is constant, it's not like you will see a 3D effect every 20 minutes.  There is a lot of action in this film and there is no doubt that when \\"Underworld: Awakening\\" was made, there was an emphasis put on the action and making the 3D benefit from these action sequences.<br /><br />With that being said, the video quality for this film is fantastic!  Sony hasn't really disappointed anyone with their Blu-ray releases of late and \\"Underworld: Awakening\\" is a film that retains its cool, dark look with blues, grays and blacks.  Black levels are nice and deep, explosions showcasing lighter colors such as oranges and ambers are vibrant.  Detail is very well done, especially showcasing the vampire or Lycan transformations.  Both 3D and 2D versions look amazing and videophiles should be pleased with both versions.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Underworld: Awakening\\" not only showcases magnificent visuals and 3D, the lossless soundtrack is also immersive and fantastic.  Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA, French 5.1 DTS-HD MA and English -Audio Description Track, like the 3D that is constant, as with the action.  There is plenty of action from cars crashing into each other, Selene unleashing a parade of bullets, elevators crashing, bodies being swatted like flies and hearing the groans, the growls, you name it...the audio is coming from all over the place.<br /><br />I was so pleased with this soundtrack and just hearing constant audio coming from the surround channels was a major plus for me and also, the music soundtrack also is utilized for the surround channels as well.<br /><br />You get an immersive lossless soundtrack with \\"Underworld: Awakening\\" and dialogue is crystal clear, there is nothing bad to say about the soundtrack for this film.  Audiophiles will definitely be pleased!<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Underworld: Awakening\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Filmmakers Commentary - Featuring directors Mans Marlind, Bjorn Stein, producers Richard Wright and Gary Lucchesi, Executive producer and visual effects supervisor James McQuaide, this audio commentary is very active and informative.<br />  Selene Rises - (12:14) A featurette about Kate Beckinsale reprising her role as Selene and also going into the costume and character development.<br />  Casting the Future of Underworld - (12:33) A featurette about the two new cast members, Theo James and India Eisley.<br />  Resuming the Action - (8:52) A featurette about the film's action sequences, the stunts and the 3D technology used for the film.<br />  Building a Better Lycan - (10:20) A featurette on how they wanted to upgrade the visuals for the werewolves (Lycans).<br />  Previsualization Sequences - Featuring six pre-visualization sequences, including an alternate opening sequence: Alternate Opening Sequence (5:29), Car Chase in 3D (1:51), Coven Fight in 3D (1:58), Anitgen Attack - Part 1 (2:19), Antigen Attack - Part 2 (3:52), and Antigen Attack - Part 3 (6:05).<br />  Awakening a Franchise, Building a Brutal New World - (18:53) A featurette about the technology, special effects, set design for \\"Underworld: Awakening\\" and more.<br />  Blooper Reel - (3:21) Bloopers for \\"Underworld: Awakening\\".<br />  \\"Heavy Prey\\" Music Video by Lacey Sturm feat. Geno Lenardo - (3:25) Featuring the music video \\"Heavy Prey\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I have always looked at the \\"Underworld\\" films as your vampire vs. werewolf popcorn action film series.  With \\"Underworld: Awakening\\", the writers were moving away from the \\"Twilight\\" mushy romance (or Romeo & Juliet romance, as I called the first two films).<br /><br />This time around, Juliet (Selene) is separated from her Romeo (Michael) and the world has turned against them.  They are the hunted and she lost 12-years of her life, to find out that she has a child who may be the most powerful child with vampire and Lycan blood, and most importantly, having the blood of Alexander Corvinus, hence the immortality.<br /><br />And what is quite interesting is the introduction of the two new characters, we have \\"Secret Life of the American Teenager\\" actress India Eisley playing Eve and a vampire named David (played by Theo James) as the next generation who will play an important role in the future of the films.<br /><br />I admit that while \\"Underworld\\" films are typically popcorn action films, there was depth in the storyline as it focused on the war between vampires and Lycans and treachery that went on behind-the-scenes.  There was a sense of brooding darkness that followed the characters but this time around, since most of the vampires and Lycans have been massacred, the film changes from being vampire vs. Lycans film to now the humans vs. the vampires, Lycans and hybrids.<br /><br />And there was no doubt that these films were now more action heavy, designed for 3D and the storyline, was made to be kept simple for those who have never watched the films in the trilogy.

B00782O7NE|5.0|In France, Michel Hazanavicius is best known for his \\"OSS 117″ spy comedy films featuring actor Jean Dujardin and his wife, B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo.  But for Hazanavicius, as a fan of silent films, especially the filmmakers of that era, it was always a fantasy to make a silent film.<br /><br />Of course, when he brought up to producers or potential investors that he wanted to create a black and white silent film, he was not taken seriously.  But fortunately, producer Thomas Langmann and other producers for the film, they listened and despite hesitation, followed his gut to finance the film, which would be known as \\"The Artist\\".<br /><br />With a budget of $15 million and 35 days to shoot in Los Angeles, the film which required a lot of research not just by Hazanavicius but also his cast and trusting casting directors to hire the right people to pull this film off.  Along with Dujardin and Bejo, cast in the film are John Goodman (\\"Roseanne\\", \\"The Big Lebowski\\"), James Cromwell (\\"L.A. Confidential\\", \\"The Green Mile\\", \\"i Robot\\"), Penelope Ann Miller (\\"Carlito's Way\\", \\"Awakenings\\"), Missi Pyle (\\"Big Fish\\", \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\") and Malcolm McDowell (\\"A Clockwork Orange\\", \\"Halloween\\", \\"Easy A\\").<br /><br />And the black and white silent film that was almost never made, would become a major success and receive universal acclaim.  Dujardi won \\"Best Actor\\" at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, winner of three Golden Globes, winner of seven BAFTA awards, winner of five Academy Awards and winning six Cesar Awards (making it the most awarded French film in history).<br /><br />Made for $15 million, \\"The Artist\\" would earn over $133 million in the box office and now \\"The Artist\\" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in June 2012.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />In order to capture the feel of a silent film, \\"The Artist\\" is presented in black and white (1:33:1 aspect ratio) and looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray!  Full of detail, the HD presentation on Blu-ray features wonderful clarity.  From its closeups of the faces of the characters to the details of makeup, clothing and scenery.<br /><br />Black levels are nice and deep and white and grays well-contrast, there is a little softness, but I believe that was intentional.  I didn't detect any anomalies or any problems with the video whatsoever.  \\"The Artist\\" looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The film is a silent film but there are moments of sound effects but is driven by its musical score, composed by Ludovic Bource, who worked with the Michel Hazanvicius on both \\"OSS 117″ films.<br /><br />According to Ludovic Bource, the relationship that he and Hazanvicius had during the making of the film was not saying so much.  If anything, Bource watched the rushes to understand the feeling of the film and builds his music from there.  Prior to making the film, both he and Hazanvicius listened to Chaplin, Max Steiner and Franz Waxman to Bernard Hermann.  They analyzed and listened to the music from the past, including romantic composers from the 19th century.<br /><br />Bource said in an interview, \\"We worked - a bit like Chaplin - along the lines of a light sophistication... What was great was being able to work in sequence blocks of 7, 8 or 9 minutes; to be able to reflect on the mood that could be connected to the plot or to a resonance which would be like the characters interior echo, even if there were different sequences within these blocks.\\"<br /><br />Part of the challenge that Bource had in creating the music for a silent film was having to edit the music during editing.  Bource said, \\"we had to reduce certain pieces according to the editing, throw lots of them away, and write new ones, adapt them following each step of the film that was being made.  Michel and I didn't stop fine-tuning, refining.\\"<br /><br />For the soundtrack, Ludovic Bource worked with the Flanders Philharmonic Orchestra in Brussels for a week.  Featuring 80 musicians, 50 string players, four French horns, four trombones, five percussionists, a harpist, ten technicians, five orchestrators and three mixers.<br /><br />My personal favorites from the film's soundtrack was its touch of elegance through the use of piano and strings.  The music goes through a musically wonderful but sad and emotional transition once we see the decline of silent film and hearing the music starting to go for upbeat, to something much more melodramatic and with a hint of sadness.  Bource had said that he was inspired by Brahms' \\"Sapphic Ode\\" and a song that fits the film's image of decline and loneliness of character George Valentin.<br /><br />While Ludovic Bource created the majority of the music on this soundtrack, also featured are Brussels Philharmonic with \\"Estancia OP.8″, a surprise for me was hearing Red Nichols & His Five Pennies \\"Imagination\\".  Red Nichols was a popular jazz band in the 1920′s and a wonderful inclusion to this soundtrack.  Also, included are Duke Ellington's \\"Jubilee Stomp\\" (from 1928) and Rose Murphy's \\"Pennies from Heaven\\" (a song that earned her the nickname \\"The Chee Chee Girl\\").<br /><br />The music was a major emotional component to the film and I found it to be delightful and fantastic.  And on Blu-ray, the use of music and sound effects were more than appropriate for this film and sounds amazing in lossless!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Blooper Reel - (2:14) Outtakes from \\"The Artist\\".<br />  The Artist: The Making Of A Hollywood Love Story - (21:56) Interviews with the cast of \\"The Artist\\" and their thoughts on the film and their characters.<br />  Q&A with the Filmmakers and Cast - (44:57) A fascinating and hilarious post-screening audience Q&A with director Michel Hazanavicius, producer Thomas Langmann and talents Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, Missi Pyle and James Cromwell.<br />  Hollywood As A Character: The Locations of The Artist - (5:10) A short featurette about filming in Hollywood and in classic locations.  Interviews with the current owners of workspaces and homes where \\"The Artist\\" was shot.<br />  The Artisans Behind The Artist - (11:30) A featurette about the production, cinematography, costume design and the music composition for \\"The Artist\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" comes with a slipcover case and a Ultraviolet redemption code.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />As a fan of silent film, you eventually begin to read about what happened to the careers or the individuals, the stars of the silent era.<br /><br />From Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Harry Langdon Jr., Clara Bow, Mary Pickford, the Talmadge sisters and many other silent film stars of the time, not many fared well from the transition from the silent films to the Talkies.<br /><br />Many were known for their look and their acting style but not for their voices.  During that time, not many people had to remember their lines and people never judged about what came out of an actor's lips, there were intertitles that would explain what was going on in a scene and many talents had a great career and life because they were the stars of the time.<br /><br />And while some tried to make the transition and others refused it, aside from a few talents such as Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Carole Lombard, Myrna Loy or Gloria Swanson, the coming of the talkies was not welcomed by many of the stars, stars who balked that the talkies would never surpass the popularity of silent films.<br /><br />They were wrong.  The talkies would eventually be the nail on the coffin more the careers of most of the silent film stars and for those such as Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Mary Pickford who tried their best to make their careers continue, unfortunately, silent films and their stars were considered passe.  And the studios tried to distance themselves away from them.<br /><br />Charles Chaplin tried his best to incorporate sound and even went as far to narrate a re-release of \\"The Gold Rush\\" (which shocked people because they never knew their beloved \\"tramp\\" would have an accent), Buster Keaton would also be featured in many talkies but by the '30s and '40s, physical vaudeville comedies were not popular compared to slapstick comedy, romantic comedies with handsome leading actors nor heroic military or Western stars.<br /><br />Harold Lloyd, Mary Pickford and Clara Bow tried as well and although Mary Pickford would win an Academy Award for \\"Best Actress in a Leading Role\\" for \\"Coquette\\" in 1930, she had amazing fear towards the microphone, because she felt that she would never make it into talkies.  And her next talkie would become a flop, it killed career if the \\"American's Sweetheart\\".  As for Clara Bow, people were more surprised that she had a Bronx accent.<br /><br />Harold Lloyd on the other hand would make a talkie but knew that with age and what the industry was looking for in Hollywood, he began to focus his career on photography and was one of the few people who had creative control of his films and did what he can to restore it.<br /><br />But with silent films and the stars being considered as old-fashioned, movies and stars that your parents or grandparents would watch, not many stars made the transition.<br /><br />And with the release of \\"The Artist\\", filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius was aware of that.  Sure, he is known as a comedy filmmaker for his \\"OSS 117″ films but he is a silent film fan, has watched many films and knew that he wanted to make one, he just needed the financial support.<br /><br />The timing of \\"The Artist\\" is incredible.  As more and more people are now discovering silent films through the wonderful releases on Blu-ray and DVD, many are clamoring for the films featuring these top stars of that era.  Many wanting to know more about the silent era and being entertained by the films of directors such as D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, F.W. Murnau, Frank Borzage, Ernst Lubitsch, Fritz Lang, to name a few.  There is resurgence of interest in silent films today.<br /><br />I have no doubt in my mind that \\"The Artist\\" will convert some people to silent films.  It may not make one an ardent fan but at least giving people exposure to a silent film.<br /><br />And one thing that Michel Hazanavicius wanted to do is capture normalcy.  No vaudeville comedy type of direction but to capture the normalcy as seen in Murnau and Borzage films.  The feeling of natural acting.<br /><br />And this is where \\"The Artist\\" achieves efficacy because both Jean Dujardin and B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo are wonderful in this film. They make you believe in their characters, they make you feel the emotional high and lows of the character of George Constantin.  But not only is the acting wonderful by its main talent and also its supporting talent (including the extras), \\"The Artist\\" captivates you with its wonderful acting, its costume design, the authentic look of capturing an era but also a film that has emotion, humor, sadness and Ludoic Bource's music...everything comes together in this film.<br /><br />I absolutely love this film and I probably watched this film about seven times now and I still have not grown tired of it.  The music, the camera, the editing, the overall rhythm of the film carries us along.  George Constantin is the silent actor that captivates a generation that grew up with the advances of cinema and embraced the silent film.  Peppy Miller is the upcoming starlet that epitomizes the \\"out with the old\\" sentiment, and Bejo plays her character with so much enthusiasm.  She knows how to flirt with the camera, captivate the viewer.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, the video and audio quality is magnificent.  While a silent film, the musical soundtrack by LudovicBource is fantastic!  As for the special features, it was great to see how the film was shot in various, historical locations in Los Angles and the addition of the post-screening live audience Q&A was also fun to watch!<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" is a great film and while I doubt Hollywood is going to invest in any more modern day silent films, \\"The Artist\\" was a film that many never seen before or for those who are familiar with silent films, caused excitement and came out in a time that was just right.  It's delightful, heartwarming and magnificent!<br /><br />In some way, \\"The Artist\\" is quite relevant because we are also in a modern, technological flux in entertainment.  Television and film are changing thanks to the Internet and ways to catch entertainment.  May it be music or cinema, with technology, social media and an audience who has access to many forms of entertainment, what is in today could be gone or drastically changed a decade from now. Change is inevitable and \\"The Artist\\" is a good reminder of how change affected a genre and all the talent involved.<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" began as a fantasy for filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius.  Now, \\"The Artist\\" will now be considered his finest masterpiece.  \\"The Artist\\" on Blu-ray is highly recommended!sidered passe.

B0097AX6EQ|5.0|This book should be compulsory reading for everyone it shows the courage of young men flying choppers in extremely hazardous conditions while dealing with very incompetent senior Officers and of the lasting effects this had on their future lives
B009SQRL4U|5.0|My family enjoyed this movie. I think it was a great movie to see at the start of the season. It was funny and very entertaining. I definitely recommend watching it. And yes it is a movie for kids. There may be parts you need to explain are not real but they will enjoy it too.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Encourages logical thinking. A very simple and user friendly puzzle.<br />Easy to follow directions and fast moving levels even for older people.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This was an overall good book, but there were some dissapointments. I was discouraged that we didn't get to see all 7 characters POVs. I wanted to know how Frank was feeling through the whole Hazel/Leo drama. And vice versa with Hazel. And how was Jason feeling about the shared power with Percy? I think that if Rick Riordan had to do only 4 POVs, he shoulden't have done Piper. I liked her in The Lost Hero, but now she just seems kind of bratty. I also don't like how she felt about Percy, and how she was all like &#34;Jason's better&#34; and &#34;Jason's hotter&#34;. I felt bad for Reyna, since Jason was being TOTALLY ignorant about how she had a crush on him. It was a good book though, and I would recommend it to all those action-adventure geeks such as myself. Somtimes you just need to let your inner nerd shine through. :)
B003VANOFY|2.0|Good headphone, but mic doesn't work on Win 8, nor does the drive work stably, it crashes my windows 8.<br />Its really sad, but logitech hasn't done anything about it.

B0065AVS0K|5.0|My entire hall and I watched this movie after our first snow day and It was amazing!!!!!!

B007VUA7VO|4.0|Beautiful looking app and practical too. Easy to access and not buggy at all. My only complaint is that it assumes battery to be new so performance predictions are slightly exaggerated.
1742200206|5.0|I really like Lonely Planet guidebooks. I bought my first one back in 1994 for my trip to Egypt and was very pleased with it. Since then, I have bought several on various destinations and have been very satisfied with them. I prefer them to other guide books, because Lonely Planet just seems to be on the same wavelength as I am when it comes to visiting new places. Others seem to be geared to my parent's generation (they are in their 70's) and some to a very young generation (as in early 20's or younger). I think Lonely Planet hits a good happy medium.<br /><br />As to this particular guidebook on New York City, I bought the first edition of it right before I moved to the NYC area in 1998. It was a great help, and I used the hell out of it, and it is still in good shape. I am keeping it as the World Trade Center is on the cover.<br /><br />This new one is the 8th edition and looks about twice as long as my old one. There is a great picture of the Chrysler Building at night on the cover. There is just about everything you need to know in this book. All the basics at the front and details further back on where to sleep and eat, what to see and how to get there among other useful, detailed information a visitor would find essential to a great visit. Most of the book is divided up into areas of the city for ease of use. There is also background information on the city towards the back, as well as very good maps, including subway lines. And, lots of color pictures all over it.<br /><br />New York is a great city and this guidebook tells you how to get a lot out of a visit there.
B008OOYALE|5.0|very fun and all around great game. ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok. ok ok ok ok ok ok
B007QPFGJW|3.0|This book starts slowly and is a bit confusing regarding characters and places unknown to me. Particularly never having been to Oslo.<br />The focus on drugs and drug addicts doesn't appeal to me.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Well so far so good.... I received the battery pack and it is of good quality and packed well. I have an iphone 5 and I have charged it twice. The phone was at 50% both times and the battery topped it off in short order. So far so good. As I write this the battery is charging the my ipad 3... so far so good. This is a nice battery - I travel in Asia and it will come in handy as there are times I need to to top off my phone due to using Skype for calls and skype burns up the battery quickly on all phones and such..... this is a quality battery from my view and will be used all the time.<br /><br />I have used this to power the iphone during blue tooth usage with the Bose Soundlink speaker and the battery keeps the iphone at 100% during use which is nice so you dont have to plug it into the wall. Same goes for Mountain Biking as I ready myself and listen to music thus keeping the phone at 100%... China Mfg. of batteries is the norm, and most batteries come from this region of the world. 100% of our business is located in Asia as the EPA has forced much of the Mfg. out of the USA due to regs. Nearly 100% of Laptop batteries come from China and they are good at it.<br /><br />Most Name Brand Battery folks here in the US get their stuff from Asia and use the Branding that they have built in the States that draws a higher sell price. Everyone likes to have a name brand I guess but the same folks that make a no name brand make the Brand name Brand.... Ha, HA, but it's true.<br /><br />I would say that you could not do better for a light weight battery with enough horse power to charge whatever you need to charge with this battery. I will update if this battery takes a dump and only time will tell. This seems to be a good battery for what I need. Its powerful, small and light weight and at this point - it works! Happy Charging!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|After reading all of John Grisham's books, I would put The Racketeer in the top 1/3. As always Grisham gives you a little something you were not looking for. This just might be a re-read someday. Good work, kept you turning the pages.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love to play the different games. the variety is great for my daughter and I to play. it is fun to unlock new points and is awesome competition
0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day was a quickly read book. Not because of the reading level but rather it kept my attention until the end.<br />Buy it and share with your friends and family. I have military members in my family and circle of friends and pray daily that they are able to come home to their families.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Love this writer and this short story is awesome. Lives up to his reputation and any fan will enjoy it.
0470876417|5.0|This book was designed very creatively and thus kept the material engaging.  Great introduction to business models and good use of examples.  Highly recommend to keep around for reference as you work on developing products and services.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|I bought one of these beanie boos at my local market and thought the big beatie eyes were so cute on these toys, my daughter is having a ball collecting them all! :)Great stuffing stuffer!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|First off I'm a big fan of the whole Jack Reacher series and have enjoyed them all.  This time however our man Lee fell a little short.  I understand these pieces are 'formula\\" novels and not Shakespeare.  Having said that, the Reacher stories are usually better developed and manage to tie up all the loose ends by the last few pages.  This time Child started out down many different paths and then in many cases either ended story lines abruptly or just never really fleshed them out.  I got the feeling this book was getting close to a publisher's deadline and Child just decided to either kill off a character or just never finish the train of thought about someone or something.  Who the hell were the bad guys?  He never did tell us,  just indicated they had a big time organization that could apparently take over a government facility with out problem.  He got started developing a romantic interest for Reacher then let her drop dead in a corn field with Reacher disregarding her like so much road kill.  I could go on and on.  This one will be a the bottom of my Reacher list.  I just hope there aren't some other offerings to compete for the \\"worst ever \\" position.
B008NABUU8|4.0|It's a fun little game, at times frustratingly addictive, but my only real complaint at the moment is the responsiveness of the menu bars along the side. It just takes a few more swipes than I'd like.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|We saw this in the theater last year, and I can't wait to see it again.  Even my cynical teenager loved this movie.  It's rare for a movie to please all of us (my kids are 9 and 13) but this movie definitely did.  This is a new Christmas classic for us, right up there with the original Grinch.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|works great, no issues at all. loaded it up and that was all i had to do. my books were there when i opened it up easy to read and access.
1416972250|4.0|First, an admission: it took me a dragging long time to get through the first half of this book since it felt like the pacing, terminologies, grammar, etc., didn't quite feel the same as the previous two books. Yet, when I got into the second half, it took off real well.<br />The story? For anyone who hasn't read it, I'll just say one and its meaning: twisted.<br />Twist here, twist there, twist, twist, twist, so... yep, twisted.<br />While the mainstay characters are still here, some new ones are introduced and have substance all their own.<br />The location is, aside from the first couple chapters, set in the City of Glass, and the way it's described makes one wish it were real, not fictional, while the residents are something to strive for.<br />And everyone seems to have some secret that, in this glassy city, makes it hard to keep a somber, straight face. And when secrets surface, facades break and some twists become jaw-dropping.<br />Honestly, this book felt like it had excess lines and scenes, so 541 pages literally felt like too much, some of it could've been shaved and it would have felt more fluid in the reading, let alone lighter in the hands.
0316228532|1.0|I LOVED all the Harry Potter books and still do.  This is simply a horrible book.  How could the same author produce such confusing, depressing and meaningless non plot no redeeming value book?????  do not waste your time or money.  Paul
B002VH7P4O|5.0|First a caveat.  There is a strong chance that the apple will arrive with the stalk broken off.  Mine did.  These are not well packaged.  However, the broken stalk is easily rectified with a drop of super glue.  The repair is invisible and the USB stick can still be removed from the apple using the stalk.  I found this repair to be more convenient than returning the product.<br /><br />As for the sound quality it is truly amazing.  I have never heard The Beatles sound this good.  I agree with the other 5 star reviews regarding the sound quality.  I have the vinyl sets arriving next week so it will be interesting to do the comparison.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|To many plot holes and unanswered questions.  Some situations were very silly and unbelievable.  I hope the next installment makes more sense.
0525423656|3.0|The second installment in Condie's Matched Trilogy picks up immediately where Matched ends, but is now told in two voices: Cassia's and Ky's. Cassia has volunteered for work details in the Outer Provinces, where Ky has been sent to serve as a decoy for the Society in its war against an unnamed enemy. Ky manages to escape into the canyons with two compatriots, but loses one in the process. He and the surviving boy, 13-year-old Eli, make a run for it. Cassia miraculously ends up near Ky's point of disappearance, picks up her own somewhat shady compatriot in Indie, and manages to find clues to Ky's whereabouts. Cassia and Ky, along with Indie and Eli, are reunited and together being to sort out their places in this new world. Two seek out the Rising, wishing to join the opposition and war against Society; one seeks a new path and perhaps a new life; and one seeks to discover some hidden truths about a brave friend. This is very obviously a \\"middle novel\\" in a trilogy. The reader learns more about Ky's past, secrets about Xander are revealed, Cassia begins to question all she thought she knew about her nearest and dearest friends and family members, and the introduction of Indie makes the reader wonder exactly who will end up paired at the end of the next novel. Condie leaves you hanging at the end of this one, so you'll want to jump right into Reached after its November 13, 2012 publication date.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|It's disappointing that the author doesn't continue the story from the third book and decides to develop a new set of characters.
B007EECSFA|4.0|During the first 25% of the book I thought how in the world did this book get all those 5 star ratings BUT,  let me tell you, when it took off, it didn't walk it ran ! This is story about an elderly mother who is dying, and the children come home but while there, the oldest daughter discovers some things just don't jive, and she begins to delve into her mother's past, which brings to the forefront of her mind a memory of a something that happened when she was young. No, it's not what you think...the story starts to unfold, as told thru the sickly mother to her older daughter in flash backs...what a story, and you will come away with remembering that our mothers were more than just \\"moms\\" they were at one time, people with dreams,fantasies,hopes, hurts,loves and yes, secrets which sometimes are best left alone. A great read !<br /><br />Short Review:<br />A mother + a secret + a grown daughter's curiosity + a picture + a past = a must read!
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I so enjoyed this second in the Pollyanna series as much as I did the first. They were both very enjoyable reads.
B001EC2ISA|3.0|Beetlejuice is a wonderful blend of the macabre, a skewering of YUPPIE materialism, Questions about the afterlife and the concept of happiness as a by-product of living, all in a comic blend of the sly and the crude with the glue being Michael Keaton in the title role.  Worth seeing, worth owning.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|this is a great book. very interesting on how habits are formed and how to forge good habits and forgo bad habits.
B00979CS50|5.0|Takes me back to 1969 when I was eighteen in Northern California, when all hell was breaking loose.  Stop the war.  Screw college, it is all going to change anyway.  Here the music is in charge, enveloping, takes you away.  No more point and click world. I still play down Down by the River at full volume, and this is just a good. Fantastic.  Rock at its best.
B007THA4FI|2.0|i love her harry potter series, but with this book, i keep waiting and wondering when it will get interesting....
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|I'm a big fan of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. The story has become culturally iconic around the world.<br />It continues to resonate in our minds, since its original publication in the mid-1800's.<br />This production is, far-and-away, the very finest production of this classic story that has ever been produced,<br />and I have seen all of them.<br /><br />The animation is so life-like... so very, very real ... so detailed.  Particularly because the storyline contains imagery<br />of ghosts sweeping Scrooge away on supernatural trips back and forth through time... it took the power of modern<br />animation to bring that to life.  This production offers us that which this story has always cried out for... such other-worldly<br />fantastic imagery... but not in a cartoonish way, rather, in a shockingly lifelike way unique to 21st Century high-end animation.<br /><br />I was also pleased to see that so many of the best lines from the book are faithfully used in this production, and Disney did<br />not abuse its artistic license.  Disney (amazingly) also did not attempt to secularize or &#34;de-Christianize&#34; the message<br />at all. It packs the strong message of accountability and charitable responsibility, and does not shy away from that<br />Christ-centered message, or make it more &#34;politically correct&#34; in any way.<br /><br />Visually, it is just spectacular. The animation is breathtaking in its detail (especially the BluRay version).<br />There are not many movies that I would watch over and over again. This is one of them.<br />If I could only have a half-dozen movies in my collection... this would be one of them.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This was an exceptional movie and delivered the kind of sci-fi excitment I crave.  Definitely one to watch.  The movie was filled with unexpected twists and turns, just the way I like it.
B002Z58GQI|5.0|I have been using the item as soon as I got it and have not had any problems with it.  Very pleased.
B005V5WBFG|4.0|this is one of the best apps going easy to use. It will give good protection for all your toys and do it automatic all you have to do is set it up
B0077EBWVI|2.0|This movie is ok if you are watching it for free and there is nothing else you to do. If they would have remade it like the original it may have been better but trying to add in details from the 2000's made the movie cheesy. The cast was beautiful and made the watching tolerable but the essence of the movie was ruined with the new details.
B005I0DLXK|5.0|Every song on this album is great. Very well made.  The music vary's,is not all the same and very entertaining.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|can't. stop playing just wish u got more coins but love it my husband found it for hos phone the my youngest. put it on my kindle
B009WO7NQO|3.0|android phones get the free verson why dosnt the kindle offer the free verson 3 dollers is a lot. atleast just charge 1 doller
B002ZG974M|5.0|This was a great film that I showed my Child Psychology  students.  It was a great teaching tool regarding universal as well as cultural aspects of development.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|I really liked this book. I am a fan of theTV series and it was fun to see how the characters relate in their real world. They have a heated sexual relationship that was fun to read about.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|easy purchase and fast delivery for this colorful and fun watch.  Great gift for Christmas or birthday, adult or child.
B0059F7I24|5.0|excellent music. The band does not disapoint on this album. Listening to them, I cant get enough. A must for all of us.
B008RDHYJM|2.0|I recently received my Kylie Minogue Time Capsule and was really disappointed! After reading the hype and excitement about this item I was looking forward to it's release. Upon receiving it, I was a little shocked by the size of the package. Opening it, I was even more shocked by how small the actual size of the box was. I figured maybe I just thought it would be bigger in my mind. Then I opened it and was really surprised. From the description I thought this would house 3\\" cds of ALL the singles Kylie has released from the beginning of her career to now (similar to the ones Britney Spears released awhile back or the rare Japanese set that Madonna released years ago.) Nope...this set only included 25 singles from Kylie's career and the worse part is the artwork. We do not get full color reproductions of each covers front and back, but smaller black and white versions with big black borders around them and NO back art. I also must mention that only one song is on each cd (no b-sides or remixes). I think this was truly a mistake in how this was put together. The price should also not be as high as it is since not all the singles were included. While I love Kylie and think she has done a great job celebrating her 25 years in the business, this is one misstep that should have been repackaged. This could have been a stellar item!
B005EGXTL2|4.0|I could nt put this book down. I just had ti see how katniss and peeta turned out. Addictive reading.
B000IZ8DZQ|2.0|It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Slow start, the end seems as though there was supposed to be a sequel with Michael Caine.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Cross between ET and Stand By Me. It was funny, touching and a little scary. Not for little kids. Special effects were great.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I am not the biggest comic book action movie fan, and I was very pleasantly surprised by The Avengers.  Witty dialogue, great special effects, good story line.  I highly recommend it for anyone.
B00846REIS|3.0|Like Bared to You enough to continue reading it, but it's NOT 50 Shades of Gray! I'm only 1/2 way through the 1st book and I like the characters but many parts are forgettable. I'd still recommend it.
B00020X88O|5.0|My copy of Showgirls (MGM 1995) has a running time of 2 hours 11 minutes (131 minutes). If the VIP edition is uncut then why is it listed at only 128 minutes?
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I have had this cover for almost 1 year and am a little disappointed. I use my Kindle daily and it goes everywhere with me. I immediately loved the case when it arrived but after a couple months of use the silicone started wearing off. No biggie, right? Well then the elastic starts getting fuzzy and out of shape. It now gapes and barely holds the cover closed. I paid $40 for this brand new & don't really feel I have gotten my moneys worth.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|As far as special effects, the move was great.  However rather lame on how the aliens were created. The movie is ok for renting but not necessary a movie you would want to own. It is good to see the engineer speak at the end of the movie. When the engineer gets over powered by the alien creature that uses his body as a host for a new race of aliens.  One major problem in the story is with the birth of the alien creature which occurs too quickly. When compared to Alien and Aliens it takes more time for the alien to emerge from the chest of the alien's host body.
B004LROUNG|3.0|\\"The Litigators\\" was not one of my favorite Grisham novels. I liked the theme of the big pharmaceutical company being sued for its questionable drug, very timely, but some of the characters and the execution seemed a little weak. I had just finished reading \\"The Broker\\", which I loved, and so was a little disappointed with \\"The Litigators\\".
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wow, this story is simply fantastic from the beginning. You will cry, laugh and simply fall in love with the characters and the poetry in this wonder YA book. Great job Colleen Hoover and I guess I need to listen to The Avett Brothers. I'll start book two Point of Retreat tonight.
0780619587|5.0|We saw this movie several years ago and really enjoyed it. I wanted my music teacher friend to see it, so I ordered it and we watched it the other night when she came over for dinner. Anyone who loves music would enjoy this movie!
B004IY6API|5.0|As one of Judas Priest's first records this one deserves attention.<br />In here you can find classic songs like \\"exciter\\" or \\"better by you, better than me\\" and the best early inceptions of that pure heavy metal style that only Judas Priest forged.<br />If I had to line up best JP's records it would be in the third place.
B0058VW36U|2.0|it was great till it updated. now it crashes.  I hope they fix the problem soon. I don't know how else to report the crash
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I don't have an HD kindle fire - Why would I want to pay for a premium HD game? I have the option of either HD or regular on my android phone. Why don't I have that option from Amazon, running an Android OS? Lame, Amazon. REALLY LAME.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|All of John Grisham's books are immensely entertaining and readable.  This one is no exception, but it is not up to his previous standards in my opinion.  Some of the scenarios presented in the story were highly unlikely, and at times there seemed to be some disjointedness, which from Grisham, is not what I expected.  Nonetheless, as a great Grisham fan, I do recommend the book.  At his worst Grisham is better reading than almost anyone elses best.  I enjoyed the book and yes, I do recommend it.
B005LAII7G|5.0|I'd say it was the non-Hollywood-like approach that made me love this movie from the first scene.<br /><br />I thought I was going to see a mindless action movie that was a crappy remake.<br /><br />To my surprise I saw great acting, a solid, character driven story, and awesome action.<br /><br />Can't wait to own the bluray
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book. It just keeps getting better. Can't wait to read the third book.. The love that Christian has for her is unbelievable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was wonderful. I had a hard time putting it down and I have read it before and seen the movie. The way the capitol is so twisted and the cruel punishment of making each district send two of their children in to die is repulsive but very intriguing and it makes for an amazing story. I recommend this book to anyone who likes an adventure without ever having to leave the house.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|i really love this musical. Before watching it, I had no idea it orginally was a broadway musical. the songs are awesome! i was born in the late 80's and wished i could have experienced the early to late 80's even early 90's music. diego boneta blew me away and so did julianne hough. my favorite numbers are anyway you want it, don't stop believing and wanted dead or alive.
B008XG1X18|5.0|for browsing and pinning, I love pinterest on my Kindle.  I don't find it to be slow or cumbersome.  much easier than hopping on the computer!
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I love Paramore so much and this cd is great! I got it the year it came out and still listen to it often. Gotta love The Old Hayley Williams
B004SIP8W0|5.0|Movie is great. Reminds us how fortunate we are and how we can endure anything - it's all in the way we think about it. We need to put others first - especially children. My favorite movie of all time.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Matt Bissonnette, aka Mark Owen, disgraced the uniform by writing this book. I will not support his effort. Judging by the reviews it was hastily written as well. In one word... \\"pathetic\\".
0345528581|5.0|I picked up a copy of P90X based on the great things I'd heard about it.  It's a tough, effective workout, but I eventually fell out of it because of the time commitment required (1 hour/day, 6 days/week), my desire not to monopolize the only TV in our house during prime TV time, and my general distaste for how gimmicky it seemed.  Thus, I was in the market for a good exercise program that wouldn't require me to join a gym, wouldn't bogart the TV every night, and didn't require 6 days a week of exercise.<br /><br />Enter \\"You Are Your Own Gym.\\"  No gym, TV, or anything else required.  You can do these exercises anywhere.  And best of all, these workouts kick my butt every bit as much as P90X (maybe more) - in 1/3 the time.<br /><br />I'm a male in my mid-30s and consider myself to be relatively fit.  So I made the executive decision to start myself at the intermediate workout rather than beginner.  Big mistake:  I could not complete the first workout, which has you doing \\"ladders\\" of an exercise for 7.5 minutes, without taking a lot more rest time than the workout provides for.  The next day, I could barely lift my hands above my shoulders.  Needless to say, I had to tuck my tail between my legs and bump myself down to \\"beginner.\\"  (You laugh, but how many pushups can YOU do from a downward dog position?  That's the author's version of military presses, and I could only manage five or so at a time.)<br /><br />Luckily, the author gives numerous variations of the exercises to key them to any ability level.  As a result, anybody can get as much resistance as they need or can handle - no more, no less.  Progressing through the variations is fun and gives a real feeling of accomplishment.<br /><br />One final note:  if you don't want to spring the 11 bucks for the book, the iPhone app tells you everything you need to know for two bucks.  It has timed workouts, plus video of each exercise performed by the author himself.  So if you want a preview of the book, or if you're strapped for cash, you can get the whole workout for two bucks - or about $118 less than P90X.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Once you make it past the first chapter, Wool is a story that you cannot put down. One reason is Juliette, who is one of the more compelling and resourceful protagonists in science fiction. She is tough, intelligent, and knows when to be scared. All things one could say about the author. Howey dives into this world with unflinching attention to the reality of human nature, in a world that appears highly constrained.  As you read, however, you realize that the limits placed on the human condition in Wool eerily resemble those of our own world. Bad things happen in this narrative, and not just to bad people; the world is not as we initially see it; characters develop and grow. Reading these books, I felt that the narrative arc was taking the reader somewhere worthwhile, and was not disappointed. The omnibus is a keeper - and much better than Howey's fine-but-standard Molly Fyde series. My only quibble would be around the plausibility of the technology that created the devastated world of Wool. But this is a minor assumption to swallow, given the rich rewards that follow.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|not too complicated, just a superficial fusion of birds and star wars for kids to sink into, works great on my pandigital supernova gingerbread 2.3
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this book to be a well written, hot & steamy novel. The author tied in the characters well, (excuse the pun,lol). I also like happiness when I read, this book has an interesting journey... mixed with joy.
B005LAII8A|4.0|No spoilers.<br /><br />Outstanding 21st Century Noir. Haven't seen a really good one since '[[ASIN:B0002VYOW2 The Harvest]]' or '[[ASIN:B0001US62I Angel Heart]]'. (although, to be fair, there's a great deal of debate regarding what does and does not constitute neo-noir)<br /><br />First thing I noticed - 'La Belle Aurore\\". Not sure how many of my fellow cinephiles caught it. Rick's first club in Paris. And Joseph Gordon Levitt's character Joe is learning French. Nice touch.<br /><br />Love that JGL has that early George Raft/later Humphrey Bogart air about him: World-weary, sharp edged, smart. Just like the script. And like the original black-n-white productions, the setting is dystopian, which is not unlike the seedy backdrops of those films from the 40s and 50s. It's basically the same recognizable hordes of sad lost souls, dressed up a bit here and there with anti-grav motorbikes.<br /><br />Tells the tale of organized crime hit men who don't have to hunt their targets - they're sent back from the future directly to an established fixed position. Even the exact time of their victim's \\"delivery\\" is known. Clock strikes the chime. Pull the trigger. Bang. Dump the body. Get paid. Repeat. Simple as that.<br /><br />Except, there's a catch to their seemingly straight deal.<br /><br />If, for whatever reason, their mob employers decide that their future retired looper selves are a problem - they're grabbed and sent back to their younger versions to be taken care of - a so called \\"closed loop\\".<br /><br />But what happens if the loop isn't closed? Suppose a future older looper, facing his own assassination, intentionally chooses to go back to fix what went wrong?<br /><br />Blending the very best of the now with the best of the past, this film cleverly meshes '[[ASIN:B003ULW74S The Third Man]]' with '[[ASIN:B000F9RB9Y The Terminator]]' and adding just the lightest touches of '[[ASIN:B00004TS0G The Omen]]'. Hard to believe, but it works. Works really well. And young Pierce Gagnon was creepily convincing. Not sure he has a future in the business, no pun intended, given how many can't-miss acting phenoms are littered across the entertainment landscape, forgotten and often struggling to live a normal life. Still, in this very powerful performance - wow.<br /><br />Sharp celluloid that I would recommend for fans of the old school dark musty corners and the epitome of pointed controlled violence. Superior noir qualities walking about in an unfashionable white shirt and black tie.<br /><br />Movie Recommendation: If you enjoyed this type of film, I encourage you to screen the French production \\"[[ASIN:B001OJMMTI Cortex]]\\".rce Gagnon was creepily convincing.

6305882592|5.0|I believe I paid around 3 dollars for this DVD. When it arrived at my house it was fully packaged in cellophane. There was not a single scratch on the DVD. It plays as if it were brand new, and it may have been. The price alone made this purchase a victory. But the fact that I finally own a copy of my favorite movie of all time makes it a super win. Thank you for the prompt and professional service!
B005LAII7G|3.0|Similar to the recently rebooted '[[ASIN:B005LAII3A Total Recall]]' - unhappily discovered that the new stewards of these classics are apparently too disconnected or much too obtuse to see what made these movies classics in the first place.<br /><br />This despite the fact that I'm a monster fan of Karl Urban, I have to say: Be prepared to be bored to death. And without a shot of 'SloMo' - though it certainly felt like it.<br /><br />A bland and routine tale with little to offer. It's certainly not innovative. Nor fresh. Not particularly exciting. And surprisingly, it's not even mildly funny. Not that I expected the latter given the early reports I read about the script going \\"darker\\". But if you're going to cut away the fat, the least you can do is leave some meat.<br /><br />Honestly not sure what the point of this film was? The tiresome clich&eacute;s were numerous. A drug dealer takes over an entire building. While delivering justice in an ugly unfair world, a hardened street judge has the unenviable task of reviewing the performance of an untested rookie. Trapped, alone, and fighting for their lives - the pair have to find a way out of the drug lord's domain.<br /><br />What - that's it? A pedestrian shoot'em up?<br /><br />In all seriousness, did Director Pete Travis even read the original comics? There's *nothing* in this film that even remotely suggests he did. And one has to ask: Why not, no pun intended, draw from the source material? Where are the Judges of John Wagner and Brian Bolland? Where's the dark satirical humor? Where's the iconoclast with a wit and insight to the gritty underbelly of humanity?<br /><br />This is the second recent action flick I've screened where slow-motion was integral to the cinematography and plot. This is so 1980s and well beyond pathetic. Is there something wrong with using straight CGI platforms in 2012?<br /><br />And that brings up the question: Is the current fascination with 3D so effective a gimmick that sheeple are scammed into believing it makes up for a creative story and proper direction? It doesn't. Not by a long shot.<br /><br />Also, what was the point of constantly showing the elevator going up and down throughout the movie?!<br /><br />Yeesh.<br /><br />The only performance of note: Wood Harris, who played Kay. An actor who has been flying low but steady the past few years, producing yet another excellent execution. Definitely deserves larger and better roles.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This review is more of a review the 3D version of the movie than the movie itself.  I will say, however, that I found the movie very entertaining. Enough to purchase to rewatch.<br />(Based on a 3D blu-ray player and active shutter 3D TV)<br />The 3D version of this movie is fantastic.  One of, if not THE best, I've seen on the 3D blu-ray format.  There is incredible depth to the viewing experience of this.  The end battle feels as if things are flying around in my living room.  The picture is incredibly sharp, and there is very little \\"ghosting\\" (this is the term used for when a 3D image splits in 2 due to improper adjustments).<br />If you have the setup required (A 3D TV and a 3D blu-ray player) this is highly recommended.
B005LAIHAE|3.0|***Minor Spoiler Warning***<br /><br />Boilerplate action/thriller made more interesting given the lead - Henry Cavill - aka The New Superman.<br /><br />Not sure if this effort is a good thing or not.<br /><br />Reason: Given that I've screened him earlier in '[[ASIN:B0042RJWTC The Tudors]]', where he was fantastic as Lord Brandon, it's an established fact that he has the thespian talent to craft a believable character. But this was a fairly routine flick utilizing a rubber-stamp screenplay, so it's difficult to properly discern the performance out of the static drone of predictability.<br /><br />Tells the story of a mandatory family reunion in faraway Spain. Cavill's character, Will, isn't exactly enthused at the prospect for two simple reasons. First, his company is heading toward bankruptcy and leaving the country for a European get-together is exacerbating an already stressful situation. And second, engaging with his old man isn't high on the agenda. Long since estranged, father and son have to work hard just to be civil, otherwise things get nasty fairly quickly.<br /><br />Simply put - Will's not a happy camper. And his negativity is both palpable and viral, spoiling the gathering for the rest of his family. Completing the circle of misery, the old man is thoroughly pissed at the sourness that his son has brought with him.<br /><br />Needing to resupply, pick up a new phone to replace the one his father tossed overboard, and to get some much needed personal space - Will dives off the family's luxury sailboat and swims to shore.<br /><br />He's only on shore for an hour or so, but when he returns - his entire family is gone.<br /><br />Desperate and scared, he reaches out to the local police. Problem is that they're in on the conspiracy.<br /><br />Will, who has absolutely no experience in such matters, is forced to run.<br /><br />He has to figure out what his father was into, why, and who he can possibly trust to help. Hunted by good cops as an accused murderer, blackmailed by unknown intelligence agencies and stalked by a highly trained assassin - a standard tick-tock thriller flick ensues.<br /><br />Overall not bad, just not particularly fresh or insightful. Could've used a more sympathetic (and focused) MacGuffin in the form of a beautiful damsel in distress, i.e. '[[ASIN:6305133476 Frantic]]'. Just my two pennies in that regard.<br /><br />Movie Note: A slight bait-n-switch is made in this film. Given that Bruce Willis isn't the star, his character doesn't live beyond the opening scenes. Not that he didn't contribute; without his efforts the stage wouldn't have been set as nicely. But Marketing's choice of employing a deception - by featuring Bruce so prominently in the advertising and cover artwork - was aggravating. It would've been more accurate, and honestly more interesting, had he not even been featured at all. An unannounced cameo, which I typically enjoy more than some perfunctory credit in the ad campaign.erer, blackmailed by unknown intelligence agencies and stalked by a highly trained assassin - a standard tick-tock thriller flick ensues.<br /><br />Overall not bad, just not particularly fresh or insightful.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Been using this app for a couple of months on my kindle fire and it is nice to see what programs are draining the battery.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Right to the point - This is the worst thing I've ever heard. Lou Reed can't sing. His lyrics are horribly written. Metallica's music is repetitive. It's boring. It's annoying. Even if Lou Reed's tracks were removed from the songs, it might still possibly be the the worst album ever made. I would like to give this album zero stars, but it won't let me.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I always anxiously await a new Scarpetta novel.  I love the character & all those around her.  Would have liked to have seen a little more of Lucy in this one but all in all, a great, fast paced, edge of your seat read.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Sorry I waited so long to see it. It was action without gore, an excellent story line, fine acting, and very thought provoking.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I only read the first part and was not really motivated by the style and content to struggle though the other 4 parts.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|all these angry birds games are super fun. they took the angry birds space and normal angry birds and combined them by having levels on the ground and in space. they also have added an epic theme to it. in my opinion star wars is the best movie franchise and they have been successful in combing star wars and angry birds.
B00846F1YW|5.0|great game need more like it.... :) it was lots of fun. wish it had more levels to play.I will look for more games from this company.
B007THA4FI|2.0|... but I just couldn't.<br /><br />It could have been summed up in a 30 minute TV show and it just seemed to drag on. I found that it was a whole lot of not much story going on until I reached the last 10% of the book on my Kindle.<br /><br />I had really hoped for great characters and an untouchable story-line but was left with a bland taste in my mouth.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star wars fan hate on this for a couple of details, but i must say its a good package. You get all six movies in blu-ray and you get it in a book-like package with cover art. Plus tons of extra features in additional discs. Im happy with this buy.
B0085RQLXK|1.0|Was a big fan of this band, back when they were a## kickers. Really dug their first album up to \\"Done w/ mirrors\\", then they had a string of sell-out pop crap records, then I got back on board w/ \\"Honkin On BOBO\\". More bubble gum rock after \\"BOBO\\", and then this album.. what a huge waste of my time- over produced,sappy,cheesy corny 12 yr old girl pop-rock.A duet with Carrie Underwood??!!! Really??!! Aerosmith??!!! Forget it-<br />this one's another frisbee.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Has some jumps in the download version that was not in the movie...makes it a little disappointing.<br />This is a great movie and I look forward to the sequel.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A beautiful book which makes you look at people a whole new way..very descriptive journey through england and english people
B008XG1X18|5.0|Luv it!!!!!!! Soo many ideas:-):-)<br />It has a lot of great ideas for remodeling the home.  Can't wait to use some of them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this has the gun of the carnival game without the cost. I wish it regenerated you coins a bit faster though!
B006BAEQB2|3.0|This book was slow reading, especially for anyone with knowledge of the actual historical story.  Perhaps if a third person was narrating the story instead of the main character would have improved the story.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I am dissapointed with this attempt at a connection to the Alien franchise ... that s all I got ..that's it
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised--this album lives up to its reputation. Consistently great. Kind of Dylanesque but highly original. A hybrid of singer/songwriter and psychedelic styles, intense lyrics are tastefully matched with artful production. Some kind of lost masterpiece. Happy to see Rodriguez finally receiving much deserved attention.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest!  What a great app!  I have been introduced to so many things that I wouldn't have even thought about if Pintrest didn't exist..  I am never \\"bored\\" when I'm on Pintrest!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|ever since I started to play Angry Birds I have been unable to stop. I really love that my updates download automaticly. the halloween one I love it. you have got to get this app. it is hour after hour of non stop fun
B007VUA7VO|4.0|i like how it tells you your battery health and temp and i also like when you connect charger it goes to battery percent
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King is a master of the \\"gotta\\" at the end of every chapter.  You get to the end of the chapter and you just \\"gotta\\" keep reading.  If you love Stephen King books, you know what I mean.  This is a good read and I would recommend it to a friend.  No, it isn't as good as The Stand or The Talisman, but it's still well written and holds your attention from page to page. Not a masterpiece, but still very enjoyable.
0307887448|5.0|This is a great book. I highly recommend it to everyone. Older readers will love all the eighties references and younger readers will love the video game aspect as well.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I do the puzzles everyday. It's so relaxing. I enjoy playing when I'm waiting for appointments. The pictures are beautiful.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This is typical Nelson Demille. Well written with great dialog. It's a bit slow in spots. Not one of his better efforts.
B0054LVP3Q|5.0|This is not typically the kind of book I would read, it was someone's pick in my book club and I am so happy it was chosen.  It is very well written and a page turner right from the start, I've even recommended it to other friends.
B000XYEJ0U|5.0|I was delighted to stumble across this wonderful book, filled with wisdom that has lasted through the ages.  This message of equanimity is one that most people of our modern time can benefit from.  This particular translation, by Maxwell Staniforth carries the truth in ways that other translations don't.  I was stunned by the deep meaning behind paragraph one, Book Two.  I have read this over and over and continue to find ever deeper insights.
0316776963|5.0|If you have enjoyed anything written by David Sedaris then this book most certainly will not disappoint! It's the first book I read by him, and it's still my favorite. I've read it three times now. If you're offended by crude humor, cursing, or gay people, it's not for you.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I started by getting hooked on the TV show.  A friend recommended the books to \\"fill in the gaps\\".  I knew I was hooked when I started to bring my kindle [[ASIN:B0083Q04IQ Kindle Fire 7\\", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers]] everywhere with me.  Books 1-4 were great, and book 5 is every bit as great.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|I bought the dvds for season one because It was so addicting.<br /><br />season 2 is a season I'll catch up now and again as i pay bills or do dishes....  I love horror films but season 2 just shocks to shock.  Not much character development or sufficient reason to care about the characters.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show. The writers are getting into it. The 1st season was a little bit of back ground. Second was great. The third season is blowing me away. Character's going left and right. Cliff hangers. The writing for this show is incredible. Amazing directing and camera angels. Can't be let down watching the Walking Dead
B009KS4XRO|4.0|when I try to connect while on facebook it boots me to the app... also is there a way u can make it so u can add team mates through the app
B004J4WLB4|4.0|[...] I am a writer and a gardener, so there are at least two reasons that I liked this book.  I found the writing fresh and interesting.  I enjoyed the story.  And, most of all, I loved what I learned about flowers. Oh, I guess there are three reasons.  This book will be a good gift for my gardener friends. The ending seemed a bit contrived, but that did not diminish the book that much in my eyes. I would have bought it just for the glossary in the back of the book---a rather Victorian explanation of the significance/meaning of each flower. Why not 5 stars?  I would have liked even more figurative language.  Just a personal preference.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|this show is soo funny. It kind of reminds me of a modern day friends in a way. Zooey Deschanel does not disappoint.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I liked this movie, I like the idea or the premise of how \\"live started.\\" Everything was going fine and amusing until.... they show a scene where the \\"aliens\\" choose planet earth as their conquest but planet earth is in its current present form, not the way it should've been millions of years ago; you know before Pangea and what not. That, kind of killed it for me. You would think they get that right.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|This is one of the better rock biographies out there. Mr. Townshend had some issues early in life, but once the book moved on to his R&R career, it became very interesting.<br /><br />It's obvious he kept a diary throughout this life - lot's of details regarding concerts, recording sessions, etc . .
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its great when you find an app that's free and rodent require you to get a headache while playing no brainpower used on this one.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book is a gripping page turner. Lots of fun and keeps you in suspense. The plot twists and turns, keeping you guessing. However, it is full of inaccuracies and, as the author says, it was not fact checked and he did little research. I think that the government has a legal right to (and in fact would) confiscate any ill gotten gaines regardless of whether there is currently a legal owner. It is still an absorbing book for a fun read.
B006BOT28U|4.0|It's a nice book about management and negotiations, and it tries to show you how to tackle issues from different points of view, how to negotiate difficult problems and how achieve the results you want in your organization.<br />The only con is that the methodology used in the negotiations is not very well explained. I mean that the author during the book uses 2 to 3 methodologies in different problems but only one of these methodologies is well explained.
B003X27L9U|5.0|I found it hard to look at things from the perspective of a five year old at the beginning of the book, but once I got used to it that's what made this book so enjoyable. How wondrous, intriguing and simplistic the world can be from another perspective. My only criticism is that it left me wanting more.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Worth renting! Just remember that it is based upon a comic book series. Otherwise, it has lots of merit. Enjoy!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was anticipating a fantasy type book but this is very straightforward and easy to understand. I work in the medical field but the writer is very good at explaining many of the terms used in layman's terms.  Very colorful.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|After hours of play Ice Age Villiage just stopped working.  No help, nothing.  Beware of the significant time and money you invest , and then nothing. Very frustrating!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoyed this book...showed that you can open your heart and love again. Can't wait to see the movie. Josh Duhmel
B0018AT7DW|5.0|Same old stuff with brand new digital quality. Nice to have the good old stuff. The album is awesome but digital goes every where.
B000I0QK74|1.0|The James Taylor at Christmas CD that I ordered skips and jumps and stutters so badly that I cannot listen to it.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|The album as a whole rings through like good old Green Day from days gone by. Lots of swearing for some reason. Hmmm. After 3 listenings I like most of every song. It's Jamming!
B009YU9J0E|1.0|Is it me or does the whole album song like one song?  Every song sounds exactly the same as the last one with a few tweets and buzzes thrown in for kicks.  Maybe this was the bands intention of conceptual music making or something.  I don't find it Avant-garde or interesting.  It's annoying and a lazy effort which really pisses me off because the first album (I) blew me away. I was really looking forward to (III) and this is a huge disappointment for such a once talented band.
B007N8RULO|5.0|A great game, indeed. I play this at work and on the way home. It's fun and challenges your mind.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great character building. I love all the of them even the ones I hate. Excellently written. Sucks you into the seven kingdoms and you will love discovering it all.
B008OOYALE|3.0|cute game but can't add any neighbors. it leaves me wanting more. to many items i can't buy. its kind of fun
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I can't recall when I last saw a movie so derivative, so imitative, so unoriginal.<br />  Sure, it has its moments, but I found it to be a major disappointment.  Its makers took a potentially compelling, thought provoking plot and reduced it to an \\"Alien\\" sequel.<br />  Granted, it really does deserve more than a single star -- just for the storm sequence alone -- but considering what I perceive to be the laziness involved (shamelessly recycling the previously done), one lousy star is what I'll give it.
0061122416|2.0|The protagonist learns his own power and that he will find \\"Treasure\\" when he finds his own heart? What about the gypsy seer he was so rude to? Does he owe her an apolgy, if not 10% of his material gain? Does the desert beauty have her own dream, or is she just the protagonist's projection of his ideal (fatalistic) woman who won't complain if he goes off and does his own thing to attend to her needs whenever it happens to suit him? Is the ticket to the universal soul simply desiring something? I do wish a more worthy boy would have been inserted in the leading role. You will know them by their fruits... Is there any hope that in a sequel the boy might pay it forward? Somehow I doubt it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The acting may be a little bit forced every once in a while, but the story and character development in this show is brilliant. Season three has been really exciting so far, and I love seeing the different route that the show takes over the comic book. It gives the show an element of surprise so you really never know what's going to happen next, you just know that at some point, certain things will happen.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|A excellent read, I  was gripped from the first page again.... finding it difficult to put my kindle down. I am really looking forward to the next read in the crossfire trilogy!!!!
1475143389|5.0|After two months on Michael's plan, I have experienced tremendous physical gains.  Went from a three-day a week full body program to this program and I literally can't wait to get to the gym each day.  When you start seeing the physical results (shoulders growing, chest tightening up, etc.), it really becomes ingrained in your lifestyle.  Very simple, easy to digest info.  Highly recommended.
B0083JCCX8|5.0|Really enjoyed my first kindle purchase, guess what my second will be?! Had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Had to give my daughter a hug every time I put it down though. Highly recommend to all grown ups.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although the language was surprising. I never read the Harry Potter series, so I don't know if this is common for the author. Happy endings for the characters were not the norm in this story.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Wow, Singing in the Rain is my all time favorite song and movie. But seeing it in blu-ray what can I say but \\"Totally Awesome\\".. I must have seen it over 10 times and still can't get enough of how beautifully done in blu ray, especially the colors. The music itself is something in itself. This is when singing was singing and meant something. Storyline is still true in 2012 without all the bad words or nudity. It's just a great movie to see with anyone, or even on a rainy day or night.....<br />Just sit back and relax...in the comfy of your couch or bed :)
B006H5120E|5.0|Waited forever for this and it did to disappoint. 3d was awesome considering it wasn't shot originally . Would reccommend
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest! I'm on the site at least an hour everyday looking for recipes for dinner/dessert or ideas for birthday and Christmas cards/gifts. I just recently bought a house so all of the DIY pins really come in handy.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Watched this recently and was disappointed. Not sure what all the fuss was about. The girl with the bow & arrows - I think she used it twice the whole movie. This wasn't a bad movie, just kind of predictable and some of the characters overreached.
0307744434|1.0|I had heard so many great things about it.  When I purchased it I couldn't wait to start it.  After it taking me a month to read, I found myself feeling like I couldn't wait to finally finish it.  So disappointing on many levels.  I won't get into it because if you read the other one-star reviews they say it all.  It was confusing at times, boring most of the time, and a waste of my time and money.  I don't like leaving books unfinished, so I kept at it until I finished a few minutes ago.  Don't waste your time, there are many other wonderful books waiting for you out there.
B008645YEE|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do.
0385535147|1.0|I anxiously awaited the release of this book. The day it came out, I rushed out and bought it. I was very disappointed in John Grisham's book. The reading was so easy a kindergartener could read it, and the plot was all but unbelievable.  It seems that authors who at one time were great with their literary fiction are no becoming subject to sloppy work.  I was rather disappointed in the last 2 books as well, and reading from the other comments, others feel the same way.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|This movie is awesome. the action was great and the cast was awesome. this movie had some of my favorite actors in it. i i think for her film debut gina carano did a pretty good job. and i liked how the actors did thier own stunts. i think gina would make a good wonder woman if they ever made a movie. all in all this was a fun movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0060873027|2.0|[[ASIN:3896674293 Micro]]Like a Rick Moranis movie, without the Canadian accent.<br />I don't know why it was written so that you disliked everyone in the book, but it was. I felt that there were obligatory science lessons spread out as monologues by the characters. At first they were somewhat interesting until I remembered that the characters were 1/2 an inch tall through the use of magnetics, and then it became very difficult to take the science seriously.<br />Also, my mind insisted on reading all the lines after the shrinking in tiny, high voices. That didn't help either. It made me laugh at times when I was sure Crichton was trying to be serious.<br />I read the book on an eight hour flight. Being forced to sit for that long was the only way I was able to finish the book.
B00393FFPU|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Awesome collection of stories filled with a variety of perspectives on the most devastating thing to happen to mankind. The vignettes in this collection tug your heartstrings more than you'd imagine as the entire world is plunged into helplessness.
B0057OP0PY|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do.
0740748475|5.0|any fan of calvin and hobbes will love this! great intro by bill waterson, and then- calvin and hobbes! what more could you want?
B0049J2CKE|5.0|I don't have kids, and yet, I love this movie. It's so endearing, and it's great to see a movie that's funny AND appropriate for children.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham has created characters and plot that captures readers and brings them along on a fast paced ride filled with good old fashioned twist and turns, all the while bringing fascinating characters to life. Although it wouldn't be Grisham without a few shots at the justice system, they don't interfere with the story and the fun. Read and enjoy.
B0071BY2OG|5.0|\\"Fastest\\" is a documentary on Valentino Rossi in MotoGP.  The whole story revolves around him, as the world of motorcycle racing revolves around him, so it's fitting.  The whole production fit together and progressed better than Faster did, mainly because it was focused on the rise of the GOAT, then his bumbs in 06 and 07, his return to dominance in 08 and 09, and his struggle in 10 with Lorenzo and injury.  The film expressed the feelings of Lorenzo, that while he may have been given a proven bike that Rossi developed, he was still faster on it then Rossi on a few occasions.  In all, it is a great lesson in the history of man and empires.  They rise, shine for a while and then fade into history, it's just that some burn brighter and longer than the rest.  Rossi is one of those.  But, like Ewan said, in the intro and conclusion of the movie, It doesn't matter who was faster then, what matters who is Fastest now.  The question the world wants to know, does Rossi still have it?  \\"Fastest\\" sets the stage for Rossi and his return to Yamaha.  God speed Rossi!
B0063IH60K|4.0|its your typical solitaire game. good app. a few ads in between games but not annoying like some others. I recommend it.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I think this app is very funny, and adorable. Every time I run it, it makes everybody laugh. Tom is a very high pitched cat. That's kind of why its funny. It also has cute animations where he comes up and scratches your screen or drinks milk. Enjoy!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I got the Limited Edition which came with the extended cut which is what I believe the blu-ray version is and I loved it from start to finish. It takes place at the Covenant war beginning before the Spartan Program was a known program. You learn a lot about Lasky and his past and his destiny. The environment looks legit and believable. Well done.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I guess it was okay, and by far the best of the trilogy.  Glad I read it, though.  Movie matched up pretty good.
1476712042|5.0|If you like angst and uber macho heros, you'll love this book. The hero is a hot, sexy, and strong underground fighter who falls hard for the heroine.  It's a great read that will make your heart flutter and your stomach churn ultimately delivering a wonderfully happy ending.
1451627297|5.0|I really, _really_ don't like Stephen King books, they usually scare me within 5 pages and then I can't read anymore, or sleep that night.  So, it was with a great deal of trepidation that I got this book.  Actually, I borrowed the book on CDs from the library.  But, the first disk wasn't scary, and I wasn't very sure if I was going to like it.  It seemed kinda slow.  As in , &#34;what does this have to do with JFK?&#34;  I wasn't even sure that I liked the reader, but I decided to keep going because of the good reviews.  (The reader grew on me to the point that I think he was the perfect choice).<br /><br />By the second disk, I knew that I was in deep trouble, because I had fallen into the story, and I was afraid that the library wasn't going to allow me to renew the disks!  (I only listen to them on the way home from work, so that's only about 25-30 minutes a day).  Jake/George is a wonderful character, one of the best I've met, right up there with Gus from Lonesome Dove, who I fell in love with.  I felt like I walked through everything he did.  I cringed in the Derry parts, yelled in horror at the scene in his house in Dallas (since there are no spoilers hidden I won't be more explicit than that) and cheered for him throughout the knee injury.  I even enjoyed the love story, to my shame since it was adultery.  I really liked Sadie and thought she was a great compliment to Jake.<br /><br />There are only a handful of books I give 5 stars to, but this is one of them.  I nearly subtracted a star because of all of the sex scenes (yes, I'm a &#34;prude&#34;.  I don't think sex should be portrayed that explicitly.  We don't do that typically with bathrooms scenes.  I just think some things should be private. Those are 2).  But the compelling characters who seem to live beyond those in most books, and the great story made me give the star back.<br /><br />I NEVER thought I'd give Stephen King 5 stars.  This has surely got to be his best book, and he should be very, very pleased with it.  I'm so, so sad that I finished it. In hope he doesn't do a sequel, there's just no way it would be appropriate, the book is perfect as is.
B000FC1AOI|4.0|I first read the book and then saw the movie, and I much loved the book than the movie. It's a well written book which you will keep reading it just to know how it follows.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought that this game was pretty cool.  I liked almost all the games. my cousin got this game and he was happy because I got like every game for him. so then I got a tablet and it was the first one that I added
B007EECSFA|5.0|I am a Kate Morton fan and she didn't disappoint me.  It was a \\"page-turner\\" and the ending did not disappoint.  About 2/3 through the book, I decided I had figured out the mystery, so I was anxious to finish to see if I was right.  I was!!  But, she was able to make me doubt myself, several times.  That is when a mystery is fun.
0385344228|2.0|I started out enjoying this book and its premise - a DA's son accused of murder and his fathers insistence to stand by him through thick or thin.  But the characters fell flat for me after a while, and the actions of the adults seemed a bit implausible to me.  The revealing of the facts of the story through the grand jury setting while at first was an interesting twist, grew a bit tedious. The ending while shocking just left me feeling sad. And when you think back on all of it - nothing is really resolved.  You are left to make your own conclusions. 2.5 stars.
0439023513|5.0|THIS IS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED. VERY THRILLING AND FULL OF EXCITEMENT. I EXPECTED PEETA TO END UP WITH KATNISS BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST BE CRUEL OF HER IF SHE REFUSED TO, HE WAS NOTHING BUT GOOD TO HER. WHEN HER SISTER DIED, THAT WAS VERY UNEXPECTED...SUCH A LITTLE INNOCENT GIRL.

0380788624|5.0|I didn't expect \\"Cryptonomicon\\" to be nearly so entertaining. I put off reading it because of its length, over 900 pages in trade paperback. Its story concerns two generations of crypto maniacs, which, on the surface, seems like a cool subject, but conversing with people who are preoccupied with cryptography tends to be mind-numbing. So I could not have been more surprised to find that \\"Cryptonomicon\\" is a page-turner! I wasn't sure if it would be science fiction or speculative fiction, but this is actually historical fiction. It jumps back and forth between groups of related characters during World War II and the 1990s, which end up fitting together like a jigsaw mystery.<br /><br />Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is a socially awkward young man who enlisted in the army as a musician but ended up cracking enemy codes at Bletchley Park after his mathematical talents were discovered. He is a fast friend and colleague of Alan Turing and both are acquainted with a man who is assumed to be doing much the same work on the German side, Rudolph von Hacklheber. Bobby Shaftoe is a marine stationed in Asia and sole survivor of a Japanese assault on Guadalcanal, after which he is recruited to be a member of the secretive Detachment 2702, whose job it is to obscure the fact that the Allies have cracked Enigma.<br /><br />In the modern world, Lawrence's grandson, Randy Waterhouse, is in Manila on business for Epiphyte Corporation, of which he is co-owner with old gaming buddy Avi Halaby. They ostensibly want to operate a video transfer service, so they hire a company owned by Douglas MacArthur Shaftoe, son of Bobby, to lay undersea cables. In fact, they intend to create a data haven and bank for anonymous digital currency on the little Pacific island kingdom of Kinakuta. But they may be in over their heads as big businessman Herbert \\"The Dentist\\" Kepler tries a hostile takeover before Epiphyte is even operational, and big governments and big crime have an interest in the data haven too.<br /><br />There are about ten main characters and a lot of minor ones, some historical figures. Most of them are obsessed with cryptography. The World War II era and the 1990s were watershed years for cryptography, due to the War and the development of the World Wide Web, so it's easy to see why someone would focus on these periods and want to tie them together in what turns out to be a mystery novel. \\"Cryptonomicon\\" owes its length to the large cast of characters and to the fact that half of the text is details and digressions. These are at least as interesting as the story itself. You just have to accept that the story exists, in part, as a framework to support many tangents.<br /><br />There is cryptography, of course. Nothing very complicated, but Bruce Schneier wrote an appendix to explain his Solitaire Encryption Algorithm that is used in the book. \\"Cryptonomicon\\" isn't perfect. The ending is a little weak -though I don't know how any climax could be satisfying after two generations of build-up. I wish the data haven were involved more directly in the plot. Perhaps a sequel will take place after the data haven opens. But this book was so much fun that I feel I must give it 5 stars in spite of flaws. I started reading it on the subway and nearly missed my stop. I thought it would take a week to read, but it took only a few days, because I couldn't put it down.n too.<br /><br />There are about ten main characters and a lot of minor ones, some historical figures.

1419553429|2.0|Just finised the Sentence Correction, PS and DS sections on the Kap 800 .. Here is my take :<br /><br />Quant: It should not be considered anything more than a collection of questions, and should be used as a question supplement to the Kaplan Premier or MGMAT quant books (for basic concept development and understanding). As a question source, i seriously doubt that this book is a collection of 700-750 or 750+ level questions. I will go as far as guessing that no more than a fourth of this book includes 700 level questions(at the maximum), and majority of them are in the 650 range. Having said that, i do not think that this is all that disappointing. Any person looking to go from a 600-650 GMAT score to a 700+ score will most likely need to get PAST the HUMP that is - \\"The 650 level questions\\" .. Anyone who gets say a 700-720 will get a lot of 650-700 level questions that he or she would need to get right in order to move to higher questions.. What this book tries to simulate are the tough questions that are tough because the test makers have laid traps in order to trick you towards a particular answer choice. I feel that a lot of the quant questions towards the back end of the OG problem set do the same thing (questions that could be safely clubbed in the 650+ level), therefore these questions on the Kap 800 do make you better at avoiding common traps especially in word problems. The DS section is a bit disappointing, and i seriously feel that the last 20-25 questions on the OG13 (DS section) are better for practice.<br /><br />If it is STRICTLY 700+ questions that you are looking for, The MGMAT Advanced Quant is the book, but i would guess that any one scoring say a 720 on the GMAT would only get around 5-8 of those questions that involve really tough concepts or rarely tested topics (in the quant section, given that it is reasonable to expect 6-10 experimental questions, and the first few are medium diffuculty level questions, only 20-25 questions will be TRULY ADAPTIVE) . The rest would be either 650-700 level questions or 700+ level questions that club multiple much simpler concepts and topics.. From the free Questions attempted it seems that the GMAT CLUB tests are a couple of notches above the MGMAT Advanced quant. and therefore, they probably are the best recourse for 750+ level questions on the planet (that are still relevant for the material tested on the GMAT, and are written with similar style).<br /><br />Sentence Correction: Although some tough questions, i feel that many answer choices are not as clear as those given in the OG.. yet overall i am satisfied, and do not feel that i have wasted time on mediocre questions especially after having finished the OG13 SC questions and done all in the KAP premier. I also feel that no recourse other than the OG tests the new emphasis on the SC (as per reports from test takers) ie. long passages which are completely underlined and involve multiple categories (parral., modifiers, pronouns etc) and cannot be split vertically. I strongly believe that practicing Sentence corrections questions beyond a point is not an optimal allocation of time, and that once one has done the OG problems, and perhaps a 100 or so more problems, it is better to spend 2-3 hours a week reading the primary SC book and going over basic grammar rules. I spend 30 minutes daily on going over ONE particular topic of SC from the MGMAT SC guide, and then use the grammar resources on the internet to read more about that topic. Doing this for a couple of months, one can cover all the topics and then move onto the CAT's. I am on my third reading of the MGMAT SC guide and discover something new every time  .<br /><br />Conclusion: I feel this is a book for someone who gets around 600-620 and wants to touch 700 and maybe go a bit over..Especially for those whose weak area is WORD PROBLEMS and who makes careless mistakes...It will by itself not Guarantee a 700 by any means (as i am learning, now with CAT's) but will help if supplemented with the OG's and online resources. It will almost never help you achieve 800, nor will it enable a 720-750 level person to get 800. Infact if you are consistantly scoring 700 or above in CAT's i think this book will be a waste of time, and anyone in that situation would find it better to get the MGMAT Adv. quant or move to the GMAT club tests for the extra boost (considering that GMAT club tests are so many in number, and include both quant and verbal) ... So the NAME KAPLAN 800 is only a marketing gimmick and one must look past that. This is a logical supplement for the Kaplan premier, and those that have started off with the Kap premier (as a huge number does) then this is a couple of notches above that in difficulty. For those that start off with MGMAT set, and do well in the 400 or so questions that come with that can perhaps skip this book and move on to the MGMAT Adv quant.(if they are getting a good score on some of the practice CAT's )<br /><br />Pros: Provides a decent amount of questions witin the 650 range of difficulty at a reasonable price<br />  Is a logical supplement for the Kaplan Premier book<br />  Covers WORD PROBLEMS in detail, and provides valuable practice for those looking to improved careless mistakes<br /><br />Cons: Does not cover many topics like Probability, Permutations & Combinations, Statistics etc in detail<br />  The structure, and the explanations are poor and and because of this, it cannot be used as a review book, therefore must be supplemented with the Kaplan premier<br />  Does not reflect the TITLE ie. Does not provide a single 750 level question let alone a 800 level question<br />  Does not cover Integrated Reasoning<br />  Too Few D.S. Questions: Since DS is considered by many to be the trickiest portion of the quant (and many consider it the toughest in the whole GMAT) any advanced book should cover DS<br />  strategies, for tough questions in details and contain a large amount of DS practice questions.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Differs from other Grisham books but very entertaining. Not too deep into the details but enough to make it sound real and in keeping with how things would go legally. I have enjoyed his ventures away from his typical legal thrillers, like Playing for Pizza and The Broker. I would recommend this book for good casual reading.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I had high hopes for this book since the Harry Potter series was so entertaining. There were no characters that were likeable, the plot was mediocre, the language was annoyingly crude and foul.  I almost didn't finish the book but I did and it was a waste of time.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Skyfall is a very interesting and entertaining entry in this 50 year old series in that it gives us all the classic elements that we've come to expect from a Bond film and yet, takes it into new and unexpected territory. Not everyone is going to like where it goes but, I certainly did. The story is actually quite simple. After a mission goes awry, 007 (Daniel Craig) is thought dead but, is actually living in secret, drowning the negative effects of his job with sex and booze. But, when a mysterious and sinister individual targets MI6 and M (Dame Judi Dench) in particular, Bond returns to action despite doubts from some of his superiors that he still can handle the job. Writers Robert Wade, Neal Purvis and John Logan craft a story that is part spy thriller and part Silence Of The Lambs as Bond faces not a villainous organization or government but, one very dangerous and psychotic ex-MI6 agent known as Silva (Javier Bardem) who is bent on avenging what he feels is a betrayal by his former boss, M. It's a daring direction to give this Bond film a more personal focus despite it's scope and having Bond defending, not Queen and Country but, the one person he can even remotely consider family, M, from a man whose motives for revenge are equally personal. And director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road To Perdition) is more then up to the task. Mendes gives the film the epic scope we've come to expect from these moves as the film travels from Turkey to Shanghai and from Macau to London and Scotland but, never looses focus on the characters or story. He directs the action in a refreshingly old fashion manner, no more evident then in the thrilling train set pre-credit sequence. No quick cuts or shaky-cam, just good intense action. The action is what's exciting, not the  camera or editing tricks used to make it exciting. He gets great performances out of his cast. Craig is sensational as a Bond who is a bit burnt-out and bitter yet, is driven by duty and loyalty to return to alife he has a chance to escape... a life that maybe is right for him after all. Bardem is simply brilliant as the demented and dangerous yet, disturbingly flamboyant, Silva. A man who is Bond's equal in many way's but, is demented by his inner pain and thirst for revenge. Dame Judi Dench is great in an expanded role for M. She and Craig are magic together and it's great to see them share so many scenes after Quantum Of Solace kept them apart for almost that entire film. The supporting cast including Naomie Harris (Eve). Ralph Fiennes (Mallory) and Ben Whishaw (a young, computer geek-ish Q) are all excellent and provide great support for the principles. Mendes makes this flick look great with some stunning camera work such as the Blade Runner-esque Shanghai and the moody moors of Scotland. The film is deliberately paced but, it is more thriller then action flick although, there is plenty of the latter. Round that out with a very Bond score by Thomas Newman, a classic Bond theme by Adele and one of the best opening credits sequences in some time and you have a solid James Bond flick that is both charmingly familiar and yet boldly treads new ground. Bravo!
034580404X|3.0|I will keep this short and sweet. Good read imo. My biggest beef is this. The first two books cover so many details. You cover a very short period of time that is pretty detailed. Then suddenly, you get to the 3rd book and it feels like the author just got sick of the story. So much is left out. I would be more detailed here, but I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone. I will just say this series could have easily had another book. I don't understand why the first two books are so detailed and the last is so vague. Like I said, it seems like the author just wanted this to all be over. I was looking forward to reading about other aspects but was left wanting more when all was said and done.<br />Over all a good series though.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|While I have having lunch in my car and listening to a local radio station, they were interviewing Donald Fagen regarding his new CD, \\"Sunken Condos.\\"  Since I am a huge fan of DF and Steely Dan, I was very excited to listen to the interview and thought to myself, what could he possibly have new to write about that would produce a new CD?  Well, I recently bought it and he certainly didn't disappoint me.  Great music from an amazing musician!!  The entire CD is well produced and the songs that stand out for me is the catchy tune: \\"Memorabilia and Weather in My Head\\". Can you imagine a song about global warming, with a special lyric dedicated to Mr. Al Gore himself!<br />Overall, this CD is certainly a refreshing, change of pace from the commercialize music currently played on the radio and that is why I am giving it my 5-star rating.  Go out and buy it, you will not be disappointed.
B002OHDRF2|4.0|Terminator Salvation is a good action movie with pretty good plotline follow by a good acting job by Bale and Worthington.  The Terminator series seems to be streaching the limits at times but still keeping people's intrest in the series with acting of the actors, the music, and the basic plotline.  If you like the basic idea of the Terminator series and a good action movie with pretty good fight scenes, action, and drama that makes you feel for the characters then this is the movie for you to enjoy.  Over the past few years I've watched it mutiple times and still I enjoy it.  As for myself it keep me intrested all the way threw from start to finish, I do hope they actually go threw with their idea for Terminator 5 sometime in the future.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Jo Nesbo's lastest work 'The Phantom' is a must read for anyone who enjoys the Harry Hole series. In true fashion, this book continues with the saga of Harry Hole, the Norwegian detective,haunted with demons and battle scars from his brushes with serial killers and his old buddy, Jim Beam. From start to finish, the reader is captivated with the latest chapter in Hole's life. The drama surrounding Hole, his lost love Rakel and Oleg, keeps you turning pages until you force yourself to put the book down. The ending is shocking and kicks you in the gut and leaves you begging Nesbo for more Harry Hole.
0345803485|1.0|There is not much more I can add to the previous reviews that agree this book is horrific.  I kick myself for falling into the hype. As I kept reading, chapter after chapter, I was hoping I would like it. That I would reach the climax, the point of all the hype. However, by the time I reached the ending, I found myself pissed off that I, 1.) Wasted valuable memory on my IPad, 2.)paid for this book, 3.) paid for this book, and 4.) That I can not recover the time or brain power it took to read such garbage. Did I mention I paid for this crap? I will preface my next comment by saying, I have some (perhaps adequate) bedroom experience.  Who is using this book to spice up their sex life, really?? Is this really the fantasy for many, seriously? Do you really want to be hog tied and whipped with some leather strap used on animals?...Oh. I feel like Dr. Seuss could have written better erotic scenes than this (I love Dr. Seuss!).<br /><br />Overall, the characters were dull, unrelateable, and underdeveloped. I have no desire to read the other two novels. I must be convinced with the first.  The leading lady, Annabelle, Anastasia, April, whatever, was beyond naive. And, the ending, guhhhh!!! How could anyone ever know there was, or desire to read a sequel. Please, someone help me understand what recent college graduate entering into journalism does not have an e-mail address? Anyone...? E L James, kudos to you for receiving my contribution, however, never again! By the way, what magical Seattle Land is this??? Umm..Where are these people in Seattle? I just want to curl up in the fetal position on my bed, and close my eyes until the memory of this book goes away.<br /><br />I did find some redemption in reading Bared to You by Sylvia Day. This book was worth reading, and had the perfect balance of erotica, romance, and F'd up characters who somehow find some balance in each other. Try it.

B0091XIZO0|4.0|For his thirtieth birthday, Lang Lang dedicated his solo album to the works of Chopin, just as Maurizio Pollini, who turned 70 this year.<br />While good old Pollini opted for Preludes, Lang Lang displayed his keyboard virtuosity in the Op. 25's 12 Etudes.<br />No qualms about the keyboard technique of Lang Lang.<br />But just having heard Yuja Wang live last night, I immediately see how the two compared. Yuja played a Chopin piece as encore. How unlike Lang Lang!<br />Both have deficiencies with regard to the interpretation of Chopin, but Yuja opts for the harmonics, while Lang sticks more to the melodic side.<br />Lang Lang does not have the intuitive rhythmic sense of Yuja Wang, but has more of a personal human touch in his playing than Yuja, the ultra-supreme keyboard technician.<br />What matters with Lang Lang's Chopin is the style.<br />Having become an internationally reknowned pianist for over a decade, Lang Lang does not seem to have much time to spend on stylistic development with regard to any specific composer's works, and this is a great shame.<br />For a supreme technician to grow, musical styles should really be in the forefront.<br />While Lang Lang has already tuned down much of his personal mannerisms in playing, this album still presents the clear message that he has not yet savoured Chopin's style.<br />The Etudes are rather heavy-handed in sound. For an equally virtuosic emphasized version, listen to Tamas Vasary's, who has much more affinity with the style of Chopin, for sure.<br />The dances also show up the weaker rhythmic sense of Lang Lang, though the pieces are beautifully wrapped up in his own way.<br />May be the musical world would not bother so much these days with 'musical styles' than with virtuosic displays.<br />If that is your primary motive, this album will surely please.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|This game was good , not great. But I still liked this cool App. Good App, but not so great for me.
B007V65R54|4.0|Silver has become the consummate statistics guru in the U.S., something you can't often say about statisticians.  He also has a unique ability to explain statistics in a way that the average reader can appreciate. He certainly makes a compelling case in this book about some of worst forecasts ever made and why the underlying stats used were insufficient and wrongly interpreted.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this with the proviso that I thought that some chapters were overlong.<br /><br />Excellent book even for those not math inclined.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|If you have not seen the film, there are spoilers, below.<br /><br />I saw Prometheus first when it was in theaters and found it interesting but somewhat bewildering in some of its plot development. On taking a second look recently, I found I enjoyed the film much more as a naïve journey to find the extraterrestrial origins of the Earth.  The opening of the film is among my favorites, as we watch the robot David going through his daily routine as the crew and scientists sleep.<br /><br />The idea of setting off on a space voyage in search of alien forms of life is hardly a new concept in film.  What makes this film work are the strong performances of the cast.  Michael Fassbender's David is fascinating to watch, although a robot exhibiting high intelligence he also imbues his character with a touch of humanity. He is naïve and sinister by turns. He mimics Peter O'Toole after watching Lawrence of Arabia and administers the lethal biological weapon being developed by the aliens without regard for the consequences.<br /><br /> Noomi Rapace brings out the idealism of her character (Elizabeth Shaw) believing that the aliens they are setting off to visit will somehow be benign creators only to discover the opposite. Even though she has every reason to believe the mission is a failure, Shaw wants to pursue her questions deeper into how humans failed their creators. While Elizabeth Shaw represents the inspiration behind the expedition her fellow scientist and lover Charlie Holloway (played by Logan Marshall-Green) is the force behind the quest.<br /><br />Charlize Theron plays the formidable Meredith Vickers, who represents the corporation financing the mission.  Clearly, Vickers does not believe in the mission and has no regard for the other members of the crew. The fact that she has her own module that can be ejected from the ship underscores that she intends to survive if things go bad. Her hostility is more than not believing in the mission and is only revealed by thepresence of her father on board Prometheus.<br /><br />The film has a lot of suspense but is also has plot twists that seem lifted from Alien. Some of the action is contrived and certainly, the unforgettable scene where the pregnant Noomi Rapace has radical surgery and manages to walk away stretches belief to the limit.  For me, with all its faults Prometheus remains a highly interesting film and one that I would want to see more than once if only to appreciate the stunning visual effects.  I would be interested in a director's cut that might fill provide more in the way of plot.
B008FOB124|3.0|After a 16-year hiatus Dead Can Dance, the esoteric world music duo of Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry, returned in 2012 with this new album ANASTASIS and a long reunion tour. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Dead Can Dance changed styles with nearly every album, and when they had stopped with [[ASIN:B000002N74 Spiritchaser]] in 1996, their sound was dominated by African drumming. ANASTASIS is something of a step back from that to the album before (\\"Into the Labyrinth\\"), e.g. synthesized ethnic instruments and music that sounds vaguely tribal but can't be fixed to any particular part of the world.<br /><br />The album does not have a promising start. \\"Children of the Sun\\" is a clumsily worded paean to the hippie counterculture that with its distinctive synthesizer loops sounds like it was left off Brendan Perry's last solo album [[ASIN:B004V9J53O Ark]]. Of course, Perry and Gerrard often feature their separate work on DCD albums, but it would have been nice to have something that sounded like it came from their joint recording sessions and not some earlier Perry date. \\"Opium\\", \\"Amnesia\\", \\"All in Good Time\\" continue this Perry soloing.<br /><br />On the other hand, Gerrard's glossolalia vocals dominate in the tracks \\"Anastasis\\", \\"Agape\\" and \\"Kiko\\". Not only are they not much different than music Gerrard recorded previously for DCD, solo projects and film scores, they aren't even much distinguishable from each other.<br /><br />Only in \\"The Return of the She-King\\" do Perry and Gerrard share vocals, and this is the one song really holds up against their old work. Gerrard takes a somewhat different vocal approach than elsewhere on the album, and multitracks these vocals to fine effect. Perry also gives up his serious message-driven lyrics for pure vocalizing that melds well with Gerrard and the synthesized strings.<br /><br />I cannot really knock this album; this duo knows how to craft some catchy tunes, even if they are now clearly following a formula. And my tastes remain weighted towards their music, which I've checked by going through their classic albums again. But ANASTASIS could have been much more and both musicians seem stuck in a rut. Perry announced intriguing plans around the turn of the millennium (for a Zen percussion album called \\"Zun Zun\\"), but abandoned them for the MOR generic synthesizers of recent work. Gerrard's inability to come up with new musical ideas has been noted for over a decade now.es remain weighted towards their music, which I've checked by going through their classic albums again.

0547564651|3.0|Modern child development research repeatedly shows that virtue, ie. good character, cannot be \\"taught\\" but only arises when children are treated compassionately and reasonably and then imitate that good treatment. In other words, children do as we do, not as we say.  The other key to building good character is not to expect children to be miniature adults but to understand what is reasonable at every age and stage. For example, we build good character when we understand that two year olds don't want to share toys and shouldn't have to, that toddlers need to explore and their environment should be baby-proofed, and so on. So building good character actually starts at birth when we respond to our infants' cries thus showing them that we care about their feelings.  For a parenting book that details how to build character in children from birth on, see [[ASIN:0615439349 Smart Love: The Comprehensive Guide to Understanding, Regulating and Enjoying Your Child]]
B0076DCT2G|2.0|The plot is too much about the sarcastic remarks of the main character. I was not impressed. I find the book rather boring, although, on the positive side, some of the political narratives are insightful.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was highly recommended to me, and now I can highly recommend it to others.  I didn't feel like any security issues were present in the book; but it seemed so real.  I have always respected the men and women who serve our country, but this book has definitely raised my level of admiration and respect.

B008H6GH8I|5.0|Based on my experience with previous RE Degeneration movie and other CG films, I was expecting this to be a decent film at the most, but when I watched the whole film, I couldn't help but to love it.<br /><br />Pros.<br /><br />-Great Animation/Graphics: This is a must for CG films and like the last version Animation is wonderful and the city and scenes in the movie look great.<br /><br />-Marvelous Character Design: Leon, Ada and other main characters are very well designed and the voice acting is decent.<br /><br />-Amazing Action Sequences: This what I loved/surprised by the most. Fighting choreography is just mind-blowing. I was expecting some action but not this much. To me more the better. I would love to describe this in more, but can't do without spoiling.<br /><br />-Acceptable Story: The plot for most part made sense. This is no Avatar, but is engaging enough to be entertaining.<br /><br />Cons.<br /><br />-The Ending: I truly wish they would have gone a step further and showed one more fight (won't spoil but if you see, you will know what I am talking about). The story feels incomplete because they don't show this one more fight and what happens to a mysterious character introduced in this film. I haven't played Resident Evil 6, so may be this has something to do with the movie leading into the game????<br /><br />Contrary to the con I described the movie is enjoyable enough to be worth owning. I hope they make at least one more with Leon and Ada.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|\\"Team of Rivals\\" depicts Lincoln without the iconography. It's a highly researched historical work that reads like a fine novel. You see Lincoln as a compassionate, grief-stricken leader who's incredibly savvy about politics, hard-edged when he needs to be, and conciliatory to his opponents when it serves the interests of the country. I thought Gore Vidal's Lincoln was the one book that brought our greatest president alive, but now there are two. The fascinating details of Lincoln's political and personal life, his fierce conflicts and domestic trials only make Lincoln more sympathetic, if possible. I loved this book and recommend it highly to anyone.

0446547646|3.0|I really wanted to like this book. Honestly, I did. I thought it had a good enough summary on the inside cover of the book. After finishing it, though, I was left feeling empty inside, thinking to myself, \\"that's it?\\" The events were pretty predictable and went along with the basic storyline of all of Sparks' work. I expected that, but usually his books have more depth to them. Maybe I wasn't fond because it wasn't easily relatable for me. The end was highly unrealistic. It would never happen in a million years. I bought it used so I spent less than $4, and I'm glad I didn't spend more on it. It was good enough to finish, but nowhere near good enough to read again. It will sit on my shelf until someone wants to borrow it. Maybe they'll enjoy it more than I did. It wasn't exceptional, but it wasn't really a horrible story either. If I knew I would feel like this after I read it, I would have never bought it in the first place. Again, though, this is my preference and this could end up being your new favorite book. Not likely, but it is plausible.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I stumbled upon this book and am so glad that I did.  I have already read the first Crossfire novel\\"Bared to You\\" which was excellent.  These are two the best books I have read since The \\"Fifty Shades\\" books.  I am looking forward to the next one that Sylvia Day writes.  It keeps you reading to the very last page.  \\"Reflected in You\\" examines a lot of problems that a lot of people have faced but are afraid to discuss openly.  For you that thought \\"Fifty Shades\\" was too graphic, you won't have that problem with this book.  There is sex but not quite as graphic and very tasteful.

B000FC1K66|3.0|This book was not what I expected. The setting could really be anywhere under any circumstances, because what is comes down to is a coming of age story and the persistent self doubt that we all experience throughout our lives. Did we make the right decisions? How could our lives have been different? Are we the best version of ourselves that we can be? That being said, I really didn't enjoy this book. It's short, written in memoir style, and I feel like it examined everything in a very superficial way. The focus of the book is apparently supposed to be how the next generation deals with the reality of the Holocaust, how the various perpetrators and bystanders should be treated, and what we do with the history we've been dealt. The Amazon.com review says, \\"What does it mean to love those people--parents, grandparents, even lovers--who committed the worst atrocities the world has ever known?\\" But the book never addresses this problem. Michael Berg, the main character, skims over his own family's possible involvement and when faced head on with the fact that his lover was complicit in the murder of several women on a march from Auschwitz, he never displays any emotion one way or the other as to how he feels about it. Instead, he takes pity on her because she's illiterate and devotes a good deal of time making sure she's comfortable for the duration of her life. I do think this is quality work - the writing and translation is almost poetic. I just don't think the actual intention and message is conveyed well.

They first reeled me with Teen Dream, then I caught up with the rest and anxiously awaited the release of Bloom. I was not disappointed. I was also able to see them live for the first time this year. If you ever have the chance to see them, don't pass it up. It was one of the most amazing shows I've been to - from the music to the light show - I had the good-show-happy's for at least a week after it was over. It made me wish I'd found this wonderful band earlier than I did so I could have seen them more times than I have! :-)

I can only hope.

006097625X|5.0|Picking up Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics is the first step in truly understanding, appreciating, and also inadvertently defending comics for the remainder of your life. For me, comics were always the funny pages in the Sunday Newspaper and the thin editions of Superman, Spiderman, and Batman. For me, they never really transcended that stereotype. I was aware of their more wide-spread usage, as I grew older, but that label stuck with me. Once I had to read McCloud's work in my Graphic Literature class, however, all those walls came tumbling down and I gained a much, much broader and rational opinion on the sheer works of art that are comics. An entire new world of the different aspects of comics was introduced to me. From this textbook (as I consider this as much an intellectual's book as any), which completely revolutionized the way I view graphic literature, came things I now see as vital tools for understanding these works.<br /> One of the most important aspects to comics that I had never before even fathomed was what the author liked to refer to as \\"blood in the gutter.\\" There is an entire chapter in this textbook which examines the use of panels as almost a form of language as you read. A panel is not just used to house action and subject matter, panels are also telling the story; primarily without the viewer's entire awareness. Blood in the gutter basically implies that there are transitions and actions which are not actually shown, but insinuated and rely on the reader's postulation to fill in the missing pieces - to interpret the blood (or action, to make the term more universal) in the gutter. Examples of this can be seen extensively in most graphic novels. An excellent example of blood in the gutters is in Lynd Ward's woodcut novel \\"God's Man.\\" In the novel, there are subject-to-subject transitions between every panel. You are lucky to find even one sequence where there are moment-to-moment or even action-to-action (both with little closure) progression. It's just not there. You simply watch once scene move to the next while staying within a specific idea or event. This requires a good deal of reader involvement. You have to be able to piece together that the previous panel led the current one - but everything in between in up to the reader (does this scene happen seconds after the last? Day? Weeks?).<br /> The next important element McCloud introduced to me again focused on panels as story tellers. The author asserts that panel's shape, size, boldness, absences, etc. all convey a message. McCloud writes, \\"In learning to read comics, we all learned to perceive time spatially, for in the world of comics, time and space are one and the same. [However,] the few centimeters which transport us from second to second in one sequence could take us a hundred million years in another.\\" He goes on to show different image sequences (yes, the textbook about comics is written and told through actual comics) which prove his theory. Also, the size of a panel can speak volumes. If a comic contains panel after panel of the same size and suddenly there is one panel which is much larger or much smaller than the others, readers are able to gather that that unique panel is special in some way - usually showing time progression or regression. An example of this can be seen in the famous Watchmen by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Toward the end of chapter four, we see panels being used to show time. For the majority of the chapter we have been reading of Dr. Manhattan's past (which led to his \\"creation\\"). We then go back to him on Mars. Building up to the pages with him on mars, we've had several small panels jumping subject to subject (implied) quickly. The panels with him on Mars, however, are elongated and much plainer. This slows readers down, there is more to look at. This usage makes the reader, without blatantly pointing it out, read the panels are simpler and slower. This perpetuates the storyline that Dr. Manhattan functions better on Mars.<br /> The last key piece that I took from the text was McCloud's chapter on the use of lines and shapes to convey emotion. Starting out the chapter, McCloud's comic doppelganger simply asks \\"can emotion be made visible?\\" Following this, we see panel after panel of different lines, shapes, shading, and disfigurations which beg definition in the form of an emotion. McCloud says that the use of pictures evoking emotion is a pivotal part of graphic literature. An example of this is available in almost any comic; but can be pinpointed in Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. In a scene, on page 75, where Batman is combatting ruffians in a trash dump, we see the use of lines to illustrate explosions. However, these also show emotion. We can contextualize the explosions as scalding, fiery, painful, loud, massive, and even deafening just from the way they are drawn. They are huge, ridged, bright, and ominous. We can tell these are terrible things going on.<br /> These things, I feel, are now vital for viewing comics. I am not sure if, after reading Scott McCloud's textbook I'll be able to read graphic novels in the same way ever again. This textbook took all my previous, unfounded knowledge of comics and threw them out the window, set them on fire, and buried the ashes. I recommend this text book to anyone - especially those who don't read comics. It will change the way you view juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence the same way again.

030758836X|3.0|I enjoyed the voice of both characters, especially the twist about halfway through. However, I was left cold and let down at the end of the book. There was so much more the author could have done to finish it off with a zing and leave me feeling satisfied.  The characters were rich and real.
B004K00NMG|3.0|There is beauty, action, and adventure, but no suspense or nostalgia.<br /><br />It features a combination of traditional and CG (computer model rendering) animations, we do not see this again until [[ASIN:B003E66Y3E Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron]].<br /><br />There are moments for everyone, however the theme shifts from one moment to another, making it hard to hold everyone's attention.<br /><br />There are gory and creepy moments, and the \\"west\\" is portrayed as rather sinister (even by today's standards).<br /><br />All of the \\"surprises\\" seem choreographed like a ballet, so it''s a very mixed opinion for me. It has re-watch value, but not the whole story.
0375423966|5.0|I first read these in French during my last foray into the language and was so gripped and entertained that I bought the English translation as a gift for my mom. Obviously you have to like Satrapi's simplistic comic style, but if you do, this set promises hours of great entertainment while she takes you on a funny and exciting journey through Iran and Europe. Only down side is that every good book has to come to an end.

B001E75QGG|5.0|One of the things I find hilarious, regarding the unjustified hatred of Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull, is this:<br /><br />When it's many detractors list the things they can't stand about the film, most of the \\"problems\\" they mention are usually traits which are very prominently and consistently featured throughout the entire series. Yet for some reason, when it comes to Crystal Skull, so many of the fanboys (who seem to suffer from selective memory loss) suddenly deem these same traits to be absolutely unacceptable.<br /><br />In fact, their hatred is so irrational, that they even go to the ridiculous extent, of claiming that their childhood had been \\"raped\\" by the filmmakers (the original creators of the characters and storylines of these brilliant adventure films).<br /><br />The fact is, that the only real problem with Crystal Skull, is that it suffered from impossible expectations...and very little else. In the 19 years which followed the release of Last Crusade, Indy fans had been imagining their own version of what the next film might be like. And when the finished product didn't quite fit with the movie they'd been playing in their collective heads, for nearly two decades, they immediately labeled it as a piece of crap and unfairly dismissed it as a complete failure.<br /><br />Personally, I've never witnessed such inappropriate band wagon jumping (in regard to a film). Apparently, they were expecting the fourth movie to be as good as, or better than Raiders Of The Lost Ark. So when the film didn't live up to these unreal expectations, the disappointment they felt, quickly manifested itself into a massive assault of online criticism...which then morphed into the erroneous and \\"accepted myth\\" that the film is terrible. The film is NOT terrible...not by any means!<br /><br />The reality is, that none of the three follow-up films were as good as Raiders...none were even close! But Crystal Skull, easily, fits perfectly with the rest of the series! And if you're a real fan of Indiana Jones, who's being honest with him/herself, then you know this to be the truth, and you embrace the film for what it is...a fun popcorn movie...no better or worse than Temple Of Doom and Last Crusade.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Rock of Ages is a really good movie and it brought back a lot of memories with the music that was played during the film.<br />You should watch it!
B00466HM28|3.0|The size of this makes it awesome for carrying around and it all works great. I have it custom mapped for multiple softwares. I love the product and all the features for the price. My only problem is, is that the USB plug on the controller becomes lose very quickly after moderate use. This is actually a huge problem, once the plug stops working your out of a controller. I would recommend this controller for home use and to leave the plug in the controller and do touch unless you have to. When unplugging it just be careful and it'll last a lot longer. The price on amazon is awesome.

0634029355|2.0|I was carefull to choose this DVD because it had early work on it , but i was dissapointed by the level of instruction. Even though i feel it is aimed at beg. to intermed. players the guy who is 'instructing' could really do a beter job of spelling out the riffs and runs. for example he might say'ok this song starts with some hammer-ons and pull-offs (plays riffs) and then goes into A7 to Gmaj' just as an example. This is frustrating because i end up rewinding many times to make sure im playing the correct notes- what would be so much better is if he took the time and effort to say ' this run startes 2nd fret on the G  pull off to open G then...' and so on spelling out the notes. this assures accuracy and ultimately saves time and frustration ( I feel strongly about this because i have purchases other DVD's that are dome that way and the difference is noght to day)<br /><br />Also not all songs are not complete- for example white room is missing solo- layla is missing outro solo so its just studies of the songs really<br /><br />After watching, i kinda feel my money would have been beter spent on a book of TAB, but at the end of the day i feel i will get a handle on the songs that attracted me to this DVD , but buyer be informed!

B009GXHOW4|4.0|I think this is a great app,  but after a while, it took all the fun out of the game. there's no point to playing if you just give yourself diamonds.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It takes a considerable and realistic amount of time to get things done in this game and I love the dragons.
B0096HIEE2|4.0|I won't lie. I went to this movie for the sights. However the story was more developed then I expected. Mike is that guy. That guy who is down on his luck, screwed up his credit when he was younger, and still can't fix it. That's Mike. Now he's a stripper to try to fix his life. Along the way he takes on the Kid as a quazi-apprentice. Lots of laughs, definitely a movie for chick night with your friends.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|I recommend this film to anybody! It keeps you interested from start to finish and it became one of my favorites.
0691143692|4.0|First of all i must tell that i am a casual reader not a historian.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book a lot. It is covering a timeline more then 1000years. So in the end you will have a general idea about everything.<br /><br />I first got the digital edition. After reading first 50 pages i bought the paper version also. It deserves a nice place in my library next to other history books.<br /><br />Salute!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Plot felt recycled.  Is it possible that this author has no new ideas?  Very disapponting read.  I will not keep reading his books if this is what he will be pulishing.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case is the best one I ever used.  Fits perfectly on my kindle Fire HD. Stands great and easy to use. Love the color Purple! Amazon is so easy for shopping and orders arrive fast.

B008V0OLOW|1.0|I have many of her CDs I like her voice and her section of songs, But this Diana Krall Glad Rag Doll CD is not up to her standards.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Absolutely great music of the times; amazing that it took so long for popular recognition here in the States.  Maybe a little better than Coming From Reality.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I really loved reading this collection of articles from Miss Minimalist's blog. I love her ideas on living a minimalist lifestyle, and her tips on how to do this are really ingenious, original, and helpful. Here are some of my favorites:<br /><br />Use Mason jars for everything! They can hold office, art, and bathroom supplies. They can be glasses or gift wrap or a piggy bank. The possibilities are endless.<br /><br />Closely monitor what comes in and stays in your home. Get rid of one thing every day.<br /><br />Downsize office supplies that you never use. Maybe you don't need 200 assorted paper clips.<br /><br />Digitize, well, everything. (Make sure you back up all your data, too). And only print if you absolutely have to.<br /><br />Get rid of a magazine subscription.<br /><br />We can only process and retain so much. At some point, all that information becomes mental clutter. (I really liked this one.)<br /><br />Overall, a great book. I'm even going to read her \\"real\\" book, [[ASIN:0984087311 The Joy of Less, A Minimalist Living Guide: How to Declutter, Organize, and Simplify Your Life]].
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Best wifi files transfer application available. Can't live without it. Simple interface, easy to use, easy on battery also. No complaints so far.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I had high expectations after reading the reviews and seeing the commercials that it was going to be a movie. I initially lost interest in the first story, it wasn't very captivating but I trudged through it looking for the meat and potatoes. Unfortunately I never got to it. About 2 weeks later and I'm only on the second part of the Luisa Ray story. In other words I've lost my interest and am only finishing to say that I finished. This book shows tons of promise but it just doesn't deliver. Plus the breaking of each story into 2 stories is just annoying. Not to mention the VERY weak link between each story seems to be thrown in as an afterthought, not as if it were actually part of the story. I wanted to be generous and give this book 3 stars but in good conscience I just can't do that. If possible I recommend just borrowing this book rather than buy it. But hindsight is always 20/20.
0800141660|5.0|One word: beautiful. Oh, and I love the certain romantic deleted scene. Wish they had left it in the movie! Ah well... &#34;Excuse me...&#34;
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Once I started reading this book I was knew I was in for a late night. One customer review that didn't like the book thought the cover art was hideous. Then why bother? The cover is what entices me toward a book. I found the art to be intruging and downloaded a sample and from there I was hooked. What I read surprised me. I thought Abby was going to be the one chasing Travis, trying to tear down his defensively wall but instead it was the other way around. At times I wanted to slap Abby, at others I wanted to slap Travis but I'm glad it ended well. Found it disturbingly romantic and can't wait to read Travis' point of view.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|I'm not going to beat around the bush. I love Neil Gaiman. He creates fantasies that are completely bizarre and engaging. The scenarios in his books are so well constructed that you can only marvel at his creative ability. American Gods is certainly no exception.<br /><br />It's been there years since Shadow was thrown in jail when he find out he's getting released early after his wife was killed in a car crash.<br /><br />On his way home for her funeral, he meets a man named Wednesday. Wednesday seems to know an awful lot about him and asks for Shadow's services as a man-of-all-work. When Shadow reluctantly agrees, he is quickly drawn into a world where the gods of mythology are very much alive.<br /><br />A war is brewing between the old gods, who were brought to America by those who settled the land, and the new gods of technology. Shadow must decide which side he's on and if it's a war that is really worth fighting.<br /><br />I have never read anything that I could confidently compare to Gaiman's work. He writes such a singular type of fantasy that I'm convinced it would be impossible for someone else to replicate. His novels are equal part fantasy and humor with some occasional horror and a hefty dash of action.<br /><br />American Gods has all of these qualities, along with an extremely interesting commentary on American culture. We are a country that worships screens -- computer screens, television screens, the screens of our phones. We rely on technology to get through daily life, and this book raises interesting questions about where we place our values.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, mythology, or American culture. It has an incredible mixture of all three.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham's novels are always captivating. This is no exception. Feds wrongly convict good guy, who learns about a murderer and then gets his licks in. Hard to stop anywhere before the last page.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Keep in mind the information gathered and presented has patient bias upon experience and knowledge of the patient.  If the reader is able to 'translate' jargon from patient experiences to reader experiences, the information can extend to greater understanding.<br /><br />Well done.
B0088X7YMS|2.0|Wow at a lost why they did it in CG this movie I think it would have been much better if it was live actors.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Have read all the John Corey books and have been quite pleased with them.  The Panther was a dissapointment to me.  There was a lack of action until the end of the book, and the book just ran on and on.  I really got tired of all Cory's witticism's and quite a few of them were quite racist.  Perhaps Mr. DeMille should have a look at his own society and culture before he critizes others.

B0076XIS4O|5.0|i'm hooked.  i don't really know how to describe the music itself except to say it's easy to listen to in basically any context.  i can play it in one ear at work and i don't get terribly distracted.  i play it in the car and whistle along and it keeps me from losing my cool at bad drivers.  i can play it softly to go to sleep.  usually lyrics and peoples voice draw my attention away from what i'm doing but not with grimes.  it's weird.<br /><br />you definitely have to be cool with her slightly odd vocal style to enjoy the music but i can't get enough.  listen to the samples and if you like, strap on your nikes and JUST DO IT.
B004SBX112|4.0|I just got an \\"update\\" to this game on my old Kindle Fire and it DOWN-DATED ... removed several levels I already had.....  what gives?<br />Note I don't mean it removed my progress, I'm used to that. I mean it deleted a lot of levels entirely. -That was Nov 9 2012.<br />NOV 10 - A second update has put all the missing levels back, so yay to that... progress is gone but all missing game levels have been returned. :)  I guess somebody mistook version 1.3  for 3.1  ...
B000L53D4O|5.0|I got this for my grandson when he was 7 months, as he was trying to pull up on everything and stand with support. His attention was never grabbed by anything before this toy. He loves it!!! We don't let him stand with it too much because he still hasn't mastered the concept, but it's coming.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I picked up the book as a quick reading recommendation from a morning news program. It was a suggested weekend read; it took me 3 months (but that's not the books fault) Once you read and begin to see the characters for who they are, the reading is addictive. The writing makes you long for the ending to see how justice is served (depending on which character you're rooting for). Sadly, there is no resolution. Perhaps it's because the plot set up/build up would make any ending pale by comparison, or perhaps the author got tired of keeping up with the exhausting insanity of the characters.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great product.  My grandkids love this and play it all the time.  It's both challenging & entertaining & a great thought provoking game for the kids.
0525478817|5.0|The problem I have with writing my review of The Fault in Our Stars is that so much has already been said about this book. I feel like I would just be reiterating everything that I've already read or seen on someone else's blog by doing this post. But I love John Green - he's brilliant and unique and totally awesome - and I do feel like I really want to pay tribute to him through this review.<br /><br />This is the third John Green book that I've read, and it has replaced An Abundance of Katherines as my favorite. It may be a typical reaction, considering that there are so many people who love this book as much as I do. But I think it's a testament to how amazing this book is.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars reaches all kinds of readers (and even non-readers), handles a delicate subject matter gracefully and with good humor, and is written in the trademark witty rhythm that Green has down pat. In the end, despite all our individual differences, many readers will enjoy this book because it's so moving.<br /><br />Unlike many who have read the book, I didn't end up in tears - but that doesn't mean that I wasn't deeply, profoundly moved by what I read because I definitely was. Instead, I found that I laughed out loud quite a bit while I was reading, which I definitely wasn't expecting. It's rare that a book will have me beaming and actually laughing out loud, and so, credit must be given to this story for doing just that.<br /><br />One thing that I completely agree with when it comes to the many reviews I've read - Augustus is such a character and I don't just mean literally. He's just got such an amazing presence, as evidence by the fact that he truly leapt off the pages. I was won over by his kindness, his positivity and just how gosh darn sweet and genuine he came across. And I love the fact that we get to see the grittier, realer, more nervous and insecure side of him at times. There is so much to Gus and I love that he felt so real to me.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is beautifully written, showcasing a story filled with warmth, authenticity, positivity and lots of hope. I highly recommend it, and truly think that many readers will come away from the novel just as I did - lighter, happier and a whole lot more hopeful about life.n Our Stars is beautifully written, showcasing a story filled with warmth, authenticity, positivity and lots of hope.

031236198X|3.0|I really liked pages 130-134.  Other than that, it was really a waste of time for me.  I did not enjoy the story, and in my experience it is a team's ability to deal with error, mistakes, and bad choices that define a companies ability to succeed during times of change--which is not represented in the book at all.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Exceptional. His stories just reach out grab you in. This one is one of his best. I carried my iPad with me everywhere until I finished it.

B0086449YA|5.0|The CD has been is my my car since the day I purchased, so I will not be able to<br />capture all the specifics but...this two disc set will not be a disappointment.<br />SIde note: it's great driving music too.Both discs are quite the contrary.<br /><br />There are tender songs, songs where the band let's loose and literally makes you<br />crazy. I cannot get enough of GATOR BLOOD.  I just have to mention that last month,<br />I saw Mark Knopfler and band perform. Of course many of the \\"Privateering\\" collection<br />were in the set list.  The musicianship and acoustics were off the charts and I feel<br />like I was transported to a parallel universe.<br /><br /> I highly recommend \\"Privateering\\".
0312641893|5.0|I must say, you guys, that I cannot believe I waited so long to read this book! Cinder is magical and compelling. The mere fact that it's a very creative retelling of Cinderella makes it even more awesome - drawing inspiration from any fairytale is enough to guarantee my interest in a book.<br /><br />One of the things I loved most about Cinder were the characters. I cannot emphasize enough how much I love it when an author manages to flesh out a character enough for me to really fall in love. Marissa Meyer did such a wonderful job with her cast in this book!<br /><br />Cinder, the title character, is so interesting to me, as she's a cyborg. I had a field day while reading, because both very sensitive topics (like about her ability to truly feel things) and very trivial topics (like whether or not getting wet would cause her to rust or getting too hot would cause overheating or a meltdown) would pop into mind every now and again. The conflict between the machine and the human parts of Cinder was of interest, as well as her stubborn persistence, incredible access to and utilization of knowledge and her loyalty to the ones she loved.<br /><br />The other characters in the book were all vivid in my mind, as well, particularly Kai, Iko, Peony, Levana and Adri. I loathed Adri for how she behaved towards Cinder, and the way that she seemed so incredibly materialistic and concerned with appearances. I feared Levana because she seemed so incredibly powerful and intimidating; I was also angry with her because she was abusing her power. Peony was such a sweetheart and I adored her kind, thoughtful nature and her relationship with Cinder. Iko was so funny - I would love to have someone as entertaining as her in my life.<br /><br />And Kai, well, he deserves his own paragraph, because he definitely made me swoon. There are just too many things for me to love about him - he's intelligent, brave, thoughtful, loyal, generous and kind. As much as Cinder fell for him, I did too - he's an incredible person, and I can't say more than that without spoiling a lot of the plot, so just trust me when I say Kai is totally crush-worthy.<br /><br />It wasn't just the characters that I loved about Cinder, but the story as well. What Marissa Meyer did was clever and very creative; I was definitely pleasantly surprised at how she wove everything (the setting, the characters, the actual conflict) together in the end. It's hard to write about it without spoiling things, so I will just leave it at it was very well-done. I did guess one of the major twists very early on, but that definitely didn't deter me from loving this book.<br /><br />There is one more thing that I want to mention - and that's how initially, the book seemed to be moving a little too slowly for my tastes. I'm happy that I persisted though because it got so good in the end. Just a little disclaimer: even if you think it starts out slow, just keep reading because it gets awesome.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting such a strong personal emotional response to the book - but the fact that Marissa Meyer was able to make me feel everything was definitely in its favor. As I declared on Twitter right after I finished reading, I truly believe Marissa Meyer deserves all the stars because this book is fantastic! There are so many aspects to please all kinds of people - romance, friendships, self-discovery, uncovering mysterious plots - that I think I will be hard-pressed to find anyone who wouldn't enjoy this book. Cinder is one of my favorite reads of 2012, and if you're hesitating, I highly suggest you hesitate no longer and buy this book!'s an incredible person, and I can't say more than that without spoiling a lot of the plot, so just trust me when I say Kai is totally crush-worthy.<br /><br />It wasn't just the characters that I loved about Cinder, but the story as well.

B0013F1D02|5.0|Romance, action, fantasy, suspense, AND comedy...it's all here as well as Robert DeNiro as a cross-dressing cloud pirate. It's Princess Bride for the teenage crowd. It's as complex a plot as one could wish for, but somehow, all the loose ends do get tied up, except we don't know what happened to the unicorn.  In our film group, both adults and 13-14 year old girls loved the film.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is definitely worth a read for Grisham fans.  You'll find yourself guessing the ending, and chances are you'll guess it correctly - but the fun is in navigating the twists and turns of the elaborate scheme filled plot.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|The Lucky One is like a Lifetime Movie - simple and pleasant, but nothing I will ever think about again later. It was a quick, uncomplicated read. One pet peeve is that the female protagonist kept referring to her ex-husband, who was a known character to the reader, as \\"my ex\\" instead of just by his name. I know plenty of divorced people and nobody talks that way. And she said it over, and over. I don't know, it just really bugged me after a while.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I downloaded Season 6 from Amazon, 3-4 at a time. Good quality video, no problems at all.  I just wish I didn't have to wait another year for Season 7!  Cliffhanger ending...<br />But this is a review of the downloads and I am very satisfied with them. :-)
0545140323|5.0|Honestly, this book swept me off my feet! The Lonely Hearts Club has the perfect combination of elements to make me fall in love with a story - real friendships, a slow-burn romance, and total girl power moments and, as an added bonus, references to the Beatles. Elizabeth Eulberg writes in a way that's funny, authentic and totally addicting; I had the pleasure of meeting her, and while I was reading, I certainly felt like her personality actually came across well. I'm happy that this book was one of my summer reads - and I highly recommend it to anyone who has yet to read it.<br /><br />Penny Lane is one of the best things about this book. She's the epitome of a great character - a little off-beat, a whole lot quirky, but still in touch with feelings that teens (and former teens) have experienced. I love how experiencing a broken heart became a catalyst for the club she started, as well as how she attempted to handle the leadership duties that ended up thrust upon her. She's a great friend to her best friends, and the members of the club, and that's one thing I love about her a lot. Plus, she seems like the type who's up for anything - which would definitely cement our friendship.<br /><br />Female friendships are essential to life, and that's something I've always personally believed in. This is another thing that I loved about The Lonely Hearts Club, how it highlighted and celebrated the importance of having great friendships as a part of your life. It's always good to know there are people you can trust to love you, support you and be there for you unconditionally - and seeing this happen with the members of the club certainly warmed my heart.<br /><br />Reading this book also made me realize how amazing it is to really step up and own your own identity. It's natural to be influenced by others or want to follow in the path that they may have set up for you, no doubt. But if you really take the time to reflect on things, you'll realize what things mean the most to you and what YOU would really love or like or hate or tolerate or believe. This happens to quite a few of the members of the club, and I thought it was an empowering and inspiring message.<br /><br />Of course, there's romance involved and to me, it suited the book perfectly. It's one of those cases where the boy is someone Penny has known for a while, and who's a good friend. I love how it just naturally seems to grow from that into something more - and I'm a big fan of one of the \\"grand gestures\\" that this guy does towards the end of the book. I was definitely rooting for them to be together, and was super glad when everyone in the club did too!<br /><br />All in all, The Lonely Hearts Club was a smashing read for the summer - it was fun, quirky and adorable. I loved the characters and the story; plus, it helps that it made me laugh out loud multiple times! (Side story: I was reading this on the subway, sitting next to my best friend. I kept laughing out loud and snorting and grinning like an idiot and she just kept giving me weird looks. Eventually, she asked about it - and now she wants to read it. Ta dah, mission accomplished!). I'm looking forward to reading more books by Elizabeth Eulberg (and Take a Bow just happens to be on my shelf!).you and what YOU would really love or like or hate or tolerate or believe.

B009AMAM9S|3.0|Did you ever pick-up a comic book or a pulp magazine and find a puzzle page with a drawing of something like a tree with many branches and leaves with a title \\"Can you find the seven faces in this picture\\". I would find the first 6 in 2 minutes and spend the next 20 or 30 minutes looking for that last face. I could never give-up until I found it. Well that's what this movie was for me. I kept looking to find that missing face. I could not concentrate on the highly convoluted and interwoven plot, but only where would Tom Hanks turn up next. One time I thought I saw him playing the part of the main mast on the sailing ship. He was everywhere I looked.<br /><br />Then I started to find other books and movies I had read or seen. I heard the syntax and vocabulary from \\"The Clockwork Orange\\" by Anthony Burgess at the start of the movie and the same from \\"Lord of the Flies\\" toward the end with the true true. At one time I saw the makeup the boys used on one of the warriors. The scene of the old man on the toilet seat clipping things out of a paper was from a book by Anthony Burgess whose title I forgot but the description of a man sitting on a toilet for long periods clipping things never left my mind.<br /><br />Then of course there was the parody of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest\\" and I kept looking for the Chief who I never found. The scene where the characters were choosing names got me to thinking of \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and why do I have to be Mr. Pink. Then there was the scene where they had the dead people on moving meat hooks like something from \\"Soylent Green\\". I thought I heard one character say \\"Soylent Green is People\\". The only thing missing was Edward G. Robinson saying \\"It's strawberry jam\\".<br /><br />Then there was the street scene from \\"Blade Runner\\" and the chase scene from \\"Star Wars\\" thru the forest on the anti-gravity ski doos. Hale Berry did a take-off on Tom Cruise in Minority Report as the future detective in front of the large computer screen. The line \\"If I was going to hurt you, you would be dead by now\\" came from a recent movie I saw but I can't remember the name.<br /><br />I think the Wachowskis wrote a  puzzle within a movie. The DVD would make a good parlor game where movie buffs could sit around and try to name the movie or book that the scene or line was based on. I liked reading the reviews as I did not read the book and it gave me some understanding of the movie other than who was playing who. I understand the credits showed the makeup used to make Tom Hanks look like six other people but I got a painful cramp in my left leg and got up after sitting for almost three hours on a lumpy seat to walk it off and missed that part.<br /><br />In summary, if you are looking for entertainment or escape in a movie,  this is not the one. If you want something to keep your mind at a high level of activity, this is for you.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is a fun little app that doesn't require you to spend any real money to get into.  The rare and super rare dragon breeds are pretty frustrating, but I'm dealing with that.  if you're easily frustrated, you may not enjoy this too much.
B008BWFP2W|4.0|She's courageous not because of the masturbation scene, obviously, this anyone can do nowadays, no more courage than to brush one's teeth on screen.<br /><br />Binoche is courageous because she's not afraid to appear on screen almost naked, and act frankly, darkly her own age.<br /><br />This film is not great, but it's well shot, serious and not moralistic.<br /><br />Good movie, 4 stars.

B008Q7O6VS|5.0|Twenty years ago, my dad stood outside a record store at midnight to buy this album for me, I didn't get it from him until almost a month later and had to 'buy' it from him. I think he got more release swag for being an 'old' guy. So now twenty years later for the remastered release, I ordered on Amazon and in less than 24-hours I have it in my hands and immediately in the cd player (surprised it still worked). I still think this was Megadeth's best lineup, at least musically - I know personally they had a lot of issues. The remastered tracks sound even more amazing than they did 20 years ago. Get this album (along with Rust In Peace) and bang your head til you bleed!

0345803485|5.0|I was on a plane to Chicago, sitting between two ordinary-seeming women who both happened to be reading Fifty Shades. I had heard of the title, but knew nothing about the book. I, clueless male that I am, figured it must be some harmless Harry Potter-like fiction.<br /><br />After every chapter, the woman seated to my right would gently close the cover, recline her seat, and shut her eyes. After a few minutes, she'd slowly bring her seat upright, exhale creepily, exchange a grin/giggle with the woman to my left, and then read the next chapter.<br /><br />You can imagine my horror when, later at the hotel, I opened the book's Wikipedia page.<br /><br />But on the plane ride home, I had Fifty Shades in my lap and a highlighter in my hand. I was going to get to the bottom of this.<br /><br />***<br /><br />The criticism of this book has been ruthless and relentless, sometimes hilariously so. One reviewer described Chapter 8 as the chapter in which E L James sat at her computer, highlighted the word \\"groaned,\\" right-clicked, selected \\"Synonyms,\\" and then scattered all of the corresponding words throughout the next 20 pages. It's a slight exaggeration, but also frighteningly accurate.<br /><br />But there are more serious criticisms, too. Some have wondered what this book says about us as a species. Does it represent a failure of feminism? A celebration of sadism? A proliferation of narcissism? Maybe. But that's too many -ism's to really get my head around. I don't know what this book \\"represents,\\" but I know what it invokes. Fifty Shades has propagated its way to popularity one woman at a time, one referral at a time, because it invokes that which lurks deep.<br /><br />One possibility is that the woman next to me on the plane was a closet sadist or masochist who was experiencing a mild pornographic high. Maybe that's all it was: cheap, perverted pleasure.<br /><br />Another possibility is that she was experiencing something far more compelling. Maybe it had nothing to do with the perverted events and everything to do with the carnal-bordering-on-spiritual intensity between Anastasia and Christian, the kind of intensity that typically lies dormant beneath 9 to 5 routines and 401(k) contributions and abstract notions of the \\"future.\\" Maybe Fifty Shades had revealed the real intensity of life, the urgency within.

B001VPJYZK|4.0|At the fourth season's end, the story fast forwarded five years into the future, and we now see life on Wisteria Lane starting from 2013, one year after the show's last season was on TV. Much has changed for our housewives. Susan has left Mike and raises her son MJ, Bree is a professional caterer with Catherine ever since Orson went to jail and Danielle took back her son, Lynette's children are teenagers, and Gaby's a mommy. As for Edie, well, she is back and for the better for of all the Wisteria Lane characters, she is truthful about who she is, what she wants in life, and she doesn't hesitate in saying it out loud. Not only that, she is married to a new husband whose intentions are not that honest.<br /><br />Of what hasn't changed, Fairview still has a Season Mystery in which our Housewives are involved, while their own lives get out of control as we see them solving their problems with unethical solutions. However, I think that Marc Cherry, instead of preparing his plotlines with the same care as in the first four seasons, started to lack direction and fresh ideas in his storylines. Indeed, at the first season, Desperate Housewives intrigued me because it was a clever satire/tragicomedy on Suburbia under the covers of a Soap Opera. Which was how the show could be sold according to Cherry. But after the incredible success of the first season, which never happened again during the show's course and went downhill, I felt Marc Cherry wanted to recapture this success by reusing the same plotlines that made the first season a success.<br /><br />For instance, Lynette learns that one of her sons has sex with the mother of his friend, a mother whose husband beats her. When he is unmasked, her son warns Lynette that if she tells that man the truth, he will leave Lynette's house. And this is where I found the show less interesting because to me, and to other people who agreed with me, this plotline, along with others in the final seasons, were too similar to storylines used in the first four seasons. And I was glad to see that in the Bonus Feature \\"What more do I need - A Very Good Read\\", which discusses the writing process for the episode in which Lynette's son is unmasked, a writer warns everyone that the storyline is too similar to what Bree lived through when Danielle warned her mother that she would leave home if Bree tried to stop Danielle's relationship with her History Teacher.<br /><br />Secondly, several contradictions appeared in the show. First in Mary Alice's narration, and then into the dialogues. For Mary Alice's narration, she says that, after Lynette's son is arrested for a crime he didn't commit, the breakfast the Scavos did was the last they ever took together as a family. But guess what? A few episodes later, they were all back and happily eating together again. What happened in that sudden change of storyline? Was Cherry afraid of upsetting some of his viewers, which the \\"What more do I need - A Very Good Read\\" revealed as some of the writers showed concern of not upsetting fans with their storylines? And for the dialogues, I was astonished to see Lynette say at the twenty-sixth minute of the episode 17 (The Story of Lucy and Jessie) that she is forty-three while Tom say he is two years younger, which means forty-one, the same age Tom was in the first season when he said to Lynette that if he didn't get a high position in his office he would be nothing. Did Tom and Lynette drink at a secret fountain of youth or what?<br /><br />Back to the warning Marc Cherry got from a writer in the bonus feature, Cherry agreed with the storyline's similarity and gave a subtle difference to what Lynette does in comparison to Bree. However, it was while watching this making-of, along with the uninspiring bonus features \\"I Know Things Now: Desperate Housewives celebrates 100\\" and \\"So Very Teri\\", that I felt the show became complacent. Which even Nicolette Sheridan said in interviews after her controversial departure from the show, both behind-the-scenes and in the show. And speaking of Edie Britt, her death bothered me because apart from Mary Alice's mystery, Gabrielle Solis and Bree, she was the other reason why I loved watching Desperate Housewives. She was funny, she had guts, she was a unfair loner who deserved better respect, and one of the few that did and said what the other housewifes wanted, but never admitted to themselves and their families. And as Edie dies in the middle of the fifth season, I cannot help finding her accident, and the special episode dedicated to her, sour-tasted as Marc Cherry got rid of one of his show's most popular character. One I definitely preferred over Susan's relentless romances and annoying clumsiness.<br /><br />Of the season's highlights, my only favorite episode was the 100th, dedicated to Eli Scruggs, a handyman whose actions influenced all the housewives on Wisteria Lane. Even though this episode was made up at the last minute, as Cherry said in the commentaries, it was nice to see a small tribute to the consequences of a secondary character's actions.<br /><br />As such, I give the show four stars mostly because of the season's excellent mystery, and for Edie Britt, who has always been to me one of the main housewives on the show.<br /><br />PS: Did any of you noticed how Nicolette Sheridan's face was blurred in the making-of \\"What More do I need - A Very Good Read\\"? Did her conflicts with Marc Cherry and ABC resulted in this censorship or did something else happened? Very weird to see that blurred face on the screen.w, both behind-the-scenes and in the show.

B0083P1QUM|5.0|\\"The Bone Bed\\" was hard to put down once I got into it. I liked the book and will continue to buy Cornwell's books as long as she writes them.
1400067820|3.0|This book has a really cool innovative style.  The first appendix is \\"a graphical tour of the book\\" where Taleb graphically explains all the main concepts. It renders the nearly incomprehensible visually explicitly clear.  I wish nonfiction writers would use such a graphical appendix.  The second appendix focuses on really technical concepts for the quants.  That's so Taleb can write the body of the book for the layperson.  But, for the mathematicians he is willing to drill down in technical details.<br /><br />The main point of the book is that the World is really complex and genuinely unpredictable.  Black Swans (rare) events will always be Black Swans.  Any efforts to forecast such events are counterproductive.  But, even though we can't forecast Black Swan events we can manage our exposure to them so they don't hurt us or so we can even benefit from them (antifragility).  If we simply remain long the underlying risk by attempting to model Black Swan infested variables, we will be exposed to volatility and fail (fragility).<br /><br />The main underlying concepts are that the majority of causal relationships are nonlinear.  They typically have both a convex section where the curve rises exponentially upward and is associated with a positive effect (antifragile) and a concave section that declines exponentially downward and has a negative effect (fragile).  Think of the dose of a prescription drug.  At first, as you increase the dose the health benefits improve (convexity).  But, beyond a certain dose side effects and toxicity cause harm (concavity).  This is shown on the first page of the \\"graphical tour.\\"  The trick is to reduce one's exposure to the concave part of the curve (reduce toxicity, reduce fragility) and increase exposure the the convex part (increase benefit, increase antifragility).  And, this is true across all domains.  The way to do that is use a barbell strategy that positively captures the optionality of the variable (being long in the convex area and short in the concave area).<br /><br />Sometimes, this (convex vs concave) metaphor is reversed because a beneficial rising section of a variable's curve can be concave and a declining hurtful section can be convex.  And, Taleb does use contradicting examples like that.  From a geometric standpoint convexity and concavity do not tell you whether a curve is rising or declining and whether they are associated with positive or negative effect.  So, you have to pay attention on a case-by-case basis.<br /><br />Within this book Taleb offers interesting data insights.  The more frequently you look at data, the more noise you get.  Assume that you are looking at data with a yearly frequency and that your ratio of noise to signal is 50%/50%.  If you look at the same data on a daily basis, the noise to signal ratio will change to 95%/5%.  If you look at it on an hourly basis it becomes 99.5% to 0.5%.  I don't know how he comes up with those figures (pg. 126).  But, they are directionally interesting.  Thus, Taleb thinks it is a waste of time to watch the stock market on an hourly or even daily basis.  Taleb debunks the merit of Big Data.  The more variables you look at the exponentially more spurious correlations you will get (pg. 419).  This is a case of a rising convex curve with negative effect.  \\"Modernity provides too many variables... and the spurious relationships grow much, much faster than real information, as noise is convex and information is concave\\" (pg. 420).  Taleb does not vest much in 95% confidence intervals.  What matters for him is the consequence when you fall outside the confidence interval.  If a plane takes off 95% of the time on time.  That's pretty good.  If the plane does not crash 99% of the time, that feels like a suicidal mission (1 time out of a 100 you'll be dead).  So, the probabilities in absence of their consequences are meaningless (pg 260).<br /><br />Just as in [[ASIN:081297381X The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: \\"On Robustness and Fragility\\"]] Taleb rejects the entire body of modern finance.  In \\"The Black Swan\\" he did it by stating that the Normal distribution generates inadequately thin tails and understates the probability of rare events.  Now, he adds additional arguments.  And, that is that Harry Markowitz comes up with the prerequisite parameters of the Normal distribution namely the standard deviation and the mean.  But, ignores an error term in each.  \\"If these parameters need to be estimated, with an error, then the derivations need to be written differently and... we would have no Markowitz paper, no blowups, no modern finance\\" (pg. 447).  Taleb further attacks Markowitz portfolio theory because of its reliance on static correlations between investments.  Correlations change all the time, and typically go way up during downturns which eliminates Markowitz diversification benefit just when you need it.  Per Taleb, Markowitz portfolio theory causes investors to overallocate to risky asset classes.  He further advances that Markowitz does not use his own portfolio theory to manage his own investments.  Instead, he uses a simpler but more sophisticated method similar to the one recommended by Mandelbrot and himself (Taleb) (pg. 397).  On page 220 and 221, Taleb criticizes Myron Scholes and Robert Merton for getting Nobel prizes for their option formula that others discovered in more sophisticated form before them (but he does not mention who they are).  On the same pages, he criticizes Mark Rubinstein for attributing techniques to professors in the 1990s that \\"we as practicioners used in more sophisticated forms in the 1980s\\".<br /><br />Taleb attacks a lot more people than just Markowitz and company.  Often his attacks are well grounded; sometimes they are less so.  He attacks Thomas Friedman because his influential columns helped cause the Iraq war.  He also criticizes his book \\"The World is flat\\" for promoting globalization without realizing that globalization increases worldwide systemic risks (pg. 386).  Taleb has much intellectual contempt for Paul Krugman because he does not understand the weaknesses in the argument of \\"comparative advantage\\" that causes countries to become excessively reliant on the exports of a few commodities (pg. 449).  He similarly attacks David Ricardo who came up with this original theory (pg. 212).  Taleb roasts Joseph Stiglitz for stating in 2008 that Fannie Mae's probability of failure was effectively zero (Fannie Mae was taken over by the government months shortly after) and for the same Stiglitz to write in 2010 on how he had predicted the 2007-2008 financial crisis (pg. 389).  Taleb defines the \\"Joseph Stiglitz problem\\"... \\"Mental cherry-picking, leading to contributing to the cause of a crisis while being convinced of the opposite-and thinking he predicted it\\" (pg. 432).  That's actually Taleb's most convincing attack (the Stiglitz problem).<br /><br />So, who does Taleb like? Steve Jobs.  He is the one person that Taleb adulates.  He refers to him at length four times throughout the book always in anthological fashion.  He likes Job because he was anti-establishment, without academic credentials, autodidact, visionary, aesthete and artisan in temperament.  It is easy to agree with Taleb on those counts.<br /><br />Taleb is at his best when criticizing modern medicine (chapters 21 and 22).  Somehow his convex-concave framework allows him to analyze well where medicine overtreats and overdiagnozes.  As mentioned earlier, treatment benefits are nonlinear.  It is all in the dosage.  Medicine has an intervention bias.  Doing something (vs nothing) is almost a requirement for defensive purposes (preventing malpractice suits).  Medical interventions are also a response to powerful lucrative economic incentives.  This medical mindset has created the medicalization of many normal conditions.  For instance, the threshold for hypertension and high cholesterol levels have been chronically reduced so a rising portion of the population can be counted as prospective patients for related prescription drugs.  Yet, the benefits of those drugs are convex to the severity of those conditions.  This means that patients with near normal conditions will not be helped by those drugs and may be hurt by their long term side effects.  It is only for patients with more severe conditions that such drugs may be beneficial.  Although, Taleb mentions that reducing markers metrics (cholesterol, high blood pressure) does not always correspond<br /><br />Taleb has much scorn for any monetary and fiscal policy interventions.  Even though Taleb starts from the same place as John Maynard Keynes that the future is unpredictable.  They tackle this uncertainty completely differently.  Keynes propose expansive government policies (both fiscal and monetary) to shore up economies during downturns.  Taleb recommends the government to do very little and for individuals and companies to deal with uncertainty by managing their exposure to it (convex vs concave framework).  Taleb acknowledge he has an obsessive stance against any government debt at all (pg. 53) and wishes governments never borrowed and always balanced their Budget (pg. 286).  On page 101, he lauds George Cooper's [[ASIN:1906659575 The Origin of Financial Crises]] who damned the Fed for all the wrong reasons and did not understand that its role is to manage inflation and unemployment rate levels.  Taleb also criticizes Bernanke for his \\"Great Moderation\\" statement less than a year before the onset of the financial crisis.  But, he does not give credit to Bernanke for very quickly changing course and coming up with creative expansive monetary policies to prevent the Great Recession from turning into the Great Depression II.  On page 303, Taleb indicates that government interventions almost always end in disaster.  He got his timing wrong.  Disastrous economic shocks occur first, and government interventions to mitigate those disasters kick in second.  Additionally, if governments truly never borrowed and central banks never conducted expansive monetary policies the world's capital creation over the past couple of centuries would be a small fraction of what it is today.  Economic growth for centuries prior to this recent modern era was minimal (&lt;0.5% per year).  With the advent of modern government policies economies have grown far faster.<br /><br />Many of Taleb's other arguments are weak.<br /><br />His entire section on city-states being stronger than larger countries is less than convincing.  On page 87, he lauds Switzerland for having a decentralized government with much power vested in its Cantons.  But, this government model is not that different from Spain's regional governments set up that has currently turned into a fiscal disaster.  The Swiss successes has to do with a lot more than its Canton governments.  Later, he advances that Switzerland has been very successful with a very low level of formal education.  That's wrong.  Switzerland has a high level of formal education with 31.3% of its population having an associate college degree or higher.  That is much higher than the OECD average of 27.5%, the European Union average of 24.5%, Germany's 24.3%, and Italy's 13.6% (source OECD 2009).<br /><br />Along the same line, (pg. 90) he states \\"thankfully, the European Union is legally protected from overcentralization.\\"  That makes little sense since the European Union is a uniquely centralized supranational government by definition.  On page 97, Taleb somewhat contradicts himself by stating \\"until recent history, the central state represented about 5% of the economy compared to about 10 times that share in Modern Europe.\\"<br /><br />As an example of fiscal austerity, he mentions Sweden (pg. 131) \\"which responded admirably with a policy of fiscal toughness\\" in response to a severe recession in the early 1990s.  But that is the opposite of what occurred.  Sweden undertook unprecedented expansive fiscal policies associated with huge Budget deficits (12% of GDP in 1993, 9% in 1994).  And, it has been praised as a model of drastic fiscal intervention to fend off major economic downturns and avoid the nearly three decade long Japanese malaise.  Granted, Sweden shored up its fiscal position later much after it had mitigated its recession.<br /><br />When it comes to investment strategy Taleb struggles to make an implementable recommendation.  He recommends investing 90% in very safe assets such as Treasuries and 10% in highly risky assets with massive upside (convex antifragile) (pg. 161).  Here, I understand he is talking of Puts on stock indices that are way out of the money.  Those would become very lucrative in a market crash.  However, he recognizes that such financial options are now very expensive (pg. 175).  He reiterates that such options are very expensive like insurance contracts (pg. 183).  Therefore, it does seem more like an insurance strategy than a viable long term investment strategy to create wealth.  That's because your portfolio will lose purchasing power every single year until a market crash.  Let's say if you live in California, it may be good to buy earthquake insurance to protect your home from a related disaster.  But, this is not an attractive investment strategy.<br /><br />This is an interesting but very uneven book.  It does make you think.  But, it has few pragmatic advice.  If you are interested in such subjects, Nate Silver's [[ASIN:159420411X The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail-but Some Don't]] is a far more coherent book.  I also strongly recommend Richard Bookstaber's [[ASIN:0470393750 A Demon of Our Own Design: Markets, Hedge Funds, and the Perils of Financial Innovation]].  The latter describes in precise details why our financial system is so \\"fragile.\\"  It is a prescient book written before the financial crisis that anticipated many of the reasons why the system would crash (leverage, liquidity, regulatory, and complexity issues).

034580404X|5.0|I was on a plane to Chicago, sitting between two ordinary-seeming women who both happened to be reading Fifty Shades. I had heard of the title, but knew nothing about the book. I, clueless male that I am, figured it must be some harmless Harry Potter-like fiction.<br /><br />After every chapter, the woman seated to my right would gently close the cover, recline her seat, and shut her eyes. After a few minutes, she'd slowly bring her seat upright, exhale creepily, exchange a grin/giggle with the woman to my left, and then read the next chapter.<br /><br />You can imagine my horror when, later at the hotel, I opened the book's Wikipedia page.<br /><br />But on the plane ride home, I had the first Fifty Shades in my lap and a highlighter in my hand. I was going to get to the bottom of this.<br /><br />***<br /><br />The criticism of these books has been ruthless and relentless, sometimes hilariously so.

B008OOYALE|1.0|This games was fun at first but its too expensive. You can't even get any of the dragons after the air dragon because you have to spend too much money to get the gold and when your friends send you gold you can't even use them. If they would drop the price on the gold and the dragons it would be a good game but for now I would rather play their other games.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun but frustrating. Did I miss the instructions?  Have questions regarding all of rules of the game. Where can I find them?  Still learning how to use my kindle!  Will not give up...
B005LAJ212|5.0|I LOVE this show & I am a 52yr.old male. :-)<br />It really hooks you & does not let go!<br />I could watch it all day (if I had the time)<br />Very well done! One of my favorite new shows. BRAVO!
B008S80OU2|5.0|Here it is, everything Sony thinks I need from Blue Oyster Cult's Columbia years including Imaginos (and I honestly didn't think I would see the day that would happen).  Yet here it is in my shaking, expectant hands.  Well, was it worth it, all said and done?  For the true fan or someone super ambitious just starting out, a confident YES.  [Note - I'm going to give this a really good listen to and comparison with the originals, remasters, etc that I have before discussing anything about sound quality].<br /><br />For someone looking for a collection of some Blue Oyster Cult songs, there are better alternatives out there.  However, rather than buying one of their greatest hits, picking up \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", giving in to \\"Agents of Fortune\\", thinking that \\"Spectres\\" is worth the purchase, discovering \\"Cultosaurus Erectus\\" in all its magnificence, seeing the glory of \\"Secret Treaties\\" and all that is early BOC, and finally slowly but surely picking up every album including \\"Club Ninja\\" 'just to have' but later 'really liking it in a way that's hard to explain' ... rather than all of that, are you really that afraid of a little commitment up front?  If so, go ahead and start with a greatest hits or \\"Agents\\" - that's the way many of us have done it so, so many years ago, and there's nothing wrong with that.  You'll be back for this one, though, and it will be here just for you.<br /><br />Opening up the box, I found the packaging to be very attractive.  The box holds all of the \\"mini albums\\" perfectly along with the thick soft cover booklet.  Each album is a pseudo replica of the original album - front and back, all original artwork, tracks listed as side A and B on the back, matching labels along the spine of each album that look quite handsome all together, and all of the colors are matched as closely to each album as I can remember (I had a copy of every record album that's here except for the two extras discs).  Pseudo meaning that there is a white border around every front and back image.  This gives you the whole image (so it can be viewed in its entirety), but it is different than the original LPs.  They are still very attractive IMHO.<br /><br />The quality of print is very reasonable, and it's possible to read the small text printed on the back (just barely in some cases).  I compared the quality of \\"Spectres\\", \\"Blue Oyster Cult\\", and \\"Tyranny and Mutation\\" to the remastered version's artwork.  The printing on the early remasters has a slight edge over the boxed set.  Please keep in mind that the artwork appears to be off of the original LPs, so the text has not been modified to today's digital standards to a larger and more readable font (especially the back covers).  A few of the covers on the back have the text \\"This is a facsimile of the original LP jacket\\" on them - \\"BOC\\", \\"Tyranny\\", \\"Secret Treaties\\", \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", and \\"Spectres\\".  This text snippet appears because all of these albums have additional bonus tracks (and therefore the original release backcover artwork will not list all of the tracks found).<br /><br />The CD Labels themselves have full color printing, and most look just like the old red with black lettering Columbia inner record label EXCEPT \\"Mirrors\\" (color picture), \\"Some Enchanted Evening DVD\\" (color picture), \\"On Your Feet\\" (color picture), \\"Secret Treaties\\" (black label with red text), \\"Tyranny\\" (half red, half black), \\"Rarities\\" (symbols included), and \\"Best of Broadcast\\" (chronos symbol with some silver text).  They also are very attractive, much more attractive than the silver CD with black text normal CDs have.  The songs aren't listed on the labels, but with records have two sides, this would have been difficult to reproduce on a one-sided CD. I wonder who uses those CD based song lists anymore with the computer able to find the song titles automatically.  Did someone at one time actually pull out the CD to read the label?  Have we come that far as a society to move past that kind of silly-ness (\\"yeah, anyone mind if I stop this party to read what this song is\\" ... awkward)?  Well, good for society, then.<br /><br />The newly remastered CDs do NOT have any new or bonus tracks.  However, the additional \\"Rarities\\" and \\"Broadcasts\\" CDs could easily have been included by Sony just for that reason.  It's all good, and the CDs contain tracks that fans have long waited for such as demos for the \\"Teachers\\" soundtrack.  The \\"Rarities\\" CD mostly contains live tracks.  The ONLY real gripe I have about content is that the Stephen King Intro version(s) of Astronomy (from the Imaginos Astronomy CD single, very rare) are NOT included here.  The actual Stephen King intro IS included, so I guess it's possible to recreate one.  The Astronomy UK Wild Mix is also not included.  Very minor but still official releases.  The \\"Broadcasts\\" CD has quality copies of \\"Wings of Mercury\\" and \\"It's Not Easy\\" which have been difficult to find until now.<br /><br />The internet website is now up for downloading the four live shows, and the audio files are 320 mp3 (there are high quality mp3's).  Some true enthusiasts may have preferred lossless flac, but their inclusion as a bonus at all is very welcome.  Very.  The live show set, dubbed \\"Harvester of Lives\\", consists of the following:<br /><br />Disc 1 - 1980 Old Waldorf show from San Francisco CA (Part 1)<br />01 - Intro Dr. Music<br />02 - Lips in the Hills<br />03 - Unknown Tongue<br />04 - Cities On Flame<br />05 - Marshall Plan<br />06 - Divine Wind<br />07 - Last Days Of May<br />08 - It's Not Easy<br /><br />Disc 2 - 1980 Old Waldorf show from San Francisco CA (Part 2)<br />01 - Me262<br />02 - Black Blade<br />03 - Godzilla<br />04 - 5 Guitar Medley<br />05 - Born to be Wild<br />06 - Arthur Comics<br />07 - Roadhouse Blues<br />08 - (Don't Fear) The Reaper<br /><br />Disc 3 - 1981 Bonds International Casino show from NYC<br />01 - Dr. Music<br />02 - Burnin' For You<br />03 - Fire Of Unknown Origin<br />04 - Joan Crawford<br />05 - Veteran Of The Psychic Wars<br />06 - Hot Rails To Hell<br />07 - ME-262<br />08 - (Don't Fear) The Reaper<br />09 - Godzilla<br />10 - Born To Be Wild<br />11 - 5 Guitars<br />12 - Roadhouse Blues<br /><br />Disc 4 - 1983 Perkins Palace show from Pasadena CA<br />01 - Intro / Stairway To The Stars<br />02 - Harvester Of Eyes<br />03 - Workshop Of The Telescopes<br />04 - Before The Kiss, A Redcap<br />05 - Born To Rock<br />06 - Hot Rails To Hell<br />07 - Seven Screaming Dizbusters<br />08 - Cities On Flame With Rock & Roll<br />09 - Burning For You<br />10 - Joan Crawford<br />11 - Born To Be Wild<br />12 - (Don't Fear) The Reaper<br />13 - Roadhouse Blues<br /><br />Disc 5 - 1986 Santa Monica Civic Auditorium CA<br />01 - R.

They are high quality recordings, and they appear to be released \\"as is\\".  There is little if any mastering or remastering, but they are fine as is.

Listening to \\"Mirrors\\", \\"Imaginos\\", \\"Club Ninja\\", \\"The Revolution\\", and \\"Fire of Unknown Origin\\" softer songs such as \\"The Vigil\\" and \\"Perfect Water\\" have crisp and clean notes with more audible background music.

Punchier songs like \\"The Siege and Investiture of Baron von Frankenstein's Castle at Weisseria\\" (I just love typing that out, excuse me) and \\"Veins\\" still have their punch with a less muddy sound.  There is more distinction with, well, pretty much everything.<br /><br />\\"On Your Feet\\" or \\"ETL\\" could easily have been improperly remastered, and sadly, I would have forgiven them - it's a monumental task, really, that couldn't possibly please every fan.  There were high expectations with these live performance remasters considering their great performances and set lists.  \\"On Your Feet\\" is the true gem in this package.  Sony will hopefully, eventually, offer at least this diamond as a separate purchase - this right here alone can draw in new BOC fans.  It's quite possibly the killer app - it alone can justify the cost of the whole package.

B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I never had this happen before... it says I can't install on my device. Really wanted to check it out before I bought the full version. Glad I did it this way, I wouldn't have been able to install after paying for it. I'm sure the game play is great but giving it 1 star for not installing.
0571195121|2.0|I ordered this book over a month ago. Well before the hurricane and still have not received the order. It was a very low price. I have owned the book before. I thought it was funny and cute, not able to find it from storage I re purchased it. I give the book itself five stars. I can only give the purchase two stars because I have not received the book or any information reguarding it from the seller except the email of purchase.
B007SGM084|5.0|absolutely amazing and makes me wonder if there are more to come with fifty shades...I will definitely pass on for more readers.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my little boy loves this game, he plays it everyday.  Something. I have noticed is there hasn't been a single error downloading content.
B007TMON8M|4.0|Played through the first couple of tasks.  No problems with the app, and it was a fun little game.  I didn't see anywhere that showed the amount of force in a part, or why exactlt it failed, and thought this would be nice, but can't have everything in an inexpensive app!
B00A3OI8MA|5.0|As if Season One wasn't good enough, Season Two has come along!  I absolutely LOVE Asylum and the way the writers brought in a few familiar faces along with tons of new characters and such a twisted, in depth story line.  Jessica Lange scares the snot out of me and I had no idea that James Cromwell could be so durn creepy.  Highly recommend for any horror fans, there is something for everyone here!
B004JRVQX0|1.0|After reading many reviews on multiple forums it is quite apparant that ilok do not care at all about the customers..<br /><br />If you see some software that you would wish to purchase, but requires iLok, do two things.<br /><br />1. send a polite email to the vendor explaining that you will not pay a third party for the right to use their software and you will be purchasing a competing product.<br />2. Buy software that does not require iLok<br /><br />There are always alternatives.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Very enjoyable movie.  Good story and good screen presence by the actors, most of them new and upcoming.  Can't help being impressed by the \\"can do\\" messgae being sent.  Good mixture of comedy and drama.  Well worth the cost.
B00A2MHX4C|5.0|This episode could stand on its own.  I've watched it several times as it is more than a show but a bone tickler and the setting and props are very well done.  I think it is movie quality.  I love Castle and the bantering between Richard Castle, writer, and Beckett, detective. I originally started watch this program because I loved Nathan Fillion in the shows Serenity and Firefly.  This particular episode is about a science fiction convention and how it is discovered that Beckett while in college was heavy into Sci-Fi a particular show, similar to Star Trek.  This episode spoofs Firefly.  I can't tell you the end as it would spoil the hilarity you will enjoy.  So...funny...  I know I will watch it many more times as there is so much to enjoy.
0345803507|5.0|AWESOME!!  This was an excellent continuation of the first two books, Fifty Shades of Grey & Fifty Shades Darker.  The story continues and has twists and turns just like the first two books.<br /><br />I couldn't put the book down and read every chance I could!  I am so anxious for the series to continue!<br /><br />All I can say is this was fantastic!!  Hurry with the next book Ms. James!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Carries on where the first book left off and is just as good as the first. Gideon Cross is so alluring. I can't wait to continue to read this series.
0307887960|4.0|My doctor recommended this book to me and I must say that so far so great! I've only been on it for less than a week and already lost 9lbs and getting compliments :)
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I have used this product to create training programs at work and it works great. It interfaces well with Microsoft Office and transferring files for printing is a breeze. Powerful formatting tools makes this the nicest portable app with a Tablet I have encountered.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found this book amazing!  Keeping in mind this book is fiction and maybe a little far fetched, I found myself a little giddy reading it.  It is, without a doubt, a life that any woman would love to have.  A rich man, beauty and a great sex life!<br /><br />I loved this book from cover to cover!  It took me away from the stresses of my day and brought me into a fairy tale life one can only dream about!<br /><br />This book has a sweet story, heart aching, passion and erotica all through out the book!  If every woman could climax like Anastasia, what a life that would be!  Christian Grey is the man we all dream of. This story is heart warming and truly enjoyable to read!<br /><br />.
B001HN697M|4.0|Really liked how it told the back story even without Kate.  Would definitely recommend to anyone that enjoyed the other movies.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|This is a wonderful and very relevent soundtrack.The juxtapostion of the orchestral with elecro-acoustic percussion and sonic imagery is as good as it gets.Any one familiar with the musical history of the Bond movies will hear references to the classic themes of Bond done in a fresh and modern way.Clocking in at 77 minutes  this is robust and well thought out presentation.Skyfall stands on its own as a great homage to a very successful franchise and is a perfect persentation of exciting modern music for these uncertain times.From the first orchestral stab to start this CD to the end you will not be dissapointed and do not be misled by other commments.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This works like a charm to free up space being chewed up by junk basically. It removes garbage from several different areas on my Tablet, increasing performance and speed.
0307341577|2.0|I liked Gone Girl and also Sharp Edges, although some scenes were a little much for me. Dark Places was more of a horror piece, I thought, and I was glad to finish it.  I think the author writes well and these psychological thrillers are well done. This was just a little too \\"dark\\" for me.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|This was an ok movie; however felt it could have been better.  Wasn't real impressed with the daughter, didn't know what I expected but felt she should of had more personality.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I let a man borrow this book and forgot about it just before a move. Every time I look at my relatively small collection of books, I miss this one. I am buying the kindle edition today to replace it. Amazing story of a battle I never thought was possible. The sheer amount of combatants that were faced was incredible. My favorite piece is how powerful the promise is from a village leader in the story. Buy it and add it to your military shelf.
6305428042|5.0|Best halloween movie of all time!!! A must have! Not scary at all. Perfect movie for families with children. It is easily a halloween tradition
0525952926|5.0|This is the kind of book you don't want to put down.  As you read it you fall in love with the characters and are sorry when it ends. I am very glad there is a sequel.  Congratulations Ken Follett.  Another fantastic book.<br />I particularly think history buffs will love this, especially those interested in WWII.
B002QS1O36|4.0|It's raw, it's sexy, it's lush, it's romantic, and, yes, just a little pretentious. Phantom the movie is straight-out fabulous.<br /><br />While a movie by its very nature lacks the immediacy and energy of a stage production, it also allows for nuances that are impossible on stage. \\"Phantom\\" takes advantage of these possibilities. The backstage life of the Opera, the outdoor scenes, the ability to go into tight focus then pull back, are all part of the movie's strengths. If Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler lack the classic voices of the stage, they more than make up for it in looks. (Especially Gerard Butler. Mmmm.) Film is, after all, a visual medium.<br /><br />The costumes are wonderful, the choreography breathtaking--I love this movie!
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I have been a very big Porcupine Tree fan from almost the beginning.  I love every one of their albums.  I have enjoyed both of Steve Wilson's solo albums, but not sure I fully apprecited them until I viewed this DVD.  This is an amazing concert video covering Steve's 2 solo CD's. The musicians are amazing as they reproduce perfectly what I thought could only be done in the studio.  Lots of unique instruments.  Reminds me a bit of the double trio King Crimson Days.  They have an amazing clear curtain that has images projected onto it.  Very cool effect.  There are just so many cool moments.  Wish I could have seen this show live.  I highly recommend this concert video for those that appreciate an improv style of Progressive modern rock.  Steve Wilson is a genious!  I purchased the Bluray version, and I would say the video quality is very good but the audio is amazing.  If in doubt, just buy this DVD or Bluray.  I can't imagine how you could be anything but blown away when you watch it.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|I read this over a week when i had time on my hands. Really great story and managed to put a lot of the narrative of the Great war into perspective. I knew a lot of individual things beforehand but this made it really flow, a great read
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I learned allot, smiled allot and enjoyed the story line.  Allan in my friend now as well....oh to see so much change in a lifetime.
B0018QQQK8|2.0|Another amazing book by Nicholas Sparks. Inspiring book about heartache and determination and true love. Definitely worth reading not once but over and over again
B0096HIEE2|1.0|I dont recommend this movie, sucked!!!! I lost all respect for the actors in this movie. I cant bring myself to watch anything that they are in.
B003HC8ITI|5.0|The included framed collectible is as exactly as it appears in the picture. The size is also proportionate to what is pictured as well. This is a gorgeous framed set with three photos from the movie with three original frames from the movie on the right of the photos. The photos on the left of the frame are the same as pictured. The original frames included are the only things that vary. I was impressed. The certificate of authentication adds a nice touch. Great collectible and going to be a great xmas gift for our family movie buff.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A must read.  I love the characters in this series.  Their story is so intense and in some ways tragic.  I have read the 50 Shades of Grey series and I am a huge Christian fan, but....I have to say if Gideon and Christian were standing side by side it would have to be Gideon for me.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved it! I have recommended the book to all of my friends. Will definitely use this as a read a loud in class!
B007REV4T8|1.0|Never been much of a Bond fan, but Daniel Craig has completely ruined the franchise. He's a terrible actor, and making the series into a bourne rip-off has made me completely hate the franchise. Skyfall is not worth watching. Trust me when I tell you this!
1577314808|5.0|this book explains to me what happened when I lived in india and studied for the yoga acharya training... I got a mantra from my swami and had to repeat it for 2 hours ..... and every day within a few months during my daily meditation sessions;<br /><br />even on the very first day I felt a very pleasant feeling, like I could touch the light, everything became very clear and \\"slow\\" .... this experience lasted for months, I had sakshi bav (sanskrit - witness state) experience: slowly I detached more and more from my own thinking, emotions, body and mind; I became an observer, watching myself like a DVD - doing my yoga exercises, drinking my tea, talking to a swami or driving to the village with a riksha .....<br /><br />the book \\"the power of now\\" explains in detail what happened to me - it is a practical approach of experiencing the \\"SO HUM\\" .... I am that .... I am atman .... mantra, it will be hard to understand for any reader who did not have such an experience of instant bliss and peace, while every fisherman, yogi, outdoor fan e.g. ... might begin to understand what exaclty makes them happy in their life and how to avoid to get caught in mindgames, competition, suffering and \\"past and future\\" thinking;<br /><br />you cant analyse this book with your mind - otherwise you will come to the result that it is rubbish - how should a victim of an earthquake, a mother of 5 children, someone about to die e.g. .... experience peace by just stop thinking na dbe in \\"here and now\\" .....<br /><br />this book works pretty much like a zen instruction book, it will appeal to those who have already experienced at least a glimpse of what tolle is talking about;<br /><br />beside books like shankaracharia s - tattva bodha, vivekanandas complete works, the yoga sutras of patanjali, some meditation and yoga books - it might heklp to understand the secret of meditation, awareness and how consciousness is beyond mind and body;<br /><br />---<br /><br />very important: tolle describesONLY the witness state - which he calls the egoless state - this is NOT enlightment, samadhi or nirvana!!! it is just the beginning, for those interested in what enlightment is - read the yoga sutras of patanjali, understand, concentration, dharana, pratyahara, true meditation and finally samyama; sakshi bav (witness state) can be achieved within days, yet it is NOT even close to the state the masters call enlightment as there are 6 stages of samadhi, and only the last one is a permanent state of consciousness and self realisation, whereas the witness state is temporarily, a nice discovery but not the ultimate \\"self\\" realisation - eckart tolle seem to think it is;<br /><br />also on the inner planes one can become \\"lucid\\" and aware, it might begin with lucid dreams, out of body experiences and might get to visions about flying through inner planes; one day I experienced a state of mind out of any form, where I knew anything, it seemed that I stayed on this plane forever (today I know that it was a timeless/formless plane) and when I finally returned to by body / mind existence I was hardly able to remember \\"who\\" I was within this life ... tolles exercise can lead to these experiences if one is persistent through many years and practises raja yoga, japa mala meditation, mantras or kundalini videya / vedanta - or alternativley zen budhism;
B008S80OU2|5.0|Yes the download link does not work. Don't most of us already have these shows? I have 3 of the 4. They have all been released in bootleg form on real cds people. Shadow Warriors from '86, Tales Of The Psychic Wars 2 disc set from '81 and '83, and The Monster from '80.<br />That aside, this is a wonderful set! Don't take points off for packaging! Come on! We are soooo lucky to even get this in this world of dying cds. I took my original covers from the remasters and just slipped them in the box. All liner notes and pics including Fire and Imaginos. Not rocket science especially for BOC fans.<br />The remasters sound amazing! Bonus material is quite fun to hear. Note - If you wish to rip these into your computer you will need to punch in the album title and songs on most of these. I do not believe many of the newer remasters were encoded with info.<br />The sleeves are not as flimsy as some have said. Mirrors and Revolution look way better than the cheap Sony Collector's choice originals. Better artwork. Just be careful folks! Really a dream come true after so many years waiting! Remasters oh yes!<br />BTW Club Ninja was a good '80's rock album and sounds great remastered. The so called BOC purists balk at it and balk at Imaginos. Whatever. Seen them 8 times after the Bouchard brothers. Albert was kicked out remember?? These are the \\"fans\\" who did not purchase Heaven Forbid, Bad Channels, Cult Classic, The Curse Of The Hidden Mirror, or A Long Day's Night. The tattoo on my arm is a testament to my undying love for BOC! In all their forms! And yes the Imaginos remaster is wonderful! On tour forever! Also for the die hards Live 1976 on Castle records. There ya go the whole shabang!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|From the trailer, this looked like it would be the most amazing movie ever, and, I have to say, it was pretty damn good.  I think the problem was the trailer set the wrong expectation for people.  This isn't an action flick; the movie is more introspective than most, and demands a certain level of attention span.  I think it was just different than people expected, and that's why it was not as successful as people thought it would be.<br /><br />Personally, I loved it.
B008NABUU8|1.0|Game loaded upside down, didn't think that was actually possible. Totally useless when the game your trying to play will only appear on screen upside down.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I absolutely love this album. Every song is mesmerizing and insightful. It has a very cohesive sound and it is very versatile. I listen to it when I run, when I drive, and when I want to chill out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The story of this book was wonderful. The entire series was much better then was described to me. I was impressed that a book could not only have a different and intense story line but also be beyond dirty and literally make you squirm in your seat with the desire. Going beyond normal bounds and braking the mold. I couldn't help but love this book. I would really enjoy a 4th on the life they lived till they grow old and die. I feel she, the author, did women a favor  by opening up the un talked about world of bedroom play. Though I don't partake in a lot of the things she talks about I enjoy the ideas and would consider them now more so then before. Above all though the love story was the best part. To show a man so in love with a women and open up and a women be loving and soft and yet bold and sure. That was nice. Also the personality changes in him and how to deal and understand was unique and enlightening as well. All in all a wonderful must read!
B008NB0SQO|1.0|Charles Dickens' \\"Christmas Carol\\" has been told through so many different forms and versions, it can get tiring at times; but there is one version that stands above others: \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol.\\" What sets this movie above all other versions?<br /><br />One song: \\"When Love Is Gone,\\" the turning point for Scrooge. It is one of the most beautiful, heartstring-pulling songs you'll ever hear, and yes, in a Muppet movie. For many of us (the majority), this song is absolutely essential--crucial--to providing a complete and deep re-telling of the Dickens classic.<br /><br />So after holding this version of \\"The Christmas Carol\\" above all other versions, why am I giving it a 1-star review? For one simple reason: this pivotal song is CUT from the 2005 and *now* 2012 releases. Disney had 7 years to gather and listen to feedback from their previous release and make corrections as necessary. And what did Disney do? They gave us an HD version of the 2005 version.<br /><br />The 2012 release was a chance to get it *right*. And Disney screwed up...again. Needless to say, I'm joining a large group of boycotters and hoping the next release will be in five years or less (25th anniversary edition, anyone?).<br /><br />And meanwhile, the price of the laserdisc, VHS, and 2002 DVD versions continue to rise...
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I was not going to purchase this book because Book Two left much to be desired.  However, it is worth the wait and back on track with Book One which I also enjoyed.  Some parts get a bit too much 'fantasy' and out of touch with reality, but the plot makes you want to continue to see what is going to happpen to Mr. Gray.<br />It makes you understand that rich people have problems too.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this, one of Kate Morton's best. The blackout in London is a fascinating setting, and the idea of finding out your mother isn't who you thought she was is a great hook.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Still after 36 years and numerous incarnations, Gene and Paul still have what it takes to put together a fist in the air album.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I play this game very often.  Enjoy the graphics but the constant music drives everyone around me Crazy.  The tile designs are easy to find for quick matching.
B004SBX112|3.0|just updated and lost all my stars and all three games! I have no stars and the new halloween game is gone along with the 2011 version. I paid for it now lost everything!! annoyed to say the least.
0307346617|3.0|I understand the writing style is different, but it left a lot to be desired. In this style you get a lot of the author telling you instead of showing you. No character development. All the characters talk the same, there is very little to distinguish between one character and another other than the page breaks. That is what it is though, literally an oral history.<br /><br />****Minor Spoilers****<br /><br />I did enjoy some of the new ideas such as the survivors on the submarine and the thought of the zombies still coming for you without hands, impaling you with their own bones. It was exciting getting a \\"new\\" zombie story without all the same clich&eacute;s. The interview with the handler left me wanting for more, that was one chapter that I felt actually leapt from the pages and actually showed some soul and insight into one of the characters.<br /><br />Fun read!
B009AJD5E0|1.0|Stupid plot.  Ridiculous screenplay.  Murky cinematography.  And some of the worst acting I've ever seen.  Noomi Papace is a very, very unattractive and untalented actress.  Charlize Theron was pathetic.  It's rare for me to say I really hated a film, but I really hated this one.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Saw a free online episode of Episode 1, Season 2 and I was hooked - so I started looking where I could view/purchase Season 1.  After looking at other sites, remembered Amazon and went there; purchased it and watched all of Season 1 episodes online during one weekend.  Great quality and experienced no problems watching them.  Will only use Amazon from now on for any time of purchase like this!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Recently flew for better than four hours, and Angry Bird Free kept me amused and engaged for the entire time.  It works on my tablet as well as cell phone.  The major frustration is the game itself in that one can't move ahead until one wins, and some of those darn piggies are hard to kill!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|It still has some issues that need to be ironed out, but overall, it's the best product out there for magazines.
B000VRH2CQ|5.0|This was the first Mingus album I ever heard, alongside with Black Saint & Sinner Lady, so as an entry point it has colored my later perception of the man's music. Maybe that's also why I love some of these versions of Mingus' older songs better than the originals. Of course, I might be disrespectful to the position of Mingus Ah Um in Mingus canon, but in my opinion the songs like \\"Theme for Lester Young\\" and \\"Better Git it in your soul\\" sound much more sinewy, muscular and unpredictable on this album.<br /><br />I also feel that this version of \\"II B.S.\\" wins in intensity all the previous incarnations of the song. \\"Mood Indigo\\" heard here is a very evocative, sensitive reading, also in sound quality. On Mingus x 5 there's a HUGE band playing: tuba, trombone, 2 trumpets and 4 saxes + rhythm section. Yet all these instruments are there for a reason. They create a living, sprawling network of counterthemes, rhythmic accents, they color and comment. The musicians play with the fire and joy of old New Orleans jazz, swinging but with a meaning.<br /><br />Mingus could make just a few horns sound like a full-blown orchestra (check out Tijuana Moods for proof), but here he squeezes out everything he can from his bandmates. Yet there's nothing bloated or unnecessary in the adaptations. Highly recommended.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This headset is the best I have ever used. I love it and would definitely recommend it to friends. For those wondering if it can work with bluetooth on a computer the answer is yes it does. Really love the ability to place and answer calls while gaming. The range on this device is also really good, I can walk anywhere in my house while still chatting with my friends on xbox live even if I leave my controller in my room.    The headset is a little pricy, but if you can afford it you won't be disappointed.    If you would like to see the headset in depth check out my video review [...]

B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is an excellent read for all present and future Captains.  It is exciting and packed full of information on survival.  It is a bible for prparedness and expectation.  The author has a done a tremendous amount of homework in order to portray a lifelike situation.  It is a true to life portrayal of survival even with a tiger as an unwanted guest.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This author was skeptical of heaven when he suffered his illness.  Seeing life after death, or life during coma, is an insightful description from a physician's point of view.  Other after-life books written by non-physicians provide beautiful insights for readers, this author takes the reader through \\"the worm view\\" into the heavenly realm.  His writing style is what one might expect from a physician, descriptive rather than poetic.  But his descriptions have motivated me to read it twice...maybe more.  An excellent, thought provoking book.  I recommend it to every reader...believer and non-believer.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|love my kindle fire...it brings reading this book to a whole new level of easy. Some might be daunted by the length of the book or that it is part of a series, however it stands by itself as a story too. I am looking forward to the last book in the series too.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is way more then a quick time passer. I find myself looking forward to hatching more dragons (there is an endless supply)  and expanding my dragon property. I love how the dragons change as they grow up. definately reccomend for all ages

B0084B5TK8|5.0|DRACULA by Bram Stoker as offered on Amazon.com as a free edition, is a delightful read. Since I like very descriptive prose, the details as seen through the eyes, thoughts and emotions of the characters create a suspenseful journey into the world of yesteryear hundreds of years ago. I read some of the critiques by some readers, and whether or not the \\"interpretation or modernization\\" of Bram Stokers original text was altered to their disappointment, that would be sad for they wouldn't enjoy this version.<br /><br />As for me, I am neither a literary genius nor am I a historian so this modernized English version (if that is what the critques say)works fine for me. I would rather comprehend what was being said and let the story tell itself with all the descriptive suspense, action, and lust that appeals to both men, women and anyone else who has always enjoyed a good Dracula \\"story\\". Actually, I don't mean to sound chauvanistic but the first encounter with the first three female vampires was totally and beautifully lustful.<br /><br />I'm not done with this book yet, since I've just begun reading but I look forward to more great reading until the very end.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book for a casual read? Droool, Droool, Bite, Bite, yikes, yikes, Ooooh my YES!!!<br /><br />Dracula by Bram Stoker stokes!!
B009YU9J0E|4.0|Although this is not the lengthy, pulsating, driven, and at times bewildering chaos that made (II) such a massive follow-up to (I), (III) stands its ground. True to their nature, Ethan and Alice have made a spasmodic and rapturous collection of tunes to throw into the vault. Tonally and thematically their most cohesive album, by no means can the same be said for flow or structure. These are separate tracks that speak of discord, trauma, beauty, and violence. Alice is more muted and twisted in her vocals, but it doesn't come off as childish. There is a method to the madness. I'm slowly falling in love with these songs as much as any of their other tracks, and if you're a fan, it probably won't take you too many listens to get into the album either.<br /><br />For people just coming into the fold, this may be a great introduction. There is emotion and emphasis sized down for the average listener whereas their first two albums can be over-whelming to take in at once.<br /><br />If anything I'm left, as always, wanting more from a duo who seem to try to give everything of themselves to their audience. Each album is a different monster. This monster seems to be hiding in the shadows- small, sharp, desperate, and willing to run away with you if you let it.
B008OOYALE|3.0|The dragons are really cute and they are fun to take care of but the game keeps locking up then you have to force close to unlock it. It takes to many coins to clear the land once you have expanded. I don't think the payout on your dragons is correct either. Needs a little fixing.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I am a fan of marvel comics so I could not wait for the movie to come out on DVD. It has action and comedy which helps to make it more enjoyable. I am ready for the next movie adventure.
0345803485|3.0|I, of course, am way behind the curve, but read the first 50 Shades yesterday .. here goes. Once upon a time there was a writer who wrote a love story, like a gazillion other writers, but she wanted to make a shit ton of money, so she went to Wikipedia (see how I did that? lol) and looked up some D/s info and kept a little, threw in a LOT of sex because that sells books, and she lived happily ever after. THE END P.S. From the titles of the other two books, I'm guessing she is going to have Miss Steele rescue Mr. Grey from his darker side so they too can live happily ever after.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I was waiting for a new Mumford album a few months after their debut album.  Personally, this does not top the first album, but it is a strong album and I love each song.  It is a great addition to my Mumford collection.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|If you follow the \\"Resident Evil\\" series you must add this one to the collection!  The action is great.  The storyline and characters continue to evolve as do the \\"Resident Evil\\" series of games.  Enjoy the carrnage!

B00973CGXK|5.0|I love the Killers.<br /><br />This latest album is awesome.  Almost every song is a winner.  Great power and emotion.  It has a vibe that I think Brandon Flowers pulled from his solo work.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is one of the best books I've ever read, with characters so haunting you find yourself thinking about them long after you've closed the book. The first thing I did when I finished was to search for other books by Diane Setterfield. None yet, but I'll be the first in line when her next book comes out.

0763644765|5.0|I read this to my 18 month old son and there is a page that says \\"Tinkle, Tinkle, Toot!\\"  He thought that was so funny and giggled so hard!! Immediately finishing the book... he said \\"Potty? Pants off?\\"  I took him over to his little potty and he sat there, but didn't do anything... but at least he was understanding the concept! The next night we read it again... and said \\"Potty?\\" So we took him to his little potty and he went! For 3 weeks now he goes in his potty every night before his bath! He loves this book and we read it everytime he is sitting on the potty now... he loves to say another phrase in the book \\"I DID IT!!\\" after he goes :D  Great book!! Highly recommend!
0446580848|3.0|My first DeMille book was 'The Lion's Game'.  I couldn't put that one down. But with 'The Panther' it reads smooth like the others, but the interest and engaging qualities found with 'The Lion's Game' was painfully or longingly absent.a good John I like the Corey books and I was thrillrd that Paul Brenner was in this book, but this was not my favotire DeMille book. I wanted more activity to keep you imbedded in the story. The background and history was interesting but i also would have liked to see more action. Hope this helps you make your reading decision. As always if you have any questions just ask me.
B00000DUE7|4.0|This CD collection does not contain the \\"complete sacred music of Antonio Vivaldi.\\"  Among those missing include the following works: Mass in C major, RV 586; Credo in G, RV 592; Credidi Propter Quod in C, RV 605; Lauda Jerusalem in E, RV 609; Magnificant in G, RV 611; and Intro in G, RV 636.  The latter pieces are available in Phillips' Vivaldi Sacred Choral Music, Volumes 1 -5 featuring the John Alldis Choir and English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Vittorio Negri.  Putting that disappointment aside, the collection is a great choice.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent reading, fresh and interesting. It presents the true experience of a doctor in honest, simple nd engaging terms. Great book for anyone who does not believe in the afterlife.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun games...some easy and some challenging. Great for short windows of play. Don't really like the 'earn coins to unlock games' concept.
145210655X|5.0|\\"Darth Vader and Son\\" is a very funny book.  What I like most about it is that it had me laughing first at the absurdity of  Vader & Luke having such regular experiences, and then I was laughing at the nature of the little discussions and dilemmas in father/son relationships in the perspective of the real world. The illustrations pulled me right into the different moments, and little 4 year-old Luke is adorable. I admit that there's a part of me that felt sad Vader (Anakin) and Luke never had the chance to enjoy such cute bonding sessions, but that sounds pretty crazy so I'll just leave it be.  This is a great gift item with the type of humor that stays fresh with each read.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|excellent book, full of adventure, excitement, history, travel guide, and insight into the thinking of soldiers, politicians, the greedy and zealots. A fascinating, absorbing and fun read.

B008TTPQXA|5.0|Eben Alexander's courageous and questioning account of his near death experience is fascinating and inspiring. A self confessed \\"Scientific sceptic\\" he admits to not believing in the existence God or an afterlife prior this experience. His years of writing scientific papers and giving presentations lead him to question rigorously his experiences. He knows there will be people who rubbish his account as unscientific. As he puts it \\"I know there will be people who will seek to invalidate my experience anyhow, and many who will discount it out of court, because of a refusal to believe that what I underwent could possibly be \\"scientific\\" - could possibly be more than a crazy feverish dream. But I know better. And both for the sake of those here on earth and those I met beyond this realm, I see it as my duty - both as a scientist and hence a seeker of truth, and as a doctor devoted to helping people - to make it known to as many people as I can that what I underwent is true, and real and of stunning importance. Not just to me, but to all of us.\\"<br />A great, and inspiring read.
0316228532|4.0|Looked at the initial reviews here on Amazon and did think twice about buying. My feeling was to \\"forget\\" the success of Harry Potter and act as if the author was new to me and give it a try. I enjoyed it...sure, some of it is sad and shows the darker side(s) of modern life....but it is a good read!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I read all three books one after the other. I'd rank as some of the best books I've read. The characterizations were genius. Grizzly war scenes and all. My favorites were the tag lines each character had, ie, body floating in the river... You'll understand if you read the books. Highly recommended.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I purchased The Racketeer for my Dad's Kindle recently.  Although I haven't read it myself yet, I notice that he rarely puts it down, which is a GOOD sign!  I'll have to be next in line!

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I enjoyed the first two books. However, the third book is absolutely TERRIBLE, I still want my money back for that one!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am definetly one of those Americans that pretends to have soooooo much going on there's just no time to read the word of God. Of course that's false everyone hes some time to spend in the word, and the holy Bible app makes it simple. with its plans and its easy to use navigation system, not to mention daily reminders and multiple translations, I finally find myself diving into the word everyday and savoring it. you really don't know just how great and necessary the Bible is to faith until you start reading it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is one of my fav story games.  the dragons are very cute.  I hope they keep up the good work.  I like it so far.
0553804367|4.0|This book does a nice job of taking some sophisticated theoretical concepts and distilling them down into easy to chew pieces.  This was a pleasant read for a few hours on my flight back from Europe.  Easy to read physics in layman's terms.  The book seems to progress into more theoretical depth as you get closer to the end (sections on Einstein's Relativity, etc).  But for the most part the writing is easy to understand and concepts are explained in an intuitive fashion.<br /><br />At the time of writing this review, the book currently has ~ 4.5 stars -- quite good in aggregate.  However, one common theme I noticed with respect to the 3 star and lower reviews was that a lot of the respective reviewers felt this book was \\"too brief\\" or \\"too dumbed down\\".  However, I think that was kind of the whole point of the book.  It's modern physics for the masses.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book.  I'm 46 years old (so not a teen) and although this is a story of first/young love, it is not written just for a younger audience.  It allows you to see all the characters thru the main characters eyes, Hazel, but since she is clearly beyond her own years, her take on things is very accurate and adult-like and true.  So you get a real understanding of the heartache and love her parents have towards her..how people around her see her. It reminds me quite a bit \\"Juno\\" and I picture her character to be very similar in fact.  Funny, very touching and just a really, really great book.  Not a \\"cancer story\\". Highly recommend to mid-teens that like to read & up.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|With this app i can write my college classes and my personal notes. That's really nice because i have them wherever i go. I just have to sign in and that's it
B008FSCNTK|2.0|I heard an interview with Krall on NPR about this album. I was going to buy it for my mother for Christmas because these songs are from her era, but after having seen the cover...I don't think so. Kind of racy for the masses, and my 83-year-old mom would be scandalized. Too bad, though.
B0095R64AO|3.0|A bit tedious, a bit drawn out, a bit circular in motion, but I can't say that it wasn't all I expect of a Rom-com.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you have love for animals this book is for you! Such a sweet story about the love between a dog and his owner. A must read!
B0031TZBQU|4.0|It was not written as a guide to running, so don't expect it to be.  Rather, it is a book about life from the perspective of a runner.  It also offers good insight into the life of Murakami.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book was a good and fast read but just average by Grisham's standards. It almost seemed like a John Patterson quick read and I do not look to Grisham for that. I will say that it did take me almost 90% to figure out where this was going so that is a good thing. All in all a good read but not great

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book left me wanting more. I'd really like to know more about Christian and what he is thinking throughout the books. How does he feel about being a father? What happened to Hyde? Tell me more about Elliot and Kavanaugh.... give me more more more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0385535147|5.0|I just finished reading The Racketeer and I have to say that I could barely put it down.  This plot reminds me of Grisham's early writing in The Firm and The Pelican Brief.  It was imaginative, creative and kept me glued to the pages until the very end.  Throughout the book, I was trying to guess how the whole plot was going to come together.  It was fast paced, with characters you loved or hated but could not be neutral about. Not until it all tied together in the final pages did I understand the intricacies.  While I have been thrilled with some of his work, and somewhat disappointed in some, this (and I must say his last book), puts him  back on my favorites list.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I tend to like bad movies, as long as they can entertain me for the length, its all good. But I found myself just not paying any attention at all throughout this movie. It was just boring. I had higher hopes.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved this book and all the characters. It was by far my favorite of the series. The storyline was extremely well crafted from start to finish.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am enjoying reading this book. I like the way John Grisham writes. It came in handy with Sandy around
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son plays this nonstop and loves it. The creative ideas are endless. He loves building communites and can even join with his brothers game and they build together
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The AmazonBasics backpack is well worth the money.  The padding inside the bag really surprised me. Great quality! It could have more compartments inside but for the price I would definitely recommend you get it!
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Half way through I could't care less about what might happen. Don't get the big five star rating !<br /><br />Moving on .....!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Purchased this app after using the free version, after the purchase have not been able to bring up an image from my gallery it keeps going round and round asking from where to pull the picture.
B002B44KDG|5.0|What more can be said?<br /><br />Neil Young is a living legend. He shaped the music we listen to in so many different genres - grunge to country to americana to folk and more. This album is a must have for any music fan, period. Now, listen to the title track and enjoy the chills and beautiful vibes it sends your way!
B008PU8SR4|2.0|Possibly, my expectations were too high. Lots of friends recommended the book in enthusiastic terms: I quite liked it, it's nice, it's pleasant, it's really interesting but I hoped for more. It certainly is a very curious booklet (pun intended)
B008RTE08E|5.0|Most Beatle fans have owned this for years. I think the addition of all the bonus material makes it a nice upgrade. Included, is a 19 minute feature on the making of the movie, a version of the movie with Paul's comments, a pool scene with Nat Jackley, and bizzare, haunting Mr. Bloodvessel singing by himself in a field. There are also alternate videos too 3 of the songs (believe they escaped in being bootlegged) and some Easter Egg videos (in a fish and chips store, Magic Alex singing, Aunt Jessie singing and an additional dining room scene - no spaghetti).<br /><br />Those who have never seen the movie would be most likely enjoy the great music videos included as part of the film. Highlights would be Magical Mystery Tour (opening) and I Am the Walrus.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This app is okay, buy it wasn't quite what I was looking for to accompany our studies if westward expansion. Still looking...
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|This film seems created by people familiar with the storyline of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" but with little sense of Jane Austen's times or, indeed, her characters. The plot is essentially correct but the tone is frequently and incomprehensibly off.<br /><br />The general excellence of the actors, the dreamy cinematography and music, and the obvious care lavished on this movie make its flaws even more apparent and confusing. The Elizabeth and Jane Bennett described by Jane Austen would never listen at keyholes or shout at their mother or giggle at a feeble marriage proposal.  Mr. Collins was written as a comically pompous character; here he is so meek and awkward his romantic attempts are more pathetic than amusing and make the sisters' reactions seem cruel.<br /><br />The costumes and hair are inexplicable--Kitty and Lydia are dressed as if they are from a generation past, when they are the ones most concerned with fashion and are always buying new bonnets and gowns, and Elizabeth walks about with her hair down and in bare feet.  In reality, this would have been considered absolutely vulgar--akin to spitting tobacco--and never something a well-bred girl would do, no matter how high-spirited or independent.<br /><br />The Bennetts live in a place so ill-kept the animals wading across the yard look in danger of drowning in mud.  The Bennetts don't have the wealth of Bingley or Darcy, but they are supposed to be respectable, established gentry; Jed Clampett wouldn't own a place this slovenly.<br /><br />Despite all these missteps, this version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is worth seeing for Keira Knightley's lively, if over-giggly, portrayal of Elizabeth and Matthew Macfadyen's interesting take on Darcy: he's more shy and subdued than actively arrogant (though his stuttering proposal at the end seems all wrong.  Love makes Darcy MORE eloquent, not less). The proposal scene in the rain is a highlight, and the plot stays true enough to the original for viewers to enjoy a cinematic vacation to Jane Austen's world.<br /><br />For the truest version of P and P, on all levels, definitely check out the BBC Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth version.  It's wonderful!
B001PJRAUS|2.0|I am sorry to say that I could not like this movie. This had nothing to do with the plot, it was all about the characters. None of the characters seemed charming or to have that spark of life to them that makes us enjoy all the characters of Pride and Prejudice even while knowing all of their faults. Besides, if at the end of the movie you like Wickham more then Mr. Darcy...something is deeply wrong. Seriously, I questioned my nature as a female when I had this epiphany. Amanda is...I don't know, a bit clumsy and bland; and I think I have enough respect for us women that most of us who have read Pride and Prejudice would have done better then her in this situation. Either way, the characters are not Austen's, they seem more like the directors slightly ridiculous caricatures. All that being said, its probably worth seeing once if you're an enthusiast. However, I recommend that you rent it. Buy it after you know you like it for sure or not.
B001EJV276|5.0|This Is a very inspiring movie. Good actors and storyline. It great to watch when you need a little extra movtivation.
B008S9WZB2|4.0|I bought Magic Door after getting Big Moon Ritual.  Both are fantastic.  I personally prefer the feeling of BMR, but they are quite similar and I usually just put both on shuffle.  I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised at the mixture of psychedelia, blues, folksy ballads.  The instrumentation and lyrics are matched perfectly.  There is a slightly spacey feel to both albums (more so on BMR), but it's more like the spaciness you get from camping under the stars in the woods.  Robinson shows himself an excellent songwriter in each song. Highly recommended, but as both albums are hard to characterize, they might need a few spins before you can sink into them.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Great application, although sometimes you have to be smarter than the app to figure out how to make it work right. :-) It took me a while and a bit of experimenting, but, I think it's great!
B001706I5I|5.0|Is this the greatest film ever?  The best Christmas film?  No, but I like it even more than I like the original, which is saying quite a bit.  Jim Carrey does an amazing take on the Grinch.  It's a wonderful feel good Christmas movie that should be watched every year.  It's not Home Alone or A Christmas Story, but it's right there with them for me!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really like this app.  Not only can I see how much battery I have left, I can see exactly what apps  and functions are using the battery so I can turn off the battery hogs.  Works great on Samsung phone and Dell tablet
0982954328|4.0|I liked the book. It was of good quality and the illustrations were a plus. The price was decent. The only drawback was that the print was a little small but I've since learned to review that before I make the purchase.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I am a John Grisham fan and devour each new release. This one started out great but led to such a far fetched plot that was hard to swallow. There didn't seem to be any doubt that the main character's plan would succeed. It was still an enjoyable read but I prefer more well thought out and plausible plots.
B008SOS63S|5.0|I already have the blu ray to this excellent concert so I thought I would get the cd to play in the car and I have been very surprised at how much I enjoy hearing this in two channel stereo. I am hearing things for the first time because I am focusing on the music and not being distracted by watching the concert as well. I've seen Joe live twice and the Beacon blu ray has been in constant rotation. If you like Joe Bonamassa I can give this a five star, must own recommendation!
B008ENA74E|4.0|An interesting account of the deterioration of integrity in the world of finance and particularly at Goldman Sachs. This change in attitude toward customers began under Paulson and was encouraged under Blankfein. The essence of the problem is that when it comes to money and principal, money wins every time.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I like this. It uses the Sherlock Holmes pieces and creates a unique story. It put a twist on Sherlock Holmes' use of narcotics. Lucy Liu is a unique version of Watson. Jonny Lee Miller is more of a slob than you would have expected from Sherlock Holmes but the original Sherlock would sit and smoke really cheap tobacco for hours so he really wasn't the obsessive compulsive neatnik portrayed frequently. Aidan Quinn adds a veteran actor with great chops to the show. I have thoroughly enjoyed the stories to date.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I was!!!!!<br /><br />Internally, I had come to the realization that certain foods only made me hungry for more - more - more.<br /><br />This book not only validated my suspicions but it spelled out in black and white what causes that \\"phenomenon\\" and how to AVOID IT!<br /><br />Now I know the REAL culprit behind my Yo-Yo dieting and have hope that this weight loss can be maintained.<br /><br />Highly recommend - BUT only if you really are \\"Sick and tired of being sick and tired\\".

B0053O89KG|4.0|A late purchase of the DVD series, Castle, from Amazon provides a pleasant mixture of the romantic comedy and crime drama that sets it apart from the more serious attempts with the whodoneit genre.  It's an interesting twist in the well written series that the teenage daughter of author-crime fighter charmer Rick Castle is the adult of the Castle family. This Castle family includes a somewhat delusional mother still waiting for her break-out role in the theatre.  Detective Beckett is also an intriguing character riding the fence between being serious about law inforcement and being under the charm of that rogue, Rick Castle.<br /><br />  -------  Bob Pond
B005V20JKI|3.0|an update has been available for this app for a year or so on android market but Amazon refuses to bring this update.  the update contains critical content and fixes.  I can only.say, shame on amazon.  but that's northern reason for the 3 star.  the game is pretty entertaining to start but does get kind of old after everything is unlocked which shouldn't take too long.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not normally interested in this type of book, but there was so much hype around it that I decided to take a chance. I was pleasantly surprised. I thoroughly enjoyed this book to the point of being spellbound from chapter to chapter. Absolutely could not wait for the next page to turn. Not as good as the Twilight Saga, but close.

B0001I55OC|2.0|I read the book first and loved it so much that I purchased the DVD. But there were so many variations from the book that viewing the movie was less than enjoyable. I'm not saying that a movie needs to be exactly like the book, word for word. But the entire theme and plot was changed around. An actual father/son relationship was forged between the professor and Chris that was completely unnecessary. In fact, it added a sort of cheesiness to the movie that I couldn't overlook.<br /><br />I was not happy with this movie. However, I am not writing this review to bash the movie. I hope that this review and others like it would spur another writing, direction and production team (or even the same team) to film this movie again and really do the book justice.
B008KE3960|2.0|This \\"defense\\" game just requires too much routing and rerouting of planes and takes the focus off of strategy. It's not a bad first attempt for Amazon in the game market, but a smash hit? No way...day 2 I uninstalled because there are better games that deserve the application space. Amazon, my advice, back-up and try again

0446580848|2.0|Have enjoyed most of the DeMille books and feel that I get a nice dose of history tucked inside a mystery/thriller.  This time the constant stream of sarcastic banter from the principal character was intrusive at best and annoying at worst.  Found myself thinking all too often 'just shut up and get on with the story\\".  In this case a lot less banter would have allowed the story to flow more effectively.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I cant believe it. the trailer made this movie seem like it would be soooo lame and corny. it made it seem like it would be a comedy with old fashioned humor. which is was i didn't want to see it in theaters but oh how i was wrong<br /><br />this film is dark. lots of death. unexpected. the music makes it more. plot was good, goes into the life of the main character. the antagonist made you want to hate her.<br /><br />i recommend this film to all who want to see a dark story with a twist at the end.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|I haven't read the autobiography on which the movie was based, but Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do an incredible job of telling the story of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash in a way that draws you in and makes you feel like you know them personally.  Phoenix and Witherspoon impress with their vocal talents, performing the songs themselves.  It is a movie I have watched over and over.  I appreciate the reminder that while we all go through struggles in life, and make mistakes, it is never too late to turn our life around.  And when it comes to true love, sometimes the timing is just not right, but there is hope that perhaps later, when the time and place are different, true love will prevail.

B002ODEJYE|5.0|It constantly amazes me how entertainers can put on such elaborate productions.  Pink is a very sexy young lady and is worthy of the production, which is filmed beautifully in concert with the dancers, musicians, and Pink herself. I have found myself replaying \\"Bad Influence\\" over and over in my head.  Whoever thought up the Funhouse did an excellent job of making fantasy come to life and Pink's music fits perfectly with that environment.  That the concert itself runs for over two and a half hours is remarkable and the Blu-ray transfer and dolby digital 5.1 sound track brings it right into your home (or home theater).  Very entertaining - and if you weren't a fan of Pink before watching this show, you must be a very callous person.  Anyway, that's my opinion and I'm sticking with it.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|An entertaining read.  At times you wanted to give her a swift kick or a good talking to about her actions, but at the same time you had to admire her determination to complete her quest.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I went from 215 down to 190 lbs in a span of 2 months following the Keto diet, which is the principles explained in this book.  No exercise just carb restriction less than 30g daily accompanied with high fat intake and moderate protein. I had a rough idea of what was going on in my body, but after reading this book I have a complete understanding of my diet and why I have attained such results.  I feel good overall, I sleep better at night, I am never hungry, and my energy levels are through the roof that I want to do more activities.  I started exercising and everyday I look forward to it after working an 8 hour shift.  I am glad I read this book because now I can explain to people how my diet works down to a molecular level.  It also puts me at ease that I now know how to explain to people that I will not die of heart disease since they see me eating daily either: cheese, eggs, fatty meats, ribs, steak, pork finds, chicken wings, mayonnaise, bunless baconators, bunless double cheeseburgers, and once in a while a few shreds of lettuce with copious amount of ranch dressing.  I'm still losing weight and I feel confident I will reach my goal weight.  Thank you Gary Taubes.

B000YXMMAE|1.0|RADIOHEAD, the greatest deceivers of all time.<br />I watched a program with this radiohead playing \\"in rainbows\\" and I laughed a lot.<br />What a bad band!<br /><br />They don't know how to play, even a child is better than them. I myself, when I was 5 was better than them playing.<br /><br />The leader is a deceiver, he doesn't know how to sing, he doesn't know how to play the guitar, and is a mediocre composer, the lyrics are silly.<br />And the rest of the band, is not necessary to comment about them, they simply aren't musicians, they stay there deceiving all the time that they are playing something.<br /><br />I think they've laughed a lot, noticing that there are people that bought their albums.<br /><br />How easy is to deceive people nowadays, you can be musician without being.<br />The only thing you must to do is go there, and have the courage to pretend you are, and people will believe that you are.<br /><br />I only can compare this group with mediocres like Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Madonna, or Britney Spears.<br /><br />Radiohead, the greatest deceivers of all time.

0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is an awesome series! I couldn't put the books down once I started reading them. It is best that you get all three of the books because you can not get the full affect of the books by only reading the first book. The first book was  my favorite and the most exciting to me. It feels like your living Katniss's life! When you start reading the 2nd and 3rd books, at first they may seem to be very boring or that Katniss is just whining all the time, but keep reading don't stop!!!<br />I used these books as a time filler during a very boring summer. I highly recommend them and wish that there was another series!

0307456625|4.0|This was a book club choice for my group. The host invited her friend, Priscilla, one of Africa's \\"Lost Girls\\" to come speak to us. Her story was amazing. Family members murdered. Refugee camps. Horrors. She, her husband, and their three children now live and work here. They love America and say we are \\"God people, you act like God would act.\\" Though, that is obviously a generalization, it is evident that she is grateful to be here.<br /><br />Meeting Priscilla was wonderful. Her strength and dedication to life are inspiring. When she told us of how some people in the US told her that she didn't have to work here, that the government would give her a house and that she could just sit in it all day, and that she said to them, \\"Why wouldn't I want to work?! I am able! I have two arms. Why wouldn't I want to work? Maybe one day if I am sick and old, but not now!\\" She and her family are the only kind of immigrants that made America great, and they are continuing to do so. I think the heroine in our book had similar pluck.<br /><br />It was also very heart-opening to hear Priscilla joke about disciplining her children and how she tells them that if they do not behave that she would not buy them anything good. Upon hearing this, my silent mind immediately thought of \\"candy\\" and \\"toys\\" being the \\"anything good\\". Priscilla finished her story up by saying, \\"Yes, I tell them, I won't buy you anything good, no shoes, no clothes...\\"<br /><br />Wow. We know nothing of want.<br /><br />When I first heard the title of this series I was not interested in reading it. It reminded me of those cheesy crime shows in the 1980s, like \\"Spencer For Hire\\", etc., which my family actually watched.<br /><br />As the choice of the month for my book club, I read it to respect the chooser, if you will. And I am so glad! I really enjoyed the book and it was day-and-night different from my assumption.<br /><br />It really was fun, quick, touching, and interesting. The heroine is very human and it is a delight to have her thoughts narrate most of the story. The author makes political commentary from which our own busy-body government should take a lesson or two, (i.e. 'hands off my life!).<br /><br />The reflections on human relationships made throughout the book are the most poignant of all.<br /><br />I am really glad that I read this book.

1594202842|3.0|This book was far less shocking than the media made it out to be.  I actually quite enjoyed it and read it quickly.  Amy Chua is not a demon.  Her writing can be very heartfelt.  She is prideful, arrogant, honest (though not always with herself), witty (often making fun of herself), driven, sensitive, and she loves her husband and children very much.  I really liked this book.  Though far too harsh sometimes verbally, Amy's parenting is something from which many American parents could learn.  She believed in her children and that has caused them to believe in themselves.  I don't agree with all her choices as a mother but none of us are perfect.  It seems she tried her best and that is all that can be asked of any of us.

0439023513|3.0|** spoiler alert ** Still processing this one. The first two I really liked but this one was so very sad. Certain horrors of war were realistically presented and I don't think I was ready for that. It was way too graphic. The overall political outcome was good and I really appreciate the author's knowledge of the classics. Her reference to bread and circuses was perfect and all too true today, unfortunately. I wasn't uplifted by this book but it did make me appreciate my life and my family and my sweet precious daughter. Perhaps that was the point.<br /><br />I have not recommended this book to others because of the graphic violence.  It is very disturbing.

B005723JSQ|5.0|Fun, quick read. I'm not usually a fan of chick-lit, but this one kept my attention. It had a few minor flaws, but I gave it 5 stars due to the believable plot and lots of humor.  Of course there are a few spots that are predictable; it wouldn't be chick-lit without some predictability, right??  At any rate, this book was good enough that I will seek out more Sophie Kinsella to read!
0393976149|5.0|Ahhhh! I can't believe I haven't read this book until now. In a way, though, I am glad to have waited so long. Glad to have waited until I became a mother.<br /><br />This story is truly a treasure. One of my favorites now.<br /><br />From afar, I had always believed it to be just a fluffy children's story. Alas, how wrong I was. The lessons, the morals, the relationships, the heartaches, the joys are all so relevant and true. I can say that this story was life-changing for me.<br /><br />There are so many quotes and vignettes to be shared from Alcott's gem Little Women, but Marmee's exclamation and the proceeding narrative at the end of the book are of the most poignant, in my opinion:<br /><br />\\"Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, with face and voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility--<br /> 'Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this!'\\"
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked this book. Except for the ending!! If there is no district 12 what happens now? Makes me want to read book 3 now.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Great creative writing! Kudos to the author and screenwriter. Fantasy was skillfully intertwined with history. Thoroughly entertaining.  Great special effects.
0757302661|3.0|(I only read a portion of this book.) This book is a bit \\"out there\\" saying that childbirth does not have to be painful (riiiight) but there are some great things that I learned in regards to how to relax. I also learned about the uterine muscles and how they work. This really helped me visualize what the different sets of muscles were doing during each contraction. I feel this helped make my contractions, or surges as they call them, more productive. This book and \\"The Idiot's Guide to Natural Childbirth\\" were good sources and what I read helped me with my 6-hour natural birth. The experience was a blessing and the knowledge I acquired prior to the birth was very helpful.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This was amazing. Full range of octaves, good tone, no delay. It teaches you how to play songs too. You can set many features, as to how you want it to look and function, etc. I've been looking for a piano app, and this is the right choice!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Get this woman an editor!  The read was, at least, entertaining.  You almost feel like you have to read it with all the talk, but, apparently, folks just need a societally acceptable reason to read about sex.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this book! Morton's gradual revelation of the story was perfectly balenced between revealing just enough to keep you interested and giving away too much.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This will be another Grisham classic. He leaves you spellbound until you read the next page. I have read everything he had in print and I am yet to be disappointed. I can hardly wait for his next release.<br />Billy R. White.  Don't forget to notify me, Amazon.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved the book. Couldn't wait to read it and I was sad when I finished it so quickly. So many stories going on at once but it's easy to follow. Little upset that I have to wait a year for the next one to come out.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I loved this cover. I bought it for my Kindle Fire HD and it fits perfectly. I recommend it. Good leather too and a great stand positiion

B008TMOIEK|5.0|I was very impressed with the musical selections throughout \\"FSOG\\" when I read it the first time. Being a classical musical afficianado, I was very impressed with Christian's musical tastes -- or is that E.L. James' musical tastes?<br /><br />One of my very favourite pieces of all time is Marcello's Oboe Concerto. I had no idea, however, that J.S. Bach had adapted it for piano!<br /><br />I'm not usually a fan of choral pieces but I have to say I really like the selections on this CD.<br /><br />In case you've already read the books (and who hasn't?), go back and re-read them listening to the CD. It will take your reading experience to another level!<br /><br />But, most important of all, I think this CD is a great sampler on its own merits without being associated with FSOG. I love the idea that so many people who are normally intimidated by or just have not been exposed to classical music can be introduced to it in such a unique and enjoyable manner.<br /><br />So, pour yourself a glass of Pinot, put on the CD and pull out your copy of FSOG and enjoy it all over again!
B0054JELS4|1.0|Ordered NCIS seasons 1-8.  Delivered on time.  After watching a few discs, it became apparent that the quality was very poor.  At least 1 disc per season failed to play, skipped or froze up.  In season 4, all discs had problems.  After reporting the issue and requesting a replacment set, we were informed to throw away our set and a credit was applied to our card.<br />It appears that this seller is selling a product that is already proven poor, but hopes the customer won't complain.<br />Recommend not using this seller!

B005D9MUWY|2.0|Does not work on the kindle fire. It used to until an update broke it. Developers do not seem to care.
0920236162|5.0|. . . and then after the first reading, enter the name of the girl listening to you read. Or who is reading it for herself. This is a Wonderful book. The Princess Elizabeth understands in her soul what it Really means to be royal and that is a lesson all our young princesses today need to learn. In a short, clever, funny book Robert Munsch teaches self-esteem, courage, wisdom and ego-strength as Elizabeth faces both a real dragon and the dragon of traditional expectations. Hurray for Munsch, for Elizabeth, and for all young courageous, wise women who are learning to know themselves.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is a movie that peaks your interest from the beginning<br />just trying to keep track of what is going on, and the 3D<br />is really done great  The other preliminary trailers and<br />descriptions fall quite short of describing this movie for<br />the 3D audience. I really recommend seeing this movie in 3D.

B007V5XT1O|5.0|I bought this because I had tickets to the \\"Blown Away\\" tour concert in Baltimore, MD.  The songs are great, and Carrie's range in singing is amazing.  I would recommend this to all types of music fans, not just country.  Her concert highlighting the songs from the Blown Away CD was fantastic too!
0307352145|5.0|Great summary analysis on the different ways personality can manifest. Strong book that reminds the reader it's okay to respond differently in situations from the social norm, we're all different and can use that to our benefit. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever felt out of place or is trying to communicate better with peers.<br /><br />Good book for those looking for personal introspection or looking for a way to better motivate employees. The workplace analysis was extremely interesting.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This series, and particularly Book 2 \\"Winter of the World,\\" is the best thing from Ken Follet in years..... and he has some really good ones!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read. Grisham is back to his tremendous ability to keep you guessing throughout the book.<br />Very well written and extremely interesting.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I totally get what Diana was going after musically. It is certainly not a two or three star album as some here say and no way a one star!<br />I think the one star people who hated it are stuck with a picture of her sitting at the piano doing jazz tunes we all know and love.<br /><br />The music here is more classic song book material. Before radio and records, people would spend time around a piano and/or a guitar/ukulele singing songs! These were songs written by school teachers, preachers, the poor, former slaves, and tin pan alley! Some of those songs were bawdy but most are sweet and simple or whistful. Cole Porter comes to mind as a product of this same kind of song book. This style is the root to Swing as well.<br /><br />Diana has translated these songs into a somewhat contemporary and casual feel.<br />The other way to look at them, and this is a stretch so, bear with me: some of these songs remind me of Brazilian Samba. I could see a steamy Brazilian singer, in portuguese, singing Just Like A Butterfly or I Used to Love You.<br /><br />But the best comparison is to cabaret songs. Ute Lemper, Kurt Weill, Squirrel Nut Zippers, or other cabaret singers come to mind. Minus some of the umhpapa. Although, Here Lies Love and When the Curtain Comes Down have some of that cabaret quality.<br />Plus some honky tonk like I'm a Little Mixed Up.<br /><br />Prairie Lullaby and Wide River to Cross reminds me of a Nora Jones style song.<br /><br />As for any concern or dislike of any country sounds here, remember, Krall is from Vancouver Island in Western Canada! If there were ever a person to do this kind of album, with the blending in it, it would be her.<br /><br />Was Diana and her style of singing the best singer for some of these songs? Not all. But after listening to the album 5 or more times now, it has grown on me.<br /><br />I think it is worth the risk for those who can accept experimentation and adaptation from musical artists they like. Listen to it more than 3-4 times, a week or more apart when you are in different moods, especially on a good sound system, before you decide.<br /><br />Short NPR radio piece on it:[...]<br /><br />If you are a super Jazz fanatic and really hate change, don't bother. Thankfully, I am not one of those and I like experimentation and like this album.pecially on a good sound system, before you decide.

B008FQ1O7O|4.0|Cheered me up no end. Only thing is split pages on kindle a bit difficult. Maybe me as am newbie
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|While the movie was not as good as I had hoped when I viewed at the cineplex, I found the Blu Ray disc to be an excellent reproduction of the theatrical experience.  Both visuals and audio were as well presented as the theatrical version and the 3D effects were well done and not excessive.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is the highest quality series I have ever watched. I bought the first 2 seasons and watched them in a marathon session of 36 hours. Though my eyes were strained and I had eaten far too much chocolate...it was for a great cause, as now I am prepared for season 3. The abbey itelf is a SPECTACULAR setting, the costumes flawless...the acting unparalleled. The character development is entire...one feels a variety of emotions for them. Some are sinister yes, but even they have their humanity. The viewer is as invested in the characters as a viewer can be....with the surprising and wondrous edition of Shirley MacLaine, I cannot fathom how things can improve. Jeremy Brett would have fit right in here...the acting is THAT fine.<br />So, do not hesitate to indulge in the UK version of Downton Abbey...<br /><br />Incidentally, there is nothing naughty, tawdry, obscene or vile in the UK version...I have no idea what the editors will have to do to the US version in order to make it viewable for US tastes (it will need breasts, blood, 1 Kardashian and mucho general debauchery or it will fail miserably, I fear)! But, for now...Downton Abbey is a pristine and magnificent production!<br /><br />****I am taking the time to review season 3****- Season 3 is rather a disappointment:<br />1) Shirley M. appears and then departs without any real notice; Irish revolutionary Tom has become a TIRING subject, not interesting or deep enough to carry the time given to him; Bates...oh god...Bates and the dark cinema of his excerpts...Bates is exhausting; the element of Daisy establishing a connection with William's father has been eliminated (I guess)...; and there is a coolness between Mary and Matthew. In short, this would be a 3-star review....
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I love this crazy movie!  It's like the actors just let go and let the acting flow through them.  The characters are outrageous and hysterical!  I won't give away any secrets, for anyone who has not seen this yet, but be prepared to laugh out loud at what our favorite actors come up with this time!  The movie is NOT for kids, but anyone over 15 will really enjoy this.  The music is predictable, and very well done.  It is amazing that Tom Cruise actually did the singing for this.  Who would have thought??????  See this movie.  You won't regret it.
B005EPFA8I|3.0|The cave, the discovery, Werner, the music (Ernst Reijseger), the art...it is all surreal and ethereal...mystical...divine...; as a horse-person, I am fasciniated by the 2 VERY distinct phenotypic differences in the 2 main creations in the cave...1 is a very typical Mongolian-type Steppe horse (a Przewalksi)...the other is a very fine Oriental horse, a hot-blood. Check them out...! But, back to this artful Herzogian creation, it is redundant....too long....it lacks the watery feel of Herzog's work (which is always present even when you have absolutely no idea where he is taking you next....)...he probably would have been better off to edit it down by 30% (AS IF one could from such an opportunity....)...I think he probably wanted to give us every second of film he shot...and he does here. The thing about Werner H. is that his filming is so personal...and the magick conjured, so childlike...that one feels an affinity and a belonging with Werner H. enough to refer to him as &#34;Werner&#34;.<br />To write a review and not mention the UN-FRICKIN REAL music of Ernst Reijseger, well...now THAT would be a felony. The music that Reijseger makes, is whale-like, supernatural...it has a frequency that affects the soul...pokes at it...opens it wide...and makes the listener want to cry for things known and unknown. It is highly personal music, lilting and lowing like sparrows and Jersey cows content with their calves. It is very cavey...very sensual and layered. To make matters even worse, after the psychologic bathing I took from listening to Reijseger in some of Werner's other films, I felt I owed it to Reijseger and art in general, to buy every CD he ever made! This left me momentarily penniless...but, who cares...there is no poverty when one listens to music such as this...and frankly, I would rather starve and listen to it, then have Babette's Feast and not listen to it...<br />So there!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really loved this book series.  The way the story unfolds reminds me of the first couple of<br />seasons of \\"Lost\\", before it got lost.  The characters are compelling and the post-apocalyptic<br />society is fascinating even without the dramatic revelations.<br /><br />Don't start reading this series if you have anything important on your plate.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The story was lame............you could see the ending way before you should.<br />Typical Grisham sequencing.  Nothing new from this book
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I've read all of the books in this series and I can't wait to find out how it continues in the next book. I just wish we didn't have to wait so long
B008P1EWIM|3.0|It doesn't seem to keep up with changes in temperature unless I restart the app.  It'll read the same temp in the morning as when I went to sleep the night before.<br /><br />Since I use it nightstand mode, I'd like for it to display the correct outdoor temperature before I go off to shower and get dressed.<br /><br />Great looking app and if you don't want to know what the current tempertue is, then by all means spend a buck on this one.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I found the background on the meaning of flowers very interesting. What I really liked was how the main character grew into the person she became. I liked the ending in that she found something she loved to do & that there was the possiblity for love & family that she never had in her future.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Interesting twist...<br /><br />Not like his usual books on legal suits and court rooms, this story takes a look outside the court room and what happens between the prisoners, the federal, and the district  attorney office...<br /><br />Under table handshakes, clever conspiracies, cruel murders, and etc. A challenge to your usual portray of the federal, the prison, and the society...
B008VBYN80|5.0|I like the game but the fact that you gotta have energy is annoying other than that I love it
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Well developed characters, interesting world, pace moves along well. Mostly told as a flashback, and that method works well. Looking forward to the next one!
1451638450|5.0|I wasn't overly fond of Cryoburn, so was a bit wary of expecting much from the latest book. What a pleasant surprise! The romantic in me was reminded of reading Komarr for the first time. Something I've wanted for a long time is an historical novel from the time of the occupation. While I would still like to read of General Piotr's adventures as a young man, this did provide a glimpse back to that time.<br /><br />Is Tej as strongly written as some of the previous Vor women? No, but I have a hard time imagining Ivan happy with someone with such an intense personality.<br /><br />My only quibbles with the book are the cover art (I've had a mental image of Ivan for years and that didn't come close) and the change in By - it didn't feel right.<br /><br />A very enjoyable read. Highly recommended.
B00633W614|5.0|One of Jeffrey Archers best works to date. I look forward to reading the next in this series to see what becomes of the characters and how Archer developes the plot.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Being a huge Star Wars fans and having played the Angry Birds games before, I could not stop myself from purchasing this game. Works great on the Kindle Fire HD. Very smooth game play, good graghics, and addicting. Really liking the movie tie-in/theme. Good job Rovio
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This is just a Facebook AP right? I mean, how much should we be expecting from it. Access Facebook and don't screw up. It should just work like on a computer. This AP is just \\"ok\\". It has quircs though. It keep defaulting to the last person's homepage I was on a few weeks ago. Even when I go to news feed and then end the session there. So anyway, that's why I rate this as Neutral. It works about as well as anything does with Facebook. Which is to say, not very flawlessly and not very seemlessly. they keep changing things they should just be fixing or improving. they must be bored over there at Facbook and not have anything better to do than change change change.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was exciting and helped me better understand what these men go through, their motivation and their sense of duty I appreciate these men doing their jobs so that we can live free.
B009JNXK88|4.0|pretty tight controls considering the devices. retro fun gameplay. one of the better games on the app store. I got it for free but it is worth the 99 cents.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett never disappoints his readers.  I entered into the world of  the early 1900s.  My only disappointment was when I finished it's.  I look forward to the next in the trilogy.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked the way Dr. Alexander wove the parts of his stunning account of a  spiritual experience with what was going on in his treatment and what his family was going through at the same time. He emphasizes that his experience of an afterlife is not something that came from his brain during his week-long coma ( as he would have thought, as a neurosurgeon , previously) because, for all practical purposes, his brain was &#34;dead&#34; the whole time. He really believes his spiritual self was out of his body during that time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series of stories was an absolute steal of a deal on Amazon.  They were as well written as most of the mainstream books I have read recently and involve a very compelling and intriguing science fiction/distopian mystery.  I highly recommend anyone to pick these up and read them, and to support this author so that we can get more great books in the future.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I had previously read &#34;I Woz&#34;, Steve Wozniak's story of his side of the making of Apple Computer Company. It was extremely interesting to compare the two stories. Wozniak's depiction of Jobs was as a friend who took Woz's inventions to the next level and built a business model. This book says pretty much the same thing. Isaacson shows the many sides of this extremely unusual individual- his compulsiveness, his charm, his astounding ability to manipulate people to bring out creativity they never knew they had, his narcissism , his stubbornness, and his strange way of creating his own reality. This last trait was responsible for the creation of some wonderful products that have undeniably changed our world, but also caused his demise from a cancer that might have been curable had he not tried to deny the inevitable truth of the situation. A genius with remarkable foresight  but with some crucial flaws.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Played this games for hours. Color is great and would recommend it to anyone who has time to kill. Worked with no problems on the Kindle Fire.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed the \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" by Stephen Chbosky. The entire book is a series of letters from a teenager to someone unknown. The letters capture all the angst, insecurity, and anxiety of being a teenager. Through his letters we learn this teenager is somewhat unusual. Sam is amazingly bright but very challenged socially and that's the first mystery. We don't know why... As he navigates the hallways of his freshman year of high school, we see him mature, fall in love, experience heart break, and finally really start to get to know himself. What was interesting is the Chbosky weaves in some very interesting plot twists that I didn't expect.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I suffer from stress induced insomnia and it is impossible for me to calm down enough to have a deep recuperative sleep, so needless to say I'm always tired. However, after downloading the free version of this app I found that I was able to fall asleep much easier and stay asleep much longer. I also use it to relax during the day when I have a free moment. I loved the free app so much I had to purchase the premium app and it was well worth the what it sells for. The best part for was the selection and quality of sounds and the level of customization. I'm not a big fan of &quot;white noise&quot;, does nothing for me but agitate me. While it is a selection choice there are so many other sounds that work for me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is a great storyteller.  I like the fact that he moves along without the horror, gore or muderous atmosphere prevalent in much of today's literature.  I don't usually garner the jist of the ending as early as I did here, but he held you secure until he confirmed the trail he wove and why he did what he did.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I found this to be, at times an engaging read, but, by the same token, at other times, quite tedious and cumbersome. Bram Stoker's descriptive writing is incredible, however, at times when dipping in during an entry by a character, it was nigh on impossible to decipher which character you were reading from because of a lack of differing registers amongst the characters.<br /><br />All in all, it was enjoyable, but I would advise caution to readers that are easily lost and would have trouble with the older style of language used.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Definitely more character info than the first book.  I liked this book much better than the first one, more believable.
B008OOYALE|5.0|love to play this game. the dragons are cute and goals are pretty easy. easy for all ages to play. could be easier to grow things.
B008OOYALE|4.0|it is fun. I wasn't sure when I first downloaded and was ready to delete but it grows on you. it would be nicer to get a little more reward from items and it is costly to clear area to expand. I like creating dragons so I don't have to buy them
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The Language of Flowers was very good. Character development was excellent. It was interesting to learn  about the various flowers and what they stood for.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The series speaks for itself.... The relationship between Mr. Grey and Ana is one of a kind. One you can feel with complete envy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I had time to read some fiction so I knew I could count on JG. Great read. Looking forward to some more down time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Have never feel in love with a series the way I did with 50 shades of grey.  I was able to understand and feel his point of view, just from the detail of the book... Amazing Series!!!!!
B003B02O14|5.0|Good to great I no not read a lot of fiction but when I do JG all ways has something new and cutting edge to fall back on. A++
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was breath taking, memorizing  and intense... I cant wait to see things from &#34;Mr. Grey's&#34; point of view
1439153663|5.0|Excellent book.  Really centered around the strength of family.  Kept your attention throughout the whole book, and developed a strong connection to the main characters, Belle and Lavinia.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|What an insight Ayn Rand had, and very sad that our world is so accurately reflected in today's love of collectivism and the fact that history repeatedly shows it always results in failure.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|Beevor's book enthusiastically recounts the details of the great battles of World War II and if you delight in tactics and strategy, this book is for you. The author's command of the military history of the war is breathtaking. I am not much interested in tactical minutae, but I must confess I had to pause more than once during my reading to reflect how things  might easily have turned out differently had this or that commander issued different orders or deployed his battle assets differently. The war might have been lost. . .or won a few years earlier. The great value of Beevor's work is that it again reminds us that success or failure in battle are rarely inevitable - a perspective we sometimes lose when we view history from the wrong end of the telescope.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I loved it, i couldn't put it down so thrilling to read . Would recommend to everyone, such a great book.
B008OOYALE|5.0|it was awesome I am wooing obsessed w / this game it is so much fun. I have it. no my phone it is sooo much fun I have been waiting for this game to come on my kindle it was. sooo miluch fun the dragons areso interesting.

0930289528|5.0|Wow, just wow. This book was one of the best graphic novels I have ever read. It was a really well written story, the setting was really good, and the characters were just great.<br /><br />To start off the main character \\"V\\" is great. He is not the average, do good, save everyone super hero, but instead borders on being a terrorists. Throughout the novel the books shows him doing both good and bad things such as blowing up building, killing people and so on. You also see him as saving people. Like I said, he's sort of both a hero and a terrorist. What makes this even better is seeing the other side of things, the government he's fighting against. That just makes you think more about who he really is.<br />Next is Evey, the 16 year old girl that \\"V\\" saves in the beginning of the story. I love her character the most because she really goes through the most changes, and I love seeing how she grows and develops into and adult, and I especially love what she does at the end. (I won't have any spoilers here)<br />Last character I will go into is \\"The Leader\\". The leader seems like a \\"Hitler\\" type character. He seems cruel, prejudice, and just seems to hate everyone who is well, different. You really hate him, but what this book does, actually the book does this with all the character is show them as humans, not as horrible people. Especially with \\"The Leader\\", it really shows him as more tragic than evil. It gives a really interesting perspective and I think it was done so well.<br /><br />Next I'll talk about the story telling. The storytelling the entire way through was very well done, and I honestly think this being a graphic novel makes it even better. The artwork, theme, setting, story, and tone all go together so well, and it looks amazing. The artwork is dark, and not always clear, and even seems like a movie sometimes with the way it switches scenes constantly.<br /><br />The story itself is really good. It starts with revenge, but as you get to know the character \\"V\\", you find out it is so much more. Throughout the whole novel you are constantly questioning V's methods, if what he is doing is really good or is bad. He could be the bad guy and that is really what makes this story great.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this to anyone. This story, book, characters, and setting is great. And the art style of the comic blends it all together really well. I especially recommend this to anyone who has seen the movie V for vendetta.

1936608898|5.0|Melissa and Dallas have a refreshing opinion about dieting: Eat real food!  It's not gimmicky or a fad.  It's about learning how your body works and how food affects your body.  It's not preachy.  It's not just about losing weight.  It's about arming yourself with knowledge and making good choices for the rest of your life. It's about eliminating things from your diet and seeing how those small changes affect you and paying attention to what you eat.  I highly recommend this book because it's smart, it's funny and it's really the best way to eat for a long and healthy life.

0156030306|4.0|Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon has been reprinted more than twenty times and in numerous languages. The rest of his bibliography of novels has been eclipsed by the umbra of this award-winning work: [[ASIN:B009P0NU6M The Touch]] (1968) and [[ASIN:0395294495 The Fifth Sally]] (1980). Aside from his novelette of the same name (1959), even Daniel Keyes' short work has been lost to science fiction magazines and anthologies in the 1960s and 1970s. Reviewing the last three sentences, it becomes apparent that Flowers for Algernon is Daniel Keyes' sole lasting contribution to the genre of science fiction. I'm always leery of what other people consider masterpieces, as in Gollancz's \\"SF Masterworks\\" (Flowers for Algernon being #25), but this novel is rightfully a great (meh, pretty darn good) work of science fiction.<br /><br />Rear cover synopsis:<br />\\"Charlie Gordon, IQ 68, is a floor sweeper, and the gentle butt of everyone's jokes, until an experiment in the enhancement of human intelligence turns him into a genius. But then Algernon, the mouse whose triumphal experimental transformation preceded his, fades and dies, and Charlie has to face the possibility that his salvation was only temporary.\\"<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Algernon is a white mouse who has had an experimental done on his brain which involving \\"competitive inhibition enzymes\\" (102), which revitalizes brain proteins at a supernormal rate and leaves the mouse with an amazing intelligence for working our mazes. Seeing the benefit of such a procedure, Prof. Nemur and Dr. Strauss at Beekman University enlist a student from Center for Retarded Adults: Charlie Gordon. This simple man, abandoned by his family while still a teenager, works at a bakery doing menial tasks and shouldering demeaning jokes from his co-workers, who he childishly believes are his friends.<br /><br />Charlie had begun to read and write while at the Center but goes on to start a diary when he is enlisted by Nemur and Beekman. His phonetics and spelling are terrible at first; however, he endures and continues his diary entries. Charlie meets with Algernon and is frustrated by the mouse's innate ability to navigate mazes because the mouse beats Charlie every time. But once Charlie has his operation with permission from his sister (who thought Charlie dead after all those years), Charlie begins to read more, understand more, write more clearly, remember more, and even beat Algernon at his maze races.<br /><br />Charlie once admired the students' intellectual conversation on campus, but as his IQ ramps up through 85 and above 100 Charlie becomes more and more aware of his surroundings; however, his emotional intelligence isn't on as steep as an incline as his IQ. Charlie is unable to understand moral dilemmas or understand the repercussions of his increasingly effervescent memories of his past where child neglect and child abuse were common. His childish anger at these ill social qualms doesn't affect his study and he soon finds that all those conversations at the university mere so petty compared to the knowledge he now holds. Off campus at the bakery, his coworkers now distrust his sudden and unexplained burst of intelligence (Charlie was told not to tell them of the experiment). Aside from the doctors, Charlie has no friends except the one being who shares his experimental status--Algernon.<br /><br />His information absorption still outpaces his social understanding when he confronts those butterflies in his stomach--a woman who tutored him at his old school, who now sits at the front row in his heart, Alice Kinnian. Emotionally approaching her takes time, but the physical and intimate approach proves to be impossible because of Charlie's 65-IQ once self, who now lurks in the shadows. This internal turmoil within Charlie, between the Charlies, drives a deeper stake between himself and the rest of society who don't understand him, besides Algernon.<br /><br />When Charlie is taken to a symposium, his increasingly negative attitude to being treated as a test subject reaches a boiling point when Prof. Nemur takes the stage to speak about Charlie and Algernon. Charlie releases Algernon from the cage and the conference erupts in a collected attempt to capture the mouse, which is secretively snatched by Charlie who then elopes to New York to live a life by himself with the money he's secured from the experiment's stipends. Alone, he is able to forge a physical love life with his neighbor but his one friendship remains with Algernon, for whom he builds a large interactive maze for. Still keeping a diary from months ago, Charlie realizes that Algernon's problem solving skills are being replaced by anger and fear, just as Charlie's calmness is being replaced by alcoholism.<br /><br />Eventually Charlie contacts Alice again and he's convinced to return to the university where he shares his Algernon discoveries with the professor and the doctor. Using his still impressive intelligence, Charlie strives to understand Algernon's mental collapse and whether he too is prone to the degradation which may smite him.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />Charlie is a likable character when he has an IQ of 65; he's determined, meek, non-judgmental, and accepting. His battle with illiteracy is witnessed by his childish spelling and surface level observations but as his IQ develops, so too does his writing ability and observational skills, yet he slowly becomes less and less likable. He gains a superiority complex and treats others with verbal spars as his disdainful co-workers had done to him. His own IQ absorbs him and socializing with people becomes a sort of sport which he lacks in equipment and skill. Best fortified with alcohol, Charlie turns from an awkward intellect to a scornful belligerent.<br /><br />There's little sympathy to impart to Charlie aside from his unfortunate upbringing where his teachers gave up on his slowness and his own mother fought to disown him because of the shame he brought to the family. Charlie eventually gathers the courage to confront his family and finds that his reflective memory doesn't match the reality. He had been robbed or a prosperous childhood and is again robbed of coming to terms with the past.<br /><br />Charlie's intelligence didn't define him; the reactions from the other characters that really made Charlie who he became. Where the professors and doctors treated him like an experiment, Charlie sees himself as a miracle of science equal in humanity to those below him and those above him. (\\"Even a feeble minded man wants to be like other men\\" [139].) Where his co-workers saw him inept, Charlie sees himself as super-capable. Where his teacher saw him as a motivated yet challenged man, Charlie sees himself as a perpetual machine of intelligence. This contrast of what others thought of him versus what he sees in himself is the crux of Charlie's social division--the schism between expectations and reality--that ill-equips him to face society.<br /><br />While high-IQ Charlie is able to largely live his own life without low-IQ Charlie's menace, social awkwardness causes low-IQ Charlie to manifest as fear of rejection. Even when high-IQ Charlie combats this discomfort with alcohol, low-IQ Charlie eventually wins when his presence becomes corporeal, emotional. However, both high-IQ and low-IQ Charlies find comfort in befriending Algernon, something without expectations and without judgment.<br /><br />So, the growth of intelligence is interesting (like Poul Anderson's [[ASIN:B005HRT9LW Brain Wave]] [1954]) and also the reactions to Charlie's change, but the 216-page novel is numbed by the factors of simplicity, predictability, and lack of engaging the reader--nothing had to mulled over. Just as Charlie's understanding of society was superficial, so too is the gloss which makes Flowers for Algernon such an easy read. The novel shines pretty well when you're reading it, but leave it set for a few days and it loses its luminosity.<br /><br />------------<br /><br />It's not quite a masterpiece as Gollancz makes it out to be with their \\"SF Masterwork\\" series, but it's an interesting piece of psychology and study of IQ which makes it unique. It'd be interesting to read this with real science to back it up. This was actually done with the novelette in [[ASIN:B008Q9TPVW Introductory Psychology Through Science Fiction]] (1974), a tantalizing conceptualization with twenty-six other stories involving the science of psychology in science fiction context and broken down into seven sections: (1) Psychobiology, (2) The Learning Process, (3) Sensation and Perception, (4) Social Processes, (5) Developmental Processes, (6) Personality, and (7) Abnormal Processes and Therapy.

B00A3OJBMG|5.0|I was very skeptical about this season just as I have been about every season past the 5th.  I mean once you defeat Satan, what else is there, right?  I am glad the answer has been, \\"More than one could ever fathom!\\"  But as much as I'm loving the story as it continues to unfold with each episode, I have grown super weary of Sam's whiny B attitude.  It's almost like he wants to say to Dean, \\"I was happy and you ruined it by fighting your way back!\\" Waa waa waaaaa! If anyone should be angry it should be Dean.  He spent a YEAR in PURGATORY!  And if you want to do the degrees of separation thing, it was Sam's fault!  Like Dean pointed out through the anger of the specter, Sam drank the demon blood, that made the angels have to come to try to stop him from killing Lilith, which brought Lucifer topside, which lead to all the other crap that happened from Season 5 to the present.  Dean had no childhood, no life period because he has always been tasked with keeping Sam from crashing and burning, yet that whiny cretin can't even break Dean off a little slack for getting out of Purgatory the best way he could.  Like Dean said - albeit spurred by the wrath of the specter - Sam betrayed and deserted him, Cass did much of the same; the only being he has found thus far who seems to be trustworthy in spite of his \\"condition\\" is ironically, Benny, the \\"vampirate,\\" whom I agree has a \\"creepy [sexiness]\\" about him.  And as much as Sam is whining about missing Amelia, I can't help but be suspicious that she's going to turn out to be a demon-laced romantic distraction planted by Crowley to keep Sam FROM looking for Dean, arguably the most formidable hunter ever.  They ALL fear Dean.<br /><br />I have heard that the Winchester story was initially planned to be told in 10 chapters/seasons.  I just pray the rest of this season and however many more we are lucky enough to get, sees someone straight jack Sam and make his whiny butt look Dean in the face and acknowledge his sacrifice, the least of which was NOT him being shredded by hellhounds and spending 40 years in HELL because he wanted Sam brought back to life.  Sack up Sam and get over yourself!!east of which was NOT him being shredded by hellhounds and spending 40 years in HELL because he wanted Sam brought back to life.  Sack up Sam and get over yourself!!

B001IA96Q0|5.0|This movie is much-maligned, and rightly so. It's definitely the weakest of the series (er, \\"quadrilogy\\"?). But it still has some good moments and I'm unwilling to completely toss it out. Everybody focuses on the bad, and I will too. But first I want to point out some of the good stuff:<br /><br />What the Movie Got Right:<br /><br />1. Advancing the time era along with Harrison Ford's age. Made it seem more authentic.<br />2. The 50's nuclear weapons tests.<br />3. The Cold War mentality of that era.<br />4. Along with that, having Russians as the enemy. I thought this worked well.<br />5. Harrison Ford still does pretty good as an aged Indy.<br />6. Cate Blanchett rocked as a villain.<br />7. Bringing Karen Allen back was a good idea. That's always something I didn't like about the former movies. They bounce around with a different love interest every movie, and in that way weren't very cohesive.<br />8. The IDEA of an Amazon jungle setting was good, even if the execution was off.<br />9. Similarly, the idea of having one creepy-crawly (first snakes, then bugs and rats, now ants) was good, even if it was done stupidly.<br />10. Indy wanting to settle down. Personally, I thought this was a nice touch and kind of realistic.<br />11. Centering the movie around a \\"possibly real but still sort of mythical\\" historical object. In this case, crystal skulls. There are crystal skull objects which are real. It's too bad that right as this movie was released, the whole crystal skull thing was proven to be a big hoax.<br />12. Still entertaining.<br />13. It was not directed by Michael Bay.<br /><br />Things that Many People don't like but I think are Okay:<br /><br />1. ESP. I thought this was kind of cool, and I was okay with it. I realize it isn't real, but neither are angels, magic rocks, and magic cups.<br />2. Similarly, aliens. Seriously, why does this part of the movie bother people? I mean, the Indy series was somewhat X-files like anyway in that it usually involved classified information. And there was always a historical tie-in. In this case, the tie-in for aliens was crystal skulls. Those really do exist, but are not ancient at all and are hoaxes. But to get worked up over aliens... I don't get it. We've got God in the first movie, some Hindu gods in the second, God again in the third - why not aliens? We were all created by the Flying Spaghetti Monster, after all.<br />3. The \\"Son I never knew I had\\" story. I thought it worked well.<br />4. Mutt. The character was good to me. Could they have gotten a different actor? I wish.<br />5. The ending. Yeah it's kind of odd, but where else could it go really?<br />6. The cameo appearance of the ark. Meh. I would have prefered they left that one hidden forever.<br /><br />Things that make you want to strangle the filmmakers:<br /><br />1. Too much exposition. There's one character especially who's sole purpose in the movie is to explain everything. And if you see something in the movie you don't understand, don't worry because he'll explain it to you. This drags the movie down, BIG TIME.<br /><br />2. CGI Groundhog. I mean, come on... seriously? George Lucasitis at its worst.<br />3. CGI Ants. That act in a way that is completely different from ants in real life.<br />4. CGI Jungle.<br />5. CGI Monkeys. Swinging through the trees with Shia LaBeouf, no less.<br />6. CGI. In fact, pretty much every scene in this movie involving CGI is a complete fail. It looks fake. It looks stupid. It seems gratuitous. You can pin this on Georgie Lucas's personal addiction to CGI. He has rose-colored glasses when it come to the stuff. Insisted on making 3 movies filled with it, and probably would have taken the human actors out of those too if he could. When confronted with how fake it looks, he just says, \\"It's no faker-looking than using a puppet.\\" No George, you're wrong. It IS faker-looking than using a puppet. MUCH faker! So he throws it into his Indiana Jones movie. Why? No reason, really. The groundhog is a good example. It's just there for atmosphere, apparently. He couldn't put womp rats in because it's not the Mos Eisley spaceport, so he settled for groundhogs.<br /><br />7. Snake scene. Yes, I realize this was meant to be funny. However, it wasn't funny. It was dumb.<br />8. Driving over a cliff. I don't know. I realize we had similar moments in the other movies. Just seems like this one wasn't done as well. It just seemed off.<br /><br />9. The refrigerator scene. Like many others, this one threw me off from the very beginning. Now I realize we had a similar incident in Temple of Doom... Where Indy jumped off an airplane with a raft, landed on the side of a snowy mountain, slid down the mountain, went off a cliff, landed in the water, etc. And even though that too was unlikely, it still seemed SLIGHTLY plausible. But flying hundreds of feet through the air in a refrigerator, crashing to the ground, and then walking right out? I'm sorry, it's just too much of a stretch for me. (Sequels sometimes have this problem, where they are trying to push the envelope but end up pushing it too far. I felt the same way about some of the goofier scenes in Live Free or Die Hard.)<br />10. Shia LaBeouf. Need I say more?<br /><br />So there you have it. Yeah, there's a lot of bad but I did want to also point out the good. This movie is a low point, but it's still better than the boring TV series. (Okay TV series fans, there. I said it. Feel free to trash me now!)<br /><br />There are several things that go wrong in this movie and it is difficult to pin down exactly where it failed the worst. It's hard to say it's the story, because Temple of Doom had a similarly non-epic story, and it's a great movie. To me a lot of it is the overuse and reliance on CGI. This was something that was new to the Indy series. A little bit - where needed - would have been okay. But in usual George Lucas fashion, he went over the top with it. It really hurts the movie, I think.<br /><br />So what if you take out / ignore the bad CGI? Is it a good movie? I dunno. It fails when it comes to the humor quite a bit, also. And I have to say, the story is pretty random and hard to follow.<br /><br />Well, so much for saying good things about this movie. I gave it my best, folks!<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />UPDATE: So I've watched this movie again, 5 years after the first time I saw it. I have to say, it has aged pretty well. I am upping my review to 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, I believe that I complained too much about the CGI. Seeing this again, it wasn't as bad as I had remembered. It was all done quite well, actually. It all looks very real.<br /><br />The main thing to me is that in hindsight, this movie \\"fits\\" just right. It wasn't the greatest but it certainly wasn't bad at all. The movie was absolutely action packed, and my kids and I both enjoyed it.<br /><br />I think this movie came across to me the same way The Last Crusade did. The first time I saw that movie, I wasn't all that thrilled with it. But over time, it aged well. And I grew to love it. I think I'm finding myself in the same place with the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />Thanks for the all the comments below! Have a good day :)

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm a late-comer to the Downton Abbey series. But I was immediately hooked after watching the first episode of Season 1 on my new roku box. After gobbling up the whole first season within a week, a friend bought me this, Season 2, which I sat glued to through within the next week.  Set in the pre-World War 1 era of Britain, the series drew me in with its authentic depiction of life among both the wealthy and the servant class.  Compelling stories emerge from the lives and relationships of all of the characters as the war approaches and changes everything.  I highly recommend this intelligent series.

B00962341U|4.0|There is no question that Leona Lewis is an extremely talented singer. \\"Glassheart\\" is an album that seems to portray a darker ambiance (mood) than her previous albums.The songs for the most part are good in spite of the fact that (in my opinion) there is a lack of a good hit single. \\"Lovebird\\" is one of my favorite songs with a nice melodic hook to it. \\"Shake You Up\\" is interesting because it's a different type (style) of song than Leona usually sings.(Leona can \\"sing the phone book\\" and I would like her to try and include more variety of styles on her albums.)<br />The main motive in \\"Favourite Scar\\" is definitely sampled from another song but I couldn't recall the title. Thanks to Shelley who replied to my original post, I can tell you the motive was sampled from the song \\"Head Over Heals\\" by Tears For Fears.<br /><br />\\"Sugar\\" (on the bonus disc) is a catchy song with an infectious melody.<br /><br />It's a mystery as to why the album hasn't been released yet in the USA. I think it's because they want the album's release to coincide with the US tour dates.(Of course this is only my speculation based on various articles I have read about the album.)<br /><br />In summary,\\"Glassheart\\" is a good album (better than her last effort) but I wouldn't consider it a masterpiece. The songs  have a dark ambiance and are enjoyable to listen to. Leona's vocals are great and that's what makes the songs sound good. The album (in my opinion) needs a good hit single so it can obtain more radio play and public recognition.

B007T99ENE|3.0|Sweet Tooth - written in typical McEwan style. Set in a time of change, particularly for women, but when women are still viewed as less superior than men. It's an easy read but if you like solid endings, this is not the book for you. I was not sure if I liked the main character and it maybe that McEwan was not a fan of his main character, placing her in a story that seems her purpose in life is to find a husband rather than make a serious contribution to the world.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Pocket edition is a fun distraction when I need one away from my computer. It could use some drag and drop elements for tool bar allocation and I can't seem to find about half of the recipes; armor, buckets, etc. Definitely worth the $7 for entertainment value, though.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Regardless of his past indiscretions, I like Schwarzenegger.  The book is pretty well-written and an easy read. He is driven, funny, and extremely positive. Go Arnold!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|This albums is fantastic. My only disappointment is that I did not know about it sooner. Each track has a timeless feel that is comparable to Bob Dylan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book is an amazing sequel to the hunger games !! Couldnt stop reading till the last page :) A must read trilogy !
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use both the Weather Channel app and this one. They compliment each other very nicely.  Where one lacks, the other fills in the gaps.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|Nicolas Cage returns as Johnny Blaze, a man who made a deal with the devil and has regretted it ever since, but when a mysterious man seeks him out and asks him to protect a boy being pursued by mercenaries, Blaze sees his chance to finally rid the curse that turns him into Ghost Rider in the presence of evil. Only the mercenaries aren't just working for anyone, and the task will put Blaze head-to-head with the very evil he's been running from.<br /><br />There's really not much to say about `Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance' other than it's a fun, mindless ride directed by the guys who did `Crank' and is shot in the same quick-cut, hyper-kinetic vein that they used in that film and it really injects some intensity into the action, that and the improved special effects make for some impressive set-pieces. I can't really speak to character development, because there's little of that and the story is on shaky ground as it is, but then that's not really why you see this film. It's perfect for if you just want to see something where you don't have to think too much.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Very exciting book. I had watched the movie first, so it was nice picturing the account played out. Book is more thorough than movie.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I really just absolutely love the personalization qualities of this application.  I could play it all day every day. Better than all others.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Very good, the product arrived on time in a very good contitions, I am very happy with it! Go fot it with not problem
B00846REIS|5.0|The story is close enough to Fifty Shades w/ a different twist.<br />I just hated the fact that Entwined to You will not be released until May 2013. :(
0316228532|1.0|JK Rowling's trend toward the negative and misery started about the 4th Harry Potter book (about the time she married), culminating in this much-too-long epistle containing nothing but the awful, jealous, disrespectful, jaundiced and crass views of life. It is a string of gossipy events typical of the British, given their love of tabloid drivel.<br /><br />No character in the book has a good day, any joy, a smile. It is 100% dark. There is no plot, no character development (they are all alike), save the two evil teens, Crystal and Fats, who have no redeeming qualities, of course.<br /><br />Perhaps the British will love this book as they do their ridiculous tabloids; however, I doubt American readers will bother with another JK Rowling narrative of the trite and boring.<br /><br />This book was a total waste of money and time. I saw it through to the end (on audio, with an equally boring reader who probably did his best with such poor copy to get through), hoping for improvement. It did not come.
B0043RSIUK|5.0|Whether a Follett fan or not, do get this book and enjoy all that the author has to offer.<br /><br />Richard
B002YMWPUA|4.0|An interesting film that explores the psychological experience of the prisoners during the Troubles of Northern Ireland. A good film showing the life and death of Bobby Sands and his hunger strike. Any person interested in Irish history should look into this.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|When you open a Grisham novel, certain expectations are there: A well-constructed script, a twist or two, characters that will act unexpectedly - than turn around and do it all over again. The Racketeer delivers exactly what you'd expect and then some.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|this is the best angry birds game yet.  they did a great job combining both worlds but why do I have to pay $2.99 then $1.99 for one more world would be 5 stars if not for that
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Very fascinating application that presents videos on a variety of subjects not commonly considered. Presenters are thoughtful and interesting. Well worth the time investment!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I absolutely love these games.  I have the first and the third one. Please hurry and come out with the second one.
0061801313|5.0|I bought this for my wife she has not put them down until she finished. She has read the first 8 books and she is starting on the 9th.
0385535147|5.0|This story, as Grisham mentions at the end of the book, was not based on reality.  It was, however, a very enjoyable yarn with many plot twists.  To all future readers:  Don't believe all the \\"facts\\" as the story enfolds.  Many things are not as they seem.  Don't believe everything you read until you read the ENTIRE BOOK and reach the conclusion.  The story starts off with an inmate who figures out a way to cut his jail time in half, by \\"helping\\" the government convict someone for the murder of a federal judge.  He does that and is released.  Then the real story begins.<br /><br />Without telling any more of the story, let me say that the story was quite enjoyable, and could eventually be made into a movie.  It was that good.  I would recommend this book to anyone that likes Grisham books.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|[[ASIN:B0030ZOYHC Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />This is the first time seeing anything to do with the series, so I was unsure what to expect.  I read all of the other reviews that gave the title 5/5 and raved about it, so I decided to buy it and see for myself.  All I really knew about the series is that it had to do with gigantic mechs, but I had no idea about anything else in the movie plot.  I found myself pretty confused in the beginning, since I had no idea what the \\"Angels\\" were, where they came from, and what was going on.  By the end of the movie, I had a slightly better idea, but I think the movie could have explained a little more and given a little more of the back-story.<br /><br />Technical Aspects<br /><br />From the packaging, down to the art style of the animation, everything is top-notch.  The Blu-ray packaging is really cool; the interior case has this kind of purplish-iridescent plastic (doesn't really impact anything, but was a really unique addition.  Really cool.).  It also comes with a small art-book (I haven't really looked at the whole thing yet).<br /><br />The surround sound is really awesome.  I was really impressed with how well the sound and animation is.  I have the Blu-ray edition of \\"Ponyo,\\" and this movie has some really awesome surround sound, so I kind of use this as my benchmark.  Evangelion 1.11 stacks up very well with \\"Ponyo,\\" as far as surround-sound goes (excellent).<br /><br />The animation, and the intricate detail of the machinery of the city are really awesome.<br /><br />Story/summary<br /><br />The main character is a whiny, emasculated male, and that was pretty annoying to watch.  I cared more about the other protagonist, the girl Rei, than I did the main protagonist (she was much more of a likable character, and showed real bravery).  Regardless, I give the movie a 4/5, because, even though the back-story isn't as fleshed out as it could be, and the main character isn't very likable (andannoying, actually), I still think the movie as a whole is very good.  Also, part of the one star that I took away from a perfect score was because of my personal taste--I really did not think the mechs were as cool as I expected.<br /><br />I've also purchased Evangelion 2.22, and after I watch that, I will have more time to reflect on the first movie (I suspect if you watch both together, it will improve the overall experience).
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|I really liked this book because this book has a twist on every page and it makes you want to read more.
1439152802|4.0|This is a very beguiling story with lots of subtle hints, but, I must admit, I was flummoxed until almost the very end trying to figure out, along with Laurel, her dying mother's secret. Juxapositioning events in modern-day England with past events during the London Blitz of 1941, Morton does a fine job of mesmerizing her reader in this mildly Gothic, psychological mystery that is steeped in intrigue. Well, it's not really a mystery, per se, so much as a complex machination of four deeply-flawed characters whose lives intertwine. It opens with the killing of a minor protagonist, but we know who did it. The mystery--Dorothy's secret--lies not in the what, but in the why--the participatory, almost heroic reasons that causes her to...Well, I'd spoil it for you if I said anything more. But in following Laurel's quest to uncover and then eventually keep her mother's secret, we are methodically and spell-bindingly led to the astonishing answers.<br /><br />\\"The Secret Keeper\\" is, as all of Kate Morton's novels are, my kind of book. It has just about everything a good read should have: believably real-life characters; intrigue; history; lasting romance; descriptive, narrative passages; and a strikingly fresh, unassuming writing style that fluidly carries the plot line along to its unexpected surprise ending. This is a novel that kept me captivated--and nearly flummoxed--from the opening paragraph on through to the bitter-sweet ending.<br /><br />A relatively young Australian-based author, Morton combines her vast knowledge of English history with her love of both the dramatic arts and English literature--she holds a degree in each--into a rich tapestry whose thematic threads will keep you, as it did me, thoroughly engrossed. To say that Morton is a great writer, one who should appeal to adult readers everywhere, is almost an understatement. But, to tell the truth, it's not a secret.<br /><br />This review was written by June J. McInerney, Literary Blogger and author of \\"The Basset Chronicles\\".
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Dare I say more than Iron Man.  Well it's close.  I'll say for sure, for me, it's much better than Iron Man 2.  Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner.  He seems like the right fit with the character.  Out of all the people who have played the part he is the only one that reminds me of Bill Bixby, who I think is still the best Banner but Mark does a great job.  Each character had a fair amount of screen time, it's not all just iron man which it could have easily turned into.  Robert Downey Jr. is so good that he leaves you wanting more. I Each brought something to the table.  The breakout star being the CGI Hulk. For the first time in CGI Hulks I was able to put aside the fact that he is pure simulation and concentrate on his personality. Something that I feel was lost in the prior movies.  His interactions with Thor and Loki was really good.  The only one I didn't care too much for was Captain America but I din't care for his movie very much either. He grows on you after a while though. Joss Whedon did a awesome job and I look forward to Avengers 2.
B0014DC0AK|5.0|Even though the band ceased to exist in 2001 following the death of frontman Chuck Schuldiner (who died from brain cancer), the sixth album from Floridian death metal icons Death, quite simply, never ceases to amaze. Surprisingly progressive, superbly catchy, and adherently groovy, \\"Symbolic\\" (which was originally released in 1995, and re-released with four demo tracks in 2008) is a very rare find in death metal because it is a positively air-guitar-able album. Schuldiner and Bobby Koelble both come-up with gob after gob of excellent, satisfying, and instinctively memorable riffs, technically-impressive leads, and dazzling solo runs. Meanwhile, bassists Kelly Conlon (who would later go on to join Monstrosity) and Steve DiGiorgio (who is also a proud member of Sadus and Autopsy) lay down some wicked bass lines, memorable grooves, and even toss in the odd solo or two. And the band is rounded out by another indisputably legendary musician, drummer Gene Hoglan, who is also in fine form, here. His drumming may be mainly centered around blasts and thrash beats, but he is nonetheless a very godly skinsman, and his top-notch talents -- i.e. blistering feet work and inhuman dexterity -- are proudly displayed all throughout these nine songs. Plus, but no matter how technical his playing may be, it is always air-drummer worthy. (It is easy to imagine Hoglan inspiring generations of fans across the globe to get behind a trapkit.)<br /><br />Finally, as with the music, the vocals are confrontational, influential, and always very memorable. (For this effort, Chuck adopted a newfound low, deathly growl to go along with his signature black metal-esque rasps, one that he would go on to use in later releases such as 1999's swansong \\"Sound Of Perseverance.\\")  Add consistently epic and mature songwriting/arrangements and an excellent production job (courtesy of Chuck) to the mix, and the end result is one of the clear-cut crown jewels on the death metal timeline. It is also easily one of the most influential pieces of music in the genre's history.<br /><br />Death begin the title track with a very great and catchy, chugging, abrasively grinding main riff that snowballs into a blinding onslaught of blistering licks, interesting, beeping bass lines, and pummeling blast beats. Top it all off with a nice-and-long (and wailing) melodic guitar solo section, and the end result is a very addictive set opener. Next comes, \\"Zero Tolerance,\\" which aside from featuring powerful, shout-worthy vocals and inspiring, rebellious lyrics, clearly takes a page out of the Judas Priest playbook, as it lets fly a bunch of excellent, mazy, winding solos and lovely, epic-sounding guitar harmonies. And a pounding doom metal riff is included in the chorus, too. \\"Empty Words\\" features an epic arrangement, opening on a quiet note, with docile strings and melodic hand percussion. The electric guitars eventually come screaming in, though, unleashing a handful of fiery, technical solos, and creating a muscular, airtight rhythm complete with thundering thrash beats/double bass drumming and persistent, grumbling bass lines. As a result, \\"Empty Words\\" may be a mostly melodic and first-and-foremost mid-tempo song, but it certainly does not lack any potency or heaviness.<br /><br />\\"Sacred Serenity\\" features a similarly epic arrangement. It begins sounding almost like a cut of pure progressive rock, with a funky, Primus-esque slapped bass part and bouncy drum beat in the intro. And again, the guitars come ripping on through with impressive, pyrotechnic soloing, and hooky, head-bangable riffing. A dreary, soft string breakdown is included later on, but this song is mostly highlighted by its excellent, epically complex soloing and deft, technical bass work throughout. \\"Sacred Serenity\\" is also of note for the way it builds and gains momentum off of itself. \\"1,000 Eyes\\" augments its machine-gun riffage with booming, bottom-heavy bass lines, and a rhythmic, galloping drum beat. Things occasionally downshift to adopt some more mid-tempo chugging, but most of the song is blistering. \\"Without Judgement\\" is backed by industrial-strength chug and churn guitar slices, and is anchored by more exceptional bass work -- including very steady, grumbling bass grooves and a short but sweet bass solo. There are a few down-tempo melodic parts (with soaring guitar harmonies and high-flying melodic solos); but they only help to add punch and delicious contrast to the fast, thrashy parts.<br /><br />Following that comes something that just might be the best death metal song ever. (It is at least one of the best, and that's for certain.) Its name is \\"Crystal Mountain\\" -- need I say more?! Well, OK, no review would be complete without mentioning the gobs of eargasmic soloing, impeccable cymbal rides (cheers, Gene!), extremely catchy vocals and memorable lyrics, and awesome, flowing outro found here. Here, the band lay deliciously melodic leads on top of equally-as-tasty Spanish/acoustic guitars, and do so to unforgettable effect. Then, Death offset \\"C.M.,\\" which is the album's most melodic and progressive cut, with \\"Misanthrope,\\" which is a breakneck, and fairly devastating barrage of aggressive tempos, blazing guitars, and skull-splitting drum slamming. (Hoglan sure does not skimp on the blasts, here.) Finally, the set wraps up with another terrifically epic piece in \\"Perennial Quest,\\" a sprawling, near eight-and-a-half minute long set closer. Most of it is relatively restrained, and it even features occasional slow and melodic breakdowns (the acoustic breakdown near the end is just plain gorgeous!). And only occasionally does the song erupt into a blast of propulsive, thrashing, blast beat-aided speed metal, thus making the arrangements brilliantly dynamic. Plus, another shred-tastic, vertigo-inducing solo section is included, as well. Needless to say, it is one excellent way to end an already fantastic album.<br /><br />Progressive death metal, death-thrash, melodic death metal -- throw out the categories, because \\"Symbolic\\" is THE ultimate DM album. Even seventeen years after it was initially released, it remains the crowning achievement for each band member involved in the making of it, and one of the most essential pieces of music that a metalhead can buy!ccasionally downshift to adopt some more mid-tempo chugging, but most of the song is blistering. \\"Without Judgement\\" is backed by industrial-strength chug and churn guitar slices, and is anchored by more exceptional bass work -- including very steady, grumbling bass grooves and a short but sweet bass solo.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoy John Grisham and the way he writes.  This book was quite suspenseful. I really guessed it was another character, who was at fault. Therefore, it was a surprise conclusion for me.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent series with well-written & well played-out plots. There are a number of key characters & they are well-defined & well-acted. In all, top rated.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Let me start by saying - I love Nelson DeMille and his John Corey books and I couldn't wait for The Panther to finally come out.  I had read The Lion and, after re-reading it after 9/11, was amazed at how spot on he was to the Middle East conflicts and even seemed to predict possible terrorist opportunities before they happened.  I'll be honest and admit that my knowledge of the Middle East and our involvement there is pretty limited so I did appreciate his history lessons and extensive knowledge of Yemeni and its culture in the book The Panther.  But other than that and some clever John Corey banter, this book was a complete bore.  According to my Kindle - no action happened until more than 80% through and even then, it was not up to DeMille's usual passion.  I'm disappointed, but still looking forward to his next release!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I loved this movie.  I'm pretty picky and cynical and I had heard bad things about this movie before seeing it, and in fact had anticipated watching it just to make fun of it.  But no way.  It's very exciting, scary and has great special effects, like the wild skycraper climb, which I won't say anything more about so as not to spoil it.  Forget the bad reviews, go ahead and see this and enjoy it however you want.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Dan Reynolds lead singer - harmonizes flawlessly with the band.  The songs are emotional, yet upbeat.  Some of the songs weave melodies through story in a way that has you holding your breath to hear the words - others just have you tapping your toes and stomping your feet.<br /><br />I got to see Imagine Dragons in concert in Portland Oregon last month -they had the crowd screaming and stomping through every song.  Their live performance was beyond amazing.  Some bands sound great in a studio but don't have enough \\"bells and whistles\\" live to make a concert work.  That is not the case with Imagine Dragons.<br /><br />My FAVORITE album of 2012 - I've bought it for friends and they 100% agree - Night Visions absolutely ROCKS!<br /><br />I cannot wait for their sophomore effort - I do not doubt that it will be worth every penny.<br /><br />P.S.  You Tube their videos - amazing!
1469984202|5.0|Well somehow my old man discovered this new great writer named Hugh Howey. It seems he's writing some great novels that land somewhere between the sci-fi and dystopian shelves. He snatched up the Wool Omnibus and greedily devoured the entire thing as quickly as possible. Normal for me, actually, but no so for my old man. He reads so much for work and just to keep up with the news and all that he doesn't really read much fiction at all. Well, till now. He read this whole series and when finished immediately loaded up the Kindle with the prequel. Of course that was just as awesome and led to another late night virtual trip to Amazon (thank God for Kindle instant downloads, right, can I get an amen?) to scoop up the Molly Fyde series too. Reader, I was all astonishment. That is, till I took a peek myself at Wool. Just a peek to find out what all the fuss was about. I didn't expect much honestly 'cos I haven't read any good sci-fi since Ender's Game. Well, yeah, till now. This is good stuff yall! I have to admit we both pictured Katniss (Hunger Games) as the heroine even though she was the wrong age. Juliette, the heroine of these Wool novels is like Katniss though. She's a very practical kind of smart girl that is wonderful in a crisis. She's full of integrity and does so many cool things you just can't help but cheer for her. I can't wait for this to be a movie.<br />I guess I should write a little something about what Wool is about. It's the way off future and the setting is a massive underground silo full of people all kind of seperated by the kind of work they do. No one seems to know why they are there and it's forbidden to ask why and to want to go above ground. If you do that, you are suited up with some handy wool cleaning pads on the front of your suit and, bob's your uncle, popped out the airlock. There you are supposed to \\"clean\\" the sort of windows there so everyone inside can see outside. Yep, so they can see the wasteland above. You've got just a few short minutes to do that before you are killed by the poisoned atmospere. Everyone wonders why the condemned go ahead with the cleaning. Why they don't just flip 'em the bird and walk off. Of course, our cool super heroine, Juliette, has a different experience up top. Yall, it changes everything. Totally cool, kick ass book. Can't wait to dive into the prequel now. (First Shift-Legacy:Part of The Silo Series, Wool)
B004SIP7US|5.0|This review is for the Blu Ray version of this movie.<br />I'm not going to get into a critique of the film but suffice to say, the movie, in my opinion is very good.<br />Granted, some of the actors are a little too \\"pretty\\" to be historically accurate, but Daniel Day Lewis is amazing in his portrayal of \\"The Butcher\\".<br /><br />The clarity on this Blu ray is excellent, but what I like the most about it, that it consolidates the film and all the \\"extras\\" onto a single disc.<br /><br />The 2 disc version has a \\"continuation\\" of the movie on Disc 2, which is a little bit of a pain.  Other than that, this Blu ray version includes all the extras, and even one I didn't notice on the 2 disc set, which is a tour of the \\"sets\\" with Martin Scorcesse.  Overall, excellent.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. Dr. Alexander writes from the heart, trying to explain an experience that the usual words can't describe. Even the non believer will have to stop and think because the scientific angle of this experience is documented by modern technology. Thank you Dr. Alexander for sharing it with us and giving us something to look forward to.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game!! I love being able to have friends to send you stuff, and connect on facebook. I have always loved hidden object games, and this is a great one!! I highly recommend  this game!!
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I was very skeptical about this movie, however, from the first minute - I love it!!! It was bright, hilarious, sarcastically smart. I am very picky. And this movie got my attention, and I'd love to see it again and again.
B00817ZRRU|4.0|I found this book to be very interesting, but only from chapter 5 on. Up until then,<br />the characters talk about business and finance, and less about the plot. Being an<br />older teen, you can imagine how boring that was for me. Parts of the book having to<br />do with Lisbeth Salander got me through until I found the book good enough not to put<br />down. The main character, Mikael, in my eyes, is dull and difficult to enjoy, but I<br />found enjoyment reading parts of the book he was in because of how man times \\"coffee\\"<br />is mentioned throughout the dialogue and the character's actions. I thoroughly enjoyed<br />the plot, seeing as I love murder mysteries. Plus, other attributes, like abuse, keep<br />the characters well developed and interesting. It was a great book, and I plan on<br />continuing the trilogy.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I usually don't play games on my Kindle/phone because I get bored really quickly.<br />This game was AWESOME. Keeps you on your toes with a timer, keeps you guessing, and uses your brain. Good game, wish it lasted longer or they had more.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|I read this book on a friend's recommendation and I wasn't feeling 100% positive I would actually enjoy it. I was wrong! The book is well written, was as historically accurate as it could be, and the plot twists were certainly unexpected. Each time you thought you 'knew' the character, they would change direction or a new layer would be revealed. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will read the others written by Tom Rob Smith.
B0054SMID0|5.0|If you read the Lincoln Lawyer by Michael Connelly you will likely enjoy this movie.<br />Matthew McConaughey does a great job; it was good to see him act in something<br />other than a romantic comedy.  I hope there are more movies based on Connelly's<br />series with attorney Mickey Haller.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love this game! Have played many hidden object games and not one like this! The fun is in knowing more &quot;rooms&quot; will be available once you reach different levels in the game.  You don't feel stuck looking at the same scene over and over.  Highly recommend!
B002G1YPH0|3.0|The thing comes in 3 parts. The base , The part you attach to the base , and the Heatsink+Fan.<br /><br />It is all a pain to install. I had a alright time with the base , just had to line up the holes to the proper notches. The second two parts is where the real pain comes in. The attachment to the base doesn't attach to the Heatsink+Fan. It attaches the Heatsink to the CPU like a clamp.<br /><br />Hard to explain. Should have taken pictures. Just trust me. This part is really hard to install properly.<br /><br />It is absolutely huge and works fine once properly installed though. Which I am hoping I have installed it properly.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|Hi, Peter Sowatskey here.  With six novels on Kindle I needed the secret of John's success.  I didn't even have to send Donavan Creed out to wring it out of him.<br />I was, for ten years, a well paid commission salenman.  When John points out that after the writing is done you have a product you have to sell is a transition few writers figure out.  He tells you how.<br />When I started writing seriously 12 years ago at the age of 61, I just wrote.  I like writing.  I made a mistake.  Had John's book been available to me then, I would have known that the writing is only 50% of the job.  Getting dedicated readers is the other 50%.  I'm using the concepts in the book.  I'll catch up someday.  Be smarter than me.  Get the balance right sooner.  You'll be a happy person.<br />Buy John's book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was a fast read, one I didn't want to put down. Right away I wondered what \\"apart time\\" meant. Was his wife dead? I liked his internal thoughts, his desire to be a better person so the \\"apart time\\" would end. I sympathized with his mother as she tried to help her son achieve a normal life all the while dealing with a husband I probably would have bopped over the head. Each of the characters, even the ones I didn't like, came alive. And best of all, the story had a satisfying ending.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|Nelson,<br /><br />As of course you know, John Corey is a terrific character.  Funny, fearless and appealingly predictable. He is getting a little \\"P Whipped\\" though. But even so I definitely wouldn't mind tipping a few with him and shooting the breeze.  I really don't want to complain to much because I friggin' love the whole series and am appreciative and eager to dive right in whenever you pop out a Corey book.  I usually finish it in one long sitting.  This one, however, took a little longer, and I even had trouble staying focused while reading on the can, and that never happens.  The middle part was slightly painful to get thru.  Just slightly.  It took me 3 days.  I can't put my finger on why exactly, but it just didn't hold my attention as much as usual.  Maybe it was because I was chewing Khat in an effort to really get a flavor of the situation.  Whatever the reason, though, it didn't have the typical exciting flow.  Also, the Panther was more of a punk than a terrorist, and I found myself hoping Corey could've shot him earlier in the story, Buck too.  I know it would've probably shortened the book, but some times sacrifices are in order.  One last thing, can Corey please kill Ted Walsh already.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|Hey great story and great special effects in the movie.  It came in on scheduled.  The price was better than found in the stores.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|Like _The Bad Seed_ on PCP. This movie should surely cure anyone still thinking about having children. Why risk it?
B0088EDMMS|5.0|We just love this movie.  We were so happy to finally have it on blu ray.  It's the best Halloween movie.  We watch it allot and our nephews and nieces enjoy watching it with us.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Absolutely loved this game!!! Very challenging but they have hints and walk throughs. It was a lil scary I'll admit but I loved it! Its not one of those games that your done within an hour or so. You definately get your money's worth. I recommend this game for sure and I'm not usually the type to leave reviews. Buy it!!
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|I got this after hearing all the positive reviews, i do like it so far. The acting is horrible though, i do know i'll get blasted by the fanboys who troll this particular series on amazon (see the comments under every negative review). Truth is the acting is bad, porn quality bad, in-fact their are times when you'll catch yourself subconsciously wondering why the Cinemax music hasn't started up, or why the actors still have their clothes on.<br />Regardless, the makeup is awesome and if you can live with bad acting then go for it. Their are only six episodes in the first season.<br />Also as far as the bad acting, try googling \\"Walking Dead, bad acting\\" to see how many other people agree with me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Immensely enjoyed it ! Couldn't put it down & didn't want it to end. A little different than his previous novels.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait until the third book comes out!  What an enchanting story.  I like the mystery behind it.  I want to be this couple.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Wonderfully produced. If you like her music you'll like this concert bluray video.<br /><br />Seven more words to meet the minimum 20.
159420411X|5.0|Book deals with making the distinction of important information(signal) and noise. The book explains the task making predictions in different settings and why they are successful or not. Its well written and a background in mathematics is not needed to follow the ideas, although many references are provided for those who want to dig deeper into the subjects.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this book and have recommended it to friends already.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I'm still reading this book...which is a reflection of my opinion of this book; it definitely hasn't kept my attention.  Although I'm a fan of several Grisham novels, this plot moves very slowly and doesn't keep me in suspense. The characters are not easy to relate to, so as a reader, I don't really care about what happens. Save your money and visit your local library if you need to read this one.
B009Q6ADG0|4.0|9/13/15  UPDATE TO PREVIOUS REVIEW: To My Detractors:  Sigh....  To Badanimal:  Do people not comprehend what they read any more?  I said that I WAS TOLD that I have an ALMOST perfect ear, NOT that I have perfect pitch.  Regardless of whatever artist takes your fancy, hearing (in some cases, excessive) in/exhalations does not make for a good song or style.  But diverse people have diverse tastes, so if that's your thing, good for you.  As for me, there are plenty of different types of music/artists that I enjoy listening to that don't in/exhale almost every verse, including artists who were singing long before either you or I was born and who are considered some of the greats in music.  I also enjoy listening to plenty of contemporary 'new' artists who also can't be heard to in/exhale and are also considered great artists.  AND:   ....&#34;it's schooled it's all about technique and sounding just so.....  .... &#34;until I heard it done later by pop artists such as Tori Amos who does this a lot and which basically helped create her unique style....&#34;  While some styles may be ok for some artists, there are also quite a few songs that don't translate well when performed by other artists.  Can you imagine hearing &#34;Skyfall&#34; sung by a Rap artist?  Also, however well of a songwriter someone may be, some of them cannot/should not sing what they write.   (See last paragraph of part of AP article below.  Incidentally, I'm not just talking about Adele here, but a singer could be the best singer in the world and still miss on some songs.  Look at the many professional, very popular, artists who completely flub &#34;The Star-Spangled Banner.&#34;                                                             -------------------------------------------------------------- To CRAB  I didn't say having a twang disqualified her from singing certain songs.  I merely meant that the slight twang I heard in the recording of Skyfall that I heard disrupted the flow of the singingand makes one think of country/western music, not the style of music this was going for, particularly as it's for a James Bond movie that has nothing about country music in it.  Perhaps this will help explain the 'twang:'  From an article about Adele  2011–13:  21 and worldwide recognition  Adele released her second studio album, 21, on 24 January 2011 in the UK and 22 February in the US.  She said that the album was inspired by the breakup with her former partner.  The album's sound is described as classic and contemporary country and roots music.  The change in sound from her first album was the result of her bus driver playing contemporary music from Nashville when she was touring the American South, and the title reflected the growth she had experienced in the prior two years                          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  However, having said the above, below is something I recently found that makes me believe that perhaps some, if not all, of the recordings I heard may not have been Adele after all.  May 31, 2013 from an Associated Press article: LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There are about 600 versions of Adele's Oscar-winning song &#34;Skyfall&#34; on the Spotify subscription music service. Not one of them features Adele. Adele's label, XL Recordings, keeps her music off of all-you-can-listen subscription plans until download sales peter out. In the meantime, copycat artists fill the void, racking up royalty revenue, often before customers realize they've been listening to someone else.  .........  The services allow users to store songs on their devices as long as they keep paying  But because such a vast selection can be stored online in the so-called cloud, when listeners search for popular songs, they often find oddball renditions.    .............Some songs are even more famous than the originals. Which do you think of first, Aretha Franklin's soaring 1967 version of &#34;Respect,&#34; or Otis Redding's original from two years earlier? How about Jimi Hendrix's funky 1968 rendition of &#34;All Along the Watchtower&#34;? Does anyone even remember that Bob Dylan wrote and sang it in a release six months before?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PREVIOUS REVIEW:  I am inserting my edit of my previous review (see below) here so anyone reading this won't miss it.  Since I posted my original reivew I have since read that Adele suffered some type of injury/damages to her vocal chords which might explain the quality in her voice that I heard in all the samples I listened to before submitting my review.  If that is the case, can someone suggest a site I can go to where I can hear her voice before the damage/injury?  Thank you.  --------------- Original Review ------------------ I love the music and the lyrics are superb, not only good for this movie, but perfect for any 'end of civilization' scenario, however the singer, dare I say it, stinks.  This would have been a much better piece if it were sung by someone else, almost anyone else.  Although I have a nice speaking voice, I don't have a very good singing voice, but have been told by numerous people (people who would know) that I do have an almost perfect ear.  Therefore, perhaps I'm hearing nuances that others don't on this recording, but I cannot count the sounds Adele's putting out as good singing.  I'd never heard Adele sing before hearing this recording of Skyfall, so in the interests of doing her justice, before writing this review I listened closely to other recordings made by her and she has the same type of sound (whine/twang) in almost all of them.  There are certain types of lyrics/pitches her voice just cannot carry or do justice to. Do the same as I did and, if you're being completely honest and/or aren't tone deaf, you'll notice it for yourself.  I suppose the twang is OK if countywestern were the only music she sang, but not in the majority of the pieces of hers I've researched and definitely not in this one.  Not only that but in this piece specifically, you can hear every breath she takes.  IMHO, one of the marks of an excellent singer is NOT being able to hear them taking a breath.  While there are some songs practically anyone can sing adequately, there are others that need to be matched with just the right singer.  Unfortunately in this case, Adele is not it.  While I can give the music and lyrics 5 stars, I have to give Adele less than zero.

B007SGM084|5.0|Since I bought this books, I`ve never stop reading them. They are addictive. I like the way the author describes the places and the main characters`feelings.
0525478817|5.0|originally posted here (english at the bottom): [...]     First of all, you have to know that I don't cry easily. Well, I hardly cry. Almost never. Then books like this come into my hands (meaning: books written by John Green) and you know, you just know that it's better be prepared with tons of tissues because you're going to need them. And you'll need them ALL. John, oh, John, why do you do this to us? Why are you keep giving us books like Looking for Alaska (my copy has been read so many times it's falling into pieces), An abundace of Katherine and The fault in our stars? Don't you know my heart has problems? Do you want to kill me? Probably yes.    I've just finished the book and I have to say that it holds a very important meaning for me, for central issue of the story, and it broke my heart into tiny little pieces. That's why I loved it, because when a book can engage you so much then it's okay to accept to have your heart broken, because, really, you can forgive a book like this if it makes you feel a wide range of emotions. And you can forgive it for being poetically sad (on a side note: I hate poetically sad books. John Green can make me love those, too.).     Hazel and Augustus are two teenagers who faced cancer. Hazel cannot breath normally and knows her life won't be very long. Augustus is fine, but has only one 'real' leg. Hazel feels like a grenade, about to go off and to hurt the people she loves with her death; she loves tv shows and adores an author who wrote a book with an open ending. She'd die to meet him and talk to him and Augustus will make her dream come true. Even if things won't go as Hazel planned, still something extremely good will happen.    What can I say? I do not have words to express my opinion on this book. I won't do it justice and, frankly, I don't want even to try it. I'm not that good. This book was pure emotion for me. It made me hurt and suffer and laugh and cry so much I used my whole box of Kleenex.    Green's characters are always a bit surreal. Sure, almost believable, but extraordinary deep, brilliant, sarcastic, funny and witty. Maybe they do not depict perfectly how teenagers are (I'm not criticizing, it's just a thought), but you can't help and fall in love with them. Hazel and Augustus are fantastic in their strengths and weaknesses, in their dry humor and in the way they face life and illness. Important ideas, witty lines to light up the mood, crazy dialogues and some of the best lines I've read recently made me love the book.    For example, what would you say if you are told these words?  \\"I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.\\"    I just cried a bit. A tiny bit, because I felt things were about to go wrong. But you know what? I'd have loved to say these words to the person who was like Augustus for me. You should always tell true things, because you never know if you have days or seconds or century to live.  Green's writing is just plain awesome; I read everything he has written and loved each and every single word, for different reasons and in different ways. But the love is always there. Green is a genius. And I hate him because he has such an impact on me (it's called the Green's Kleenex effect, due to the perfect combo of a wonderful writing and awesome plots).  Okay, I stop here, because I am too deeply involved in this and this review is not making sense. But read the book. With Kleenex around.    My favourite quote(s):    I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, then all at once.    There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Ofcourse, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.  [To that guy, in loving memory. I am thankful for what we were given]    I believe the universe wants to be noticed. I think the universe is inprobably biased toward the consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. And who am I, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it-or my observation of it-is temporary.    Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin, but in truth it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I loved that each of these characters had faults, recognized them and worked through the entire novel to grow and essentially conquer those faults.  It is a book that reminds us we can be good and should be good.  You feel as though you can sit right at home with the March family and they would welcome you there.  Loved it can't believe I've have waited so long to read it!

B002QUWYWE|4.0|I purchased this movie from Amazon because they are efficient and I never have a problem with items being shipped.  I saw the movie, Misery years ago in the theaters.  However, I wanted to watch the movie with a few of my grandchildren who visited for two weeks.  They loved it and for me, it was a good movie all over again.  The acting is superb, of course.  Kathy Bates won an academy award for her part.  I also purchased 2016, Obama's America.  This is an astonishing, well researched and very fair documentary.  Amazingly, I was not able to purchase this DVD at any of the major stores when it was first released.  Amazon, of course, has everything at your fingertips.
