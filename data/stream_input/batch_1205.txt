B0029O0BLS|1.0|This movie is terrible and like a lot of movies, it doesn't even compare to the book.  Don't waste your time.
B000GPI2CM|5.0|This is a fine collection / sampler of music from the Linn Records catalog.  Seven of the Seventeen selections are popular music and the remaining nine are classical.  Once gets nearly sixty-four minutes of interesting music by a variety of artists recorded in audiophile quality sound.  The sound is superb whether listening in 5.1 SACD surround, two-channel SACD or ordinary two-channel stereo on the CD layer.  The surround sound tends to be more of the \\"ambience\\" style were the main sound is located in the front soundstage and the surrounds add a feeling of the room.<br /><br />I highly recommend this disc and the whole series of Linn SACD samplers to audiophiles and/or music lovers.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas just can't help but keep messing with these movies.  As many have heard, the original trilogy contains a number of alterations, the most disturbing of which is Darth Vader yelling \\"NOOOOOO\\" as he kills the emperor in Return of the Jedi, to make a bridge to Lucas's Revenge of the Sith.    Here's the thing.  Return of the Jedi was not directed by George Lucas.  It is not his movie - he had the original concept, but the movie is the work of Richard Marquand, who died in 1987.  It is beyond offensive that Lucas would feel justified in modifying someone else's movie (someone who isn't even alive to defend his work), particularly because the modification is to take the subtle, well-directed climax of the film and morph it into some ham-fisted, ridiculous thing.    What kind of director modifies good movies to make them more similar to bad ones?  A bad director, that's what kind.    I will have no part in this.  As much as I would love to have Star Wars on Blu-Ray, I refuse to financially reward someone who would cynically modify a work of art that isn't his.    When George Lucas or his heir decides to release the digitally remastered but unaltered original trilogy on Blu-Ray, I'll buy the box set, even the one containing the prequel trilogy.  Until then, forget it.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I adore this movie. I used to watch it when I was a kid (I was born in 78) and it is such a neat film. Especially for the time when it was done, the effects are pretty good. I love the story the most though. It's a little dark so very young children might not like it, or might be scared (there is a woman who can take her head off) - but it's such a wonderful fantasy movie.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  It explains some of the questions that the series didn't have time to answer.  It is a nice wrap up to a wonderful series that was ended entirely too soon.  It has a somewhat expected ending but with some unexpected twists.  At the end, I wanted to see more about what happens to Serenity and her crew.  Special effects have improved so much over the years.  The ship looks like it could actually work in the ways explained.  It was just rugged enough to be believeable as an \\"outside the law\\" spaceship.  Picture quality was wonderful.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|... then change Boba Fett not dying in the first few seconds of the fight on the sand barge. What a waste of an iconic character. I was already disappointed by Hayden Christensen replacing Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of Darth Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi. This is just too much. I will be voting with my wallet. No Star Wars on Blu-Ray for me.
0553801473|4.0|***(No spoilers)****<br /><br />I came into this \\"Dance\\" with zero expectations aside from the fact that I figured this book would be part two of \\"Feast\\". Taken from this context the two books together make a decent book four. So basically before you even begin to read \\"Dance\\" make sure that you are up to speed with what happened in \\"Feast\\".<br /><br />Overall, I felt that this entry was the weakest of the series, but only because a few of the plot lines themselves were rather mundane or our of character. I'm mainly referring to the Tyrion and Dany plot lines here.<br /><br />Tyrion's ongoing drama between he and his siblings in the first three installments was one of the main reasons why he is one of my favorite characters in this series. In this book (for obvious reasons to those who have read the previous installments) such banter is eliminated, which really had to make for difficult writing on Martin's part. While definitely the weakest Tyrion story so far, I was not left completely unsatisfied, it's just not the same without the sibling rivalry.<br /><br />As far as Dany goes, I must say this was the plot line that really bugged me the most. Like many reviewers before me, it seems as if she has a completely different personality in \\"Dance\\" from previous entries, which really made her story rather annoying for me to read for the first 3/4 of the book. However, I really enjoyed what occurs towards the end of the story with her, so even though her overall storyline was weak, in my opinion it ended on a strong note.<br /><br />While I was left moderately unfulfilled with the above two story lines, I thoroughly enjoyed the Jon and Theon plot lines immensely. Both had very interesting twists and turns that culminate in classic Martin shockers, and I really thought Martin did a good job of moving some of the more interesting story lines from \\"Feast\\" along, namely Arya and Cersei.<br /><br />Many other reviewers seem to be annoyed with all of the different viewpoints that Martin introduces throughout the book, but when taken in context with the story they actually do make sense and move the plot along. I got no sense that he was planning on keeping up with each of these characters in future volumes, but that this seemed to just be a way to tell \\"Dances\\" main story lines from  different vantage points. This is part of the reason why I like Martin's writing so much. He is able to really flesh out even the most mundane characters and give them life.<br /><br />While \\"Dance\\" is the weakest entry in this series, I truly thought the book was well written and do not think it is a bad book at all. \\"Dance\\" is not as exciting as the first three books, however when read in context with \\"Feast\\", \\"Dance\\" completes a decent fourth entry and ultimately does seem to set up many scenarios that could be culminated in the next chapter. Ultimately, the next book will be the one that makes or breaks the series for me. If Martin can return to form from the first three books, then these two will be seen as the middle point of the entire saga.<br /><br />For now, I will take them as such and am willing to give him the chance to reign all of the plot lines together in book six. I have confidence that he will be able to do so, hopefully some time before 2015.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Leave it alone already...you might as well go ahead and digitally graft Luke's hand back on. Will not be purchasing this at any price.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|A fantastic series..  The first book was a little hard to follow at first as the characters are setup.. But still a very entertaining story..  But once your immersed the story the follows in the first and the subsequent two following books paints a story that has many twists and left me wishing for more..  Very much worth the read..
078401020X|1.0|I started ordering DVD's through Amazon only in the past year or so and have been satisfied with the 20 some movies I've ordered except for this one. The DVD I ordered from this outfit is far from DVD quality. No scratches or skips but blur. This product is not grainy or have any problems with pixels but it is completely blurry the whole way through. Very dissapointed.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This album is a piece of art. It has \\"dance-y\\" songs (Judas, Scheiße), it has sexy songs (Heavy Metal Lover), and it has songs that make you fall to your knees and worship the woman. (Government Hooker, Marry The Night, Yoü and I, The Edge of Glory). If you haven't ever heard this album I really sugguest you do.    -Liam \\"Little Monster\\" Mac
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Just received my order, WOW... starting out with The Phantom Mencace and it looks amazing. The collection is packaged in a similar style to the Alien Collection, in a slim cardboard slip book type design. I prefer this new type of packaging since the discs cannot come off the spindle and get scratched in shipping. The little booklet it comes with is nice, nothing too special just a table of contents. I'll update this ACTUAL review when i finish all the movies, but if this first movie is any idication of the overall quality then all the negative assumptions are unfounded as suspected by all rational movie fans.    Skipped forward to A New Hope since i never had them on dvd, can't compare... looks great.     JUST BUY THIS collection on Blu-ray if you're a fan, it's nonsensical to whine over superficial matters, if any are of real consequence to the overall work of art in the end anyway. I've seen enough, a 10 page vain review trying to prove i'm some ULTIMATE fan is not needed.
0545123291|4.0|linger started out way slower than shiver did and after 200 pages i realized not to much had happened. however, the love story is still there and the ending is really good. i am still exited to read the finale,forever. the only thing i really didn't care for about linger was the lack of olivia. i really was looking forward to her changing in the spring and coming back. because she didnt, i had this feeling of waiting for something to happen that never did. but maggies's writing was as always, steller, and the story was engaging enough to hook me. i am still in love with sam, and isabel shined in this one like she didn't in shiver. cole was entertaining to. i won't give anything away but i really liked him by the end.i think readers of shiver will enjoy linger and be anxious to read forever. i know iam .
B004US4K2C|5.0|so far its pretty awesome. they have they're own go widgets which are awesome. and I love the dock settings.  fingers crossed!
0385504225|4.0|I don't normally write reviews, but mostly because writing isn't my thing.  I leave it to the professionals and the pretentious. I have to say, having seen the reviews I had low expectations.  My wife received the book as a gift when it was first released and I left it sitting ever since as I was dumb enough to think the fact that there are more 1 star reviews here than 5 star reviews meant this would be a horrible read.  I could not have been more wrong.  It did take me a little longer to get hooked, but I am a busy stay at home dad and I don't have a lot of time to read, but once I was hooked that was it.      As an Agnostic I could identify with Langdon's skepticism, although yes, at times the writing and dialogue are corny.  But I can look past a lot of that.  I often have a hard time reading something with an emphasis on \\"faith\\".  For me what I enjoy about Dan Brown's books are less about the characters and their development, and more about the research he does do present facts in an exciting way.  I have serious doubts that Noetic science is what I read in this book and that there is quantifiable evidence that can prove the existence of God or the benefits of group consciousness.  What I did and do enjoy is learning about the Masonic history of our forefathers.  I know it's just scratching the surface, but his books always lead me to the library to attempt to learn more.  Just looking up a few things from his books always provides evidence that his stories do have a factual basis.    Basically I'm saying that if you haven't read this, do yourself a favor.  Apparently if you're one to critique writing styles you may not enjoy it.  Personally, I have a background in mathematics and am more of an analytical thinker.  I am not one to analyze something as useless as proper grammar (don't get me wrong, grammar has its place, but it's the subjectivity in its development that annoys me unlike mathematics)or writing style or whatever other reasons so many have given tolead to the undeservedly(IMHO) poor reviews.  I think many people just wanted to ding him because of the success of his other famous novels.  This book is by no means perfect and it's not something I would read a second time, but I definitely feel it was worth my time.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I LOVE LADY GAGA! LITTLE MONSTERS FOREVER!!!!!!!!!! Lol anyways about the CD, I loved loved loved it! I had it pre-orderd form the day you could, and i had that day deleviery. I have no regrets about that. The album is FANTASTIC, i love every song on it. I've listend to it like a hundred times ont he fist day i got it. The cover art is beautiful, like the songs. Everyone deserves this. BEST BUY EVER for this product. :D
B000F9RB8K|3.0|A very dramatic and excellent movie, highly recommend it. A pity the BluRay transfer is soft and not crisp as should be; I give a 3 star for this reason only. It is a 5 star for the movie itself.
B004SIP9E2|4.0|I love Anna Faris; she's such a... She is so young in this movie, it almost doesn't look like her. Anyway, have fun with parodies of the new genre of scary movies. It's stupid fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down -- in fact I read the trilogy in one week, which is no small feat for the mother of a two-year old!  Gripping story, realistic characters, thought provoking (but light-handed) commentary on our society.  I can't wait for the movie!
B004IDYK0G|5.0|I had planned to buy just one or two songs but the whole Album is just to Awesome to choose from, not like other albums. I love this Album it's so worth it :)
B004SUDPWI|5.0|What can I say. This movie is a classic. One of the rare movies that you don't  mind watching over and over. If your into World War 2 movies this DVD is an absolute must have!
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|It is great! seems like a good coverage of their catalog. Love the collection of videos. Wish more bands would do this and make it a norm.
0062060554|3.0|It took me a long time to get into this book and I felt that the author could have shortened at least the first third considerably.  The loss of memory was a very frightening premise but the book was not very frightening, was not a page-turner and to me, definitely not a thriller.  But, I finished it.
B004RKC4PI|1.0|The ballads.  Wow, and these truly are their best ballads.  Remember how you had your first slow dance at prom to \\"Rag Doll\\"? How you used to dim the lights and put on \\"Livin' On The Edge\\" before snuggling up with that special someone?  Remember how you couldn't play \\"Love In An Elevator\\" for a few months after you broke up with your girlfriend because that was \\"your\\" song?  Good thing they didn't clutter this one up with speed metal tunes like \\"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing\\", \\"You See Me Crying\\", \\"Home Tonight\\", \\"Pink\\", or \\"Kings And Queens\\".  No no, this is all about the BALLADS.
B001C4GS7C|5.0|This is a great story but, please, do yourself a favor and buy the audiobook version which is narrated by Frank Muller...Wow!  He makes this book truly come alive!
1401301010|1.0|If you were expecting a tell all book about the stereotypical narcissistic rock n' roll lifestyle, then this is the book for you. If you were hoping for an insightful journey into the mind of Red Hot Chili Pepper front-man Anthony Kiedis, prepare for disappointment. I had really high hopes for this autobiography, but overall, the narration lacks emotional and intellectual depth. Larry Sloman, the supposed ghostwriter, isn't doing his job. The highlights of \\"Scar Tissue\\" revolve around sex and drugs replete with graphic, unnecessary details, and with the band being such a poignant part of Anthony's life, you'd think the music wouldn't take a backseat to drugs, sex, rehab, and partying. Does he honestly not remember anything else in his life other than those mostly vacuous, sordid affairs? The content is as shallow as the narration, from grade school to present day, and even up until the very end the book you never really feel as if you're 'taking the journey' with him. It's a rock n' roll autobiography, so I wasn't exactly expecting Shakespeare, but it feels as if Kiedis/Sloman really play up the tortured 'artist' angle to the point of exhaustion. We get it...you're a rock star...now talk about the music. \\"Scar Tissue\\" reads as if he's afraid to bore his fans with insight into RHCP's musicality or even their dynamic relationship as band-mates. However, Kiedis himself is not a musician, so perhaps this explains the lack of salient information.<br /><br />I was hoping for insight into RHCP's core, the 'heart' of the band so to speak, and came away empty handed. Kiedis comes across as an arrogant jerk with no concern for the consequences of his actions and this observation is doubly disconcerting when you realize his limited capacity for self-evaluation. I honestly don't think he stopped to think twice (or even once) about how the content of this autobiography reflects on his character. To his credit he refers to himself as an \\"arrogant, selfish jerk\\" a few times and has the guts to denigrate his past behavior yet refuses to acknowledge the stagnation; according to \\"Scar Tissue\\", dude hasn't changed much.<br /><br />The most amusing part of the book, personally, is when Alaine Dawn, the infamous \\"Mother's Milk\\" model (featured on the CD/cassette/vinyl cover), sues the band (presumably for libel) when one of them writes something derogatory on a poster that features her breasts totally exposed (unbenownst to Ms. Dawn, apparently). It must have been pretty bad because Kiedis never tells us exactly what is written *and* Dawn won the case, including a $50,000 settlement, which doesn't happen very often.<br /><br />The least amusing, most hypocritical part of the book is when Kiedis oh-so-subtly implies that Johnny Depp and Gibby Haynes (Butthole Surfers) glorify drug use/addiction with their short film \\"Stuff\\" (a documentary about John Frusciante's life). Well...what exactly do you think *you've* been doing for the exhaustive, unnecessary length of this book? A good friend of mine read this book a few years ago and it actually triggered his (luckily) short lived relapse. Not to say that you should stay away from this book solely for that reason, but consider this a warning for recovering addicts looking for an excuse to use again. In that case, let's hope Kiedis never reads his own material.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you want to attempt to live vicariously through an egotistical, emotionally bankrupt, inter-personally exploitative front-man, then this is the book for you. If you want to get to know what makes RHCP (or even Anthony Kiedis) 'tick', avoid like the plague. Long story short: buy their music and skip this book.uts to denigrate his past behavior yet refuses to acknowledge the stagnation; according to \\"Scar Tissue\\", dude hasn't changed much.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I had excellent service with my purchase at Amazon. The movie is great!It is a wonderful movie to watch with your family and any groups. My youth group watched it with me and loved it!!
B004T5K3OK|5.0|I am the type of person who enjoys the idea of scanning mail, BBQ recipes and magazine articles for digital retrieving and organization. I've even gone as far as buying a top of the line Scansnap 1500 (highly recommended) scanner to help me do that. You can imagine my surprise when I tell you that in quite a few ways, this $2 app (on sale) is more useful than my $400 mega scanner!! The quality is as good as your phone's/tablet's camera and the design is very well thought out.  One piece of advice that was extremely useful from other reviewers was to download the free version from the Android market and purchase the license on Amazon as the version there is more recent and will most likely continue to be the most updated. If you are going to purchase an app, you mine as well get it from the place that it gets the most &quot;care&quot; from.  AMAZON NEEDS TO IMPROVE THIS IF THEY WANT PEOPLES BUSINESS!  I am using this on a Samsung Epic 4g.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I grew up with Star Wars.  By far my favorite movies when I was young.  Me and a friend spent our hard-earned money renting Return of the Jedi every week and the rest went on buying Star Wars toys.  My childhood was Star Wars and it made me what I am today...a Sci-Fi loving geek that is so happy for what these movies did for me.  Thank you for this George.    However I would love to have this experience again.  I don't want to see Obi-Wan screaming in the desert, I don't want Vader's \\"Nooooooooooos\\", I don't want a burping frog, I don't want a hilariously falling Java, I don't want Hayden Christensen's ghost, I don't want blinking Ewoks and most of all I want Jabba to be sinister again...not someone who has Disney style singing scenes in his palace or makes a silly face when Han Solo steps on him.  Jabba is a sinister bastard who would have none of that thank you.    I want the movies I grew up with in the best quality and I'd gladly pay at least 300$ for the privilege.  Please Mr. Lucas...do this for me so I can show my kids the great movies I grew up with and not the mangled disasters presented in this set.    Yours,  Binni
B005C0EH5W|4.0|It took me longer than I wanted to get around to reviewing this latest Karmakanic offering.  I find \\"In A Perfect World\\" to be on par with  their last effort \\"Who's The Boss In The Factory\\", maybe even a bit more accessible. Each song is strong with a nice mix between longer and shorter numbers with the majority actually being shorter. I feel they take a little step beyond WTBITF by presenting a more \\"radio friendly\\" cut in \\"Turn It Up\\" (But, I thought \\"Let in Hollywood\\" from their last album was pretty radio friendly, but maybe a bit too long.) and a wonderfully fun number in \\"Can't Take It With You\\". (After \\"1969\\" probably my favorite cut)It is a really addictive song with a salsa beat that turns prog rock. A tough song to sit still to, and not want to crank up!    The longest cut is the first one \\"1969\\", which clocks in at over 14 minutes. While I really dislike to compare today's prog with yesterdays prog \\"1969\\" is the most \\"Yes sounding\\" song I have heard coming from the Flower Kings camp.  The transitions between slow and fast movements, and the guitar work is just too obvious to ignore. This is nothing against the piece it is definitely the center piece. The next longest song at 9:54 is \\"When Fear Came To Town\\", a really slow somber song. While I am generally not a fan of long, slow, prog numbers WFCTT is really nice! It starts off with just an acoustic guitar and vocals, then Jonas' base slowly and quietly comes in, and finally keyboards and other instruments fill in the end. I don't really like it placed at the end because it kind of leaves me wanting more. Technically, the radio edit of \\"Turn It Up\\" is really at the end, which is really kind of pointless because all they do is shorten the full length version by about two minutes. For all intents and purposes TIU is simply on there twice. That minor criticism aside, I have nothing bad to say about \\"In A Perfect World\\".  Jonas Reingold is definitely putting out Flower Kings style music but it is a bit less tedious and definitely friendlier to the greater music market. While the line is fine, I can definitely see how folks may like Karmakanic but not like the Flower Kings. I doubt it would be true in reverse.   Bottom line, if you like the Flower Kings, liked the last Karmakanic album, then you will like this one as well. No doubt about it. If you are out to discover new music,  and reading these reviews for advice then perhaps think about purchasing \\"Who's the Boss In The Factory\\" first. Then expand into \\"In A Perfect World\\" and \\"early\\" Flower Kings music from 1994 - 2001.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why why why must Lucas continually tinker with these films? chipping away at what made them great in the first place everytime he re-releases them - ive written an open letter to Lucus - you can see it here -[...]  please add comments if you feel stringly as it do about this.
0307463745|2.0|I agree with a number of the other reviews in that this book doesn't really present anything new.  Plus, the authors seem to confuse the situation of people being inept at planning with the value of planning.  Sure, do some people take planning to ridiculous extremes, you bet, but, used correctly, it makes all the difference in the world.  Many other subjects in the book are treated just a flippantly.
B001AQMBNC|4.0|How can they put a good movie like Starman on bluray and not add extras....Pity<br />Would have been nice to hear output form what the actor/actress taught about their<br />roles in this great little movie from the past that continues to be good at every<br />view.<br />Enjoy
B003ZSJ212|1.0|You know I was all for a little spit and polish on these movies back in 1997, but this has gotten crazy. I don't mind adding a few CG elements here and there: cloud city, Mos Eisley, Dewbacks, but when the original movie is significantly altered with the special editions, the 2004 DVD's, and now this, it's gotten out of hand.      No one should ever take classic movies and delete original footage, significantly alter footage \\"Han/Greedo, fake CG Jabba, CG dancers, deletion of original Anakin, or add new dialogue, NOOOOOOOOOOOO!.  Plus whatever minor changes are made, always include for the fans the original unaltered versions.      I don't really know what can be done to stop this butchering of these movies.  Please release originals and have a version that has CG elements that doesn't alter the original concept.    GEEZ!
B004DF3S7A|4.0|This is really great music, and Rod Stewart delivers.  A long time ago (20 or more years), I read a review of some young starlet and Rod Stewart, and basically the review said that she had a voice that many women would give their eyeteeth for, but she didn't know how to deliver a song...and then the same critic reviewed Rod, and said while he might not have the best voice, he really knew how to use his voice.  This album doesn't compare to Ella Fitzgerald singing The Gershwin Song Book, and he sounds  a little like the pedophile in love with Chris on \\"The Family Guy,\\" but still it's a wonderful album.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Hammer Studios is one of the best horror movie makers. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are the best actors for the job.
B004ZQBOK0|4.0|This album is a must have for any fan of hard rock or metal. I'd say they are a mixture between Motley Crue and Avenged Sevenfold. But it's really hard to put a label on these guys. They are very talented musicians and have put together a solid album. Better yet, the production is killer! I took a chance on these guys, because I find that most new hard rock and metal all sounds very similar, but I am so glad I gave this disc a spin! I doubt this album leave my rotation for a long while. 4.5 stars
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I purchased this gaming keypad out of curiosity about how freeing three fingers and replacing them with my thumb for movement would benefit my fps gaming experience.     Right now I'm playing Battlefield: Bad Company 2(BC2) and at first it didn't feel natural because of my years of repeated training while playing with the classic keyboard(WASD)/mouse combination nor did it feel comfortable since hand position changes but both of these issues went away(at least for me) after about a week or so of playing. I even created an alternate soldier so that my \\"hand/brain system rewiring\\" would not affect negatively my stats.    Now, I don't have to move a finger away from it's natural position to move, jump, spot or reload... knifing is done through a mouse button, the rest is less common. Using the G13 AND a mouse brings the best of both worlds(PC vs Gaming Console) to the gaming control dilemma because aiming is still done through the mouse.    CONS:     Joystick could be more ergonomic position wise, I think the belkin keypad got that concept better implemented.  It is also kind of easy to lose grip of the thumbstick, specially if you got sweaty hands. My PS3 controls feel much better.    -------------------    I got used to the thumbstick and until something much better comes out I'll keep using this one. I am now a convert.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|The Gruffalo tells the whimsical story of a little mouse who goes on a stroll in the woods.  He comes across several other creatures - predators who all think the little mouse looks quite tasty!  The witty mouse must do his best to keep from being eaten!  He invents a story about a terrible monster, The Gruffalo, who will of course devour all the predators.  Our little hero is pretty pleased with himself when his enemies run away - but what will become of him when the creature of his imagination turns out to be not quite so imaginary after all?<br /><br />I highly recommend it!  Featuring voice talents such as Helena Bonham Carter and Robbie Coltrane, the tale has a lyrical feel that takes you along on the little mouse's journey.  The animation is beautiful, the story is sweet and overall it may become a family favorite.  Hubby and I enjoyed watching the behind-the-scenes feature - it was fascinating to see how the animation team brought everything together.
B003C0IGRE|5.0|This was the third book by David Baldacci that I have read is the past four weeks. For a fiction book it has many references to the Washington, DC area that are real. Having been to DC 13 times in the past 11 years with students, I find that the series, with the Camel Club mentioned, are thrilling, full of action, hard to put down. The references to actual areas help with the visualization of Baldacci's words. If you want a great series of stories, read the 5 books that involve the Camel Club.
0811875040|4.0|I have to say I love this book, it is so pretty and the recipes are wonderfully challenging, not a basic cake in site. But, there are not photos with every recipe which I find very disapointing. The layout and photos that are in the book are so pretty it would just be nice to have more photos. Otherwise, I love it so much.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|1. \\"Noo nooo\\" ... see other reviewers.      2. No original versions = he's just gonna resell this package with them later.    These movies are not haircuts that need to be upkept and tweaked every three months.  LEAVE THEM ALONE.  Sheeh.  I give this set 1 star as a sign to purchasers that we should not be getting this.
B0054N73EY|5.0|It has been a long wait but it was totally worth it.  The Chili Peppers are back with a vengence.  Same great music with just a little bit of change up in the vocals and arrangements.  This one will definitely be on my top 10 for 2011.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|i'm very pleased with the company. they told me they'd send a replacement as original would not work. they sent replacement promptly.  it was from vtictic. I would recommend them to everyone.    I would very much recommend them them to everyone.

B0052FG8KO|5.0|I' ve just bought this new Work of Art CD yesterday in Paris, without listening to any title because of the 1st album quality, and since yesterday it's playing round and round in my car and at home . This gives me exactly what i'm waiting from a melodic rock album : perfect voice, amazing melodies and good riffs, from first to 12 th song .  I was already thinking that Work of Art was a big rock band, but in my opinion they are nothing but one of the best AOR bands ever. Frontiers records gives us the chance to enjoy that kind of music again and again with great bands like WET, Khymera, Place Vendome, AURAS, and many more, but i really think that Work of Art are playing in a higher level. My best 2011 album with Journey's Eclipse ( my favourite band for life...);  If you like good AOR music, don't hesitate and enjoy this CD.

B004FQX5CK|4.0|The detail in the shots is incredible. I would have trouble telling how old this movie is.     I bought this bluray without having watched it before, though, and I only feel \\"meh\\". I think it assumes too much prior knowledge about the world. If I had known that this was after a nuclear war and that most people had already fled Earth, it would make a bit more sense why this world sucks (I had trouble suspending disbelief with the fact that LA will be in constant rain in 8 years...). The final 30 minutes of this movie are too slow. We see Harrison Ford dangling from a rooftop for what feels like an eternity.    I usually prefer lighter-fare movies and leave the serious stuff to TV shows, which have time to develop everything (ie, The Wire).
0316098329|5.0|I was a little afraid to read this book.  I wasn't sure if I could handle the subject matter.  It was fantastic!!  A great read.
B005FUTBWS|4.0|In the Horror or Suspense genre, Red State is likely the best of both you'll see this year. Very well written and directed, you will be gripped from the very beginning. And if Inglorious Bastards' Christoph Waltz or, for that matter, The Dark Knight's Heath Ledger, earned them an Academy Award for Best supporting Actor for playing the villain, there will be no greater sin in cinema if Michael Parks is not nominated.
B003ELOQCA|4.0|By all means, U2 360 looks set to be a fantastic concert. The fabulous set list, the venue from space and a rocket ready to launch.     The first two times that I watched this, I felt a disconnect. Perhaps I had not listened to No Line On The Horizon, from which many songs were performed. It could also be the uneven pacing of the songs. It veers from fast to slow and then fast to slow again. The final reason being the disorientated editing on the first few minutes that put some Amazon reviewers off.     I'm glad to say that on the third viewing, I thought that U2 360 was actually a very good show, just a more mellow one. And the setting; a \\"spaceship\\" with spider-like claws provides the out of this earth feel. The center of the ship beams out the concert to the back rows.      Look out for U2's tribute to Burma's democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi in Walk On. The stadium collectively puts on her face as a show of solidarity. The last three encores also features Bono dangling from a mike and he sings while twirling around. U2 still knows how to wow the crowd.    Initially, there appears to be are no extras on the single DVD edition. Only a space age menu greets you if activated. I was fiddling with the DVD remote and discovered this. Go to either Audio Set Up or Track Selection and press the left arrow button.  A short film called 21 Days featuring rehearsals and people setting up the stage will appear. Other bonus features and documentary have been saved for the deluxe, super deluxe and what-have-you editions.
0340980923|4.0|I am a huge fan of dystopian work and this is a great one.  The future where love is a psychological affliction that must be surgically prevented is an awesome premise but not a new one.  The best parts of this book are not where she describes the society but where she has the characters and the \\"historians\\" describe the past and all the problems love caused.  Great insights.
0312370849|5.0|Great book from start to finish. This moving novel with leave a deep impression. Looking forward to seeing the movie.
6304712936|5.0|\\"Amadeus\\" is a movie about the discussion of Mozart's life as told from a colleague's point of view. Tom Hulce convincingly plays an energetic Mozart, who is very much focused on his craft.  Fahrid Murray Abraham cleverly plays fellow classical musician Salieri.  Salieri holds Mozart in high regard.  The movie displays the why of this admiration, as seen through the many good musical performances in the movie.  Salieri longs for the same talent, and the beginning of the movie provides a very compelling preface as to the origins of this respect.  The movie \\"Amadeus\\" is told in such a way that it would be easy to understand things from Salieri's point of view.  I was watching the movie,and thinking \\"How could he?\\" (in reference to Salieri).  On the other hand, I found myself admiring Mozart's musical compositions that were performed in the movie.  I also felt empathy for the circumstances leading to Salieri's wish to enjoy the same popularity as Mozart.  It is understandable that others may watch \\"Amadeus\\" and see the relationship between Salieri and Mozart through a different perspective.  As for me, I am glad to have watched \\"Amadeus\\" because this movie illustrates some of the dynamics that catapulted Mozart to great fame. In addition, many of the people that played a pivotal part of Mozart's life were told in a superb manner from the vantage point of Salieri (as played by Abraham).  \\"Amadeus\\"  is a high-quality movie to watch for music lovers.
0399536108|4.0|Is it possible to live the non-conformist's life, as Guillebeau suggests? Absolutely. Is it as easy as he sometimes makes it seem in this book? Not at all. But for many, this is a needed kick-in-the-pants to show that life really can be different, that mortgages and credit card bills are not required, and that freedom isn't something that only happens after we turn 62 and retire from the world of cubicles and meetings. Not everyone will want the details of how to travel around the world, but we can all use the reminder that it's an option.
0307120007|5.0|My little boy brings me the book all the time so we can read it together.  After about 2 or 3 times he caught on to all of the little actions in the book and he does every single one of them now along with the characters in the book.  He always has a HUGE smile on his face when we read the book and it even dissolves (SOME) temper tantrums.  He pats the bunny, plays peek-a-boo, smells the flowers, looks in the mirror, flips through the book, feels 'daddy's' face, sticks his finger in 'mummy's' ring, and then says bye bye just as the book says.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the flowers are rather strong smelling and in my opinion stinky although my mother and father seem to think they smell fine so it's hard to say.  Anyways that's my opinion- my son has no problem sticking his nose right on the book and taking a big wiff :)<br /><br />Very Good Buy!!!!<br />Good Luck Mamas!
B0059FBQWW|4.0|I'd give it a 3.5, as there is little originality here except in concept, but the contrast between pop rock and melodic death metal is admittedly refreshing.

B0054N73EY|4.0|First play = sounds good. Second listen = hooked. Hated to hear about John Frusciante leaving, but Josh Klinghoffer fits the bill. After the radio played \\"...Rain Dance Maggie\\" and announced RDHP was releasing their first album since \\"Stadium Arcadium\\", I knew I'd be getting this days after it hit stores. The band took time off and came up with a great addition to their growing library of already exquisite albums. Favs to date include - \\"Factory of Faith\\", \\"Brendan's Death Song\\" and \\"Look Around\\". Good stuff!
1594481784|4.0|1. You don't have to be a music snob to appreciate this novel, but it probably would have helped.   2. It's sad that there is a whole generation of readers who won't know what it means to create a mix tape for someone.   3. For those of us who found Hornby's writing later (I first fell in love with A Long Way Down and have read everything since), it's worth going back to the classics.   4. The best humor has an edge, and the Brits know it.   5. The characters we remember are the ones who feel like people we know, full of quirks and inconsistencies. This novel is full of them.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game was enjoyable while it lasted. It was really short. It was good overall though and I would recommend it but would maybe pay a little less.
B001FB55N0|5.0|Surprisingly, Adam Sandler stars in a fantastic family movie, and he doesn't even seem out of his comfort zone. Threaded with great themes of honesty, justice, and especially family love in a broken home, this movie is definitely a deviation from Sandler's regular roles, but he is still his same funny self.<br /><br />Summary: Skeeter Bronson, a maintenance man who, by all rights should be managing the mega-hotel he works at, is cajoled by his sister into babysitting the niece and nephew for a few days. When the bedtime stories he tells them begin coming true, he sees a way for him to realize his dream of managing the hotel.  Of course, unforeseen consequences provide strange and hilarious happenings along his path.
0385341008|5.0|I have just scanned through the many reviews on Amazon for this book and I am going to briefly repeat what has been said before.<br /><br />What a fantastic, informative, witty read. Like many others have stated \\"I did not want this book to end\\". I have learnt so much that I did not know about WW2 and the German occupation of Guernsey. Loved the characters and all their eccentricities and also got a feel for what it was like to live through this awful period of history. I feel a desperate need to travel to Guernsey now what a shame I cannot travel back in time to meet the wonderful people that have been introduced to me in this book.<br /><br />If you are thinking of buying - do so. You won't regret it.
B0052U59F4|5.0|When Anastasia Steele agrees to interview millionaire Christian Grey as a favor for her friend, she has no idea what she's getting herself into. The moment she looks into the enigmatic businessman's piercing gray eyes, she's literally head over heels, accidentally stumbling to the ground when they first meet. After several sexually-charged interactions, Christian asks Ana out, and though she can't figure out how such a successful -- and hot! -- man could be interested in her, she agrees. However, after their date, Christian warns Ana to stay away from him. Talk about mixed signals!    Ana refuses to back down, though, and in return Christian propositions her with a blushing offer to explore her sexuality... together. Despite Ana's innocence, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to Christian and willing to do whatever it take to get to know him better. Soon, their relationship begins to transcend physical boundaries and Ana finds herself wanting more from the wealthy tycoon. If only Christian could get past his inner demons to open himself up to Ana's love...    If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be INTENSE! From Ana and Christian's relationship to Christian's internal struggles to Ana's emotional roller-coaster, the entire 380 pages are intense. The story is told in first-person present tense, which I have to admit thew me at first, but I quickly became engrossed in Ana's thoughts and intrigued with her perception of Christian and her take on their affair. Christian is a multi-faceted hero. Yes, he's drop-dead gorgeous, but he's also troubled, overbearing and possessive. As odd as it sounds, it's his flaws that really make him alluring -- it's no wonder Ana is willing to submit to him!    The secondary characters -- Ana's roommate, Christian's family, etc. -- bring another level of depth and complexity to the plot -- which, by the way, flies by; I read this book in less than three days! All in all, I'd have to say that Fifty Shades of Grey was notat all what I expected... it was fifty times better! And, if that wasn't enough, turns out that it's part of a trilogy, which means that there will be more shades of Grey to indulge in. The only downside, however, is that the story ends on a cliff-hanger, making me more than a little anxious for the next book to be released.     *originally written at: [...]

B004I11VZ0|5.0|Throughly enjoyed this movie! I'm a long time martial arts fan and I can find varying amounts of enjoyment in most kung fu movies. I remember the all day dollar variety. This is on par with the Bruce Lee type stuff we purists have missed. Donnie Yen pulls it off well. The director does a good job with the rest of the movie as well. This is a definite buy it!
B004VRK3ZU|4.0|This is a great classic for the family.  It has humor, adventure, and a bit of scariness, but not too much for kids.  If you can put up with the dated special effects, it's worth it.  A great performance from Dunst and Williams.<br /><br />Summary: A bullied boy finds a game that makes a drumming sound and begins playing with a girl. He is sucked into the game for 26 years until a brother and sister find the game, begin playing, and let him out, along with a lot of other Jungle horrors.  The only way to put things to right?  Finish the game.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|How in the world is this being offered by the same man who created this saga?  Wow...my old DVDs are becoming worth more and more every day.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I read with dismay that George Lucas is tampering again with his, it seems, no so beloved movies.  He must be still truly unhappy and disappointed with them to be changing the original movies at every opportunity he has, which, curiously, is always related to money. Now releases the originals, later the special edition, later the originals together with the special edition, then the prequels with a modified edition of the originals' special edition. And you wait; he probably is not finish yet. Most likely Mr. Lucas will also release a put-your-glasses-on 3D version with new digital sequences, maybe later a 12.2 surround with new special effects and music. For sure, in six years, to celebrate Star Wars' 40th birthday, he will surely redo the movies again, in 4D or whatever filmic dimension we are at that moment, maybe with a different story performed by digitalized actors, being the star a revamped Darth Vader played, thanks to the magic of digital technology, by a resurrected Laurence Olivier, so the whole trilogy becomes a look alike Shakespearian tragedy, for it looks that is the path he tries to make `his' movies go. Therefore, instead of the \\"Nooooo\\" Lucas is going to make Darth Vader say in order to eliminate the climax in the most important sequence of TROTJ, and in the process match the end of the VI episode with the III, Mr. Lucas should try something like \\"To be or not to be, there is no question, I lift you with my arms to destroy all your charms, and drop you into the vent, so in the force you don't make another dent.\\" Nothing can be closer to Hamlet. Well, dear George, Star Wars is not Shakespeare, and doesn't need to be. In fact, It better not be.  George Lucas should try to follow the norm that states `If something works, don't fix it,\\" and learn the lessons of other directors who also try `to improve' what couldn't be improved. It comes to mind Steven Spielberg and the Indiana Jones Trilogy in DVD, which supposedly was going to have added scenes and retouched digital effects. The fan's complains, and a timely South Park episode saved the day, and the movies can be enjoyed as they were originally conceived (I hope that George Lucas, who was the producer, doesn't get any ideas about them when it comes the time to be released in Blue Ray). If Spielberg has retouched any of his movies, it was precisely to eliminate non-sense added sequences, like that horrible anticlimactic ending scene in Close Encounters that Universal make him shot. On the contrary, George Lucas, Universal style, sees the original Star Wars trilogy merely as a commodity, destined to produce revenue one way or the other and as long as the movie industry exists. Many of us consider that Stars Wars is much more that a set of movies, they are something that belongs by right to the history of cinema, of this country, and probably of the world. The Star Wars Trilogy is more than movies, and one only has to watch, for example, Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed, among other documentaries, to realize that their content extends beyond their pure filmic intent. It is the Star Wars of 1977 the one that changed movie history, not the one of 1997, and for sure not the ones are about to be released in Blue Ray. That movie made 34 years ago is the one that most of us want to watch, with the entire splendor a Blue Ray can bring to the image, and nothing more. It is difficult to believe that a `cineasta' with more than 30 years in the business on his back cannot see beyond his nose in this matter. Maybe that's what happens when one owns a corporation that doesn't create movies but makes other movies look good through the marginal creativity of special effects (that's why the creativity of the FX couldn't save the prequels). Lucas is trying, again, to make those classical marvels to look good by creating another pointless adulterated copy. I don't see how adding dialogues, changing screams (Ben Kenobi's), digitalizing sequences or actors, or doing anything to movies already perfect makes them more perfect or more appealing to thousands of fans that yield to see the originals, not a corrupted copy. Does anyone think that digitalizing the last sequence of Casablanca, or changing the dialogues of Gone with the Wind (\\"Frankly my dear, I don't give a f@#k\\"), or adding digital extras to the battles in Spartacus, is going to make those movies better, more classical? Probably Lucas does, and wants to put every movie ever made through a computer and a recording studio so they look and sound as they were made yesterday. Why not; \\"if Ted turner could color B&W movies, I can now turn all of them into holograms.\\"   Many forgave Lucas when he made up the artificial special editions; since his justification for the move was believable, most of the fans, me included, fell in the trap (still I wonder how you can envision something that didn't exist in the 70's, i.e. digital effects). However, I never understood Lucas's unwillingness to release the original movies on DVD. He finally did, probably under fans' pressure, thanks God, but still we had to go through two or three releases of those pesky special editions, and so the originals had to came out also accompanied by them (and to the trash they went). Of course, surprise, surprise,  I couldn't see any real or unreal improvement, no \\"wow, that's amazing,\\" (only the brief encounter of Luke with his childhood friend before the last battle in episode IV); the added digital sequences matched the rest of the movies like a glove would fit the fin of a dolphin, but at least the story, dialogues, emotions, climatic sequences remained the same (I saw, however, a un-improvement in the marriage of Lucas and digital era with the disappointing prequels). But now Mr. Lucas wants to go where no one has gone before and tamper with the heart and soul of the movies, the dialogue, and remove the climax from one of the most climatic scenes in movie history, the triangular, private duel taking place in the Death Star, the scene that resolves the conflict we have been suffered together with the characters, the redemption of the tragic hero, Darth Vader. Maybe a `Nooooo\\" (less than 2 secs.) in the mouth of Darth Vader doesn't seem a big deal, but it is. Just Darth Vader's sudden movement towards the emperor, conjugated with Luke's look of relieve, surprise and pity, all lifted by John Williams's music was what made the sequence perfect.  No words. But soon, September 16, that \\"noooo\\" enhanced by True Dolby Digital and in bombastic THX, is going to scream across the living rooms of the USA, and the world, maybe, wishful thinking, as the symbolic voice for all of us, \\"Lucas, nooooo, why did you do that.\\" And there, in the Death Star, by the mouth of Darth Vader controlled by George Lucas, is where also TROTJ will also die, thrown deep into the abyss together with the emperor and the money this monstrosity is going to cost. How appropriate. Anyway, and paraphrasing Ricky's words in Casablanca, \\"We'll always have the originals,\\" and I'm going to stick with them. Those of us who know the original movies, and saw them when they were released and later in VHS or laser disk, are extremely lucky and I hope that the movies are shown by parents, and grandparents, and uncles, and aunts, and brothers, and sisters to the successive new generations, since Lucas is denying them the pleasure of watching not only a movie as it was conceived, but how a piece of movie history was made. The sadness of this entire blunder is that Lucas is not the only one to blame, we also are. In two weeks many, lots, will run to the stores, real or on line, to get a pristine copy in Blue Ray, instead of letting it go and keep playing their already owned pristine DVDs and thus force Lucas to recall the Blue Rays and do it again, this time right. Yes, \\"show him the money\\", as Tom Cruise's character would say; I won't. September 16 I will play the original movies (maybe even in Castilian, as I saw them for the firsttime when I was 14, at least the first two, TROTJ is doubted in Latin America) as if I just bought them. And I will wait until Lucas decides is time to make more money by releasing the original movies so he looks like he cares. Only then I will fall in his trap and buy them. But right now, I am going to make a copy, better two, of my Star Wars DVDs so I can keep the originals unblemished in case Lucas decides that the next step is to burn the negatives and so any remaining memory of a certain movie that premiered in May of 1977 to the delight and amazement of several million people and changed the way we see movies.

B0054N73EY|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers' 10th studio album features the band's seventh guitarist. And just as football fans get flutters in their tummies when their team starts a new QB, what's foremost in people's minds is, Can This Guy Fill The Other Guy's Shoes?<br /><br />I know that's what I was wondering, and I also know that, like a voter on Election Day, I carried pessimism in my heart.<br /><br />All worry is for naught, however, because No. 7 turns out to be RHCP's lucky number.<br /><br />Former guitarist John Frusciante's replacement, Josh Klinghoffer, thankfully never deliberately appears to be trying to one-up the two-year departed, two-time-quitting guitarist on here. His style actually is part Frusciante (whom he played alongside in the short-lived Ataxia), with a dash of Dave Navarro tossed in. He's loose and freestyle, and more capable of subtlety than the former, but he's not too proud to throw in a few crowd-pleasing monster licks from time to time. He plays his guitar like a jazz instrument, leaving out notes, moving in and out of tempo, playing more for feel than hubris.<br /><br />Perhaps it comes down to the downsize-friendly fact that Klinghoffer is a multi-instrumentalist. He plays keyboards on \\"I'm With You,\\" but is capable of playing at least seven other instruments. He also sings like a bird, and Anthony Kiedis could use all the help he can get.<br /><br />Klinghoffer backs the bandleader on a few songs, his high-octave chirp adding a polish to Keidis' tousle, such as on the dense yet airy \\"Did I Let You Know,\\" hands down the best track on \\"I'm With You.\\" There's trumpet from Flea, zambuba drums, some nice surf-y tones and a brief wave of psychedelic skronk coming out of Klinghoffer's axe -- and Kiedis twice uttering \\"Ha ha\\" in a tone implying genuine amazement at how the hurly-burly is meshing together. \\"I'm With You\\" could only have been better if Klinghoffer had sung on more of the tracks.<br /><br />This newest member's eclectic musical background carries through in the dizzying array of styles he juggles, sometimes all within the space of one song -- honky tonk, space rock, dream pop, southern rock, funk -- and even a sound near the beginning of \\"Factory of Faith\\" that I'm not sure I've ever heard before, reminiscent of ice dropped on hot grease.<br /><br />Kiedis is a man who appears to have sufficiently learned how to keep his personal demons at bay, and the passion -- perhaps the need -- he has for the Peppers shows in the lines, \\"Like I told you / I'm in for the long long,\\" on 'Even You Brutus?\\" and \\"Please don't ask me where / or where you think I been / I been a lot of places / but this could be my win\\" on \\"Meet Me at the Corner.\\" The latter finds Kiedis turning in a rare, meaty performance, one that doesn't need any assistance from Klinghoffer, though there is a brain-melting vocal interlude by the guitarist.<br /><br />Bassist Flea, who studied musical theory at USC -- and played with Thom Yorke in Atoms for Peace -- during the five-year interim between albums, has dialed his zest down, taking a back seat to Klinghoffer on most songs. Both musicians allow drummer Chad Smith to come into the foreground throughout. Flea seems to be playing in a tighter manner, pressing more than plucking or slapping. All except for a brief, jaw-dropping spasm of hardcore jazz fusion from Flea on the somewhat angry \\"Goodbye Hooray.\\" Then there's the rollicking, hip-hoppy \\"Look Around,\\" bringing to mind the band's most universally adored album, \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magick.\\"<br /><br />I'm not sure what the cover image, cleverly working in the album title, by well-paid doom artist Damien Hirst is supposed to signify.

B0002VJY0O|5.0|Fabulous! Just plain fabulous! What a force for wonderful changes this man made in his short time here. I'd recommend this to anyone who ever loved his music.
014241493X|5.0|I'm a Freshmen in high school, and I don't like reading many books. Although this book made me want to start back up again. It has everything a great book should have. Immature jokes, to adventures, deep thinking, and even goes to touching moments. I loved every chapter of the experience. I would highly recommend on buying it.     This book also has a great moral. I thought it was very clear. People are not made of paper. They have dimensions, and though at first Q seems to see Margo as his wonderful, prefect, and HOT next door neighbor, he soon learns that she's realer than that. What John Green is trying to explain is our view or idea of a person will never be enough to show all that that person really is. Because humans are complex things.
0385342039|2.0|I am not the biggest chick-lit fan, but I love Sophie Kinsella. I bought this for a beach read, and had I not been on vacation, I probably would have stopped reading it. The plot is just absolutely ridiculous - the main character, Lara, is visited by the spirit of her great-aunt Sadie, who makes all sorts of demands on her life. What I loved about the other Kinsella books I've read is that they are light-hearted, and often funny, takes on somewhat realistic life situations, but I just couldn't relate to this plot at all. I never got into any of the characters and didn't laugh the way I did at Kinsella's other books or have any sort of heartwarming feeling at the conclusion of the novel. That said, it is classic Kinsella writing, and there are some cute descriptions and quirky moments that kept the book from being a complete throwaway. I would definitely skip this one unless you are a die-hard Kinsella fan. There is much better chick-lit out there.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I first saw this movie at the theatre at first release.  I chose a Sunday matinee and left the theatre that afternoon in tears.  Yet, my heart felt joy.  The movies is so very Clint Eastwood and I enjoyed it immensely.  Meryl Streep is at the top of her game with this one, as well.
B004WJRF6C|5.0|Man... this is a great record. If you think that all the songs that are part of this work could be on a new Beatles album, you can expect pure criativity. Imagine half of this album, half of the \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" album and half of the \\"All things must pass\\" album and think: If the Beatles was still togethes, will Abbey Road still be the best Beatles record?<br />Yeah... they break up to soon...
B003ASLJMW|5.0|FIREFOX is one of the most watchable movies I have ever seen. The film critics dismiss this film so you can be sure it is good. COPLAND was ignored as well. Both are excellent. FIREFOX builds to a steady intensity and Eastwood directs it perfectly. The air action at the end more than compensates for the intellectual set up at the beginning. I love this film.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|After I go through all the hustle and bustle (wasn't that long though) to get this thing installed, thinking it would be really cool on my Android, I get the message: Not Available in my region.  So ridiculous; I have a Kindle using outside of the US, but can use the Kindle app.  Wasted my time!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm wondering... Is it possible for Mr Lucas to maybe take my life and redo it as well so that I don't have to witness this kind of scam anymore. I was trying not to think about the release date on blu ray ( hoping the time would go by quicker) but I couldn't wait so I went to pre order and saw all of the poor reviews, which I read, and to no surprise was thoroughly disgusted and angry.     Doesnt he have enough money to make his own copy that he can watch on his own? And leave us out of his crazy fantasies!!    I will not be purchasing this product or any others of this franchise until the original is released.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|SIMPLY NOOOOOOOOOO!!  I WILL DON'T BUY THIS!!   Let's say NOOOOOO to Lucas, DON'T BUY IT,     Maybe this will the only way he will listen to fans, to the people he owns his empire of money and Lucas Enterprise, without fans to buy his product he has to listen.  It was a blow in the face, i'm really disapointed, i was WILLING TO BUY THIS, i was ready to pre-order it, i was so happy and telling my son of 5: You will see what it's Star Wars, you feel what i feel when i was kid, this movie it's amazing, trying to make him prefer Star Wars instead of TRON Legacy and Tron, i buy Tron 20th anniversary and show to my son, now he's a big fan of Flynn, maybe next year will see Flynn guiding Tron with a MOUSE instead of a keyboard just because for the producer its COOL! or instead of Arcade Game will see Nintendo or XBOX!     What's next, Indy with a SABER WHIP!! Chewie growling like his dog? C-3PO with a pinkish color instead of goldie just because his voice it's better match with his color!!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Noooooooooooo! I will not be buying this.  I've spent thousands of dollars supporting Star Wars and Lucasfilm with my collecting of almost anything Star Wars, and I really looked forward to buying the Blueray.  But enough is enough. Noooooooooo is the last straw.  Way to alienate your fans, George.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|I paid full price on the market and it was worth every penny.  with the Amazon sale price it's a steal.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Don't mess with the original version.  You can't beat perfection, just stick with what works.  Come on George, what are you thinking man!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Don't encourage these kinds of insane alterations to classic films by buying this set. In my opinion he can make all the dumb additions he wants, as long as he also includes an untouched, original theatrical version of the films on blu-ray. Until that happens, I refuse to pay money for this.  This is not the Star Wars I know and love.    \\"People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.    In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.\\"    --George Lucas, in a testimony before Congress in 1988. The sheer hypocrisy of this man is astounding.
0470570954|5.0|I received my product on time, it was nicely packaged the description of the product fit with the product so I am more that happy
0316067601|1.0|Half the book is a conservative rant.  Which is fine if it were not for how the rant is chopped up and served a little at a time.  So, just when you are getting interested in the story, along comes a mindless rant about the so-called liberal media and how they killed his friends with R.O.E.  The Author repeats himself at least 20 times throughout the book.  Came very close to ruining the actual story with all that nonsensical conservative dribble.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I wrote a review of this accusing those that gave this one star of living in their parents basement, for that I apologize.  However, I still think the changes are minamal and only improve on a masterpiece.  I enjoyed the prequels and I love watching the Clone Wars with my 10 year old daughter.  In short I like what Lucas has done with the Star Wars Universe and it seems that a lot of other people feel the same way.  Even if you don't agree with me can't we stop the nastiness.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I have the Android version on my smart phone.  Occasionally all of the songs I have downloaded in a group do not appear in the queue unless I turn my phone off then on again.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|If you are a fan of Keanu this is a must.  I was lucky enough to get this 5 blu ray disc set when it was a gold box deal of the day for only $25 bucks.  There are some places in these movies you can see the graphics are out dated for today's technology, but what what more can you expect for a 1999 and 2003 movie.  Each movie has it's own slimline case.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I can't tell you how glad I am to still have the dvd release of the unaltered original films.  While they are sub-standard in this digital age of restoration, they aren't further down the road of bastardized revisionism.  Yes, Lucas can do as he pleases, too bad he doesn't realize all that earned wealth comes at the price of whatever cinematic soul he ever had.  Those of us who love film, who love truth told at 24 frames per second (or 30 in the video age), must rise up against this empire.  Just say NOOOOOOO to the dark side.
0205632645|5.0|Every child should grow up using this book as a guide and reference to writing.  Too bad I had to find out about it when I was 40.  Get this book to improve your skills.
0385334206|4.0|You never forget your first Vonnegut, and this was mine. (Not this edition, I'm thinking of 30 years ago.) I had never seen anything like it: the various measurements, the line drawings, and Kilgore Trout.  Is it about pollution and the end of resources? Our obsession with sex? The contemplations of an omniscient narrator? The meaning of categories like \\"science fiction\\" and \\"pornography\\"? Or just another of his wacky stories that turns out to be about what he did and saw in Vietnam and what it did to his later life in New York?<br /><br />I still love this story. This edition is slick and slender, I remember a bigger book.<br /><br />Delivery took longer than usual from Amazon.
B0055V0GQC|5.0|Rival Sons sounds like a cross between Led Zeppelin, Free, Black Crowes and Kings Of Leon. The singer can really yell. Just great 70's-style funky soul-rock. Turn it up loud and get lost in their sound.  [DW]
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I do not write too many reviews but I feel compelled to show my support for Ready Player One.  I did not know if this book was for me when I ready the summary but I am so glad I took the plunge and picked it up.  Admittedly, I am a gamer and movie freak who grew up in the 80s, so I must confess that this book was clearly written for someone like me.  Still, I think that anyone with a passing admiration for games or science-fiction will enjoy this book.  But, if you are like me, then this book should be something altogether magical.  I never heard of Ernest Cline before this novel.  But, now, I am a complete and unmitigated fanboy.  I started reading his other writing and am even more impressed.      Bottom Line: You literally cannot fit a wafer thin mint into this book because it is that chock full of Awesome.  In fact, this book should have a little figurine of String Fellow Hawk included with every copy because it is (without a doubt): Airwolf.    I do not care that I am already feeling a slight creep of embarrassment because I am gushing so much.  This book deserves the praise.  I am 41 years old and this book brought back the excitement and unfettered joy of my childhood.  Many great books move me, tell a great yarn or enchant me with their wonderful prose and characters.  But, to me, this is more than just a great book.  It is a Golden Ticket to revisit and relive the cherished pieces of art that widened my eyes, expanded my mind and took my breath away.    This book goes to 11.
0743270754|5.0|Great book with lessons for all to learn.  I found the insigt into the inner thinkings of Lincoln amazing.  A must read.
B004LROMSO|1.0|Camelot could have been amazing alas it was not. The lead Arthur is a horrible actor. The plot is slow and the action isn't enough. Don't waste your time or your money if you want to see an amazing series watch a Game of Thrones.
B004HGBUVG|4.0|Don't let the airplay of \\"Buttercup\\" fool you.  That's a fun song to sing in the car, but the rest of this album is as much of a downer as mid-70s Neil Young--and I say that with admiration!  This is a terrific album with a few songs so creepy (\\"Don't Know How You're Living\\" and \\"Copenhagen\\") that they'll give you goosebumps.  The previous CD, Little Honey, is more fun overall, but this is fun in a different way.  Definitely worth buying.
B004G600A4|5.0|OF ALL TIME. Hilarious without trying to hard. LOVE the horse. LOVE the HORSE!  The plot is great, what an AWESOME MOVIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

0345529057|5.0|An incredible story. Is a must, is a very good intrigue with a lot of different component that make it unforgettable.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|Old enough to remember the old Maverick series on TV.  Really enjoyed this movie and glad to have on DVD
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I read alot of negative reviews of book 4 but found it pretty good so was looking forward to this installment.  Can't even begin to describe what a letdown this book is, George has preceded to kill main characters for no reason and left the parts with greatest potential to rot.  I read fantasy books for the magic and this one blows.  The best parts - ice creatures, dragons, and Bran finding the crow - are left as annoying sidelines that never live up to their potential.  Please save your money and check out from the library if you just have to see for yourself.
B004498KPU|1.0|I dont´like this product, the video quality is bad and the sound is bad too, this is like a pirate dvd...
0553801473|5.0|This is the continuation of an incredible saga. Additionally in a beautiful book format, a very good news from the R.R. Martin fans.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I have been using Documents to Go for many years starting with the first Palm version. When I finally gave up on Palm I move to WinMo (not for long because the os was just unusable) then on to Android. DTG is one of a handful of killer apps one needs for a mobile device so I paid full price on their site immediately and don't regret it for a moment. Get it while it's on sale here at Amazon but even if you miss the sale price, get it anyway. Trust me, it is worth the price.
B0034G4ORM|3.0|While watching \\"Battle\\" I was reminded of a similar \\"Independence Day\\" from a few years ago.  About the only difference is that a somber Aaron Eckhart replaces a cavalier Will Smith as the primary human assigned to take out the alien invaders.  The movie opens with the invasion already underway but then the film quickly cuts back 24 hours to see the buildup.  These aliens come in like meteorites splashing down initially in the oceans just off the World's populated coast lines.  Evidently the water's composition is the key to their life and power.  After Staff Sergeant Nantz's commander is killed, he must take what is left of his squad along with a few civilians and retreat out of harm's way.  The film is pretty unrelenting in the battle sequences, spared only by a litany of clich&eacute;s.  The set up is pretty traditional as well.  We have the usual diverse team make-up of various ethnicities, genders and ages.  We know that everyone won't make it out and sure enough you can pretty much pick the order.  Still, the performances are convincing.  And while there certainly is no lack of explosions there is also some close combat as well.  With \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" you pretty much get what you expect.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I wasn't sure about this movie at first but took a chance one night when I was in the mood to watch a movie. I don't know what I wasn't sure about because this movie was really good and I loved the concept. It had me intrigued throughout the entire time. The beginning was awesome, where it showed Bradley Cooper's character as a bascially lovable bum who is given the chance to use 100% of his brain with a pill. Am I the only one who noticed the Robert Smith hair the morning he awoke with tell-tale signs of the drug having worn off( I loved it)??<br /><br />Bradley Cooper did really well in this movie. I thought he was just an okay actor before, nothing really going for him except his looks. He proved me wrong with Limitless.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|I want to be generous, considering that ezPDF can display and annotate files with any kind of image compression, which is so far unique on Android.  Unfortunately, it is the sloppiest piece of software I have ever bought on any platform.  I do not think it would have so high a rating as it does, had it not be the free app of the day earlier this year, and adopted by a lot of grateful and casual users who probably haven't touched it since.    It is slow, and hangs and/or crashes with annoying frequency.  Large files are usable, but barely.  The file system is a complete annoyance.  There is no option I can find that controls where files are stored; without asking, it simply copies everything to its own folder, which is confusing, a huge waste of space, and a hindrance to syncing files back to a computer.  If it is a hold-over from the iPad version, it is both lazy, and a mistake.  Forget using an SD card.  The controls are a mess:  most things are done by tapping, but it is erratic and poorly implemented.  Unintentional page-turning is a constant frustration.  The soft-buttons meanwhile are illogically and inconsistently arranged, and tiny; the new feature resizing them for tablets does not even work more than 40% of the time.  Adding new features is the only \\"improvement\\" that the developers seem interested in making.  If you're into aesthetics, the design is also ugly, and the menu text is incomprehensible jibberish.    In fairness, updates are relatively frequent, but have so far done nothing to fix basic interface problems, or make the program more stable overall.  Quite the opposite, really:  does anyone really need to watch video embedded in PDF files on a phone or tablet?  I certainly wouldn't, unless I wanted to watch it in jittery slow-motion.  I have reported all of this to directly the developer, and they never replied.  If all you want to do is read 1-page documents and maybe add a signature, go for it.  For anything more serious, don't waste your time.It's not capable enough to be an e-reader, especially not for students, lawyers, and the like.
0393339882|4.0|A fascinating subject, and presented in a manner appropriate for all to digest, or almost digest. The original concept of the QT, as put forth by Plank, caught even Plank himself by surprise, for he even doubted his own work. One of the amazing aspects of The Theory is that it can not only be related to Einstein's famous mass-energy equation, it also relates to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principal (i.e., the product of momentum change and distance change of an electron is almost equal to Plank's Constant, h bar). Coincidence, you say? Not at all! Great minds work alike. The \\"ANSWER\\" is there, all a great mind has to do is to apply LOGIC. I thoroughly enjoyed Kumar's book.<br /><br />Also check this out: [...]
B0020H47EQ|3.0|If nothing else the film asks an interesting question.  Would you sell yourself for sex for 1 night for $1 million?  Here we have a successful young couple played by Woody Harrelson as an up-and-coming architect and a never more splendid Demi Moore who is a high end real estate agent.<br /><br />When David (Harrelson) loses his job, their dream house is put in jeopardy, so they head for Vegas to win some money.  Uh huh.  There, Diana (Moore) is spotted by a suave billionaire (Robert Redford).  After meeting at the craps table, John Gage (Redford) invites them to a party in his penthouse suite.  John makes the offer and the fun begins.  Realizing how much the money would help them with their dream, they eventually agree.  One proviso.  They would never talk about it again.  Uh huh.<br /><br />Wracked with guilt and jealousy David presses to the point he drives Diana away.  Where does she go?  Well Gage is no fat old billionaire.  He is good looking and wears impeccable clothes.  He is sophisticated, romantic...and well he knows how to treat a lady.  And he wants her.  The biggest problem with the movie isn't the premise, it's the casting of Woody Harrelson in the young hubby role.  For the life of me I can't figure out what Diana sees in the lout.  Harrelson just can't pull it off and his over the top rants don't help.<br /><br />The film also kind of lumbers along with lots of sex talk but the action is all off screen.  We're not really sure what Diana and John did that night.  For all we know, they just talked.  Oh, and what happens to the $1 million?  Beyond stupid.  Still I give the movie a mild recommendation because of the provocative theme and beautiful people all in some beautiful sets.  The movie also has a damn fine soundtrack highlighted by Roy Orbison singing his rarely heard \\"A Love So Beautiful\\" over the closing credits.  And back to the original question.  Would you?
B005COO1X6|3.0|You know how when you crack open (or in this Kindle case--click open) a King book, you can tell instantly that it's his?<br />Not so much in \\"Mile 81\\". I didn't feel IT: the thing that just creeps in and grabs you. In fact, if I would have had to pick this out of an anonymous line-up of singles, I would have failed to label it as King's.<br /><br />I don't profess to be some literary expert, but the writing didn't feel smooth to me and I didn't get into it like his other works. Still, to be fair, it was an okay enough story. Suspenseful and a pleasant enough way to spend an hour reading.
0545259088|4.0|Impossible as it seems, Sam and Grace's roles have now reversed: Sam is the one left alone while Grace is at the mercy of the weather. In the endless waiting for Grace to return to herself, Sam is left restless, aimlessly wandering around Beck's house and longing to be anywhere but there. Meanwhile, Cole remains his untidy self. When he's not leaving a trail of disorder you'll find him leaving Isabel yet another voice message. But while Isabel can't stay angry forever, Cole turns his unrelenting nature to finding a cure, because Tom Culpepper will stop at nothing to rid Mercy Falls of the wolf problem and until then, no one is safe.    Naturally I've been looking forward to reading Forever since last year when I read the last cliffhanging page of Linger. When I thought Shiver ended so perfectly, Linger surprised me. I loved the addition of gray characters Isabel and Cole and I was taken aback at all the unimagined places Sam and Grace's story went. As I've come to expect, the subtle, quiet storytelling is refreshing. The small, simple moments between Sam and Grace speak loudly in their restraint and felt true-to-life. Cole continued to be a favorite of mine. His brazen disregard for any rules or appearances or what is considered normal is surprisingly endearing. I would like to be that comfortable in my own skin. As I was hoping there are some sweet moments between Sam and Grace and Isabel and Cole that made me sigh.     Besides those, there are also some complicated exchanges between Isabel and Cole, where we learn more about Beck and Sam's background to intriguing results. Not black or white, I appreciated how deftly this was handled. While there were many scenes and characters I enjoyed, something felt a bit off about Forever.  A few chapters in I noticed the changing point-of-view, something usually smooth and unnoticeable, felt disjointed but that may have been because the pace was slower and I wasn't urgently reading on as I have in the previous two books. It's like I knew, contrary to how serious the conflicts were made out to be, that everything would work out with ease. In the end the pace picked up climatically and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. But then the ending came all too quickly, failing to offer the declarations nor the degree of resolution I needed for the characters. It seemed to fit the overall bittersweet, subdued tone of the series however and Maggie Stiefvater's writing remains as lovely as ever. I cannot wait to get my hands on a copy of her next novel The Scorpio Races, due out in October.

B001992NUQ|5.0|This is one of my favourite BDs in my collection. Even the intro menu is set for ludicrous speed. Packed with tons of special features, easy interactivity from pop-up menus, four crazy commentary tracks, the \\"I am Jack's Search Index\\" (which is all levels of handy if you want to see or hear a specific bit of info without having to dig around for it), public safety announcements (worth the cost of the BD alone); we also get a few exclusive behind the scenes featurettes.<br /><br />The story is subtle, complex, and comes crashing by like a runaway train. Then, the train crashes. And you can't look away even if your life depended on it. Fight Club suggests that we don't need all the things we allow to hold us in the material world. Fight Club dares you think outside you own little world and asks \\"what would you be willing to do for the greater good of mankind?\\"<br /><br />The protagonist isn't even given a name, which actually serves to endear him to our open arms, feeling sorry for a poor man who can't sleep and is without a single iota of fun or meaningfulness. He meets a guy, and together they go on a totally psychotic self-discovery trip. And as they go, they gain groupies. What happens... is not expected.<br /><br />Every one from the camera man to the cast is simply incredible; there is no way possible for me to overstate anything about this film. Some people make negative remarks siting the violence as unnecessary. But man (as in humans) has nothing but a history of violence in one way or another. Don't go into this movie with preconceptions or judgments before hand. Once the credits roll, take an hour or so to think about everything that is said and done throughout the film. At the end of the day, this movie is about truth in self-discovery. So take it all in, breath it in, and ask yourself \\"do I conform or do I act on my own?\\"<br /><br />It's kinda like an introspective documentary, seasoned with blood sweat and tears, wrapped with banality, and with side orders of dark humour and fist-fightings with plenty to go around.<br /><br />I am Jack's Reviewer. I am Jack's time spent on Amazon. I am Jack's love of his own movie.rs of dark humour and fist-fightings with plenty to go around.<br /><br />I am Jack's Reviewer. I am Jack's time spent on Amazon.

0553801473|1.0|I've been down this road before and I'm about to turn around.<br /><br />I told myself to keep reading WoT despite a few slow and tedious books (take your pick of 4,5,6 or 7). But, with reservation, I continued on with book after book, hoping it would return to the form of the first books.<br /><br />The slow-in-coming-but-inevitable realization that I was wasting too much brain space on an endless series were the good guys never die permanently and the plot threads are WAY too long eventually stopped me from finishing the series.<br /><br />I have learned from this experience and that won't happen again.  One more stinker in the series and I'm out.<br />But thanks for the first 4 books  - They REALLY rocked!
0061537969|4.0|This book is really awesome! I started reading it and thought about putting it down after the first chapter as I have had to have my best friend/dog put down earlier this year. However, I continued on and could not put it down the day I started reading. Highly recommend this one!
B000WQWPKA|5.0|For years men and women have examined the twinkling lights that fill the sky, to find an elusive signal that would mark the home of some intelligent creatures, to be able, one day, to say, \\"We are not alone!\\"  And then, on one hot day in July, an unambiguous alien signal is detected, but unexpectedly, the aliens are not light years away . . . .    A monstrous starship had approached the Earth from behind the Moon; mankind had no idea what was coming until its transmissions were picked up after it rounded the moon.  It decelerated, settled into a synchronous orbit, and dispatched dozens of enormous, dark, organic, blister-shaped ships which dove toward the Earth . . . .    They plunged into the atmosphere, friction heated them to hell-fire temperatures, until they became cocooned in a fiery trail of clouds.  Frightened citizens of Earth looked up, unable to take their eyes away from the roiling clouds approaching their cities.  When the blister ships emerged, they glided overhead, darkening the sky, an eerie twilight on the horizon . . . .    If you are President Whitmore your day began quietly enough - a call from your wife and a causal breakfast with Connie, you longtime friend, confidant, and speech writer - until you take the call:  a menacing object is approaching the Earth.  Ominous reports begin to tumble in, and then a moving shadow envelopes the White House.  Are they hostile?  And then David, Connie's ex, arrives with the answer ... precious time has been wasted . . . .    Picture (Blu-ray): 4.5 to 5.

0786838655|4.0|Percy Jackson is just your average kid with a few problems: attention deficit disorder, dyslexia and monsters that appear at the most inopportune times. On top of that, he discovers he's the son of a Greek god and if he wants to enjoy his next birthday, he'd better find and return Zeus's lightning bolt. From one crisis to the next, Percy and his friends have to figure out how to survive long enough to complete their quest. Mythology, mystery, adventure and human relations - it's all here! My only issue was Percy's age. I know he's a demigod and he's gone through a lot of difficulties in his life, but some of his comments and observations did not seem like they could come from a 12 year old. I kept visualising him as 15. Otherwise, a great read.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I never rate books and I don't read much anymore, but I can't seem to put this book down. I downloaded the sample first and thought the amount of details absolutely fascinating. It's also one of those books that I chuckle to myself quite often as I am immersed in the life of the character. The setting is quite interesting and can be provocative to the imaginative minds. One day, I'd like to see something like the OASIS come true without the desolation in reality of course. hahaha, what am i saying. i'm an amateur reader but take my word this is a good book.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|Una de las mejores peliculas que ha filmado ultimamente Woody Allen, bellisima fotografia,  dialogos inteligentes (como siempre) y el hecho de ambientar esa epoca tan maravillosa de Paris,  llena de escritores, pintores, musicos y poetas, fue una de las mejores sorpresas.  Un 100 para Allen y para todo su magnifico elenco. Su alter ego estuvo genial, nadie hasta  ahora habia podido llenar el espacio de Woody Allen como este muchacho, felicidades!
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|For better or for worse, this certainly wasn't what I was expecting. At times an innocent, slice of life glimpse back at childhood in the very late 1970s, the film's sudden, jolting leaps into completely different genres left me disoriented and on edge for its duration. Mixing equal parts of The Goonies, Cloverfield, ET and Red Dawn in the same blender, the final product admittedly feels a bit blotchy and uneven. Rather than running from the stereotypes inherent in each ingredient, like a cast of minors fleeing a destructive unseen monster, Super 8 wears them boldly on its chest like a badge of honor. In many ways this plays out like a picture from the distant past, more concerned with upping the ante and bringing an excess of action and adventure than delivering any messages beneath the surface. A broad, varied lead cast toes the line between strong characterization and oversharing, while their less-than-stellar supporting characters bring the cheese in lethal doses. It's a fantastic popcorn muncher with a fascinating knack for the unpredictable, but much, much more shallow than anything else in the Abrams catalog. Fun for a single viewing, I doubt I'll be back for more.
B003JFIVUE|5.0|i was very glad to be able to be able to watch this episode. the season we were watching on dvd was scratched on this episode and it was an important one. glad to be able to fill in the blanks with this one.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|More stupid changes, and no theatrical version : Lucas is going insane with the original trilogy.   He is ignoring fans requests, providing only his untalented vision.  The more you link the original trilogy to the disastrous prequels, the more you frustrate your fans.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|First saw Star Wars in '77, when I was 7 years old. I was thrilled by the 1995 OT (Original Trilogy) THX remastered VHS releases, (I bought both letterbox and full-screen sets just to make sure I'd always have the original)I was originally excited about the Special Editions in 1997, but quickly found the additions/changes distracting, and went back to those THX sets, and when the trilogy came to DVD, I honestly only bought them for the bonus disc content. I was excited by the original versions released on \\"Limited Edition\\" DVD, but slightly disappointed by the fact that they were not the 1995 THX remastered cuts, they were the 1991 Laserdisc transfers? So now I have a cobbled together set of the OT and bonus features disc from the Special Edition 2.0 box, and I'm happy with that. But I'd love to just get the OT extras disc from the blu ray set. I simply don't need or want ANY of the rest of it! I thought the prequels were lousy, with Ep II being quite possibly one of the worst movies ever, and the whole prequel trilogy a complete waste of time. I honestly don't consider them when I think of the OT. So with the prequels unwanted, and these latest Special Editions completely useless to me, I can't justify buying this. I first thought, I'd buy it, and sell off the other discs, but since they don't come in there own cases, that's just not going to work. (Would anyone buy this set minus a disc, especially THAT one??) I hopefully will be able to see the original trilogy archives disc, but not at the cost of the whole set. If George Lucas was smart.............sigh....he would have released a \\"Collector's Edition\\" set on blu ray with the OT and the first Special Editions as released on VHS with all the interviews and documentary features from those, then he could go all mental and keep changing things for never ending new editions every few years, but at least the originals would remain intact and available to THOSE WHO WANT THEM. Lucas truly doesn't get it, does he? Yes,they are his films, but why can't WE have the ones that are good to go? Just keep the OT in print on the latest format? So hard? It makes me sad.
B00042YBTK|5.0|Love this whole album, especially the psychedelic tour de force of this record, the last cut, \\"gemini\\"--great guitar work throughout the whole album, courtesy of mr. weider, zoot money, and andy summers (later known as the guitarist in the police)granted, the record is a little top heavy on covers (ring of fire, river deep mountain high, to love somebody) but they are all awesome. mr burdon has the penchant to make his interpretations of other people's songs his own (check out his version of 'paint it black' on the monterrey pop festival box set--let's just say it blows the original to smithereens...his deconstruction of the aforementioned three numbers on the record is a welcome foray into the psychedelic madness)\\" I would say to buy this, but first, if you want to, perhaps, just dip your toe into the music of the psych period animals, get the compilation the best of eric burdon and the animals '66-'68, which is an excellent overview of this era and features some key cuts from this album. if you want to dig deeper one you've been initiated, then pick up 'love is'.
0545265355|5.0|I am a huge 'Harry Potter' fan and was looking for something to fill the void. I never could get into 'Twilight', books or the movies, so was feeling a little sad. I was going to take a trip to China and asked a bunch of friends for recommendations for books to read on the flight. Five friends told me I had to read the 'Hunger Games'.  I had never heard of them, and decided to read some other books instead. Cut to 9 months later, while waiting for the midnight showing of the last 'Harry Potter' movie, my sister and I were hanging out in the Barnes & Noble and saw the 'Hunger Games' trilogy on the shelf. I convinced my sister to buy them first and tell me what she thought. She let me borrow the first book after she was finished, and I couldn't put it down. I went to Amazon and ordered all 3 books immediately. I read the second and third book in one day! I loved the first two books and liked the last one. My only problem with 'Mockingjay' was the end, I felt like it was rushed and wasn't as satisfied with it as I was the previous two books. Overall I still enjoyed the trilogy and plan on enjoying the movies when they come out!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|You can see a growing trend here.  People that actually like these movies don't want them messed with anymore.  The movies that need \\"fixing\\" (or rather remaking entirely) are the NEW ones.  Mr. Lucas, focus your efforts there please.     Vader screaming NooOOOooOO in the Jedi doesn't \\"rhyme\\" with Ep3.  It doesn't provide a nice \\"double\\" effect - except in that it makes Jedi stupid...like Ep3.    Ugh..this is wasted breath.
B004UXUUDA|3.0|The events of World War II have always been something that have piqued my interest. Hitler and Nazism are pretty disgusting and there's no arguing that the entire war was completely devastating, but media that was put out during that time period is something special. Cartoons from this era were put out during the prime of Warner Bros and Disney so they're well animated and hilarious while movies set in this time period always seem to strike a nerve other movies can't even scratch the surface of. Then again, there are times when a movie does everything right other than appeal to your particular interests. Sarah's Key is such a film yet still manages to leave a strong impact.<br /><br />As you can probably imagine, Sarah's Key is kind of a downer. It's safe to say that anything that uses World War II as a backdrop or setting results in it automatically having a depressing atmosphere. There's an engaging aspect to it as well though. Sarah Starzynski (M&eacute;lusine Mayance) locks her brother in their bedroom closet and tells the authorities that he took a trip to the country with their father as the rest of the family is gathered up and sent to a concentration camp as part of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in 1942. Meanwhile a journalist in the present named Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) is investigating the events of World War II and is about to be married. On top of an unexpected pregnancy, Julia finds out that the house she's about to inherit belonged to Sarah and her family. While Sarah is dealing with trying to get back to her poor brother trapped in a closet in 1942, Julia is tracking down Sarah's current whereabouts since records indicate she was never sent back to another concentration camp.<br /><br />Everything about Sarah's Key is very solid. The entire cast puts in some gripping performances. M&eacute;lusine Mayance and Kristin Scott Thomas really stand out though. They're both so emotional and driven towards their own set of goals. The writing is superb. Not only does the film transition from the past and present in flawless fashion, but the dialogue is just as impressive. Everything said feels natural as every action taken by on-screen characters seems genuine and feels like something anyone would do in that given situation. There really isn't anything negative to say about Sarah's Key and I can't really argue with anyone who praises the film or calls it a masterpiece. It just didn't seem to affect me the way it did others though. I still recognized the spectacular ending and became a bit white-knuckled once Sarah finally made her way back to what used to be her home, but I didn't love the movie. Without being able to find any flaw in the film, I can only speculate that's because it's a movie that just isn't for me. It just didn't speak to my tastes and interests as I hoped it would.<br /><br />Sarah's Key is a depressing yet intriguing drama that has all the right pieces to a fantastic film and is in some ways an extraordinary piece of cinema. The past and present are unified in an extremely satisfying way and the ending is really incredible, but it comes down to personal preference in the end; Sarah's Key just isn't the type of movie that some people go to the theater for. Nevertheless Sarah's Key is a fascinating journey into the heart of World War II through modern times.tion from the past and present in flawless fashion, but the dialogue is just as impressive.

B005KGPC4S|5.0|There are almost as many layers to this movie as there are to an onion.  I don't know if I would label it as horror because it is so much deeper than that.  Or any label.  Well written, well acted, and the camera work is outstanding.  I can envision watching this movie many times over the next decades and still having hours of conversation as a result.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|OK so did I read that correctly? NO THEATRICAL VERSION OF THE MOVIE IS APART OF THE BLU-RAY VERSION???  I AM ABOUT TO CANCEL MY PRE-ORDER! GOERGE LUCAS ONCE AGAIN YOU MESSED UP A GOOD THING! DAMN IT!! [[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]]]
B004EPYZT4|4.0|Since this 2011 film is a remake/reboot of the '82 version of [[ASIN:0783241895 Conan the Barbarian]] I'll draw comparisons throughout this review.<br /><br />Although the film's set-up is the same as the '82 version -- raiders destroy Conan's Cimmerian village and thus the barbarian seeks revenge -- the ensuing story is completely different. The villains here are Khalar Zym and his witchy daughter, Marique, who seek to resurrect Zym's sorcerous wife, once they attain the needed pure blood necessary for their Acheron magic (or something to this effect).<br /><br />WHAT WORKS:<br /><br />- Jason Momoa, as Conan, is excellent. Far better than Arnie. It's hard to conceive of a better Conan.<br />- The Bulgarian locations are outstanding.<br />- The Costuming is more convincing than the '82 version. Conan's apparel, for instance, is more faithful to REH than Arnie's fur loincloth.<br />- Better acting than the '82 version, excluding James Earl Jones, of course.<br />- Brutal, thrilling action throughout.<br />- Convincing swordplay.<br />- Corsairs, highlighted by Conan's comrade Artus, effectively played by likable Nonso Anozie.<br />- Excellent sets/props. It definitely looks like the Hyborian Age.<br />- Good serious vibe, despite the cartooney, over-the-top last act.<br />- Rose McGowan as the witchy daughter is ee-vil and creepy.<br />- Ron Perlman as Conan's father is outstanding.<br />- The whole opening sequence.<br />- I liked how the film stressed the closeness and love of Conan and his father. There's a correlation between true greatness and a close relationship with a strong father-figure and his example of excellence.<br />- You have to give credit to the filmmakers for effectively illustrating Conan's youthful days and life in a Cimmerian village in general, something Conan's creator never delved into in any detail.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK:<br /><br />- Deviated from Robert E. Howard, albeit not as much as the '82 version. Regardless, it certainly adhered to REH's overall pulp vibe. I'd prefer to see one of REH's originals put to film, like \\"A Witch Shall be Born\\" or \\"Beyond the Black River.\\"<br />- Stephan Lang as Zym makes a worthy enough villain for Conan, but he comes off too cliched and cartoony, especially in the final act. James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom worked better, likely because he was so unique.<br />- Rachel Nichols' Tamara is solid as the female protagonist, but she doesn't hold a candle to Sandahl Bergman's Valeria.<br />- The score is serviceable but pales in comparison with Basil Poledouris' score from the '82 version and \\"Conan The Destroyer.\\" This score defintely won't be celebrated 30 years later like Basil's. Why didn't they just update Polerdouris' score?<br />- Too much \\"Modern Blockbuster Syndrome\\" that appeals to those with ADHD.<br />- Especially the over-the-top final act, which is way too comic booky. It's cartoony overkill, pure and simple. But, then again, it did bring to mind REH's \\"Jewels of Gwahlur,\\" so maybe it's not so far off the mark.<br />- The 3D format was interesting but unnecessary. Why do theaters burden films with this needless expense?<br />- The biggest flaw was that there wasn't enough depth. The film needed more 'downtime' to contrast the wall-to-wall action, like campfire scenes (which would better indicate distances), more camaraderie on the ship, more development of Conan & Tamara's relationship, etc. Although it had some of this, it wasn't enough. Action sequences naturally hold more weight when the audience cares about the characters. As it is, it's clear that the filmmakers wanted to make an action flick above all else and this weakens the film.<br />- Along with lack of depth was the lack of epic-ness or moving moments. The '82 film deviated from REH but at least it made up for it with depth and epic-ness. For instance, when Conan & Subotai make their stand against the riders of doom or Conan's moving victory salute, not to mention the potent love & death/funeral scenes, etc. This 2011 version had glimpses of this, like when Conan is birthed on the battlefield then raised to the sky and when Conan's father expresses his love with his final act, but -- again -- it needed more.<br /><br />The film runs 113 minutes.<br /><br />THE DVD: I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie slightly more on non-3D DVD. Need I point out that the cover of the DVD is Conan to a 't'? The extras include a director's commentary (Marcus Nispel), a commentary with Momoa and McGowan, a 12-minute feature on REH, a slightly longer one on the character of Conan, and a couple of features on the action scenes.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: The filmmakers got a lot of things right, like Momoa as Conan and the authentic look/feel of the Hyborian Age. The film's not bad at all and pulsates with energy, but it needed more depth, epic-ness and uniqueness to pull it out of its \\"blockbuster\\" mediocrity. It's violence for the sake of violence, which gets dull by the 90-minute mark, plus the last act is just cartooney overkill. Here's hoping that there will be a future Director's Cut DVD with important character-defining moments that were needlessly cut for the theatrical release (\\"[[ASIN:B0002XVQNU Daredevil (Director's Cut)]]\\" comes to mind).<br /><br />UPDATE: I just finished my third viewing of the movie and, I have to say, I was entertained from beginning to end. Isn't this the most important factor when viewing a movie, particularly an action-adventure one? Yes, it lacks the epic-ness and magic of the '82 version; and its focus on wall-to-wall action limits the film's effectiveness, but it's still a very worthy Conan movie. It's serious and brutal, and -- thankfully -- lacks \\"cute\\" characters. It's certainly better than \\"[[ASIN:0783225946 Conan the Destroyer]]\\" and leagues better than \\"[[ASIN:B0001Z37HM Red Sonja]]\\" and (rolling my eyes) \\"[[ASIN:0783225741 Kull the Conqueror]].\\"<br /><br />GRADE: Visually and action-wise, this is a Grade A adaption of Conan all the way, but storywise I'd give it a C+ or B-, even though it has a couple glimpses of greatness. Overall Grade: Beral scenes, etc. This 2011 version had glimpses of this, like when Conan is birthed on the battlefield then raised to the sky and when Conan's father expresses his love with his final act, but -- again -- it needed more.<br /><br />The film runs 113 minutes.<br /><br />THE DVD: I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie slightly more on non-3D DVD.

0345522478|4.0|Finally, finally got around to reading Hounded by Kevin Hearne. Had read some decent reviews of it a few months back and have the three books in my TBR pile. Today I finished Hounded, book 1 and it was pretty good,<br /><br />Atticus is a very likeable character. He's kind of a smartass. But hey, what UF character isn't? I don't usually read whole books where there's a male narrator, it's just never come up. Sure there have been books when a guy narrates for part of the story, but not the whole thing. And this was pretty good like I said.<br /><br />The hardest thing for me to overcome was the pronunciation of a lot of names. There is a glossary or key in the beginning of the book, but the names are Irish, from way back when, so it was a pain to keep going back and forth to read the \\"proper\\" pronunciation, so I didn't. I ended up just glazing over some of them or pronouncing them my old butchered way.<br /><br />Besides that factoid, it was a good read. Very interesting and compelling. I didn't want to stop. Although another tiny tiny pet peeve I had was that the paragraphs ran long, so if I got sidetracked with another task--laundry--it made it hard to find my spot again or come to a quick pause and remember where I was. But that wasn't a major issue that bothered me, so no bigs!<br /><br />One of my fave characters was pretty surprising to me, Oberon--he was Atticus's wolfhound/pet. Yet he and Atticus had a connection via mental link and were able to talk to one another, and Oberon is one funny canine! He's got the mind of a dog/canine and sees the simple pleasures in life. So he was quite enjoyable.<br /><br />The storyline basically goes that Atticus has to protect Fragarch, the sword he owns that is a pretty powerful weapon. Enemies want it and will do anything to get it. It was hard keeping everyone on track, what I mean is that there a lot of characters to meet and it was hard to determine who was an enemy and who was a friend. More than one took me by surprise!<br /><br />The ending wrapped up the story nicely, and it actually has a rather comical ending in the very last scene. There are few tiny loose-ends that will turn into plot threads for the next book likely which I will likely get to soon, but have other new releases that I want to read first!<br /><br />Overall rating 3.5/5 starsicely, and it actually has a rather comical ending in the very last scene. There are few tiny loose-ends that will turn into plot threads for the next book likely which I will likely get to soon, but have other new releases that I want to read first!    Overall rating 3.5/5 stars
0765365278|5.0|Condensing 1265 softcover pages into a small blurb can't be done well, but the reading experience left me wanting more.  Sanderson uses similar elements of directional pushing and lashing from his Allomancy-centered Mistborn books, and fans of Ender's Game may recognize the differing meaning of 'up'.  But the Way of Kings is a richly imagined, fresh world, oddly self-reflective, with a depth of characterization and maturity I found lacking in Sanderson's earlier works.  With four main perspective characters, getting into the story may be rough, but once you are interested, it keeps getting better.    Can't wait for the next book; this was a great read.
B004NSULHM|2.0|Radiohead have been through a massive transformation, and though I wish I had been able to, they have not taken me with them.  This is so different to their earlier stuff that frankly the band should go under a different name.  Obviously there are plenty of people who \\"get it\\" and it's my loss that I don't.  I know music and bands shouldn't stand still but I can't help but miss their song crafting of old.

B0013XS8A2|3.0|Pretentious - Moi?  There is something about this album - a frustrating sense of \\"what could have been\\", but instead we are left with cliched tunes fit largely for lifts.  Over produced and artificial sounding too.  This sounds like a really damning review - it's not intended to be - it is okay but not that good.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|very nice app. it makes pictures look like you drew them. also has different scenarios to choose from. highly recommend it
B000002UB6|3.0|I think it is telling that the artwork doesn't show the four of them together.  Definitely a shallow album and had it been released by anyone else it would have sunk without a trace.  Buy it for completeness, as part of the Beatles story but don't expect anything great musically or lyrically.  You can't deny the catchiness of the title track but my goodness is it banal.  This is the sound of a band breaking up, of a band that has lost the essential spirit that binds musicians together to create more than the some of the parts.  At this time all of them were producing better solo work (however esoteric or commercially unsuccessful).
B003ZSJ212|1.0|These films are Lucas' babies.  But these films are a part of our childhood and each provide great memories for each of us.  If Lucas wants to make changes, thats fine.  But give us the option to watch the originals.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love her voice. Love the album. Love that I ordered it from Amazon. Never been disappointed with anything I ordered from Amazon.
B003I55BIA|5.0|So I originally saw this book lying in my theater class one day and quickly read the back of it but somehow forgot all about it. Well I came across it again on Amazon, bought it for my Kindle and was immediately hooked. I love the concept of the story, I love how well Brittany and Alex work together. The romance was beautiful as well as the reality of their situation, with Brittany feeling so unappreciated and Alex being so caught up in his gang life. This was a great story, one of my favorites and I'd definitely recommend it to others. Absolutely.
0439023521|5.0|An action-packed story that draws upon great, post-apocalyptic/post-revolution novels such as \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" and \\"1984\\". I read it in a day and couldn't wait to download the next book in the series onto my Kindle!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|First of all, this book would just not end!! I love long books but it seemed like it went on forever! And then Abby and Travis were good, then not good, then they madeup, but then they were fighting again. And now he's jealous, and now she's jealous, and they act stupid throughout the WHOLE entire book. I was literally screaming at my Kindle because I was so frustrated with the two of them. Maybe I'm just not a romantic but I thought it went on for wayyyy too long.    Regardless, the book IS good and the ending is nice. I'm used to reading YA novels with sappy beautiful perfect love so maybe that's why I was so caught off guard. But anyways, it was definitely worth the price and I'd recommend it. Beautiful.
B000IKHNT8|5.0|Love having the original theatrical versions of the film. It is comforting to know that I can watch Han Shoot first in IV and Sebastian Shaw reappear with Kenobi & Yoda at the end of ROTJ. Everything else is fine that Lucas added to his special editions in my opinion, but the Greedo shooting and Hayden Christiansen reappearing were terrible. I would definitely recommend this purchase!
B0054N73EY|1.0|After listening to this album a couple of times I can't help but think any magic that was hanging around has left the building. The Chili Peppers overall have been on a long decline and have yet to equal Blood Sugar Sex Magick in their subsequent work. That said, they have had predictably decent to good material up until now. Couple of points:<br /><br />These songs sound like a Chili Pepper cover band doing their own originals. They lack the raw power of older Peppers music.<br />The production on this album is absolutely terrible. Very flat, tinny, mucky sound that is yet another victim of the Rick Rubin and his continued buy in to the loudness wars.<br />Another note on the production and Rubin is it is time to move on. Rubin seems to be causing the band to stagnate at this point rather than grow. If not cover songs, these sound like songs written for past albums that weren't even worthy of b-sides, or a throw away comp album.<br /><br />The absence of John F. (guitar) is notable throughout.<br />The absence of earlier more punky tinged vibes which has been waning has now completely lapsed.<br />It kinda feels like a post And Justice For All.. Metallica album. Just terrible.
1594202710|5.0|In his formidable 500-page-plus book, equally formidable scholar-diplomat Henry Kissinger writes about the nation with which he is inextricably linked: China. Kissinger infuses his text with impressive personal recollections based on more than 50 visits to China over 40 years, working either officially as national security adviser and secretary of state, or unofficially as a foreign policy expert. In that time, he has seen China's evolution through four generations of its leaders. His insights on foreign policy and his personal rapport with top officials enable him to embellish this diplomatic history with extraordinary detail and discernment. getAbstract highly recommends the book's vast scope to anyone seriously interested in examining China's current and future role in world politics and economics, and that should be just about everyone.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Ahh Ghost. First song I heard by this act was their Beatles cover tune. As covers go, I think it may eclipse the original, which is rare. This peaked my curiosity immediately. I got their album. After one listen all the way through I was totally hooked.<br /><br />Many people have compared their sound to Blue Oyster Cult, Mercyful Fate, and so on. I think personally they sound like Ghost but there are many elements from other classic acts present. The lyrics are at times a bit ridiculous, but you'll find yourself singing along to them all the same. There is something really catchy about these songs. They are crafted to hook you and they do. I don't think any of them top the 5 min mark which is a little disappointing as I could use a long Ghost jam, but that is okay. The album is too short though, it rocks so much we need more Ghost!<br /><br />The album cover art is a play on the old Salem's Lot movie box cover which I thought was clever.<br />The first track on the album is an old Christmas song played backwards. Again smart.<br />The singer, has a couple of other bands, which are surprisingly awful (see Repugnant, Subversion, Magna Carta Cartel) Really hope he sticks with this Ghost project for a while as he finally shines here.<br /><br />Top song Picks on the album: Elizabeth, Genesis, Ritual

Charged to full capacity in a shorter amount of time than the Crutchfield KCX-422TR adapter without having to remove the Otterbox Defender case, as advertised.<br /><br />Talked to CableJive support group before purchasing to verify it would work. They had never heard of any problems with solar panels so this was a great test and I was assured a refund if it didn't work. The support I got was bar-none as we exchanged emails several times.<br /><br />Will be getting another one as a backup.
B001IYCMNA|3.0|I purchased this Access Point almost 2 years ago. I had absolutely no problems with it until recently. In the past couple of weeks the access point stopped communicating 3 times. A power reset brought it back.  Looking at Cisco's site for updated firmware revealed nothing available... I have hardware version 1. They only list firmware for hardware version 2. According to the Release Notes I do not have the latest firmware for my hardware version. Browsing thru their forum reveals that many people have the same or similar issue.  While I liked this access point I am not sure that when it fails completely or when it becaomes a nuisance, the replacement will be Cisco. I expect more service from the Cisco brand than what I got.
B005GWOFO4|5.0|Quality Record Pressings made grand promises for their first product and they have delivered. This new release of Tea for the Tillerman is a super-quiet disc that, as promised, reveals previously buried details and provides an incredibly warm sound. Listening to this disc was a thrill that took me back to the excitement of hearing Tillerman for the first time 40 years ago. It's the best $30 a vinyl fan can spend.
0374290024|5.0|Methodical and thought-provoking analysis.  Provides very readable overview of 40,000 years of human history.  If you are not interested in history on this scale, you can easily read the second half of the book and still pick up the author's principle arguments as they apply to more recent times.  The book serves well the purpose of understanding the risks and challenges of the future.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Born This Way, Lady Gaga's newest album, does not fail to live up to expectations. Unlike either her premier or sophomore albums, The Fame and The Fame Monster, it brings a heavy dance beat to her talented vocals in tracks that give her a completely new sound. Although no remixes are necessary for songs like 'Heavy Metal Lover' and 'ScheiBe' to go to the clubs, the special edition includes some of the best that will have you fist pumping no matter where you are. With an all-star line up of collaborations with large names like Clarence Clemons and Brian May, Lady Gaga leaves no doubt that we can expect more great things from her in the future.
0061122416|5.0|I think this book is great, I found once I read it and mentioned it to others, many had already read it.  If you haven't please take the time to read it, it is an easy read, but very fun, entertaining and with a message that most of us have forgotten...  thank you for writing this book.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|My favorite movie of all so screwed up. Is George Lucas bored? What was wrong with originals? I cancelled my pre-order will not be buying anymore. The Darkside has truly won. I would rather see Farsides gay version of Star Wars or Star Wars the musical on Ice. For those who say its no big deal well it might just be for us who stood in line back in 1977 for many hours to see A New Hope (remember the lines reaching 4 blocks away), or back in 1980 goin to the theater every weekend for a year from the money made from mowin lawns to see Empire Strikes Back. We fans who helped George Lucas buy his great empire asked him \\"please just keep it original, clean it up so it will look ok on all the new tv's.\\" Me personally I think Lucas is mooning us and saying \\" No matter how much i screw this thing up you all will still kiss my Arse!\\" I had set amazon to notify me when I could pre-order, then i sat and waited. These changes which others have pointed out months ago no have been confirmed. Please do like I have done, cancel your order, boycott this release.
B000002GW5|4.0|running on empty  is every thing BUT running on empty , Browne a real crowd pleaser  ; love the piano , he successfully mixes rock and country { i can here the purists crying ] but thats what he has done as well as melded other sounds not common to others.
B004SBX112|1.0|This game is in fact not ad-free, there are still video ads that pop up from time to time. When you sell something marketed as &quot;ad-free&quot; it should actually be ad-free. One Star until changes are made and the ads are COMPLETELY removed. I sincerely hope it was just a small error on their part that slipped through.
B0054N73EY|5.0|Not to say there isn't the singles for the people in this day and age, that don't even know how to appreciate an album but this is such a brilliant piece of work, your selling yourself and the Peppers short, when you don't appreciate this as a whole. I know I'm wasting my breath on the MP3, singles only generation. I've been a fan and seen the music of the Peppers change and progress since day one as many others have and I really liked it first play but after many spins the Chili guys should be proud, real proud! Anthony, Chad and Flea as always are fabulous. Anthony has never sounded better. Flea, literally is constantly taking the bass to levels most will never even come close to or would even be capable. I thought John was one of the most talented players ever........Josh, is he same style player?.....no, but is he up for this?....Absolutely. I'm not going to breakdown the songs. I would give this more stars if I could. Any doubts bout Josh tackling John's old Pepper stuff, watch the live performance on Fuse....The peformance by all, was fantastic. Give this album some spins, I'm With You, is another great addition to the Pepper history.
B006CDCWDM|1.0|To write a biography with only 25 years-old and still at the top of his game... Just Nadal and his greedy team would do that. That's no surprise.<br /><br />Also, of course, there is nothing new or juicy here, other than how humble he is, how he can win even injured, etc. Although it's fun to see him confess that, even when playing friendly golf with his best friends, victoryis the only result that matters. This egocentric guy must really be apleasure to hang around...
1441979212|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is a very useful tool for improving how your research papers are written.  In the past, when I was a young Ph.D. student, I thought that most of the efforts of a scientist had to be devoted to the research itself, and only a minor part of the work time to the presentation of the results.  With time, I learned that a fluent (and correct) writing is a prerequisite for a good review of a paper.  This book helped me a lot in improving my acceptance rate, making my papers judged mostly by their scientific contents.  The book can be read from start to end and then can be used as a reference. I really appreciate that the book contains excerpts of published and unpublished papers, with the indications of mistakes and useful suggestions for improving the sentences.  The book contains a lot of tips in how to please the referees of the papers. In particular, I found very useful the chapter on hedging. In fact, I was used to be a bit too sharp in criticizing other approaches and I had the bad habit of boasting my own contributions. This chapter helped me to soften my sentences and to be less direct.  In conclusion, I will definitely recommend this book, especially to Ph.D. students.
071563318X|3.0|About 20 pages into this book, I realized that the book is not funny and is truly written as a survival guide (well written, too, I might add). But alas, I was stuck with it since I bought it for a long car trip. I could only get through it in small chunks at a time before having to put it down. Sorry, folks, but 30 pages devoted to analyzing guns and their effectiveness against killing zombies just doesn't hold my interest.    My kids (12 and 14) , however, thought the book was hilarious and kept cackling from the backseat and spent the duration of the trip pointing out all the unsafe places to be during a zombie attack. Restaurant, gas station, amusement park, hotel...endless scenarios until my husband finally took the book and crammed it in his suitcase with a stark command that ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE was not to be mentioned one more time during the trip or ELSE!    So, for 40 year olds, the book was not so great. We didn't see any humor in it other than the concept. For teenagers, the book will make them wet their pants in hysteria. I suppose everyone else falls somewhere in between.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I got this when it was free, figuring I'd never use it, but better to have it for free. Weeks later, I needed a quick way to get some pictures from my phone to my computer. This made it an extremely simple, quick task. The app is crystal clear about how to exit or leave it running, so I can't imagine why anyone would have a problem with that. Also, I love that Ivan easily navigate and monitor my phone (Droid X) from my computer's browser. I dare say I might have even paid for this.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|I was reluctant to start this book. Did not think I would like it but was desperate for something good to read. It took about 4 chapters to catch me but then I could not put it down.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|What the hell? I just saw all the stupid changes in the blu ray release. That was enough to cancel my order. Lucas has gone insane.How can you change all these things for the worse and expect people to not be angry? I'm done and will spend my money on something else. If you decide to \\"fix\\" the films again you should have the fans watch them first and not a bunch of yes men. You might actually make them better.
B000JVSUS4|4.0|Didn't care much for the lovey dovey stuff but the special effects are immaculate.  Love it on my 240hz tv!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I have always loved the series Firefly and this movie Serenity.  I always wanted both and now I have them.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|George Lucas has finally lost his mind. Every time he releases 'Star Wars' he feels the need to tinker and alter and change and SCREW-UP something that doesn't need fixing. People say \\"oh, he can do whatever he wants - they're HIS movies.\\" Wrong - he didn't direct 'Empire Strikes Back' or 'Return of the Jedi' & those were the best movies of the trilogy (coincidence?).  For his latest screw-ups he's given all the Ewoks blinking CGI eye-lids, created a very awkward pan and scan scene of a new CGI door for Jabba's Palace, added X-Wings to the final Deathstar assualt, AND made an even goofier, longer 'dragon noise' when Obi-Wan scares away the Sand People.     But those are nothing compared to the worst change of all. Now....there have been some awful edits in the past (Greedo shooting first, Jabba in a 'New Hope', Gungans at the end of 'Jedi', Hayden's force ghost & the truly embarrassing new song in Jabba's Palace) - NONE of those tragedies are as terrible as this newest \\"improvement.\\" It's all over the Internet and it looked like a joke but it's all too real. When Darth Vader kills the Emperor to save Luke's life, Vader no longer appears as an old warrior whose forgotten self triumphantly rises from the ashes. NOW Vader gives us an awkward \\"No?\\" and, as he picks up the Emperor, Vader moans a pitiful \\"Noooooooooo!\\"  It's embarassing - it's bad filmmaking. It completely ruins the tone of the scene, the character of Vader & the climax of the entire film cycle.    What next? Where does it end? How about a CGI tail for Chewbacca? CGI Yoda in \\"Empire\\" & \\"Jedi\\"? Erase Alec Guinness and replace him with Ewan McGregor?     With this latest batch of tinkering, Lucas has finally ruined these films for good. It's an insult to the fans and to everyone who worked so hard on the original films. 'Star Wars' has been butchered and destroyed. Meanwhile Lucas REFUSES to release the originals in any viewable format. It's time Lucas and his 'yes men' were sent a message. Do what Darth Vader did and just say \\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" to buying these new Blu-Rays or any other of Lucas's so-called 'improvements.' He'll never get any of my money again.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Okay, I'm a HUGE fan of Vin's and always enjoy watching his movies, over and over again.  I eagerly anticipated Fast Five.  When it came out I went to see it (several times) and I don't recommend seeing it on the Big Screen, it just got to close.  That being said this movie had action and lots of it.  I loved it!  With each movie in this series the only thing negative I can say about them is that it was a mistake to not have Vin in all of them.  Of course Vin rocks as an actor and he just keeps getting better and better.    A couple of the reviews talk about how it wasn't possible for the two cars to pull that safe through a wall.  Guys, it's the movies.  That's why it's the movies.  You know, to bring fantasy to the big screen.  Can't you just enjoy seeing something for the fun of seeing it done?  Who cares if it could happen in real life or not.  Heck, is it something you plan on doing?  Anyway, watching these muscle-bound guys in awesome muscle cars was great!  Justin Lin is an impressive director.  I'll have to watch more of his stuff.  Brian O'Conner, Tego Calderón and Don Omar are becoming fast favorites of mine.  You want to know the best part though?  If you stayed through the credits, I would never leave my Vin until the projector stops running, I think Letty, aka Michelle Rodriguez is coming BACK!!!!!!  Can't wait.  I hope it's not a long wait for the next one.  So all in all based on plot, action etc.: The Fast and the Furious-5 stars, 2 Fast 2 Furious-3 stars cause Vin ain't in it, Fast and Furious-5 stars, Tokyo Drift-3 stars, at least we got to see Vin for sec, Fast Five-5 stars. Go see it, better yet buy the video.  You'll want to watch it several times.  LUST YOU, UMMM, LOVE YOU VIN!!!!!
B00005T7I1|4.0|I enjoy this movie every time I see it.  The visuals, and the general use of color are really fun.  I want this on blu-ray.  It's not bad on DTV, which I think is 720 boosted to 1080 on my system.  I have not yet tried the DVD, but I know that I will prefer it more on blu-ray anyway.  Lenny
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|THE PRICE IS GREAT IN COMPARISON TO LOCAL STORES--WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MEMORY STICK TO ANYONE WHOSE CAMERA NEEDS ONE OF THE STICKS.  PLENTY OF MEMORY.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Once again Darth Lucas is changing his movies to \\"improve\\" them.  Well Vader screaming NOOOOOO is just terrible and what is even worst is Obiwan's Krayt Dragon cry to scare off the Sand People sounds like a sound bit from Family Guy!  Do yourselves a favor and cancel.  Don't fall to the darkside.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I recommend all people to view this DVD.<br />We all have an idea that the western/American diet or way of eating might not be so great for us; but watching this helps bring those ideas more clearly into focus.
0060557818|4.0|I know a book is good if I find myself squeezing in a few pages whenever I can - before bed, on the train, on my lunch break, etc. This was one of those books.<br /><br />What really makes a book for me is vivid characters. I want to be immersed in their world. This book did it. Croup and Vandemar are truly creepy...
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Do the right thing George. Release the originals. Let the fans have a choice and decide. We'll be waiting. It will mean more money for you! We know you would love that!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Brilliantly directed by Charles Ferguson, this stunning vehicle of truth exposes the banking criminals & investing firms who brought this country to its knees. It is spot-on and should help US government in its case to sue these greedy bankers, mortgage bankers, corupt CEOs & hedge fund players for their crimes against the people.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|The only thing that I could add to the reviews on here that were objective and spot on is that I'd have rated this outing for Donna a 5 and nothing less. This collection will be a large jewel in her crown of creations.
0938045768|5.0|I am a woman, and been training for many years, but the \\"simple\\" exercises like push-ups and pull-ups never got me into multiple reps. I might have been able to squeeze out a few reps, but that was it.   This books is very focused on proper form and technique to get you through all the 10 steps and prevent injury.  Even if you can already perform proper push-ups for example, it's highly recommended to start at beginning! Towards the end of the book, Paul explains why.  It's written in no-nonsense language, tells you like it is and that is very refreshing. Admitting, i just got started, but because of the simple approach it keeps me very motivated to follow all the way through.  The key is not to get impatient, if you follow the program ALL the way, i am convinced anyone can do this!
B005COO1X6|4.0|Nice short story.  Nothing spectacular, but it kept me busy for a short time.  This story could use a little more detail; however, it's a short (emphasis on short) story (not novel or even novella).
1594202842|5.0|I listened to the audio book version, read by Amy Chua herself.  Reading her own life story, she was funny, witty, brutally honest, down to earth, and very engaging.      When I first heard/read about Amy Chua and her book in the media, my first reaction was disgust.  But then, I became intrigued --- a Yale law professor with seemingly normal, happy, and so far successful children, there must be more to this than just \\"Chinese style\\" parenting.  (I'm ethnic Chinese BTW.)    As I listened to her, my disgust-turned-curiosity morphed further into admiration.  The book tells a story of someone who tried to apply the best of Chinese value she acquired from her parents to her own very Western, American family.  In a beautifully engaging narrative, she shared her struggles, her successes, and when she was just unsure...    At the end, I found her a lot more than just a quintessential \\"Chinese Mother.\\"   It's a story of a loving mother who adores her children and believes in their strengths and capabilities even when they don't.  It's a story of a mother who thinks and keeps her cool (most time). To me, a father of 3 young children, her story inspires me to believe in my children, to be more thoughtful, and to find the joy in hard work.  Thank you Amy Chua!
B003VS0CWO|5.0|I just love this movie, I had to have this special edition, you won't regret it. If you are a fan of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, this 35th Anniversary Edition is a must to have. Go for it!!!
1442419814|2.0|First of all, I didn't pick up this book to read myself. It was assigned for school. I had looked at the book previously, and thought it might be interesting, but the first chapter lost my interest. Although we have dissected this book and all its metaphors, I still see no brilliance in this book. In my opinion, it's a poorly written and boring Science fiction novel. I've read lots of great dystopian novels, and this came nowhere close to them.<br /><br />So, why didn't I like it? Firstly, it was dull. The first third of the book was us getting to know Tally Youngblood, the main character in the novel. We met her and she spent a long time going on about how everyone who wasn't pretty was so ugly, and so on. She soon grew sickening to listen to. The book split the next part into Tally's journey, which was long, tedious, and EXTREMELY boring. Everything else was boring and predictable.<br /><br />The characters. I did not like Tally, and I didn't like the other characters much, either. They were flat and one-dimensional, with cardboard personalities. Even Shay, who you were supposed to like didn't seem realistic or very well fleshed out.<br /><br />If you don't know the plot of this book, here's a summary: Tally Youngblood lives in a world where on your 16th birthday, you get an operation to turn you \\"pretty.\\" She befriends a girl named Shay, and when she rebels against the tradition, Tally is forced to either find her friend or never become pretty.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this book. There's many better books to read than this.

0747599874|5.0|Since we have the collection of Harry Potter books, it only seemed right that we have this little book to go with the set. The seller was plesant to work with and the book arrive quicker than I expected, especially having to come from the United Kingdom. Good investment for our Harry Potter Library.
044654759X|3.0|I must admit that the novel kept my interest, but after the books I read this summer, this was too superficial of a read for me. Katie's courage and new life were the most interesting elements to me. Alex, although a wonderful human being, was a little bit much to take, suffocating at times. Just as I thought there was a twist with the introduction of Kevin's character, another twist was around the corner with Jo, I will not however spoil it for you if you are reading this. I somewhat suspected something when Jo suddenly disappears as a character while Kevin goes on his rampage. This is my first NS book. I had seen \\"the notebook\\" and \\"nights in Rodanthe\\" and really liked them so I thought I'd read \\"safe haven\\". Overall, an entertaining, easy, albeit prescriptive, a definitely before bed read.
0545265355|2.0|The first book is absolutely amazing. The main character is strong and smart, the supporting cast is engaging, and the action is perfectly paced. After the explosive beginning, the rest of the trilogy is a huge disappointment. Both Catching Fire and Mockingjay spend huge amounts of time building up to or hinting at intriguing ideas. In CF, a burgeoning rebellion is constantly alluded to, and MJ presents the fascinating possibility that the rebel leaders may be just as bad as the Capitol. But any plot thread that shows promise is always, inexplicably eclipsed by Katniss' constant angsting, whining, and pettiness. A huge amount of time is spent on the love triangle, which is fine, romance can be interesting. But since Katniss constantly stonewalls or lashes out instead of communicating, her relationships with Peeta and Gale both feel underdeveloped, and when she finally makes her choice, it seems almost arbitrary. The final two books also commit the cardinal sin of having nearly every supporting character be more interesting than Katniss. I so badly wanted to know more about Finnick, Beetee, Johanna, even Coin, but not only are they not given enough screen time, they're deprived of even a quick where-are-they-now in the epilogue! The third book is the worst; the entire last section of it is wasted on a violent battle that has no point in the end, followed by an extremely rushed ending. What was the government like after the Capitol fell? How the heck did Peeta recover so well from his hijacking? There is no satisfying conclusion; an epilogue saying that Katniss eventually became happy and had children doesn't come close to cutting it. I have never seen any book series that builds such a fascinating world, and then refuses to explore the most interesting corners of it. I almost gave three stars because of the worldbuilding and strong first book, but the huge letdown forces me to instead award two.

B004ZQRJFO|5.0|The production on this album is top notch. First thing I look for in a track is the beat and the music that surrounds the lyrics and message. They hit this one out of the park in my opinion. Some of the lyrics are harsh but for the most part the whole album is full of bangers in my book.     My faves are: \\"Fastlane\\", \\"Echo\\", and \\"Lighters\\" but there are several more that I can bob my head to. I hope this collabo is planning on staying around for a while. This is my favorite album of the year so far!

0321647440|3.0|This is a much more intellectual and \\"dry\\" book than I like.  It does seem to cover nearly everything about the new Lion OS.  But it certainly is not fun to read or study.  It's basically boring, and there are no color pictures of any kind.  And worse, the B&W ones are very poorly done, more like newspaper prints.  This is not a book I would suggest.  There are many other books out there that are easier to understand, with much better photographs, many even in color, books that area fun to read, making them more conducive to really studying.

0062112430|1.0|Yes, I know that I'll catch hell for this but I paid good money for this book because of the utterly false promotion that compares this tedium with The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Well, it ain't the Hunger Games. The premise appears to be that in 1956 the US built a wall around the whole country and nothing was invented after that. Lobotomies are mandatory because love is illegal. Sheesh. Ridiculous.<br /><br />There are some good YA and Adult Dystopian novels out there. This is definitely NOT one of them. Save your money.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Unbelievable. After 29 years of being a fan I'm finally done. He will just release another version down the road taking these new changes out knowing that he will get the double dip AGAIN from whatever loyal fans he has left. Why do you think he is remaking each film for 3d??

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really liked this story, I just wish the sequel wasn't so expensive. For a Young Adult book it does contain many mature themes, (and no, I don't mean sex), which I thought was good. Most kids don't want books that treat them like idiots. As for people who don't believe a world like this could happen, just look at our world today, the people inside the DC Beltway really have little connection to the outside world, nor do they or the media elite understand it.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|George Lucas can't leave well enough alone.  Between Han shooting first, a new scream from Obi Wan Kenobi, a new \\"NO\\" from Darth Vader, etc., don't buy this if you are expecting to see the version of the films that we all know and love.
B001R4MEUC|5.0|There are really a lot of great songs on this album, and some really great guitar riffs, and a kick ass solo in one of the songs. In some ways I always thought of this as a predecessor to 'The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway' a true rock classic.
1451629184|1.0|I checked this book out from the library and stopped reading it after the first 50 pages. I understand that what Jaycee went through was horrible and I give her 5 stars for being a survivor. I was able to relate to her emotions on so many levels. Obviously, what the Garridos did to her was terrible, but I also found myself feeling very angry at her step father and her mother. I have three children and I have never expected them to prepare their own breakfast and lunch and walk themselves to school. The thought of it makes me cringe! I don't fault Jaycee's parents for what happened, but the neglect upsets me. Maybe having escaped the hands of a predator when I was a child has made me overprotective?<br /><br />I honestly believe that she is still stuck in the emotional age of an eleven year old.  Who can fault her? However, the book was poorly written. I think writing it was good therapy for her. My only worry is that the publisher was more interested in profit than anything else, assuming they may have encouraged her to push out this book, and assuming they get a cut of all sales. Obviously, this book was going to fly off the shelves, so they did not bother editing it. I have heard of publishers taking advantage of victims to line their own coffers and I am hoping this is not the case with Jaycee.  I believe that Jaycee should have sat on this book for a while and then returned to it. I think it was premature.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am not trying to insult Jaycee or make light of what happened to her. My assumptions about the publisher may be incorrect. I am only expressing my opinion. I understand this is very emotional subject, but I ask that you to respect my opinion and refrain from insulting me.
0525950079|1.0|Refer to all the other one-star ratings and BELIEVE them.  This book was relentlessly pithy, predictable, and pointless.  The characters were very hard to relate to....they frequently made downright stupid decisions over and over again.  Misery upon misery was heaped upon them (and the reader!).  Gratuitous violence, adolescent and highly unsexy sex scenes, unlikable protagonists: yikes! By the time I realized I intensely disliked this book, I was halfway through it.  I should have done as another reader did and walked away.<br /><br />But I loved Pillars of the Earth so very much that I refused to believe that this book would not redeem itself.  It didn't even come close.<br /><br />RUN, DON'T WALK, FROM THIS BOOK.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Please send a message to LucasFilm and boycott this Blu-ray release. George Lucas has destroyed Star Wars with these stupid, unnecessary new changes. Particularly, having Darth Vader scream \\"NOOOOOOOO\\" not once, but TWICE, as he throws the Emperor down the shaft at the end of Jedi.    Ultimately, we get the shaft. If no one buys this mess, than LucasFilm won't make any money off of it. Of course, millions of people will buy this and LucasFilm will make millions. Oh well. Sad days.
0451232577|2.0|This book is primarily a tedious history of the events and politics of the WW1 era.  It jumps around from character to character. The characters were interesting, but not well-developed.The book started out well for about the first 100 pages, then became less and less interesting to the point of boring. The ending leaves things unresolved and sets things up for the next book in the series. I read The Pillars of the Earth prior to reading this book, and it was a pretty good read. I wouldn't recommend Fall of Giants. You could read 3 really good books instead of wasting your time on this one.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book on my own before reading it with a class of seventh grade students, and I was riveted.  I couldn't put it down.  I literally stayed up all night to finish it.  The kids were equally engaged and kept wanting to read ahead (which is AWESOME!).  The book graphically describes some intensely violent situations so I would recommend this for teens thirteen and up.  I waited until my daughter was 13 before reading it with her and made sure to give her a heads up that it describes some brutal scenarios.  There is very little physical romance but there was some really intense descriptions of teenagers killing each other.  The good news for teachers and parents is that this book will hook both teenage boys and girls - and then you will enjoy it when the kids are finished with it!<br /><br />The storyline is simple: the story is set in a nation post-rebellion.  The province that is currently in power, the Capitol, is committed to ensuring the obedience of the other provinces moving forward.  So every year, they have each of the other twelve provinces choose a boy and a girl by lottery to compete for their lives in the Arena.  Twenty-four kids enter the Arena, but only one leaves - and they get a life of luxury for the rest of their lives (not as great as it sounds...).  The story follows the main character, a girl named Katniss from a poor province who is a skilled hunter which gives her a distinct advantage in the Arena.  The book explores teenage love, loyalty and courage.  I don't want to give the story away, but I strongly recommend The Hunger Games.  After reading this book, I could not wait to read the other books in the series!
0061205699|5.0|I just re-read this book after reading it way back in high school.  It is wonderfully written and I noticed how well-chosen the names of character are this time around.
0553801473|2.0|There are spoilers here, so stop reading if you don't want to know some of what happens. Like many others, I started reading these books when Game of Thrones came out on HBO this past spring. So, thankfully, i haven't been waiting for years for sequels. However, now that I've read all the books, i have to say, wtf? The series started off so well. I know i'm not saying anything anyone else hasn't said, but why must he end chapters with people being stabbed or hung and we never know if they really were killed? Is Jon Snow really dead? What happened to Brienne who was hung in AFFC? What about Catelyn Stark who has turned into Stoneheart? The only person we know for sure is dead is Quentyn Martell, who did \\"little and less\\" in this book. And that crappy epilogue? What did that accomplish?  Again, \\"little and less.\\" Who cares about Kevan Lannister? And he's another one...is he really dead? People keep saying Martin has lost his way, and i have to agree. And why nothing on Sansa? And for the love of all that's holy, what's happened to Rickon? I know he's just a kid, but can't you just drop a line in about him somewhere. With 99 different POVs, what difference would one more have been? I guess i say all this to say, I was disappointed. It took me a good month to six weeks to get through this book. Unlike others, I devoured AFFC. This book is just a clunker. I probably will read however many more books he writes in the series--assuming I'm alive--because i'm curious to see if he'll recapture the magic from the first three books.
B0055FR5PS|3.0|Not up to par, expected more.  Action is good, but aliens aren't shown up close and are only in the movie for a few minutes.
1594744769|2.0|This book was a gift from a friend at work, so I do feel a little guilty about the following comments. Like many of the other reviewers, I also thought this was going to be some dark Clive Barker or Stephen King type novel. Despite the fact that I usually hate gift books, I started this one with great anticipation.     It starts off well...grabs your attention and promises something very interesting. I enjoyed the relationship with the grandfather and I thought that the best/only friend Ricky was a very interesting character but all that is finished well before the fiftieth page. It's also around this page where one starts to realize that the protagonist is... and is going to stay, a 15 year old boy. It also becomes obvious that this isn't going to evolve into some sort of dark fantasy/mystery novel. No, it is a story about a mixed up 15 year old who is trying to find himself and then it continues on to him eye gazing, holding hands, and playing kissy face with his grandfather's 88 year old girlfriend from 1940, who still looks like she is still a teenager. This is probably the creepiest part of the book. The children certainly weren't all that creepy...not even Adams Family creepy...the multi tongue \\"monster\\" was silly....the Dr. Golan plot twist was implausible at best...and then all of a sudden there are Nazis on a submarine but before you know what that's all about the submarine is gone. Whaaaa???    I also agree with what one of the one star reviewers stated; it is obvious that the story was written around the photographs. I'd bet my last dime that there was no story about a girl with a mouth in the back of her head or an invisible boy before the photographs were found. A good writer should be able to paint the picture in the words without having to resort a gimmick. I certainly didn't need a picture of  Frodo Baggins, Billy Pilgrim, or Daisy Buchanan to know exactly what they looked like.      This is a decent book for a young teen who is not a very sophisticated reader. I wouldn't think even a teen who has read even light sci-fi/fantasy books such as, Harry Potter would enjoy it. I  give it two stars only because it did catch my interest enough for me to finish it but in the end it left me with more disappointment than anything else.  It's obviously all set up for a sequel but I won't be buying volume two.

B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I have to say, that I'm a little biased when it comes to Sci-Fi movies. I LOVE them! Although most would agree that the sequels aren't all that great, I really enjoyed them.

0762434279|1.0|I had purchased this at the same time that I purchased \\"The Millionare Next Door\\" and I thought that this miniature book was a complimentary item that came with other book and I anxiously awaited what I thought would be another actual book in the mail. When it never came, I looked again at the site to find that I had inadvertantly purchased this \\"Miniature Edition\\" of the book, as the word miniature was carefully tucked after the lengthy book name. And when they say miniature, they mean miniature! This is a ridiculous excerpt version of the book that has less than perhaps three hundred total words in it and fits neatly in the palm of your hand, with plenty of room to spare. If I were an elf or an ant, I may have found this amusing or adequate. But, as I am a normal sized human being, I found this to be absolutely annoying, somehat enraging, and a clear attempt by the supplier to pawn off of fifty cent item for ten times the value. This is how to become a millionaire, I would guess, rip people off!
B000001E7V|5.0|Is what you might hear.  It's all up to you & your imagination.  I simply loved the time when Tricky & Martine (the female voice you hear through out the  album/disc.)  To me they are liquid magic, a touch of abstraction, seduction, art, poverty, pleasure, sex, fear, ... etc.  Beautiful & powerful - It's a mojo thing; as if it had sprung from the depths of my ancestors home town of New Orleans.  I love revisiting these sounds during the time I was enrolled in University there (UNO).  This music helped see me through all the papers to be written, books to be read, & studying to do.  All while holding down a 3/4 time job & full load each semester.  This album got me through all that & more.  It made me soar.  And every weekend I'd dance my frets & worries away!  All the while singing along with this - my favorite Tricky dish.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|For a man so passionate about film preservation, George Lucas has a crazy way of showing it.  When the SE \\"became\\" Star Wars, I was annoyed and was hoping this Blu-Ray would rectify that situation.  Not only are the original versions NOT included, but the pathetically lazy quality control issues that surrounded the 2004 release are still here, despite promises by LFL to the contrary (with the exception of the \\"force fanfare\\" being re-instated, and a couple \\"frames\\" of selected shots being corrected... otherwise all the colour timing issues and dodgy lightsabers are still here).  I won't even mention poorly thought out new additions and revisions.  \\"Noooooooooo\\" indeed!  Be the man you used to be, George, and fix this horrible situation by releasing a proper restoration of the original trilogy because \\"attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.\\" Your words, George, not mine.  Be a man and live up to them.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|George Lucas, you owe every Star Wars fan a proper release of the original trilogy unaltered from the Special Edition tinkering. For the sake of history these films should be made available to public in the way people first saw them 30 years ago. And obviously I don't accept the poorly transferred release you put on DVD recently for obvious reasons such as it being based on a low end Laserdisc transfer.    If we can have several Blu-Ray versions of Blade Runner then there is no excuse to not include the original Star Wars. You're only making your fans resent you.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|By fracking god.<br /><br />Honestly, does George Lucas' stupidity EVER end??? I mean for fracks sake, first we got the monstrosities that were the 2006 special editions, one big error being HAYDEN CHRISTIANSEN superimposed at the end of RotJ, and now we have these 2011 editions???<br /><br />Honestly, does this guy have dignity-phobia or something? I was so excited when I heard the trilogy was getting a re-release n blu ray, but then it all went to naught when I heard about the idiocy that is this release having RotJ FURTHER ruined by adding the \\"NOOOOOOOOO\\" from the end of RotS at the end.<br /><br />That's it. Lucas is a tard, and I'm calling it here and now, he hates us all.

Rightfully showered with literary awards and accolades, \\"Just Kids\\" draws the scenes of its times with a heightened specificity, yet maintains a calm tone of acceptance and an elegiac look at a lost time of Beat poets, the rock scene, with one hackle-raising image of Janis Joplin hearing Kris Kristophersson singing his \\"Bobby McGee\\" to her for the first time. in a corner, at a party. I find Patti Smith a better singer than poet, and a memoirist of even greater distinction. Further autobiography is forthcoming, I understand. All to the good.

034552554X|5.0|Can flowers change the way in which you look at the world? Well this is the premise of the debut novel The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh. I had heard many great things about this novel before it was released and so I was excited to give it a go, even though it is not a novel that I would typically read, and see if it would live up to my expectations. Let me tell you it lived up to and exceeded them.<br /><br />Victoria Jones has spent her childhood in the foster care system leaving her unable to get close to anyone. Victoria finds her solace in the Victorian language of flowers, which is used to express emotions. Once Victoria turns eighteen she is left with no home, leaving her to sleep in the public park, where she plants a garden of her own. Soon her talent with flowers is noticed by a florist, and is offered a job, once the florist discovers Victoria's gift in helping other people through the message of flowers. Victoria ends up meeting a vendor at the local flower market and realizes, through him, what is missing from her own life. Soon Victoria begins to fall for the vendor and she is forced to confront a painful secret that has so far been buried in her past. Will she be able to move forward and create a life for herself or will she end up falling back on old feelings that she is not good enough. The Language Of Flowers is a heartbreaking novel about the meaning of flowers, family and love.<br /><br />The chapters alternate between the present day and Victoria's time spent in one of her foster homes with Elizabeth. I really enjoyed the way this built the back story of where Victoria has come from and what she has been through, while still moving forward with the present day story and towards exactly what secret Victoria has to hide. My intrigue was kept focused throughout the entire novel, leaving me wanting to know about Victoria's secret right through to the very end of the novel. The emotions and feelings conveyed throughout the novel were so real and raw, capturing exactly how hard life has been for Victoria. The message that Vanessa wanted to convey about the foster care system came through loud and clear and will leave you with a better understanding of the reality involved.<br />We really got an insight into exactly how Victoria feels through the events that occur during her life. The character of Victoria is so well written that every emotion she was feeling I felt for her too. I also loved how Vanessa Diffenbaugh manages to create not only a character you love in Victoria, but many other characters you will also fall in love with; Elizabeth and Renata in particular. Both characters are strong and provide light in Victoria's otherwise dark life, however they do not detract away from the importance of Victoria's character. Flowers play a large role in the novel and this was something that I really enjoyed more than I thought I would. I loved finding out the different meanings behind each flower, and I will defiantly be consulting the meanings before buying flowers for someone.  Vanessa manages to make learning about these flowers interesting and intriguing as she weaves them into Victoria's life. We learn about many of the flowers as Victoria herself does which results in us learning more about Victoria as well as the flowers. The descriptions Vanessa uses throughout the novel brings the flowers to life on the page and makes it easy to forget that you are just reading a novel. I do not want to give too much away, but I also loved the ending, which left me very satisfied at once I had finished reading.<br /><br />The Language Of Flowers is quite a sombre and dark novel, taking a look at the reality of the foster care system and the children involved in it. Some readers may find the novel too depressing at times, with Victoria's life being quite dark. I myself did not find this to be the case, rather I found it very realistic. If you want an uplifting novel, however, then Language Of Flowers is defiantly not for you.<br /><br />I would recommend The Language Of Flowers to everyone, it was a great  thought provoking read.  I was enchanted by this novel and the way in which we learn about the maternal nurturing of mothers and how sometimes life can be a lot harder than we could ever realise. A stunning debut from Vanessa Diffenbaugh; I could not tear myself away from this novel from start to finish. This is a novel I will come back to again and again and will stay with you long after you have turned the last page.  I look forward to reading more from Vanessa in the future.<br /><br />Georgina<br />Chick Litaholicwould recommend The Language Of Flowers to everyone, it was a great  thought provoking read.

0062112430|5.0|Wow. There are few words to describe this book but one of them is that. Wow.    Every word of this story burrowed under my skin and festered there, leaving me starving for more once the story ended. It's funny because as much as I loved the story, I want to say it was too long. And I really think it was. For every lyrical word I read, I felt a good third of them could have been chopped and still maintained the dignity and integrity of the story in its entirety. If it were shorter, I don't think I would have missed anything. I would have still found myself as attached to the story as I am now. But at the end of the day, I didn't mind reading all of those extra words. They just put more fluffy in the bed of story I was lying in.    I loved seeing Lena change as the story progressed and watching her become her own Hana without realizing it until it'd already happened. I'm not a big fan of playing up the \\"I'm so normal\\" schtick that YA female protags have a tendency of doing but it's what's in the seemingly \\"normal\\" that the story lies. There is a point to it so if you find yourself rolling your eyes as you read about yet another teen MC finding herself plain next to her gorgeous best friend, just hold it out. It redeems itself. Although what I found pretty pointless was the constant mentioning of Lena's height. By the end of the book I couldn't place its relevance to the overall story. I didn't get why it was mentioned constantly. Can anyone else help me out here?    What I really liked was how Oliver had a way with such seemingly little lines that did such an amazing job of portraying Lena's naivety exactly how it was, without pretenses. My favorites:  \\"I hate it when my aunt looks at me like that, like she's reading all the bad parts from my soul.\\" (pg. 71)    \\"It's [The Telltale Heart] supposed to be a story about guilt and the dangers of civil disobedience, but when I first read it I thought it seemed kind of lame and melodramatic. Now I get it, though. Poe must have snuck out a lot when he was young.\\" (pg. 117)  I'm a fan of Romeo & Juliet and I really liked the way Oliver bled that theme over into Delirium. In reality, it's a pretty commonly-used trope, especially in YA, but I really liked it here. Alex is the type of YA guy that needs to be permeated throughout YA fiction. He's not a dick, he's not a stalker, he treats Lena how she should be treated. Shock! So I was really pushing for the two to end up together because I found him such a redeeming and valuable character to the story.    I thought the world Oliver developed was absolutely amazing. More than once I found myself getting audibly revolted with how that society functioned. Lobotomizing the population as a means to control them? How terrifying is that? It's the nineteenth century redux. I also liked how the vantage point rose up off of Lena's shoulders every once in a while so the reader got a better view of the world. How it's all fenced in and electrified and the crazy that lies behind its borders (and within it). I also liked how the illusion broke down as the story went on, shattering the safe indoctrination Lena got as she was growing up. Really I liked how Delirium can be viewed as what can happen when the government takes protecting us from ourselves a little too far. It's scary and who's to say it couldn't happen? Really?    I haven't read Before I Fall but if the writing is anything like Delirium, I'm going to swallow the thing whole. This book induces some serious writer envy in me. It's a level that I would strive to reach and can only dream of achieving. I have no doubt Delirium will prevail as one of the defining novels of dystopian literature for years to come. It doesn't always have to be about society totally breaking down. This one's all about society winding itself far too tight. If you're looking for a dystopian book that doesn't involve society functioning at its basest animal instincts for survival, Delirium is it. And the writing and plot and characters are all fantastic enough to suck you in and hold you strong as well. I wouldn't want to forget mentioning that.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I had pre-ordered this item months ago, as I've long waited for star wars on blu-ray.  Now that the release date is getting closer it's become clear that George Lucas has again made significant changes to both the prequels and the original trilogy.

Do a google search on star wars blu-ray changes and you will see that this is a heavily modified version of the films.

1416511946|3.0|I did like how it was an easy read but in all honesty I expected more. I expected more crazyness in his life.. I felt like I was left hanging. But it was a great read and I have so much respect for Nikki now. I'd recommend but just keep in mind that its not as crazy as one would anticipate it to be..
1451629184|5.0|A genuinely inspirational story arising out of a sometimes tortuous 18 year life in captivity. The book, while dealing with particularly difficult issues, is well written, compelling in every way making it very difficult to put down. One cant help but feel total admiration for Jaycee who not only survived but raised, educated 2 kids, dealt with her captor's mental illness, and now is living as most of us are fortunate to be able to do.  Highly recommended.

B00001ZT6Z|5.0|This albums is epic from start to finish. Each song shows Tony Iommi on fire, his riffs are more powerful and driving than ever. Cozy Powell is not Bill Ward, but he is still a very good drummer, and his beats on every song are just killer. Geoff Nicholls keyboards are present through out the album and he does a good job at adding dark atomosphere without over shadowing the great instruments and epic vocals of Tony Martin.  Sabbath has a more power metalish sound on this album, yet it still retains the Sabbath's doomish vibe. Tunes like \\"Headless Cross\\", \\"Call of the wild\\", the epic \\"When Death Calls\\" (with sick solo work by Brian May from Queen), are some of the most Metal sounding songs Sabbath has done. There are the power metal Tony Iommi masterpieces \\"Devil and daughter\\" and \\"Nightwing\\" and the epic, catchy \\"Kill in the Spirit World\\" with spine chilling melodic solos, creeping doom riffs and a great up beat mood in the verse. Black Moon is a badass, rockin' song with a great chorus. These songs are perfect for a dark cold night, having a beer on the porch in the woods. The whole cd is full of bangers! I found this cd for 5 bucks at FYE when i was 14 years old. Back then I was used to Ozzy-only Sabbath, so I hated it...5 years later \\"Headless Cross\\" is one of my favorite Sabbath albums! I cannot stress enough how greatly overlooked and underrated this metal gem is! I rank it up there with all the Ozzy and Dio classics!<br /><br />Iommi needs to stop bending himself to the ignorant opinions of the radio rock conditioned crowd *cough*thatmetalshow*cough*, they know nothing about metal in the first place.che Ozzy eras.
B001TI6SOE|5.0|BAD, TERRIBLE TYPOS AWAIT YOU!  I'm currently reading this \\"Centennial Edition\\", and while I love Steinbeck, the publishers and editors should be ashamed of this edition.  I expect a typo or two in a book, but this edition is rife with them to the point of distraction.  Some are so glaring that it's almost unbelievable that someone missed them.  This is a great novel.  Look for a more fitting edition.

074322454X|5.0|First let me say this is not a review, but lacking another forum I will vent my frustrations here.  I want to read this outstanding book again.  My hardcover copy is long gone, but I own a Kindle now and would love to buy it,.  For some absurd reason however, the Kindle version is more than twice the price of the mass market paperback.  To say nothing of the the fact that it's environmentally criminal to force people who would by an electronic product to buy a physical book just to save money, the whole thing just makes no sense. The digital version of these products are inherently cheaper to produce than any physical copy could ever be.  The Kindle version should never cost more than the cheapest paperback version.  There is no embossed dust cover or fancy leather binding with a Kindle.  It's just text!  Amazon needs to get with publishers and correct this.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Yes, it's his work. His artistic vision. If he wants to fix stuff to prevent its aging like a sixty year old and Botox, he's allowed to do it. If he wants to make changes that he thinks makes the movies better, have at it.     The problem is, why not have the original theatrical releases as an option? He knows how rabid his fanbase is. He's been getting flack for this for ten years! Why not please both sides of the aisle?

B001SN78JO|2.0|The concept of this movie is great--a guy who always says no to everything is convinced to change his life he must say yes to everything. This could have been mined for great comedic laughs especially given Jim Carrey is the lead actor here. Sadly, the script is terrible. The worse is the last 20 minutes where it devolves into some sort of pining woe-is-me before, of course, the happy ending.<br /><br />The cast is pretty decent and deserved better. Having said that the lead actress Zooey (yep, that's her name) Deschanel is not very appealing. She plays a character with her own quirks but it's so low key you'd think she's comatose at times. She also is very unbelievable when she tries for angry in a scene.<br /><br />No extras at all on this version of the DVD and, frankly, if you do make it through this movie without fast-forwarding any of it, Warner Bros. should give you a medal or something.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm gonna keep it short and sweet. I pre-ordered these a while back...I know, it's gotta be the 3rd time I have ordered these. Months pass...Then the travesty that is slowly unfolding before us starts to occur. At first, I hope it to be a mock up, fake, etc. But it seems more likely now that all the changes are actually happening.    So...Being a loving Star Wars fan, I did the only thing that I could. I deleted the order that I had placed for the complete box set and will GLADLY do without Lucas' P.O.S.    Sigh. Coulda been great.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Who knew Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe could get together again and have not a single explosion in a movie yet craft a wondrous story? This is a simply delightful story that has a superb cast made all the better by the realistic portrayal of three very strong, yet supremely sexy, women in Crowe's life when he inherits his uncle's villa in Provence.<br /><br />Crowe is brilliant as a lovable rogue and all his high-powered colleagues in London are all pitch perfect. Then the juxtaposition of life in southern France where he spent his youth and the memories those trigger is magical.<br /><br />Marian Cotillard is beyond sexy and fiesty in her role as an extremely independent fireball of a woman that recall screen sirens of the '40s. Isabelle Candelier as the vinyner's wife is a bundle of focused energy who dances up a storm while doing the most mundane of household chores. While the longlost American daughter, Abbie Cornish, of the deceased uncle character (played with his usual aplomb by the great Albert Finney) who shows up at the villa doorstep is strongwilled without being shrill.<br /><br />The entire story is made by the fact the characters were so well written and the story is not only poignant and funny but makes a point about how life should be lived...life should be F-U-N!<br /><br />The extras are nothing special--commentary track, brief 2 min gabfest with Crowe and Scott and Crowe's band's videos.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm done with Lucas and his changes. I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy and find the changes unwarranted and embarrassing.
1594201749|5.0|First of all, this is not a sports book. You're not going to get the match-by-match buildup to South Africa's 1995 World Cup rugby title. Of course, it's in there to a great degree but this is a history book.<br /><br />You'll come out of this slackjawed in amazement at how truly great, intelligent, crafty and just plain so far ahead of the game Nelson Mandela was at this so very important time in South Africa's history.<br /><br />The author manages to take us inside Mandela's mind and also behind the scenes to look at his life from behind bars to behind the doors of the corridors of power.<br /><br />Forget Clint Eastwood's movie \\"Invictus\\" as that barely scratches the surface of what is in this book.

B00164KYV4|2.0|Who knew Kris Kristofferson was \\"Friends\\" Rachel's (Jennifer Aniston) father? Who knew the youngest bride in \\"Big Love\\" (Ginnifer Goodwin) had a thing for the Mac ad guy (Justin Long)?<br /><br />Trust me, you'll be doing this during this movie and wondering why when you have Scarlett Johansson in this movie, why Ginnifer Goodwin gets more screen time. Oh yeah and what happened to Jennifer Connelly since \\"Career Opportunities\\"? Jennifer, eat a burger or something, please!<br /><br />Anyway, any movie where Drew Barrymore says \\"He 'My Spaced' me\\" cannot be taken seriously. If if she's supposed to be a techno ditz, who uses \\"My Space\\" anymore in the Facebook era and who wrote this line? If you can't even get the lingo to sound remotely believable, it's pretty hard to laugh \\"with\\" it rather than \\"at\\" it.<br /><br />A total train wreck of a flick that is worth watching just to laugh at how bad it is and the ridiculous cast of thousands (tens actually).<br /><br />Extras are nonexistent so forget buying this DVD unless it's less than the cost of watching it on demand or some such.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|There was a time when I used to love the Star Wars movies. However, after struggling through countless new versions of the original trilogy and the joke he passed off as the prequel trilogy, I can no longer say that's true.  Had the Blu-Ray release included the original theatrical release of the films, I would have considered buying yet another version and media format of these films.  However, after reading about and viewing some of the edits that are being included especially for the Blu-Ray release, I've decided that enough is enough.  Sorry, George, but you've lost your mind and I've decided I'm done subsidizing your incessant meddling.
1451629184|3.0|Jaycee's story is a monument to human survival against the odds. It allows the reader a window view of how much power a person with such a delusional and twisted mind as her captor can hold over his captives, making them totally dependent by taking away all their decision making abilities. It is amazing how an 11 year old girl survived the shocking ordeals done to her and how she managed her situation for 18 long years. The love she has for her daughters despite all she went through and how she is making sense of her current world is truly admirable.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was very disapointed to hear that the unaltered theatrical films would not be included in this set. Still even with the previous changes I was going to purchase it. Then I heard and saw the changes made ,and well no. The bottom line is the I have seen these films and own them on DVD. It doesn't make sense for me to repurchase the films AGAIN. Especially after hearing and seeing the redubbed climax. A great movie moment has been altered to pay off a moment in the Revenge of the Sith ( a moment that was laughed at by the audience at the screening I was at ). Whatever man. If there is ever a Blu Ray set that offers the unaltered originals I'm in. Til then there are other ways to watch these films without unnesesary changes.

B0058OUJA4|5.0|This is probably the MOST challenging TDG I've ever played. It literally took me like 3 days to beat level 1 on easy mode because the waves come out so frequently, I almost didn't have enough time to build and strategize. This game's simplicity is it's ultimate strength, as it does NOT have any 3D effects, rather more an emphasis on 2D and a lot of neat neon coloring.  Definitely something worth looking at. be prepared for a challenge.
B000209ZAE|4.0|When I unpacked this drill stand I was initially impressed..solid, sturdy and all metal.  Then I came to use it and wow!!! What a total disappointment!!!!<br />The head sticks and jams when being lowered, not at all the smooth motion required for 'precision' drilling and to make matters worse it kicks off by 1-2mm to the right as it passes the midway down point.<br />Using it to drill carbon fibre sheet and up to 3mm aluminium and had to give up as way to unreliable and not worth the hassle.<br />Another $100 wasted...<br />-<br />I have revised my original 1 Star(*) rating for this drill stand to a 4 star (****) rating,<br />-<br />I have completly stripped down and buffed out all the paint from inside the collars that were gripping on the main shaft, given evey metal surface a liberal coat of fine 'servo' grease and also squeezed the guide forks a little tighter onto the brass 'olive' to prevent the kick-off's that was occurring.<br />-<br />Now works like it should have right out of the box...smooth motion, no gripping, sticking or kick-off's of any amount.<br />-<br />Happy to have spent the $100, but happier that I resisted temptation to ditch the whole within the first week.<br />-<br />Cheers<br />Matt

B00402FGE4|4.0|I'm about 8 or 9 epsodes into season one.  I'm curious if anybody else is bothered by the the characters using the communication stones to switch bodies with someone on earth and then proceed to engage in sexual intimacy using someone else's body.  It bothered me and struck me as highly unethical.  I think the air force is going to need a policy governing the usage of communication stones.  Something entailing using chaperones 24/7 to make suure the host body is not being used, abused and endangered in any way.  I know it's just a sci fi show but it seemed wrong to me.

0307887960|5.0|dukan diet is combnation of atkins and south beach with a little bit change ,it works great,and if you followe the diet you will loos weight so fast.
0307887960|3.0|With diet books, there's a tendency to review the success of the diet vs. actually reviewing the book for how it is written. I've been on the diet a couple weeks and it seems to work well. Other commenters have put their thoughts here on that and so I won't reinvent that wheel.    What I do want to address is how the book is written and the integrity of the content. The structure of many of the sentences makes it feel like it was crudely translated from another language. Some of the sentences become so wordy, with so many asides set off in commas that it's difficult to follow. Then, there are the many conflicting points in content.    The first inconsistency noticed is that you are told to only use 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of oat bran in the first/Attack phase. Then the recipe for the pancake is recommended and it shows using 2 tablespoons of oat bran. (pg 54.)    Another major error seems to be in the third/Consolidation phase section. On page 91, you are told that you can have 2 servings of starchy carbs per week. (1 serving per week in the first half of the phase, and 2 servings in the 2nd half of the phase.) But then on page 94, at the top, while discussing 2 celebration meals per week he says \\"[say] you have just lost 20 pounds so your Consolidation Phase will last 100 days. The first 50 days you are allowed 1 serving of starchy foods per day and 1 celebration meal per week. For the remaining 50 days, you can have 2 servings of starchy foods per day and 2 celebration meals per week.\\"   I really do not understand - which is it? Pasta once a week or once a day?     This book is in need of a serious editing.     Edited to Add on 9/19/2011:  Well, I'm following up now about the actual diet. My husband and I both followed this to the letter for 4 weeks. I lost 3 lbs and my husband lost 6, and gained them all back. We never cheated once. We are entirely frustrated and after a ton of google searches are hard-pressed to find genuine reviews of the diet that don't read likeadvertisements. We scrapped this diet after 4 weeks and are just going to go back to South Beach. It's a much healthier way of eating - at least you can have vegetables everyday on South Beach. As a non-meat eater, I had grown to despise the protein days. I just couldn't do it anymore after a month.
B001HN6922|1.0|My 2 year old loved \\"Cars\\".  I was so excited when I learned that there would be a sequel.  I decided that this would be his first movie in a theatre.      What a complete disappointment!  Totally inapropriate for little kids.  It was violent with a ridiculous plot impossible for a little tike to follow.  As I watched, I couldn't beleive that this story line was approved by Pixar or Disney.  There are so many other things they could've done with the Cars franchise.  Why couldn't they have kept it simple and sweet like the first one?    As I left the theatre I was upset and felt guilty for making it my little boys first movie.    THUMBS DOWN and a rotten tomato!!!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I can't even begin to describe how depressed/upset/angry/confused I was by such a simple inclusion of \\"Nooooo!\\" to RotJ...

1592402690|5.0|Geoff Emerick's perspective is very unique in the Beatles' story in that he was in the studio when they were recording much of their historic catalog.   And by reading this book you realize that if it were not for this man positioning mics, turning knobs, and improvising other ideas in the studio, the Beatles' sound would not have been the same. This is a perspective on the Beatles' music that opens up a whole other dimension. Beatle-buff? Studio-buff? Then this is an enthralling read! Wouldn't have been motivated to say a quick word here if it wasn't!    There has been criticism of this book, (probably a lot of carefully-crafted \\"Beatle-image\\" interference holding sway) that Geoff unfairly takes stabs at everyone but Paul, and promotes himself too much.  My perspective was, just when I thought Geoff might go there, he quickly returned to a very honest and balanced center. After all, he is a music-history-changing recording engineer with a collection of Grammies. He deserves what tidbits of credit he claims for himself throughout the book. Along the way I actually wanted to read about Geoff as much as the Beatles. I was satisfied by the end, but another 10 pages or so about Geoff's personal life and post-Beatles' experiences wouldn't have hurt.     And the fact that he got on with Paul more than the others is just human nature. Don't we all have people we get on with more than others? Where he does note aspects of Beatle behavior not becoming to \\"the image\\", I do not feel he went overboard, because many of these episodes and personality traits have been documented elsewhere as well.  And the book doesn't necessarily defend Paul. Geoff does make mention of those aspects of Paul's personality that rubbed the other Beatles the wrong way. It's just that Paul didn't necessarily rub Geoff the wrong way, whereas Geoff had some troubles getting along with the other Beatles. Human relationships. Human nature. The Beatles' story brought down to earth.     I think for every comment in this book that may be offensive to Beatle sensitivities, there is a positive somewhere as well. That makes this book a cup-half-full, or cup-half-empty kind of book. I would say this honesty and balance is what should be expected in a history book.     And that's what makes this a very down-to-earth study of the Beatles--and a page-turning good read!
B004SGWYW4|5.0|I came across this anime on a preview of the on-demand service offered by it's US distributing channel on my cable provider and after watching the 1st two episodes fell in love with this show.    The positives:  1. The colors and shadings used in the animation are consistent with the theme of this anime.  There is darkness to indicate the evil the kids are facing while bright colors are shown to indicate the hopefulness of youth, etc.    2. The story is well-written.  The characters are developed adequately and enough back-story is given to understand their traits.    3. The action is intense.  You get taken in by the fight of the children just to stay alive.      The negatives:  1. The animators become a bit too enthralled by the Japanese ideas of sexuality.  There are innumerable shots of the girls panties(even one of a young girl not even of age, really kinda creepy to be honest).  The breasts on the girls are all very large and a good deal of effort has been put forth to make them a focal point.  The normal Japanese bouncing boob sound effect becomes numerous and kinda tedious.  The nudity isn't bad, although the shower scene will discourage some from watching.  But nothing too unwatchable.    2. The ending left a good deal to be desired.  I'm having to search for the manga to see if the story ends as I think it does with Saeko becoming the love interest instead of Rei, etc.  Again, annoying but not out of line with the endings of some Japanese shows which can be infamous for their head-scratching endings.      Overall, this DVD has become on of my favorite series and is well worth the watch.  I really think it's one of the better shows I've seen, and although I'm only about 2 years into my anime addiction, this series does stand out for an enthralling story-line.  Great buy.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I've been following Dr. Davis' heart scan blog for the past year, and have learned so much about how certain supplements can stop and even reverse plaque, high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes, and many other health problems. And he talked a lot about wheat, and the many ways it destroys your health. But I've been hesitant to go wheat free. I love warm bread with butter, cinnamon rolls, pizza, pasta, cake, pie, Ritz crackers, pretzels, and almost everything else made with wheat. So it wasn't easy to make the commitment to go without them.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this book, and finally went wheat free one week before the book was released. And what a difference. My blood pressure had been averaging 140/88 (taking two blood pressure medications). Now, after only two weeks of wheat-free eating, I've averaged 124/68 for the past four days. I've reduced one of my medications to keep my blood pressure from dropping too low after it fell to 108/58. It's crazy! And I'm not starving myself. I'm getting plenty to eat.<br /><br />So, why did I buy the book if I already knew what to do? Because this book goes into great detail about WHY wheat is a problem. If you're like me, you probably think of wheat as four-foot tall \\"amber waves of grain.\\" But that's not what we are eating these days. It's an engineered version that's two feet tall, and is nothing like what I ate as a kid in the 1950s. And unfortunately, it raises your blood sugar higher than eating a candy bar. And if you don't think that's a problem then you need to learn more about how high blood sugar affects your health.<br /><br />\\"I don't need this book, because there's no way I'm giving up my bagels and pizza,\\" you say. That's fine---if you don't mind being fat, developing diabetes and high blood pressure and heart disease and a host of other health problems---which is what the typical American is doing these days.<br /><br />Or, you could buy this book and learn how to live a healthier, and quite possibly longer, life.<br /><br />Update (9-12-2011): I've now been wheat free for three weeks (as stated above, I went wheat free one week before the book was released), and I've lost 7 pounds. That may not sound like much of an accomplishment, until you consider:<br />- I am 6'4\\", and have been stuck at around 210 lbs. for over two years. I have not been able to lower my weight by dieting or exercise.<br />- 210 is only 20 pounds over my goal weight of 190. And everybody knows how difficult it is to lose those last 10 to 20 pounds---especially at my age (61).<br />- This is my lowest weight since 2002.<br />- I have not exercised for the past three weeks.<br />- Although I have eaten no wheat for three weeks, I have eaten a few candy bars and I've had Blue Bell No Sugar Ice Cream almost every night. (I don't recommend this---particularly the candy bars.)<br />- I have definitely been less hungry than when I was eating wheat.<br />- The hypoglycemia I've suffered with for many years has pretty much disappeared.<br />- I fully expect to be down to 190 lbs. within a few weeks. I haven't weighed 190 lbs. in over 25 years!<br /><br />Update (11-25-2011): It's now been nearly three months since I went wheat-free, and I've lost 16 lbs., which is about 1.2 pounds per week. So you might think, \\"Hey, that's no big deal--you could have lost that much weight without really trying.\\" But you'd wrong. Way wrong. As I stated before, I was stuck at 210 for over two years. Dieting and exercising did nothing to reduce my weight. I had hit a plateau and was going nowhere. Now, in just three months, I'm down another 16 lbs., to 194! I'm within four pounds of my goal weight!<br /><br />And now for another confession: during the three months I have stayed wheat-free, BUT...I have eaten Mexican food at least once a week (sometimes twice), including a basket of (corn) tortilla chips, chicken (corn) enchiladas, etc., an occasional chocolate bar, and other carbohydrate splurges. Yet, in spite of all that, I still lost 16 lbs.! My body fat is now at 14%! It's crazy!<br /><br />Also, it got a lot easier when I realized I could still have breads--without wheat, of course. I am loving almond flour. I bought the [[ASIN:B0006ZN538 Blanched Almond Meal Flour, 5 lb.]] and have been using it to make pancakes, muffins, cobbler, :). And it tastes great! Here is the pancake recipe I use:<br /><br />1 Cup almond flour<br />2 eggs<br />1/4 Cup water<br />2 Tablespoons oil (I use coconut oil)<br />1 Teaspoon baking powder (double acting)<br /><br />Makes 6 4-inch pancakes. I top them with real butter (because remember: fat is okay--it's the carbs that are killing you) and [[ASIN:B00473OQAQ Cary's Sugar Free Syrup, 24-Ounce (Pack of 4)]].<br />No sugar, low-carb, high-protein, and high-fiber. My wife and I each eat three pancakes and we are satisfied until lunch time.<br /><br />With regular, wheat pancakes I used to eat six of them, and then an hour later I was falling asleep (after my blood sugar spiked and then dropped like a rock). But with these almond flour pancakes, I stay alert and feel good.<br /><br />Dr. Davis has a great recipe for Pumpkin Spice Muffins in the book. The suggested topping is cream cheese, but I topped them with sugar-free cream cheese frosting. My nephews ate them like cupcakes. :)<br /><br />So I've lost 16 lbs. in three months--WITHOUT EXERCISING! Wonder what will happen when I start hitting the weights and the exercise bike regularly? ;) I'm about to find out. Stay tuned...<br /><br />Update (1-22-2012): It's now been five months since I went wheat-free, and I'm still going strong. I originally stated that my goal weight was 190. But my secret goal weight, the goal I didn't actually think I would ever achieve, was 185. Well, guess what? I am now at 188! I'm gonna make it! I'm down 22 pounds since August. And believe me, when you're 6'4\\", a weight of 188 allows for very little fat.<br /><br />In 2004 I hit my highest weight: 238. Now I am down 50 lbs.! I was able to lose the first 28 pounds by cutting back on the calories, mostly by not eating out so much. But once I got down to 210, my weight loss stalled for four years. I just couldn't lose anymore. Then I went wheat free---which is not a diet, but a new way of eating, and the excess weight began to fall off.<br /><br />I'm loving it! Thanks, Dr. Davis!<br /><br />Update (1-29-12): I've talked a lot in this review about my weight loss, but that's only half the story. Seven years ago when I weighed 238, my triglyceride count was 300. I started to cut back on the eating out and the snacking, and began to take fish oil capsules. After a couple of years I was down to 215 and my triglycerides were 155. Then I doubled my fish oil intake and improved my eating habits a bit more. Two years later my triglycerides were down to 99, which is pretty good, and my weight was 210. That's where I plateaued.<br /><br />The following year I experienced atrial fibrillation, followed by an angiogram and two stents. This was about the time I discovered Dr. Davis online and began following his blog. So I started taking Vitamin D and Magnesium. I couldn't bring myself to give up wheat, even after trying it for a week and losing five pounds.<br /><br />Then, about a year later in August of 2011, I bought his \\"Wheat Belly\\" book as soon as it was released and I finally determined to go wheat-free. Since then my weight has gone from 210 to 188-my lowest weight in over 25 years. I recently had a yearly exam and my triglycerides were down from 99 to 69! Wow! Dr. Davis likes to see his patients at 60/60/60 for triglycerides/LDL/HDL. These are numbers that most doctors would think wildly unrealistic, if not impossible.<br /><br />My HDL is still a little low at 39, but considering the fact that my HDL has been low for many years and at the time of my last yearly exam it was 26, that's pretty amazing. My LDL was 44! Yes, I know that LDL is a calculated value-but still-44! I will continue to improve my eating habits. I still eat too many carbs. But I know I'm headed in the right direction.<br /><br />When I see people who are overweight, have heart problems, diabetes, and all the other problems that could easily be addressed by going wheat-free and taking a few supplements, I feel so bad for them. But perhaps as they see more and more of us having long-term success they will finally read this book...and believe.<br /><br />Update (8-8-12): It has now been nearly a year since I went wheat free. Do I still miss wheat? Yes, but not enough to start eating it again. If I went back to wheat, I would lose these benefits:<br /> - My weight dropped from 210 to 186 (I'm 6-foot-4). I lost most of that weight within the first three months.<br /> - My triglycerides dropped from 99 to 70 and my HDL went up from a dangerous 26 to an incredible 57! And one of the best indicators of heart attacks is the ratio of triglycerides to HDL (google it). A good value is 2 or less, the ideal value is 1 or less. My number is pretty fantastic: 70/57 = 1.23. Before going wheat free it was: 99/26 = 3.8, which is very bad. It's no wonder I ended up with a 75% blockage, and had to have stents two years ago before I discovered Dr. Davis.<br /> - My chronic sinus problems went away. Before I gave up wheat, every time I put my head on the pillow, my nose stopped up. I could not breathe through my nose at all. That does not make for good sleeping. Also, I used to get regular sinus infections---usually a couple of times per year. No more. My sinus issues cleared up almost immediately after going wheat free.<br /><br />Will going wheat-free cure YOUR sinus problems. I have no idea. It might make your left knee quit aching or make your headaches go away. You won't know until you try it.<br /><br />All I know is that I am a much healthier person thanks to Dr. Davis.!

B0056BMK6K|5.0|A month ago I was in a rut. I had three books which were published by an Independent Publisher, at my expense, and I was having moderate success selling them. Worst of all, I was out of money for the printing of any more books. Along comes John Locke with a system that opens the doors for eBook sales at no cost to me, providing I formatted my own books into Kindle HMTL, which I did. I am now putting the finishing touches of two other books which were sitting idle since there was no way I could afford to have them made into pBooks. Thank you for opening up the possibilities. I know that I cannot duplicate what you did, John, but I can see how to maximize my efforts in promoting my own books. Thank you again for opening up the possibilities for me. All writers who believe in themselves need to realize that the only one they can rely on to promote and sell their books is they themselves. John Locke throws open the doors and invites all authors to head down the path to publication and financial consideration for their talents with the written word.

030746363X|1.0|I'm disappointed by the book because of its lack of common sense to healthy living. Ferriss promotes eating a very restricted diet for six days using a variety of supplements, and then binge eating on the seventh day. He mentions the respected Science journalist, Gary Taubes, as a way to lend credibility to his methods, but Taubes would never promote the radical style Ferriss promotes in this book. If you want to read the book, check it out of your library, but don't spend any money.

B0000041ZT|2.0|It's a bit uncomfortable being out of lock step with all the rave reviews, but I found this CD a disappointing experience. While Maestro Chailly and the Concertgebouw Orchestra perform admirably, in the main they are not dealing with Shostakovich's best work here by a long stretch.<br /><br />There is an exception -- the Concerto for Piano, Trumpet and Strings did make me sit up an take notice. This is a fine piece, though I struggled to hear the jazz in it after an admittedly jazzy bass line to open in the first few seconds of the piece.<br /><br />But I found the Jazz Suites that are the centerpiece of this CD pretty pedestrian, and again, not all that jazzy. This will be painting with an awfully broad brush, but most of these suites are cutesy at best. The first suite reminded me of a film score. I was racking my brains for quite some time before realizing that the film is Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid -- the scene near the end, told in photographs while they are on the way to Bolivia. The music doesn't really sound the same, but it's the same feel -- bouncy, old-timey, folksy. Music that sounds like it should accompany pictures of men in bowler hats.<br /><br />Jazz Suite No. 2 adds a bit of marching band into the mix. While I love Sousa as much as the next man, Shostakovich doesn't pull it off as well. I came away with the impression that the Jazz Suites must have been little more than a romp for Shostakovich, a chance to have some fun.<br /><br />I did enjoy the final cut -- DSCH's orchestration of \\"Tea for Two\\" -- perhaps more for the backstory than anything else. Shostakovich was apparently in the US complaining about how modern composers couldn't do orchestration anymore. On a dare, he ripped this score out in 45 minutes. The music is no more memorable than that in Jazz Suite No. 1, but the audacity behind it is entertaining.<br /><br />The Concerto is really worthwhile, but I found the rest of the CD firmly non-essential. Your taste, however, may be different -- like that of the other reviewers here. If so, you may just love it.reviewers here. If so, you may just love it.

This book has amazing photos, huge sizes and really detailed photos that make McQueen's creations come alive. Being a huge follower of fashion and of McQueen, who we lost too, too early, this edition pays warm homage to one of the greatest minds in fashion.

0553381687|5.0|Martin's world and his characters and his storyline are fantastic - and plausible. Everything happens for a reason, and nothing is simple. I think Martin has found an excellent balance between the elegant but plodding Lord of the Rings and Robert Jordan's joyful but childish Wheel of Time. A touch of magic and monsters give this world color but the drama is very very human; for awhile I wondered whether this was even a fantasy book or if the characters' references to the paranormal were simply their own superstition. Game of Thrones is not a complete work in and of itself and all the major plot lines are left unresolved, some in a state of supreme tension. But at least so far the story unfolds at a determined clip and there isn't much filler. Many of the characters are very deep and I'm told that over the course of the series they change and evolve and force the reader to reevaluate.
0439023483|5.0|A friend of mine bought me \\"The Hunger Games\\" over a year ago, but I only got around to reading it about a month ago. In two weeks I made my way through the entire trilogy, and while I do have some criticisms, for the most part I HIGHLY recommend this series. However, there are a few disclaimers I would put out there for any adult or child about to take the plunge into Suzanne Collin's dystopian world.  1) If you're a parent or teacher, I would use discretion in allowing anyone under the age of 13 to read these books. Not so much due to the graphic nature of the novels (although it might cause sensitive readers some distress), but because there are many prevalent, subtle themes that would most likely be lost on anyone under 13 who *isn't* an extremely mature reader: mainly, the themes of irony and hypocrisy, appearance versus reality, and the struggles to maintain humanity in an impossible situation would be lost on the average 12 and even 13 year old. In my opinion, 14 to 17 is the ideal *target* age group, though it's a gripping read and thought-provoking series for adults too! Please keep this in mind if you are planning on recommending this to a young reader you know.     2) This series isn't \\"perverse,\\" \\"disturbed,\\" or \\"sick\\"; it's a science-fiction (emphasis on the 'fiction') series that uses a controversial futuristic scenario to provide social commentary and provoke questions very relevant to our society today. Yes, these books involve children murdering each other, but that's part of the PLOT, and it's meant to make you THINK. As a reader, you're of course supposed to think that the fictional Capitol is perverse and disturbed -- as you well should if you have any sense of morality -- but it's misdirected to aim anny disgust at the author. Collins is not writing about such horrific violence to be gratuitous: she has invented a fictional world in which horrific violence is gratuitous in order to make a POINT.  As long as you keep in mind both of these points,prepare yourself for an excellent (yet brutal), fast-paced, andsuspenseful YA series. No they are not perfect works of literary art by any means, but the concept is brilliant and for the most part the books are sufficiently written and well imagined. A definite new favorite of mine!

B0041KKYH4|3.0|Hollywood has often elicited laughs from broad characterizations of teachers who would never last two days in public education.  \\"Bad Teacher\\" is just such a movie.  Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) has just completed her first (and what she hopes is her last) year of teaching at John Adams Middle School.  Engaged to a rich man, she anticipates a married life of luxury.       However, he dumps her and she's back teaching in the fall.  Hardly the dedicated, hardworking educator, Elizabeth goes through the motions, doing as little as possible in the classroom.  Her new goal:  saving enough money for breast augmentation surgery.  This will be her bait for wealthy guys, she hopes.  The film focuses on the ways and means Elizabeth employs -- mostly unethical -- to raise the cash for her operation.     When she discovers that a new substitute teacher, Mr. Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), is from a monied family, she sets her sights on him, but finds she has some competition in the person of fellow teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch).  Amy is the poster girl for Perfect Teacher.  She decorates her classroom zealously, uses clever motivational techniques, and dotes on bureaucratic rules and regulations.  She is the complete opposite of Elizabeth.     Most of the laughs in this R-rated comedy come from Elizabeth's outrageous, politically incorrect classroom methodology.  She curses, smokes, comes to class hung over, dresses far too provocatively, and has no inkling of the names of the children in her class.  Because the comedy is so broad and over the top, it can be enjoyed as a spoof.  It is by no means an accurate portrayal of middle school teaching, nor does it intend to be.     Ms. Diaz is captivating in an unsympathetic role.  Her sense of superiority, her open disdain for students and colleagues, and her lack of effort make her not merely a flake but a selfish, thoughtless bully.  Yet we watch her make her way awkwardly through the day-to-day tasks of educating young minds, performing one outlandish faux pas after another, whether aimed at kids' insecurities, parents' concern for the curriculum, standardized tests, or a principal (John Michael Higgins) who must balance teacher squabbling with oversight from the superintendent.     The rest of the cast also deliver some spot-on performances in \\"Bad Teacher,\\" which elevate it from merely OK to very good.  Ms. Punch is very funny as Amy, who starts out as a friend to Elizabeth and becomes her romantic rival.  Justin Timberlake is cast against type as a nerdy, bookish teacher who has recently had his heart broken.  Phyllis Smith (TV's \\"The Office\\") steals her scenes as Ms. Davies, a shy, middle-aged teacher who befriends Elizabeth and emerges from her shell somewhat as she learns how to have fun.  And Jason Segal plays phys ed teacher Russell Gettis, who is attracted by Elizabeth's considerable physical charms but put off by her behavior in school and the example she is setting for her kids.      In \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,\\" it develops that a popular, charismatic teacher is really a detriment to her students.  In \\"Bad Teacher,\\" we know that going in.  The jokes emerge as we watch Elizabeth Halsey navigate the waters of public education through a boozy haze.  One thing is sure:  as you think back to your days in middle school, you'll be grateful you never had a teacher anywhere near as terrible as Ms. Halsey.
B0054N73EY|5.0|For some reason, I have seen old bands stepping up with their new records this year and making it back in business and that makes me really happy (R.E.M./\\"Collapse into now\\" for example). The Peppers here sound raw, old and tired but in the best way you can imagine. They sound experienced and comfortable and it seems that for this record they recovered the magic that kept them making great sets of songs (unfortunely, this was not the case with \\"Stadium arcadium\\" back in 2006... too many  filler songs for just a couple of great singles). There's a lot of alternative rock music going on here, but you can also listen to the classical Peppers funk numbers and Kiedis's voice spicing things up only the way he would do it. Smith and Flea here sound confident... really confident behind the bass and drums and as far as the new guitar player is concerned, Josh Klinghoffer was OBVIOUSLY the perfect choice to fill the void that Frusciante left (again and forever... apparently)<br /><br />There's no way I can just mention a couple of songs. You must listen to this album entirely and then, make your decision on which songs you like the most. Personally I love \\"Monarchy of roses\\" (pretty heavy for the RHCP standards), \\"Brendan's death song\\" is a beautiful song (probably the last time I listened to a song as good as this one from the Peppers was \\"Dosed\\" (By the way/2002)). \\"Police station\\" is a masterpiece from the Peppers... great accomplishment with that song and I bet \\"Annie wants a baby\\" will stick on your head for a while. Either you like the RHCP or not, this record must be listened by anyone at least once. It's really worth it.
B004EPYZT4|2.0|The Review:<br /><br />\\"Between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis, and the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of.  And unto this, Conan, destined to wear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow.  It is I, his chronicler, who alone can tell thee of his saga.  Let me tell you of the days of high adventure.\\"<br /><br />So begins the awesome prologue of Conan The Barbarian released in 1982.  The original Conan helped catapult Arnold Schwarzenegger to super stardom.  This summer's reboot stars Jason Mamoa, who plays Khal Drogo in the HBO series, A Game of Thrones.  While Jason Mamoa is perfectly cast as Conan, the Conan reboot is no match for the original film.  Though this reboot of Conan is better than 1984's Conan The Destroyer.<br /><br />Reboots necessarily invite comparison to the original movie.  Unfortunately for this reboot, the original Conan The Barbarian is a cult classic because it is actually a really good movie.  This may be hard to believe if you have not seen the original 1982 film because of the governator's reputation for making brain dead action movies, but here are a few fun facts about the 1982 film.  The original Conan The Barbarian was directed and co-written by John Milius (writer of Apocalypse Now) with writing help from Oliver Stone.  Arnold played the title role, but the movie wouldn't have been the classic it was without James Earl Jones' portrayal of the villainous Thulsa Doom.  To top it off, the music was composed by Basil Poledouris.  You may not know the name but you know his music -- Robocop, Starship Troopers and Red Dawn to name a few.<br /><br />Now comes the 2011 Conan reboot, which is in all fairness, a respectable action movie directed by Marcus Nispel, starring the aforementioned Jason Mamoa.  Ron Perlman does a great job playing Conan's father and Leo Howard almost steals the show as the young Conan.  The makers of the Conan reboot wisely opted for an R rating.  There is sufficient bloodletting to do justice to the Conan mythos. Where Conan begins to go off track is with its one dimensional characters and underutilized fantasy elements.  Chief among the weak characters is the villain, Khalar Zym, played by the extremely talented Stephen Lang.  Khalar Zym is a poor shadow of the villainous Thulsa Doom.<br /><br />Zym is introduced as an all conquering bad ass on the quest for a fabled mask that is supposed to bestow great power upon whoever wears it.  Despite all the buildup of this mystical super weapon, it turns out to have about as much power as a flashlight.  Epic super weapon fail.  Without a strong villain to provide a suitable challenge for Conan, the movie doesn't ever pick up steam.  Most of the elements for a good movie are in place -- great cast, good action scenes and strong production values, but Zym and his cadre of bad guys just don't carry their weight as fantasy villains.  In the pantheon of villains, Zym is a forgettable b-lister.<br /><br />Hopefully, the writers can remedy the lack of a strong villain in a sequel.  There's a lot of potential for a franchise and Jason Mamoa is the ideal Conan, but this Conan fan is still waiting for the days of high adventure.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.ythos.

1416594795|4.0|As the title reads, the book is intended as a weapon against creationism, Dawkins' nightmare (a counter weapon is already out: The Greatest Hoax on Earth, by J.Sarfati). Not as detailed as some of his previous books like Climbing Mount Improbable or The Blind Watchmaker. At times it seems like the author is wasting his knowledge and reasoning battling a belief: why argue against a point of view which is based on faith? If some people (40% in the US!) believe the earth was created in a week, let them keep on being happy about it - as long as they are not your kids' teachers...
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|The Review:<br /><br />Hollywood is recycling movies, cranking out remakes, reboots and prequels so fast that Fright Night is just one of TWO remakes released in the same week in August. But unlike the Conan reboot, Fright Night hits it out of the park. I confess to never having seen the original Fright Night, so I'm a tabula rasa so far as preconceptions of what Fright Night should be. I can't tell you how well the new Fright Night stands up to the original. What I can tell you is that this new Fright Night alternates perfectly between funny and thrilling. Starring Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell, Imogen Poots, David Tennant and Toni Collette, Fright Night is long on talent and short on filler. It moves at a brisk pace until it turns on pacing afterburners (in a good way!) about halfway through.<br /><br />Anton Yelchin plays Charley Brewster. He and his single mom, Jane, played by Toni Collette live in Las Vegas and in a nod to the real world the economy is weak resulting in dozens of foreclosed, empty houses. So when whole families disappear from the neighborhood, it's only natural to think that the former occupants fell on hard economic times and lost the family home. But Charley's best friend, Ed, knows better. Ed knows that all the missing kids at school and empty houses in town are the work of Vampires. Queue Jerry, played by Colin Farrell. He's Charley and Jane's new next door neighbor. Y'know, a guy who works nights and sleeps during the day. A lot of people work nights at Vegas casinos. Besides, a vampire named Jerry? That's like naming a vampire Bill, Erik or Pam<br /><br />Well just like Erik Northman, Jerry is of the species homo vampiricus badassicus. He will not be throwing pebbles at your window and sharing chaste kisses with you in the woods. He will however, be flipping your car over and trying to disembowel you. Colin may be the scariest character named Jerry in all film history.

B002ZG99TA|3.0|Mind set for a mindless thriller....check!, Popcorn....check!,  brain removed....check! 'Unstoppable' is a very fast paced and fun ride, just keep in mind that there are some extremely ridiculous and unintentionally funny scenes. Slickly made with a likable cast, the film never rises above \\"edible garbage\\"(I know you love that term Andrew!:-D!). As long as you know what you're in for you'll have fun watching this silly action flick.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I can't wait for these blu-rays, SW finally in HD.  I have been a SW fan my whole life, considering I was born a year before the first was released.  I have gotten all of the previous versions of the films, DVD wise.  I expect them to be just as good, if not better than the DVDs.  All the new bonus features look pretty cool.  Excited and ready to go.      But what gets me is all these people out there that can't get past theyre \\"dogmatic point of views\\".  I rember the days when people were actuall SW fans.  Now all they do is complain when a change is made to better the film.  Where did all the real SW fans go?? If you were real SW fans you would take it for what it is, not complain over changes.  You demand somthing and now you have nothing but complaints for what you wanted.  Dont buy them you dont deserve them, save them for the real SW fans.  Hey somebody had to say it!!
0140544518|5.0|This is one of my favorite stories from when I was a child. I bought this book to read to my 4 year old and twin one year old girls, and they loved it just as much as I did and still do. My 4 year old was a little shocked at first by what happened to the First and Second Pigs, but she said that she liked it and asked me to read it again. I definitely recommend this book.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Here is my problem with what has happened to these movies.  George Lucas continues to think that people can't understand what is happening in a movie, so he needs to verbally describe what is going on.  It was the issue that plagued Indiana Jones IV and Star Wars I-III.  I was 5 years old when I saw Star Wars for the first time(complete with the storm trooper hitting his head on the door and everything).  The first viewing was a bit confusing to me at the time, but I understood the basic principle and loved how deep the lore was.  It was fascinating to learn all the characters names through toys and word of mouth (the internet didn't really exist at the time as it was 1990).  After a few more viewings, I found that I understood the subtle nuances and was able to grasp what characters were feeling and thinking without them saying it out loud.  Lucas feels that someone that age cannot and that they are apparently his primary audience.  He is catering to the absolute wrong crowd.  These edits make the special edition (which was terrible) look like a classic masterpiece.    One more thing George: Han shot first and Greedo didn't even get a shot off.  That's what made Han Solo cool.
B000WCDI64|5.0|As one who never paid much attention to Amy Winehouse, I found this video to be totally captivating.  I have watched it over and over with friends and have yet to tire of watching it.  Love it.  The documentary is also very good that goes with it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This complete saga set is one of the worst things to happen to Star Wars.  Don't waste money promoting the bad behavior of George Lucas.
0553801473|1.0|I'm not reviewing the book on its merits, although I agree that the book drones on and on. I'm simply getting tired of the series and resentful of the fact that I need to devote so much time to get to the end of the story. I actually only started reading the books after seeing Game of Thrones on HBO. I loved it and bought the boxed set - over 3400 pages - and read happily thinking to find out what happens at the end, only to be disappointed. But then this 5th book came out shortly after, with another 1100 pages(!) and this is also not the end?! Who knows how long before the next book emerges! I think it shows an amazing conceit on the part of the author to expect his readers to hang on for so long for the payoff to the story. So much could have been told in half the space. The chapters are incredibly long with no breaks, so you need to have the time to sit and read for a while. I'm tired of reading descriptions about the food, the banners, the peeing and shaking off.... enough already. It's getting old and I STILL don't know what happens, and I'm starting to not care. What a shame.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Simon Pegg + Nick Case = Sheer magic. All the time. This movie is hialarious, despite having a cast full of comedic stars, it's believable and is basically every Con fan's dream come true. I can't watch it enough, it always makes me laugh.
B003O85W3A|1.0|The Arcade Fire have been around long enough now  for anyone to know they have not lived up to the  hype that we have been exposed to. This album is  another boring effort and the pomposity is insane.  I was rick rolled by the Traveling Wilburys type  schmuckiness of their constant bleating. Go away  Arcade Fire and let someone else take over.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I realize the BD isn't out yet, but it's obvious that Lucas has contempt for the fans of the series that made him a billionaire.  I've cancelled my pre-order.  He simply won't give the people what they want, and that is the original 3 movies without his nearly 2 decades of digital tinkering.  It's very simple, but the company that owns this perhaps does not care.  Since they don't care, now neither do I.  So I cancelled.
6302732786|1.0|VERy dissapointed with this dvd brought it for the guns n roses show what isnt even on it ripped of false advertising crap dont waste your money
B005COO1X6|5.0|As a \\"constant reader\\" I found this to be a perfect little nugget of Stephen King brilliance.  A very fast read - it's summer time, the kids are the main characters, classic King.  As always, the descriptions bring you right into the story and the pop culture references connect you to the characters.  Loved it.
1932100660|5.0|Having spent my life doing science and engineering, I am very, very skeptical when someone makes claims that don't stand scientific rigor.     Dr. Campbell does an amazing job in this book by substantiating every claim of his by rigorous science. It totally, totally makes sense. His description of how the drug and food industries have just taken over the entire discourse on our health when they stand to make huge profits by making us unhealthy is shockingly illuminating.  I don't think I will ever be able to look at the medical profession the same way after reading this book. It's good though- I guess I'll take more responsibility for my health and not just fork everything off to a doctor without even the basic training in nutrition.    His nutritional advice, summed up by one line- \\"Eat plant based whole foods and totally eliminate dairy and meat of any kind\\" is my new diet philosophy. I feel more energy, have lost weight and my cholesterol bio-marker has gone down from 230 to 172 in a short time. Not resting on my laurels though- he wants folks to have a total cholesterol below 150 and that's what my goal is.    I just wish every American would adopt this diet. It really would do the world a lot of good- would completely solve global hunger while making us all healthy and vigorous.    And by the way, I do P90X too- you don't have to feel that you'll be a weak, floating, muscle-less being if you go all vegan. You really can have your cake and eat it too..well, as long as the cake is vegan.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter is absolutely the best show on television and the forth season was amazing...i can't wait to watch the fifth and sixth!

1400069181|4.0|With echoes (and at times even quotes) of Seth Godin and Malcolm Gladwell, Blake shares the story of TOMS shoes and how he started with just an idea and turned it not only into reality but a very successful one.  The story itself is what you are reading this book for, the \\"how to\\" side of making it happen for yourself is there but it's nothing you won't find in books by those other authors (and if you've never read those other authors, you will likely want to go do so after reading this book).  \\"Start Something That Matters\\" is not only inspirational, it's interesting. I had only a peripheral awareness of the TOMS brand prior to reading the book. I'd heard of their one for one giving program and of One Day Without Shoes, nothing more.    Mycoskie is an admitted biography junkie when it comes to biographies of those who have done what he strives to do, so it makes sense that he would write a book himself about how he found success.  That said, this isn't so much of a biography as it is a book of inspiration.  It's light and easy to read. If you are a reader of the authors I mentioned above there are portions you will likely skim due to repetition, otherwise you will likely read it cover to cover in one sitting.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|With  all the changes I had read about, the addition of Darth Vader's \\"Nooooo\\" lines is the straw that broke the camels back.  Order cancelled.
0618918248|1.0|Until last week I considered catholic church a stronghold of political reaction and a patriarchic-repressive organised system of governance. Then I read \\"The God Delusion\\" of Richard Dawkins. Since then, the statements of catholic bishop conferences appear to me as highlights of western intellectual history. To find the own conviction justified on such a poor intellectual level and with the total absence of humour, is a great shame and embarrassement for an atheist. Dawkins' cadence is that of a sermonizer for hatred against religion. If our only choice would be between Dawkins and Jesus Christ, even an atheist might be tempted to think, rejoining into a christian church could be a considerable idea. But THANK GOD! we have great philosophers as Ludwig Feuerbach, Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Marx. :-)
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This editing,changing, and CGI madness really has to stop. What makes this current mess even more embaressing is the fact we, the FANS are not given a choice. Other recent box sets, Blade Runner, Aliens, and even Superman box sets have given fans the Theatrical Cuts and/or Directors cut etc. If Jorge wants to continue to change and rechange the trilogies with each release thats fine, but at least give a LARGE section of your ORIGINAL fan base what they want. This is laughable and really sad. My childhood now gone, I am finally giving up on this request. I have cancelled my PRE ORDER of this Blu Ray set. I have kids of my own now and I dont share Star Wars with them. It no longer has its magic over me and doesnt contain any more to share with the younger generation.    \\"In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.\\"     George Lucas 1988
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Yet another childhood memory overly destroyed. Google \\"darth vader no\\" and look for the link on the Pocket Lint site, if you don't know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing George Lucas.
0307595862|1.0|I could not finish this book. I had been very impressed by The Redbreast and looked forward to this work. Nesbo is a skilled writer but in The Snowman he relies too much on graphic decriptions of torture and mutilation -- mostly of women (this was true up to the point I stopped reading). He is tricky: he doesn't have the narrator describe everything, but will have the murderer describe what he has done or what he plans to do. I could not take anymore. Gore like sex, can have its place in art, but as porn does with sex this book does with violence -- think the movie \\"The Wild Bunch.\\"<br />Too bad. I like Harry Hole, who despite his name is one of the more well portrayed dysfunctional cops in current noir literature, but after this I am hesitant to read any more Nesbo.

0316056863|4.0|I really enjoyed this memoir and it was a pretty quick read.  I enjoy Tina Fey's humor and laughed out loud several times.  I appreciate her ability to laugh at herself but I did wish she had toned down the self-deprecation slightly.  At times it seemed to go past the point where it was funny and just seemed a bit uncomfortable.  Still, I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who generally finds Tina Fey funny.  It is worth your time.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|Michael Parks delivers a purely terrifying look at religious fundamentalists in this deviation from anything that remotely resembles Kevin Smith.  Three young males searching for sex on a 'personals website' uncover something much more than what they bargained for.  What make's it frightening is the simplicity of the premise, and knowledge that people like this actually exist.  For example, please research 'Fred Phelps' and the 'Sovereign Citizen Movement'.  Then watch this movie and know that they live in your state and maybe are your neighbors!    Also, take pleasure in knowing that your money is not going to some Hollywood studio.  The typical $10 million movie probably has double its production value going into advertising.  Why?  Basically so film makers will never see anything on the 'back-end' ever again.  This is a QUALITY, low-budget, independent film without any studio executives pocketing any money.  Hollywood needs a wake-up call! No more $12 tickets, no more chain theaters that charge you $7.50 for a small popcorn!!  Call your friends over, pop your own popcorn, make you a drink, turn down the lights, turn up the volume . . . and enjoy a movie as it should be experienced!!!
B0050PYNN0|1.0|this is the dumbest movie i have ever seen i only watched 40 mins of it and i was wishing i was high so i could just forget what i seen. do not bother getting this movie save your money for something more important like fertilizer because this movie stinks just as much.

0307472841|3.0|The Inspector Wallander books are something like the Columbo TV series. Fun to watch, but formulaic,  unrealistic and predictable (Pretty much in that order for the Wallander books). But the fun made Columbo a hit.  Take away the fun and The Man from Beijing (TMfB) pops up.  It's the weakest of Mankell's books that I've read so far, and certainly not the one to start with (I've read the entire Wallander series). The Wallander books are fun if nothing else. Good junk fiction.  TMfB plods along with characters that are never fully fleshed out, and other (major) characters that maybe are too uninteresting to care about anyway. Another problem: The backstory is more intersting than the action. The backstory is what drives the story.  From the moment you pick the book up you can see through to the last page with Mankell's safe ending telegraphing itself to you. You wait and hope for something exciting to happen, but like most of Mankell's writing (and Columbo) the climax happens offstage, before the story really starts.  With the Wallander books you watch as Wallander stumbles along usually relying on dumb luck to resolve the case. Here we're expected to care about the characters, but Mankell shows his fatal flaw of not being able to create any suspense, or at best creating what might be a suspenseful situation, if you didn't see the next scene staring you in the face.  This reads like a finished draft, but as yet unedited book, very uneven and choppy.  All in all, if you've read other of Mankell's books this is easy reading, it might be a good choice for a vacation (or the WC). The book pulls you along from scene to scene, but so weakly (and slowly) that you never mind putting it down.  You won't even mind not finishing it if you forget to pack it when you move on to your next destination.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Skip it.  The movie is ruined more and more every time it's reissued to get more of our money.  Each time Lucas screws it up a little more.  *sigh*
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Without a doubt the overall best movie i saw this year.  And if you're a comic book fan, it's a nerdgasm of perfection.  Iron Man was close, Cap is perfect.
0763644455|4.0|This is a very good book which I gave to my grandson.  I love the story as it is so colorful and meaty.  He is reading it now.  The only thing I wish is that it weren't so large, which  was the only surprise. But a lot would be lost if it were.  Very personable book.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Missed my stop on the train more than a few times playing this game. Well balanced, lots of variety and fun!
B005KGPC4S|5.0|Saw this when he was touring the country. Great movie with an awesome ending. Lots of suspense and plenty of gun play.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm sure there are numerous other reviews to read about the problems with this release.  I just wanted to say, give the fans what we want!  The ORIGINAL Star Wars we all grew up with, nothing added, nothing changed, as it was but have the film cleaned up.  The CGI looks like crap compared to the models; understand that and stop adding it.    I was really excited when I heard this was coming out on bluray and the rumors were that there would be the original release included in the set, I preordered, but a voice in the  back of my head kept telling me not to trust Lucas not to mess this up...  it was right.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Pre-order cancelled.    Why? Lucas has ruined one of the seminal moments in the original trilogy with a ridiculous cry. I'd rather have a straight across transfer of the special edition dvds than these new blu-rays.    Pity.
0345529057|4.0|I'm about 7/8 through all the books in this set. It is a great series, and the box set is well priced. There are some physical quality issues with the set. I had pages unattached to the binding in a couple of the books, but Amazon did not hesitate to replace them. That being said, at the current price, the set is worth every penny. George R.R. Martin takes the reader on a whirlwind journey across kingdoms, through war and deception, with unexpected plot twists and character deaths along the way. Each book leaves you on the edge of your seat, eager to read further.
0670022411|5.0|I thought this book was incredible. I listened to the audio version of it, which was very well read. The story line was intriguing and I was immediately sucked in. The characters were well written and interesting. I can't wait to read the other two books of this series!
B005IZLPKQ|1.0|[...]    2011 has been a stellar year for Marvel Comics and their movie division. This year saw the release of three feature films featuring iconic, flagship characters from their vast library of superheroes. Both Thor and X-Men First Class were excellent films. There were high hopes for Captain America: The First Avenger. This is one of Marvel's oldest, most respected titles. Unfortunately, the movie fell short and left me with a sense of disappointment.    I just found it very difficult to get into the movie at all. A lot of that falls on the director, Joe Johnston. I felt as though he just did not create a captivating enough world to keep viewers engaged in this movie. Unfortunately, his recent history as a director has not been so great and this movie continued that trend.    A lot of the blame can be placed squarely on the cast of this movie. Let's start at the top. Chris Evans was completely the wrong choice to play Captain America, Steve Rogers. He said in interviews he was very hesitant to take the role and that came full bore in this movie. His acting was just bad. He was unconvincing and it really felt like he was phoning it in the whole movie. This movie also had Tommie Lee Jones playing a colonel. Did Tommie need a paycheck that bad to do this movie? Even he could have done better. The lead actress in the film was Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter. She was decent enough in this, but there was just no chemistry between her and Chris Evans. Although this has been a common problem for marvel as the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman in Thor was also sub-par. But I will not trash the entire cast. I did like Dominic Cooper's performance as Howard Stark. I really felt he belonged in this movie and didn't feel like I was watching Cooper play Stark. I felt like I was watching Howard Stark.    I am going to mention Hugo Weaving separately. While I thought his portrayal of Red Skull was fine, I mention him here to talk about the costuming. The costuming was just not that great. The Red Skull makeup really reminded me of The Mask. Yeah, remember that movie starring Jim Carrey. Great makeup for the early ninities, not so good for 2011. Another problem I had was Captain America's suit. I really thought it looked like a paintball outfit. Although, that would have been a hilarious way to settle the war, it just felt out of place.    All in all, this movie had potential. A few minor tweaks and at least one recasting would have made this movie a lot better. It is watchable. I'm going to give this movie a 5/10. I'll probably re-watch it with the other Marvel films in preparation for The Avengers and ensuing movie marathons once Avengers is on Blu-Ray.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|So Greedo's laser bolt ricochets off the wall and kills him. And although Han drew his blaster from its holster, he didn't fire a shot. And THEN Han tosses coin to the bartender and apologizes for the mess he didn't create?    Did these people even consider continuity while dribbling crappy CGI all over these films?    What a disgrace. Star Wars is dead to me now.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I guess it was George's destiny to destroy the original trilogy by adding all these stupid things and not fixing the old ones.  I don't think we as fans will ever get to have the same experience as we have had before thanks to Lucas having complete control of every aspect of the series.  We tell him, we want the original theatrical releases of star wars, and what does he do?  Makes them worse to maybe make us mad?  If i weren't mistaken i would say Lucas hates Star Wars and hates the fans even more.  He time and time again lets us down with these \\"new\\" releases.  I'm sad to say I'm done giving into pathetic excuse of remastered material and putting more money in his pockets.      I implore every fan out there who loves Star Wars for what it should be, do not buy this it's a waste of money and only proves we are stupid and easily manipulated to buying junk
B0001I55SS|1.0|This was a film that was so obviously created by a committee that it probably never had a chance to be any good.  It was a shameless attempt to cash in on the sci-fi excitement generated by Star Wars but with none of the imagination and none of the heart.      By the dialogue given them in the truly abysmal script, it's clear not a single one of the characters has the brains to ride a wagon down a hill let alone pilot a spacecraft across the galaxy.  The robots are a cringe-worthy attempt by some marketing genius at Disney to be cute rather than cool - one of many indications that the producers had no understanding of what sci-fi fans, including children who like sci-fi, are interested in seeing.    The cast?  Holy crap.  Who was the producer who said \\"hey, let's make a space movie for kids.  Get me Ernest Borgnine and Slim Pickins on the phone right away!\\"?  Did that producer ever work again?  I mean, even in 1979, come on.    I'm sure he was the same Einstein who thought the final scene of the movie with it's dialogue-free drift through some kind of symbolic heaven and hell was all 2001-ish.  Except this idiot didn't have an Arthur C. Clarke on board.    I wouldn't watch this film again for fear that I might die suddenly and in my final moments have to deal with the fact that Disney's The Black Hole was the last film I'd ever see.
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. I love the mix of technology, conspiracies, and heroism, You develop a love-hate relationship with some of the characters and you think some of the characters are true heroes. Some of the technology I could see as real-life, mainstream, technology. Yeah, I know it is fiction and all, but the HUD glasses seem so cool. Think smartphone on your glasses.     Great read. I highly recommend.
B004SRNH10|5.0|What company in their right mind wants to pay multiple times to have their apps developed on multiple native platforms. When they can write their sin Flex/Flash once and have them run on all the platforms. Let Adobe do the work of figuring out all the differences between platforms. If you want to do multiple native platforms right, you would want expert developers for each platform doing the work, so you would have to hire different developers for each platform like Web, iOS, Android, WebOS, Blackberry, Mac and Windows, just to name a few.    A well written flash app is as good as any native app. And a crappy written native app is as bad as any crappy written flash app.    Flash and Air work great on my Evo 4G and Samsung Galaxy TAB, but seems a bit sluggish on my Xoom, but did get better with a resent update. I have confidence that Adobe with eventually completely fix the sluggishness.    I've been a developer for many years on many different platforms and the Flex/Flash IDE's along with the other Adobe products that come with the CS5.5 Suites are the best set of tools I've ever used for developing apps and creating the artwork, ads, manuals, etc...    BTW:  Before giving a bad review READ THE DESCRIPTION, it states which phones are not compatible yet!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This was a profoundly touching movie for me personally.  As a single, middle-aged man that has a dog companion who goes everywhere with me, I instantly related to this film and the special, unspoken bond between a human and a dog that many of us dog owners are so fortunate to have.  This movie even tops \\"My Dog Spot\\" which was another movie that connected with me in a very special way.    And yes, as a grown man, construction worker, former football player, the waterworks were running from my eyes by the end of the movie.  A pretty good sign that a movie has touched your heart is when you are still thinking about the movie days after watching it.      There isn't a lot more that I can say that hasn't already been said.  But I must get one thing off my chest which I thought was the most beautiful and poignant moment in the movie.  It was the scene of Hachi's passing, in which the now elderly Hachi was laying down at his usual perch in front of the train station, still waiting for his master to arrive.  Hachi fell into a peaceful sleep with happy dreams of all the joyous times he had spent with his master.  And it was with these cherished memories in his mind that Hachi peacefully slipped away to the heavens where he finally was re-united with his master.  I thought this scene was handled beautifully by the director and was a perfect way of portraying the closure to Hachi's life-long devotion and loyalty to his master.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|I have been waiting to see this movie for months. I heard about it from Kevin smiths smodcast, including the redstate of the union podcast he did about the movie and the filming . This movie does not disappoint and if you didn't know it's a Kevin Smith film you wouldn't have guessed it in a million years. I sat there with my jaw dropped and my eyes wide open through the whole thing. The film looks fantastic, I really like the look from those red cameras. They are so clean and crisp. Michael Parks and Melissa Leo are amazing at the craft of acting and I hope they get honored for this film. So watch this movie for two reasons, to see great acting and great story telling. I have always been a Kevin smith fan and after watching this movie I understand why he is so proud of it!
B0051QO4QY|4.0|There's a late 80s/early 90s aesthetic to most of the songs that makes them feel familiar even on the first listen, and there's no mistaking Lady Gaga's intentions of being inflammatory.  Her activism on LGBT rights is well documented and on full display on the title track, but the dominant theme of this album is religion.  Throughout Born This Way, Lady Gaga takes aim at kneejerk bible thumpers as well--though her jabs are actually more thoughtful and subtle than I'm sure will be recognized once they're introduced to the crowd who has no room for any interpretation of Scripture that isn't their own.    The best microcosm for this album is \\"Judas,\\" in which Gaga sings of her devotion to the man who betrayed Christ to the Romans.  \\"Jesus is my virtue/Judas is the demon I cling to,\\" she concludes.  Is the song meant to denounce Christ or merely antagonize those who shield their bigotry and hatred behind the Bible?  Hard to say, but I think there's at least one more valid interpretation worth considering: that Lady Gaga is exploring the fact that we're all sinners.  No matter how devout you may be, if you're really honest with yourself, you can admit to having betrayed Christ in your own ways over the years.  In this context, then, \\"Judas\\" isn't as sacrilegious as it may appear at first blanch, but rather a sincere discussion of faith.  Of course, the very audience who might stand to learn something from \\"Judas\\" will renounce it the moment they hear about it, passing judgment on the superficial rather than the actual nature of the song.    Which brings me to the larger issue with Born This Way: Lady Gaga knows the world is paying attention to her, so one has to ask why she would feel the need to bait such a backlash in the first place.  Could she not have written and recorded a song about how we all fall short of our spiritual ideals that doesn't appear to be a love letter to the most notorious back-stabber of all time?  Wouldn't her very celebrity ensure that such a more modest song would still have found an audience and resonated?  The problem this creates in me as a listener is that I feel that these songs were created for the sake of instigating controversy not to raise awareness of anything, but for the sake of controversy itself.  It feels calculated, which I fear detracts from the otherwise legitimate arguments espoused throughout these fourteen songs.

B004BLJQOK|2.0|I won't go too far to down this movie seeing as how I watched it when it first came out...(think it was last year, I believe), but this review will be kinda backwards. I watched this because my fiancee said it was interesting.  Now, I didn't know until the last minute that he watched the Swedish version and read the book.  When we watched the American version, it made no sense and even he said that.  The American verion has a lot of scenes where it was cut out from the Swedish one and it made you sit in the theater wondering---\\"Okay, what the hench is this?\\" or,----\\"Did they leave out some parts?\\"  A lot of my associates who I don't like said that it was scary.  What?  A girl killing a man just for his blood?  I really don't like to down this because, in my opinion, it would've been decent if he didn't show me the book and the Swedish movie before I saw this.  But Let The Right One In(Swedish) is much better and put together storywise than Let Me In(American).

B000CE9R26|5.0|I usually don't write long extensive reviews,,I get bored reading them so I will get to the point.   I have always loved all of Donna Summer and I am 40. This CD is not her usual Disco Dance from the 70s. It is simply GENIUS. Donna shows that she embraces different styles of music and here she shows more passion (Oh Billy Please) more exotic (Eyes) more spirituality (I'm Free) and best of all,more humanity (Forgive Me). Not to mention that the rest of these tracks are just pure fun,dance,and soul. Get this CD,,it's worth it. And if you like this you will definitly like her other CD I'm A Rainbow if you're interested in seeing a different side of this Queen.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This movie is one of the best anime movies I have ever watched and I've watched a lot of anime.

As I hope to have a big family of my own someday, I hope were as close as this bunch is.

The CD has artists that \\"cover\\" songs that were in the movie.  Some are songs that weren't even in the movie.  How can you call this an \\"Original....\\"?  I just got screwed out of $15.

B004SJ3AXI|1.0|ill start by saying why are people giving this more than one star if it doesnt work? like most from summer on doesnt work. get resets, black screens, or occasionally u get half a level in and then resets. maybe rovio should spend more time on the games that made them popular instead of the endorsement deals and stuffed pigs. its been way too long unfixed. losing interest in all things birds, quick.

B0054N73EY|5.0|I am SO HAPPY to receive this Album and listen to it!  It is Music to My Ears.  Very Creative, very cool instrumentation, but still the SAME fantastic chili peppers signature style.  I die for this stuff.  Fan Since Fifth grade.  That's a long time, girls and boys.  ANd RHCP is the only band that's made it 2 decades strong in my heart. GET IT.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Stop. Changing. The films.    I just read an article about all the changes being made to the movies for the Blu-ray release. Blinking Ewoks I can get behind. It's minor. Even Vader yelling \\"Nooooo\\" at the end of 'Jedi', while unnecessary, is not as bad as the \\"Nooooo\\" at the end of 'Sith'. But changing Obi Wan's krayt dragon call so that he sounds like a retarded hyena is just... words... I can't... NO. Just NO, Mr. Lucas. NO. It doesn't even sound anything like the krayt dragon in the prequel film. How stupid do you think we are?    I've had enough of George Lucas meddling with cinema history. It's one thing to go back and add some nifty effects. But Han shot first. Stop re-writing the films and learn the meaning of ethics.    For these reasons combined, I am canceling my pre-order of the Blu-ray edition. THIS is why you fail, Mr. Lucas. I will not support your insane agenda with my hard-earned money.
0385523912|5.0|Great book about the everyday lives of North Koreans. It enlightened me on many facts about the North Korean regime whilst maintaining the depth of personal accounts of defectors now living in South Korea. I couldn't put this book down once I started, i became so involved in each of the individual's lives and did not want to believe some of the heartbreaking stories.  Everyone should read this book, it is a humanitarian crisis what has happened/is happening in North Korea.     That said, it is an insightful very personal, intimate account as told by several refugees and I am now eager to read more on North Korean history and the failure of bringing foreign aid into the country.
B000008OKU|5.0|Sticky Fingers is the defining essense of the Rolling Stones, along with Exile On Main St, Let It Bleed, Beggers Banquet and Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out, and not forgetting Some Girls.    The Stones were the first band that didn't always give the camera a sweet smile, they smirked, pouted and gave you the finger with their expressions.  Every tough guy band that followed the Stones took the group's lead.  Sticky Fingers album shocked you with it's cover art and with song's like Brown Sugar, Bitch, Dead Flowers and Sister Morphine. It mocked you with You Gotta Move and it just plain rocked you with Can't You Hear Me Knocking.    The cd I purchased is a collector's edition from Virgin Records complete with the working zipper. Recorded when it was the whole package concept that was marketed to the consumer, the songs and the art work packaging. I was twelve and on vacation with my mother when I first bought this album on vinyl at a New York state department store record department.  I remember this one because it is a good one.
B000V5ZIBU|1.0|Aside from not being able to watch these on my TV due to licensing, some of the episodes are missing. I want to watch every episode in order.  So you have to look carefully at the number of the episodes to notice that ones are missing, but what you might not realize unless you compare it to an episode listing elsewhere is that the season finale is missing for Season 1.  Really, what's the point then...?????
B0051QO4QY|4.0|i really love this album, it shows that Gaga is more than just a person who can crank out hits. You can tell she put a lot of love into this record and wanted to make sure that it had a positive message and that it was something little monsters would be proud of. It has a lot of really good songs on it and the more you listen to them, the better they get!
B003Y5H53S|1.0|This movie was AWFUL!!I watched it and had hoped it would be an entertaining film, and it was not, the plot line was slow, extremely predictable(even for an animated film) And the characters you could not learn to like at all! I cannot believe that Johnny Depp agreed to do this film and put his name on it! I hope I never have to watch it again. My daughter 8, watched it too, and she despised it as well. Many reviews say it is more for adults...but I did not see that point either. I am shocked to see that the overall ratings on this movie are higher rather than lower. I am not a movie buff, and I never write reviews on them (this is my first), but this one was such a let down....
B0054N73EY|4.0|I'm a fan of the first three RHCP releases, they were funky with a sound they can and never will find again.  I still follow them just waiting for a \\"great\\" release but I'm not going to get it.  I think \\"I'm With You\\" is a solit effort, much more interesting guitar work that \\"Stadium...\\" had.  I gave this a 4 becuse I think this is the best I will get from them, so rather than critize it, I choose to enjoy it.

B004289ZW0|1.0|This receiver feels cheap the moment it comes out of the box. It pairs easily enough and functions ok... When it is working. Mine died after a week. The worst thing about this receiver is the on off function. They attempted to go high tech and make it a touch screen. To say it doesn't work very well would be an understatement. When I wanted it to go on or off, I would have to slide a bunch of times to get a response. When I put the thing in my flight bag after a flight, it would somehow turn itself on and drain the batteries. So... When I wanted it on, it would take me multiple attempts, but the thing would turn on accidentally when I wanted it off. Bad design... A real miss. Ultimately, my unit stopped functioning after a week and I am glad it did. I exchanged it for a xgps150 from dual and I couldn't be happier. It just feels better constructed than the gns 5870, and is even smaller. The best part? The xgps150 has a BUTTON for on/off. What a novel idea...

1416972242|4.0|Wow. City of Ashes is so much better than it's predecessor. I can<br />finally say I really enjoy this series (hopefully I'm not jinxing<br />myself). Everything really came together in this book, to the point I<br />was wishing I could enter in the magical world and see what all they<br />were seeing. I seriously enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />But, like the last book, there were a few things that bothered me.<br />The main problem was Clary and Simon. Clary is supposed to be in love<br />with Jace, but here she is kissing Simon or making-out with Simon,<br />when it's one-sided. I know Jace is supposedly 'forbidden' territory,<br />but leading someone on for the sake of getting over him is stupid. I<br />was so irritated at how that was played out.<br /><br />Another thing was that scenes weren't fully developed. I'd be reading<br />and something would happen that wasn't even described. Several times<br />I'd read over what I'd just read to make sure I didn't miss anything.<br />This happens about three times, including during a key scene.<br /><br />Otherwise, I think character development was pretty good. Though, I'm<br />not liking Maia or the obligatory gay characters (love Alec though,<br />wish he got bigger parts) or the, \\"My daddy is big and evil and I miss<br />every importunity to kill him even though I'm more than given the<br />chance.\\"<br /><br />I just wish something not so obvious would happen. Guess I got a few<br />more books to see if my wish comes true!

B004UXUSIM|5.0|I have seen this movie 4 times, thusfar, and will buy the DVD when it is available. I have become a fan of Woody Allen, as he showed the beauty of my favorite city.  The music was fantastic, and I am hoping a CD is released. Owen Wilson seemed to channel Woody Allen in his expressions and speech, and was excellent in this role;  my favorite character was Hemingway, though Dali was a hoot.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Born This Way is the best album I have listened in my entire life. The best songs to me ? Government Hooker is my favourite one. This song is so sexy, I love it. Then, Marry The Night. It MUST be a single, this song is a hit. The bells at the beggining are wonderful. To finished, Judas, Born This Way, The Edge of Glory, Yoü And I, Highway Unicorn and Electric Chapel are awesome in my opinion. Buy Born This Way, you will not be disappointed!
1451629184|1.0|As expected, the book goes into minute detail about EVERYTHING trivial and unimportant about her captivity(the cats, the dogs, the grass in the backyard, etc) and almost nothing about what the public was really interested in knowing. Doesn't even give the daughters names even though this is public knowledge. I don't have any idea what that was about. Told nothing new about her ordeal and only about a tenth of what has been reported many times by the media. Deserves a lower rating than 1 star.

B0053YEM7U|5.0|While other reviewers can debate the merits of this album to death, the short of it is I haven't enjoyed a Yes album like this since 90125. It has hints of Drama and older Yes recordings with a very capable new singer. In short, I love the \\"organic\\" sound of this album. So much so that I've been inspired to download the remastered versions of Fragile and The Yes Album. Great stuff.

0756405890|5.0|I have read more than my fair share of fantasy, including virtually all of the universally recognized \\"Masters.\\"  I shan't go to the trouble of listing them all, cause no one has any reason to believe anything I say save by intuition, so I'll leave this review in the hands of fate and pure gut honesty.<br /><br />This is the best new fantasy series I've ever read.<br /><br />There, I've said it.  It's better than absolutely any fantasy setting I've read save perhaps Middle Earth.  It really is that intriguing.  It's interesting how the first person can tweak a story so profoundly.  I generally hate it, but certain modern fiction writers seem to have gotten quite a firm hand on it and I'm seeing more and more work in the last half-decade that pulls it off quite well.  Kvothe's story is no exception.  The scope of this tale is really what's so very intriguing.  The memoir-style storytelling is quite nice and not at all typical, but not earth-shattering.  The inventive atypical subcultures in the story are refreshing and (dare I say?) genre-busting, but not revolutionary.  What really carries the Kingkiller book into the realm of truly legendary fantasy storytelling is the SENSE of epic that suffuses the tale.  I find it hard to describe it in a way that does not invoke LotR, so I'll just go ahead and do that.  You know how, when the fellowship enters the halls of Moria, just prior to the encounter with the Balrog, and the description of the great hall simply bears down on you with the feeling of thousands and thousands of years of history, full and rich with long-gone tales and times?  You think about the centuries where that hall was thriving and teeming with life, and a place of light and progress and achievement, and the long, slow decline (how long it must have taken!) for it to reach the sad, low state in which you find it.  In that moment, in that place, the story is completely alive.  The writer has breathed something into his tale that makes it real in your mind.  I have no reservations about saying that Patrick Rothfuss achieves this same feat in this novel.<br /><br />I am not going to spoil anything whatsoever for you by describing anything about the plotline of this most outstanding novel.  I simply leave the above paragraph in the hopes of convincing you that this is, in fact, truly epic heroic fantasy of a quality that is destined for legendary status.eservations about saying that Patrick Rothfuss achieves this same feat in this novel.

1591843790|3.0|This is my second book from Guy. He gave lots of good advises. Blunt and simple to understand. Guy is the advocate of being simple and clear, in his public speech. However, I never found him implemented this concept in the two books I read. I found his advises did not adhere to a core message. So it reminds me of my grandma nagging for my well being. Each individual piece of advise is good, but together they are scattered and hard to remember. In the end, I felt guilty not finishing Guy's book (as well as not listening to my grandma's nagging) even thought I know they both try to help.

B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|Director John Madden had a smashing back-to-back period in 1997-1998 with \\"Mrs. Brown\\" and \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", but since then he has been unable to replicate that level of success.  \\"The Debt\\", a remake of a 2007 Israeli thriller of the same name, is his best film since that period, and deserves a wider audience than it is likely to find in theatres after more than a year spent in limbo due to the difficulties of its distributor.  Madden and his cast and crew deliver a very solid adult-oriented Cold War thriller.  Spoilers follow.    Our story takes place both in East Berlin in 1966 and Israel in 1997 (I would estimate the split to be perhaps 70/30 in the favour of 1966).  It opens with a book launch celebrating the exploits of three Mossad agents in killing a Nazi war criminal: agents Rachel Singer (Helen Mirren), David Peretz (Ciaran Hinds) and Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson).  We also see the mission in question, where the trio (played in 1966 by Jessica Chastain, Sam Worthington, and Martin Csokas) are tasked to abduct Dr. Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen), the 'surgeon of Birkenau', from East Germany.  It's not a great spoiler to say that this proves to be more difficult than originally anticipated.    There are no Jason Bourne-style moves here:  Madden's depiction of special operations is very realistic, similar to the writings of John le Carre.  The atmosphere is well-handled, particularly the 1966 segments, which believably depict the decayed East Berlin.  The film's 1966 segments are at their strongest as a character drama, in the middle/late stretch where the three spies and their captive are confined to an apartment and forced to interact for an extended period as their options slowly seem to shrink.    The main reason to see this film is Jessica Chastain, who may be the breakout star of 2011, with no less than seven features to be released due to a backlog.  In the past having this many films in a year can be dangerous (consider what 2004 did to Jude Law), but what is remarkable about Chastain's work this year is how different each performance has been so far.  She was an ethereal, idealized mother in \\"The Tree of Life\\", then a goodhearted white trash housewife in \\"The Help\\"; now, in her first (and, I believe, only) lead role of the year, she plays a rookie field agent with depth and intensity.  She compares favourably to Helen Mirren's portrayal of the older Rachel.  The other standouts are Worthington, at last given a mainstream role where he can show his dramatic skills rather than be bland in an action film; and Christensen, who has a lot of fun as the detestable villain.    Recommended.
B0051QO4QY|4.0|I was really excited when this came out.  I was hooked on Hair, Schiebe, and Edge of Glory!  The style was good, but there were some songs that didn't line up well for me.  You and I was a bit too countryish for me.  There were plenty of songs to listen to that were really interesting, like Bloody Mary, but that one song still trips me up.  Over all, I still love the Fame Monster the best, but I'll give Born This Way an 8/10! :)    By Ishyama
0439023521|3.0|Meh.<br /><br />This is one of the first few books where I'd only allowed myself to hear the very basics of the story. I wanted to be surprised by most of what I read and didn't even read a summary. Lauded as a young adult masterpiece I was very much excited to get my hands on a copy of The Hunger Games. In fact, so sure was I that I would be utterly enthralled with it that I bought the whole trilogy in one go..<br /><br />The Hunger Games starts of with a somewhat creative concept of a futuristic, post-apocalyptic society of people. Like many books in the post-apocalypse genre these days, we aren't told what exactly this `event' was. We're given some rather vague clues as to what actually happened in the form of Katniss's briefly muttering some things about the destruction of the atmosphere, wars, famine etc and even though I found that to be somewhat of a copout, I forgave that because the story takes place nearly 200 years after said event.<br /><br />THG follows the story of Katniss Everdeen, living in a world hundreds of years from now in which each year, a total of 24 children (ages 12-18) are chosen in a lottery and made to fight the death in an arena with various weapons.<br /><br />This exercise doubles as both a punishment for the people of the 12 districts of Panem --  for a rebellion against the malevolent government the districts took part in about a hundred years before -- as well as entertainment for the sadistic Capitol people and interested parties in various districts. Why the Capitol takes such pleasure in these things were are never told.<br /><br />Despite the violent nature of this novel, make no mistake: this is a teen and young adult series at heart -- as evidenced by the adults in the series inexplicable interest in Katniss Everdeen's love life and other things far less noteworthy.<br /><br />The book is neither well written nor well thought-out, and reads very much like `My First Novel' by a novice author. Suzanne Collins has not mastered the art of story telling or of writing characters with more than one dimension. We are meant to believe that Katniss is `tough' and/or brave but what we see is little more than a scared girl whose survival is based more on her acting capabilities and her trainer and teammate's ability to convey her as a lovesick teenage girl than any bravery or combat skills.<br /><br />As the book wears on, we discover that Katniss is hardly a worthy heroine and has an air of the Reluctant Hero about her that gets old pretty quickly. She is portrayed as somewhat naïve which -- as someone who has only known violence and tremendous abuses at the hands of people in power -- is unbelievable. She feels much more like a girl from today, transported into this hellish, futuristic world and hasn't a clue how to handle herself.<br /><br />There are many minor characters in the book, none of which are really given their due. Even the main characters are lacking in depth and description and are all seemingly placed in the book in order to play supporting role to Katniss who alternates between selflessness and selfishness and often with a hint of stupidity in nearly everything she does.<br /><br />Throughout the first book we are treated to a number of vividly detailed instances of violence which seem to be in place more to shock and less to move the story along. About 2/5 through the book the reader can virtually guess what the outcome will be, especially a reader who knows there are two more books in the trilogy. Suzanne Collins throws many a faux dilemma Miss Everdeen's way that only the youngest of readers will be intrigued by and add nothing to the element of suspense. Much like TV shows putting the lead character in jeopardy, everyone knows how it will end, and it won't end with the lead in a coffin.<br /><br />I have read and heard many young people discussing the merits of this book and how it's both thought-provoking and tremendous. It's been celebrated the world over and praised as anything from a political thriller to a cautionary tale of what can happen when the government becomes too powerful. Perhaps at 21 I'm just too old to appreciate the so-called brilliance of this book but frankly I found it to be one listless chapter after another, making the whole thing a subpar experience.<br /><br />But, surprisingly, I read the whole trilogy and this unfortunate work turned out to be the best among the three.<br /><br />2/5 on its own, 3/5 by comparison.ything from a political thriller to a cautionary tale of what can happen when the government becomes too powerful.

0689835604|5.0|Fantastic book and great edition to our collection. My child likes to read it over and over because of the interaction and surprises.
0062112430|5.0|So much has been written about this book, it's almost unnecessary for me to review it. I can honestly say that it completely lives up to the hype. I found it to be mesmerizing, tragic, and beautiful all at once.<br /><br />Lena is such a likeable character. I found myself literally aching for her as her world unraveled at several different turns, and I found myself nearly bursting with joy as she discovered love for the first time. Alex is what every writer should hope their hero is. He was strong and sensitive and kind and funny. But Oliver managed to write him with all these breathtaking qualities that never once made him seem too perfect.<br /><br />I think what made me think the most was not the lack of romantic love people were expected to survive without, but the lack of love altogether. A world where a mother is spurned because she comforts a crying child? Or where hugging your best friend is uncommon? I can't picture what my life would be like without the family and friends that have shaped me; the people who painstakingly knit me back together when my world was blown apart.<br /><br />I can't wait for her next book. My only disappointment was the cliff hanger ending, but I guess that's what will have me running out to get book #2 (Pandemonium) the day it releases.
1594744769|4.0|I was drawn to this book by the very mysterious cover. Did you notice that the girl wasn't touching the ground, but hovering? That is quite peculiar, indeed. The book is filled with other vintage photos that the author assures us are quite real (except for perhaps a few that have had minimal post processing work done). The pictures themselves are an integral part of the story, so I would dissuade anyone from listening to the audiobook for this reason.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the protagonist of this book. Jacob felt like he was just an ordinary kid living an ordinary life. He hated his job, had no friends, and was full of that sixteen year old angst that most kids have at that age.  During the mysterious adventure that takes him halfway around the world, Jacob grows into the man that he wants to be. As cheesy as it may sound, he finds his destiny, but not in the future; in the past.<br /><br />There are so many labels that one could put this book into, which shows how unique it is. It covers a wide range of genres and could interest many prospective readers. If you like, mystery, paranormal, historical, contemporary, a bit of fantasy then there is something in this book for you. The writing was top notch, not dumbed down like you sometimes see in other books marketed for teens.<br /><br />I really only had one problem with this book. Another dastardly cliffhanger!! This book ends with a big slap in the face, leaving me wondering \\"Wha...wha..what? That's not fair!\\" I seriously wanted more. I am happy to know that there is a sequel in the works once the author finds more of his creepy photos. I seriously applaud Mr. Riggs for giving these old and sometimes abandoned photos a new life.

B004HAG40O|5.0|I admit--I was a little bit later to The Decemberists fan club, joining with The Crane Wife. I enjoyed the prog rock moments in it, but still liked the \\"singles\\" respites.  The Hazards of Love had some good moments, but, overall, it took the concept album cum rock opera a bit too far. The King is Dead is the antidote to that... and probably the natural creative yin to Hazards' yang. The King is Dead's songs are tight, clean singles cut from a similar alt-folk/country cloth. It's been described as the best R.E.M. album since Automatic for the People--an assertion that makes me smile... and agree. With Peter Buck playing his trademark R.E.M. guitar jangle on a few of the singles, it is a great homage to R.E.M.. Nevertheless, this is a Colin Maloy and Co. affair--with this album, you can see just how much Maloy's songwriting and musicianship are the backbone to The Decemberists. I love this album and can see myself playing it for many years to come.

0375714839|3.0|I have mixed feelings about Persepolis.<br /><br />The first half (the original first volume) was overall excellent and eye-opening. Very much a view of this turbulent period in Iran from the point of view of a child. However, near the end of the first volume and for near all of the second, I find myself disliking the narrator more and more. She is a child of privilege, yet never seems to acknowledge this after her initial \\"Oh, the poor maid\\" vignette. The story becomes more and more internal, focusing on the narrator's \\"suffering,\\" which amounts to typical teenaged angst spiced by the woes that many immigrants have faced across time and place. I would have liked to see a more reflective look at this period of the narrator's life, something written from the point of view of an adult looking back rather than from the point of view of the spoiled adolescent, something that took place in history, rather than just inside the narrator's head. And that is what most turned me off of the second half. The narrator of the second half IS a spoiled adolescent and this fact is rarely, if ever, reflected upon. She comes from an incredibly privileged position, with her parents able to send her off to school and away from a war zone, yet she manages to continually make poor choices: mouthing off to those she is beholden to, doing and dealing drugs, and refusing to even consider others' foibles.<br /><br />In the interests of full disclosure, I did not finish reading the book. This was as far as I got before I decided to put it down. It is entirely possible that it got better, that there WAS a reflective voice later on, but I found myself so frustrated by the middle section that I felt no need to continue through it.<br /><br />I do, however, recommend at least trying to read it. The first half, as noted before, was certainly worthwhile and it is possible that those with less baggage than I would find the adolescent narrator less grating. For myself, I am happy to have read the first half, but am just as happy to have set it down in the second.

I never saw that scene before in any of the previous episodes!    Most of season 5's episodes are less than 40 minutes long, which wasn't the case with previous seasons.    What gives, Showtime?

B000NA28IE|5.0|First, let me say that I've never read the books, so I don't have any preconceived notions as to how this movie/story should unfold.  All I can tell you is that my wife & I both very much enjoyed this movie for what it was: a swords & sorcery fantasy/adventure flick that was both enjoyable and satisfying.  I'm glad to have the Two-Disc Special Edition of this DVD in my collection, we'll be watching it again soon.<br /><br />EDIT (08-15-2012):  I'm just finishing up book 4 of the Inheritance Cycle, and wanted to update my comments here.  Even though Eragon the movie differs in many ways from Eragon the book, I still enjoy the movie for what it is and don't feel that it deserves the hate that it gets.  Hollywood rarely does a book justice, even when the director has its best intentions in mind.  Lord Of The Rings is one of the few that I feel did the books justice and even then, Jackson left things out of the movie.  I think the director of Eragon could've done more if he'd had more time (with a longer movie) and control.  I would've liked to see all 4 books represented with movies, but Hollywood made that impossible.  Like The Golden Compass, the detractors made it so that the people who would've liked the story be told in its entirety will be left forever longing.  That's a sad thing indeed.  -kd5-
030788743X|5.0|READY PLAYER ONE is one great piece of literature, a book that not only will get hold of you from page one and never let go but it will also speak directly to your soul. At the same time though, Gen-Xers will have the time of their life in a nostalgia trip of the 1980's like no other.<br /><br />Wade Watts is an 18-year old orphan living with his heartless aunt in a stacked trailer park. He is obese and suffers from acme and severe lack of social skills but to him it matters little because he is almost always online, getting schooled and hanging out with his friends on a massively multiplayer online environment named OASIS.<br /><br />OASIS consists of a virtually endless number of worlds, some magical, others cyberpunk and yet others approximating the real world. OASIS is a huge success as in 2044, when the gap between the rich and the poor has grown into an unbridgeable chasm and all of the fossil fuels are gone (but not the environmental problems their abuse caused), life is bleak for the great majority of humanity. The only sane refuse is to get lost in this digital heaven.<br /><br />When James Halliday, the insanely rich and eccentric creator of OASIS, dies he wills his multi-billion company to the first person who will discover the three keys he Easter-egged into his digital universe. So the worldwide stampede of egg-hunters (known as gunters) starts off, people searching for the ultimate video game prize. Their only clues are Halliday's video message and known 80's fixation. With such a global race, a race that takes the masses back to simpler and happier times, the 80's come back in fashion.<br /><br />Early video games, taking their first steps just out of the primordial sea and capturing the imagination of an entire generation with only some blinking pixels.

SciFi TV series offering immersion that was never again replicated. Toys and gadgets that sprung from instances of pure genius. Movies so epic in scope and impact that one developed blind-spots to their cheesy props and plot holes.<br /><br />Like a good 80's pop-culture narrative the hero (known by his handle of Parzival) has companions (Aech and Art3mis, Shoto and Daito),  he has to face powerful villains (Sorrento and his army of Sixers), overcome insurmountable obstacles and find his destiny. A classic piece of literature that will find its rightful place in the 21st century canon.<br /><br />The pop-cultural zeigeist shows a strong geek-chic bias lately but even if the 80's were before your time or you never played any MMOGs or even any video games you will still love this book.

On page 495 of the paperback 2011 edition, it states, \\"Yet Ser Axell proposes we swoop down on the homes they left behind, to rape their windows and put their children to the sword.\\" I think it would be difficult to perform that act on a \\"window\\".

B003ZSJ212|1.0|From seeing it in the theatres in 1979 (rerelease) as a 6 year-old to... this? This is how Lucas repays the money I've poured into this franchise for decades? How can he not see he's insulting the fans? Do moviemakers make movies for the fans, or do fans pay moviemaker to make the movie he/she wants to see? If only George Lucas wants to see this version, why does he want us to pay for it.    It's gotten ridiculous. In some ways, it's painful; to watch one of your best childhood memories slowly, but horribly destroyed over the course of 30 years. :(

1593272839|5.0|This book really blew my mind!  It is superbly done.<br /><br />What I especially like about it is the way it hints at the underpinnings of Haskell (and functional programming) in category theory (and other formal systems); thus making them much more accessible and comprehensible.<br /><br />The discussions about monads are fantastic!<br /><br />The examples are first rate:  it's well worth going through each and every one of them (slowly and carefully) to fully absorb the gold mine of insights each one can impart.  (Even if you think you already understand the concepts:  you might just find yourself seeing things in a novel and unexpected way! ;-)<br /><br />I truly hope the author will write another book.  He has a real gift and talent; not only in explaining, but also in making things interesting.  I actually found this book hard to put down.  It really drew me in.  (Not just any technical book can cast such a spell!)<br /><br />This book should be of great interest to F# programmers.  F# materials alone will not give a reader enough insight into the milieu of functional programming to really appreciate monads (for instance).  In fact, I say:  to really learn C# you need to learn F#, and to really learn F# you need to learn Haskell.<br /><br />I also hope one day we'll have H# available as a fully integrated citizen of .Net (following in F#'s footsteps).<br /><br />Haskell to me is well worth learning because it is so pure.  The lessons learned can then be mapped back to many existing technologies that one must work with.  (Legacy technologies aren't going away anytime soon; but the good news is that the Haskell way of thinking can still be leveraged to great good in many venues.)<br /><br />The hand drawn artwork (done by the author himself!) added a lot to the tapestry and enchanting magic of this well crafted book.<br /><br />In conclusion:  my greatest praise for this book is the way it took such a lofty and important topic and made it so amazingly accessible, fun, and fascinating.<br /><br />Kudos for a job well done!!!
B003Y5H54W|3.0|Honestly, the camera work and the acting is very good for such a gothic setting, but the screenplay is far too much like twilight; the re-writing of vampire and werewolf lore to set it in a more romantic and almost sexual setting.  It's not bad as a rental, but it is certainly forgettable.  I won't waste your time any further... the movie will do it just fine.

1451629184|4.0|Jaycee's account of what happened in her life is innocent and simply written.  She tells you it is still scattered, not really put together but it is the way she had to write it at the moment.  Because of this the continuity is broken a bit but if you read it from an innocent place in you it will move you deeply into what a person can survive - the nightmare that seemed to never end.  Her acceptance of it being this way for the rest of her life and how she had no idea that she could have told someone when she was finally allowed to go out in public is proof of that fear can be programmed so deeply and the need for love an acceptance is so strong that we finally adapt even unto sacrifice.   She was truly convinced that she couldn't.  And hearing how she returned back to a life that was stolen from her because of one police officer that had a hunch and wouldn't let it go was life giving.  You will begin to believe that in spite of these horrors that there are people out there that do care and are willing to risk pushing the limit of the veneer that hides the truth.  I was also astounded at how positive Jaycee remained during all of the time she was there.  I don't think I could have survived it but I guess you do when you have to.  She is an amazing woman and her story reflects a true beginning toward her healing.
B00136Q79I|5.0|At first listen it made no sense whatsoever. A blur of noise. Then, after repeated listens its majesty unfolds. Folks, you need an educated ear to appreciate this work. Its not an easy ride for the mainstream. I urge you to buy this work of art. It goes beyond metal in its importance. It is probably one of the greatest records of all time. You don't believe me??? Well, Rick Ruben states that its his all time favorite production. Got your attention now. He would know now wouldn't he? The record starts ugly and end ugly. Dave Lombardo gives a performance that should go down as wonder of the world. Kerry and Jeff reinvent the guitar solo and rewrite the metal rulebook. Tom provides amazing bass and incredible vocals throughout. Each track is perfection, from start to finish. I have listened to this masterpiece more than a thousand times.  Each listen revels something new, something I haven't heard before. You hear allot about the opener and closer of this record. Well folks, forget all that, select Postmortem and the magic is reveled. Its so good it feels like a whole album in one track. Its legendary, the second section goes into an chaotic rage, never again matched in metal. I implore you to listen to this work. It will challenge you, but once you get it, will hold its grip to your dying day. Slayer never sold out, how could they, making a record like this?
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Born This Way is one of the best albums i have ever listened to. this album is way different then the first one but way better. It has a mix of 80's Pop and rock. its a way darker album but good. personally my favorite song is You and I. The album is well written and directed.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|it took 2 weeks for my fist pare to arrive and they where faulty then took and extra week and a half to get a new pair.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|One of the most fun/addictive games out there! Works perfectly and once you get into it, it's hard to stop. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.
B004XQO90O|4.0|This is unpredictable and a thoughtful story of a soldier who does not know his actual fate until later.....  spoilers....                  He is not much more than  a torso with a brain that is hooked up to a communications and virtual reality device that lets him talk to his coordinators and also go back in time to try to stop a domestic terrorist from blowing up a commuter train, among other things, in Chicago.   Quite the mindbender.  Jake G. is great as the main character.  Good direction also from Duncan Jones.
0670022411|5.0|I had no idea what I was getting into when I picked it up but I couldn't put it down.  An excellent story and adventure!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I really never thought this would work but one night, like many before, I wasn't able to sleep and I just got it. Well I set it up for 45mins and I can't remember when it was done.  Now I set it every night and I fall a asleep pretty fast.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I won't bother with a plot recap - it's been done. Although I'll cop to being a bit of a geek, I'm not a gamer at all, and yet I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It's got clever twists, over the top bad guys, and a heroic protagonist. Cline wrote a thoroughly enjoyable adventure book, easily one of the best books I've read in years. It sucked me along- I couldn't wait to finish it.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Thank you!    Just like the song from Lonely Island, this product made me soil my underpants!    It works wonders, just read the instructions before use and configure it correctly.
1609611543|5.0|This book is a wealth of life changing information.  It explains how wheat is linked to a host of health problems.  Since I stopped eating wheat my gastric reflux is gone--haven't taken meds since a week after stop eating wheat!!!  I suggest everybody should read this book!
B005COO1X6|2.0|Couldn't get into this book at all.  I found it to be really vulgar, for no reason at all, lots of \\"F bombs,\\" as others have said the ending is really stupid.  Skip this one and save our money even though it was only $3 I feel like I was robbed.
B0034G4P8K|5.0|As a fairly new fan of the \\"Transformers\\" fandom, I eagerly watched one and two before going to see the third.  I found the first one extremely enjoyable, but absolutely hated the second. I see how the story was necessary to set up the third, but the rather painful quality of two made me somewhat apprehensive going into the third.    The first thing that struck me about the third was the opening sequences. The space race between the US and the Soviet Union has always fascinated me, and seeing the story opened with footage about it to introduce the \\"dark of the moon\\" made my expectations take a very large leap. I was extremely excited to see where the movie went next.    I knew that Megan Fox's character had been replaced, which I admit made me happy. I never liked Mikeala, but I did very much like Carly.  She was engaging, strong without being overbearing, and (in my opinion) far prettier and more suited to Sam's character. The actress did seem a little wooden in spots, but once she found her footing in the story and with her co-star, she did an excellent job integrating herself into an established universe. The movie also gave a believable reason for Mikaela's absence without slowing down the story.    Another thing that I enjoyed about the third movie more than one or two was the fact that there seemed to be an actual storyline, and they stuck through it. You could tell that the movie was driving itself toward an ultimate point, and though the special effects were just as spectacular as the others (perhaps even better!), it was not the focal point of the movie. It complimented the plot, instead of overpowering it. Also introduced in this movie was the autobot who was at one time Optimus Prime's mentor, voiced by Leonard Nimoy. It was quite fascinating to see the character who shaped Optimus and turned him into the autobot that he was throughout the first two movies, and into this one. The movie also kept up the humor throughout, which at some points was direly needed since \\"Dark of the Moon\\" has a darker and more serious tone than the preceding two. The plot of the third movie was also able to stand somewhat on its own, though familiarity with the first two movies made it clear to see how events in them were making those in the third bring everything together in a climax that was truly breathtaking.    The final thing that made this movie truly enjoyable was the score.  The first two had wonderful pieces of music, but on the whole \\"Dark of the Moon\\" far outshone the other two. The score could stand on its own, but at the same time it complimented the movie and enhanced the action and romantic scenes. The music told a story of its own, weaving deeper emotions into those already evoked by what was happening on screen.    In conclusion, I give this movie five out five stars for being the best of the trilogy by a landslide.
B00544L9EI|5.0|exzzzzactly what i wanted from EM... i mean... its sick luv it, new fav no doubt. dont even think about it just get it. beats lyrics quality stuff period all tracks.
0590402331|5.0|I distinctly remember reading (and eventually memorizing) this book as a child. I purchased it for my two sons and they also know what's coming on the next page. They love this book! I think this is better than her follow-up books in the \\"If You Give..\\" series.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|At this point why even post?   However, this is the exact reason the whole STAR WARS name has become a joke. Wow, did I love this series....
0670827592|5.0|I loved this book as a child and my two boys enjoy it as well. They are familiar with the classic fairy tale but always ask me to read the big bad wolf's version to them instead. The pictures are wonderful, as well.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I love Lady Gaga's 'The Fame' and 'The Fame Monster' and Born this way is no exception. The fact that she writes her own music is awesome. I love the 80s punk rock feeling of the music. Heavy Metal Lover is my favorite song from the album. Amazing job!
0064400557|5.0|My boys love the original movie (their favorite part is when Templeton pigs out at the fair), and I decided to buy the book to read to them. They enjoy the story and I think the fact that they've seen the animated film helps, since they're smaller. It's also a great read for little older ones. For some reason children especially enjoy farm or barnyard stories and Charlotte's Web really delves into the characters, which my children love.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|So I just got done reading a ton of reviews for this and ive seen the changes myself and I have to say the Vader dialog is the only one that bothers me. But it doesnt bother me enough not to buy this set, its one thing in a set of excellent movies, for me personally it'll be easy to ignore. So ill be purchasing this set but it'll be the last time I buy the Star Wars movies so, oh well, to each his own.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I, too, have canceled my preorder due in no small part to the additional changes that once again plague such a once-upon-a-time great saga. $90 is just too high a price for something which I can watch as an upconverted DVD just fine.    I am tired of Lucas tweaking these movies to the degree that these no longer feel like the ones that I watched over and over as a kid. For goodness sake, please leave Obi-Wan's krayt dragon call and the infamous \\"Greedo shoots first\\" scence alone. How many times now have they been tweaked?!?  And adding \\"Noooooo!\\" to the end of RotJ is just plain spiteful, given the negative reactions that Episode III faced when Vader's yell came across as just cheesy instead of heart-wrenching. We all get it. We know that Vader throws the Emperor over the edge because he disapproves of him trying to kill Luke. We don't need to hear him actually saying, \\"No!\\".  Plus, why do we feel that it is necessary to give Ewoks eyelids now, all of a sudden? Episode VI has been fine without them for over 25 years. I have never met a person who said, \\"You know what? I would have loved Return of the Jedi had it not been for the fact that those pesky Ewoks never blinked! That's it. I'm out of here until they get those Ewoks blinking like they should!\\"    Now, granted, I think that the digital Yoda is kind of a good change, because that puppet always looked stupid to me, but I think I would rather have an unadulterated version of the movie rather than a tweaked version for nostalgic reasons.     Here's a novel idea: how about a version of each of the movies in HD with surround sound and vivid colors, and that's it! Leave well enough alone, and be satisfied with what you originally created! Trust me, all the public wants is superior quality, not endless tweaking. As the old adage goes: \\"If it's not broke, don't fix it!\\"
B00006SFLV|5.0|lines from this show still pop in my head anytime i see claire danes in anything.  this was by far the best most ages show ever made.  my so called life touched everything.  it was a fun show with awesome music, tons of heart, aj langer (i miss her acting so much), the beginnings of claire danes amazing career (who went on to portray temple grandin) as well as jared leto and wilson cruz, it totally captured a generation (my generation, when music was at its best and grunge was in).  it touched subjects such as homophobia, child abuse, addiction, sex, parenthood, adultery, guns in school, marriage, faith, runaways, first loves and learning to see past the outside of a person.  it does all of that but unlike alot of stuff it does it without making you feel like your watching some lifetime movie.  it was real and it was something you couldnt wait to watch every week. i watch the christmas episode every year a day or so before christmas.  its the best christmas show ever.  speaking of christmas if you have a kid between the age of 15 and 21 this would make a great christmas present.    it was a show that only made it one season but everyone watched it.  didnt make any sense why they didnt bring it back.

0446563048|5.0|This is not the average business book. It is not packed with superficial jargon and re-worded traditional management theories from the 1950's, rather the author uses extremely simple language (he refers to Toy Story and Buzz Light Year or something like that in the book) to convey a very simple theme that I think is lacking in the majority of businesses. It was rather refreshing for me to see the simple theme of promoting employee happiness as a strategy to achieving high customer satisfaction because I have believed this for several years but have some trouble implementing it in my own company. I have since implemented many ideas that evolved while reading the book and we have been able to re-energize many of our team members and get the conversation of customer WOW going. Coinidently we used the word WOW as well in our company for many years. Make no mistake, Tony has a cult going on over there at Zappos but I also think that cult is not necessarily a negative word. I wouldn't take my company to some of the extremes that he has taken Zappos, but hey, it works for him, look at the financial success. Nevertheless, it is a different, simpler, more direct and I think more effective way to look at long-term company success.  You can read the book in a day and a half, Just read it!!!
B000TX7B5U|2.0|I know that this is the lead singer for SOAD, so the lyrics were good. System is good because of the teamwork, not just the lyrics. Glad they got back together.
1594481717|1.0|This is a well written book with many interesting stories and ways of delivering the message but the fact remains that there was only  1 message in the book and by the time you read the first chapter, you get the message. I read the first half of the book before I decided that it was a collassal waste of my time because I needed to participate in a discussion event at B-school. No one could tell that I only read half the book because the chapters did not progress in content. And what was worse, I had several classmates who only browsed sections of the book and were also able to effectively participate in the conversation. Not worth the time to read the entire thing!!!
3822837849|5.0|I recommend this book to anybody interesting in the history of photography.  Camera work was a great publication of the lates artist first of the pictorialism movement and later the straight photography.  You can see the change as it goes from the early issues to the latest issues
0307389839|5.0|I started running when I was 19 years old. I was a stringer for a technical college cross-country team. I got to go to the national tournament for division three tech schools during my freshman year. I'd like to say I was hooked from that time in my life. As life goes, though, I went on to be an art school drop out whom smoked too much and became jaded about everything. Mr. Murakami brought me back. I'd been engrossed by his writing for years. But 'What I Talk About...' got me running again. I dropped thirty pounds and I'm running my first half marathon this year. Mind you I'd fell in love with his writing years ago. I just think I needed to understand this part of where it came from to get me going again.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|The first thing that struck me was the sheer beauty of the prose. He also did a wonderful job of weaving together lives of have and have nots in NYC without seeming forced at all. Individual lives and larger events collide in a way that gives added meaning to each. It's a modern epic.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I actually already owned this movie, but wanted the Blu-ray and digital version! Could not pass it up! Great deal!

B005COO1X6|5.0|Get some pop corn and a glass of wine and enjoy this classic Stephen King short story/novella, followed by a chapter of Stephen King's next novel coming out soon. You should be done reading it in about an hour. The novella ends at the 80% mark on the Kindle. This is a story about an abandoned rest stop, and a station wagon that parks there, and what happens when the curious get too close.<br /><br />It is a combination Christine and Stand by Me, since the main characters are a station wagon and some kids. I usually don't read such scary stories, but felt like getting this single for my Kindle and giving it a try, and I am glad I did.  King tells a fantastic story. It is scary, so be far warned. I liked the references to Dr. Who in the story. I also like the way Stephen King puts his characters in his neck of the woods, Maine. It is always good to write about what you know, and Stephen King knows how to write a good horror story.  Give it a try.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|Purchased this RAM for a QNAP TS-659 Pro II Network Attached Storage System.  The memory works as expected.  Have only had it a relatively short time, but so far so good.  Price was very good.  Product was reasonably packaged (padded envelope).
B003ZSJ212|1.0|All I have is what many Star Wars fans are already professing, an utter feeling of desperation as George Lucas slowly rapes the last vestiges of our childhood (s). It can only be summed up in one phrase, I quote:     \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!\\"    Thanks for nothing Lucas. I will not buy this item, and I can only hope that you re watch the films and realize why Ivan Kershner was better than you. You might have made the first film (and unfortunately the prequels), but you can't be responsible with the historical, cultural, and personal significance it holds over millions of people. Shame on you sir. Shame on you.
B003ASLJKO|5.0|My husband and I watch this movie a lot. It is funny. I had never heard of this movie but I am glad I purchased it. I recommend it to anyone.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Films makers are story tellers.  Generations of story tellers have told and retold stories, looking find to a better telling of a story.<br /><br />Few film makers have the option of continuing the process of refining a film after the one-and-only 'Directors cut' comes out.  George and his stable of kindred spirits in his employ are following the path of story tellers of old, making the story told around tonight's camp fire a little better than the last time it was told.<br /><br />Concentrate on what this release is:  High Def Star Wars, all 6 movies together. Awesome picture, awesome sound.<br /><br />Lucas films had already updated the movies before the DVD release (better effects, new effects - and some things they wanted to do but could not afford to do when the movies were originally made).  The movie watching public survived.  The world did not end.  Star Wars fans will survive these changes too (honest).  Think of all the happy arguments it will fuel over beer and popcorn!<br /><br />Don't let that fact that a story teller is constantly working to improve his product keep you from buying the Blu-Rays; enjoy the creative process and realize that George cares enough to want to tell his stories better.<br /><br />It is a series of wonderful films that have already been updated before - and this is a continuation of the process.  Watch the Blu-rays and look for the changes - enjoy them.  They are not gospel, just great SciFi!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I bet you're rethinking the logic behind putting a bottomless hole in your throne room NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!  Always loved Vader's wordless self sacrifice. Another clueless revision like Greedo and young Anakin's ghost.
B002CNTWG6|1.0|Pretty horrible music.<br /><br />No fun songs.<br /><br />I just was sorta hoping that after 5150 there would be some more good music.  5150 I could at least enjoy.<br /><br />Perhaps the reported olympic sized drinking had something to do with the music.  0udrank12.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|At first I was a little hesitant about buying this since it is the follow up to her other albums but I did buy it and I'm glad I did. My favorite song on this is The edge of Glory. When you hear that song it makes you wanna dance dance dance...Dont get me wrong I also love Judas and Born this way too..I've listened to the rest of the songs on this and they are great as well even though they are starting to grow on me a little more everytime I listen to them but all in all this a really great album..
B003ZSJ212|1.0|G.L. has no moral compass, and I am convinced he is doing this just to troll his fans. Part of me respects what a blatant jerk he is, but most of me resents him for making Star Wars embarrassing.
B000026KG7|3.0|Don't get me wrong, it sounds great and the bonus tracks are excellent, but the fade-out drum solo on the first song, Chasing Shadows, is no longer a fade out on this reissue, it simply cuts off. I compared to the vinyl to be sure, as I thought something sounded off, and yup, it cuts off short. Still, if you can get past one unnatural sounding break on the album, this reissue is worth it. Hold on to your record if you still have it though.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love how,  even though it's free,  Rovio is constantly adding new updates to the Angry Birds games with all new levels. Contrary to what everyone seems to think, the update doesn't force you to be on the Internet to play the game, but rather wants you to be on the Internet at least once while playing it. I play this all the time off the Internet on my ASUS Eee Pad Transformer with no problems. I'm a poor college student, so free with ad support is perfect for me. Thanks Rovio!
B004UA8D1O|3.0|This is a straightforward film about a cave-diving expedition, which should have been a documentary. It would have been as intense and claustrophobic, but without the unnecessary conflicts between the explorers. What make this film worth watching is the 3D. Watched this on my 50\\" 3D panasonic plasma. It is visually glorious.  Can't imagine watching in 2D, or on a small screen. Like Avatar, there are no out of screen effects, just super depth perception. It's like the screen punched a hole in the wall and your looking into the next room. Three stars for 3D, but barely two stars for 2D
B004ULNJF8|1.0|I like action flicks. I like Jason Statham.     This was not an action movie. The first 2 minutes of the movie had more action than the next hour and a half.     This movie was filled with pointless sub plots. The movie didn't make sense. You kept thinking, \\"why did he do that?\\" or \\"Doesn't he have enough evidence?\\" or \\"that is just plain stupid.\\"    The dialogue was corny, cliche, and just plain dumb.    I think you could close your eyes, point at any movie in a video store, and the movie you select would easily be better than this.     Stay away from this movie. I dont know how anyone could give it above 2 stars.
0756405890|3.0|I devoured the first chapters of this book. Very unique in concept for ther genre. No dragons, no magic wands or other pyrotechnics involved, just great story telling in a setting that was very conducive for the story to be told. I was hooked but decided that I did not want to go to the end and then wait for two years for the next installment and then have to reread an catch up on the characters and story line. Big mistake, after the second book arrived and started back into the first one, I was soon disenchanted. I wanted to reach in there and scream, get on with it! get a real life and either ravish that woman or get out of her life. The main character that I had looked up to and given high marks in the \\"Man\\" department, was turning into a wimpy guy, mooning over a woman who always seemed to chose someone else untill she was in need of a rescue and then our subservient hero was there to do so. Even though each of her rescues comes at a personal cost to him in many ways.<br />The story just got too weird towards the end and I have yet to pick up the second installment.<br />Do yourself a favour, if you like the men in your story to have a backbone, this one is not for you.
B0013K2UCC|5.0|I bought the MP3 album because I love John's voice. Much like the late Marvin Gaye, he really knows how to use his instrument. So of course I love the slower tracks, I like hearing those pipes. Ordinary People is such a beautiful song it moves me to tears. It sounds like a live track, because his voice is rich but you can hear the scratchiness too. His accompanying skills are incredible, the phrasing is perfect, its obvious he's done his homework and studied music for years. Its rare when you have a singer that is so special but there is also a strong technique behind what they're doing.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I admit I only went to this movie because my wife really wanted to see it. We went with our 20 year old son and we all three enjoyed the film. If you love Western movies and you love Sci-Fi movies, then I am sure you will be as thrilled as my wife to watch or own this movie. It was worth it to see how excited she was about it, ahead of time as well as afterward.
B000006YYW|5.0|Wow! I have about twenty thousand songs from the eighties, but until recently I did not have this album. I decided to check it out since after Juliet I wanted to know what more might be out there on the original album. And what a pleasant surprise! Many very good eurosynth songs, one after the other. Juliet, He Can't Love You, Kathy's Gone, and more. Wonderful stuff - catchy, almost effortlessly composed it seems, but that is why the BeeGees rank as the nr 3 songwriters of all time.
0817439390|5.0|Stop reading reviews. It is clear. It is informative -lots of information-. And it will help develop your understanding of photography and light beyond what you think it was possible -after reading a book-.    If you are a seasoned photographer who has shot thousands of pictures in the field it will bring you little reminders of information. For novices it's a breakthrough.
159514188X|1.0|I'm on page 143 and I'm stopping because I can't take this book anymore. I'm a voracious reader but the back-and-forth between italics for Hannah's voice and regular type for Clay is really jarring. I find myself only wanting to read what Hannah is saying, and if what she's saying is really disconnected from what Clay's doing or thinking or whatever, that makes it even stranger. It takes too much of a mental pause to shift gears, in my opinion, and the author could have grouped the sections and still achieved the same effect.    And that's just the biggest annoyance for me of many. I agree with those reviewers who have spoken more eloquently about Hannah being unlikeable.

B0042KZJ5K|5.0|If I were to rate the collection of songs considering the first issue CD as A+, the \\"new\\" CD (the second one with new released songs) would be a \\"B\\". Good but not nearly as good as the first release. Basically, little new material but mostly different versions of some of the songs from the first album. But the inclusion of the first release CD and the liner notes as to how the movie all came about makes the package worth an \\"A\\" or five stars for me. I really liked the different version of Angel Band.     I checked out the video above - \\"Related Media\\" - with an interview with Dan Tyminski and the Peasall Sisters. Both sang a bit. The Peasalls, as I understand, no longer perform. The threepart harmony from these young ladies will be missed. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've figured it out. Despite George Lucas saying he had nothing to due with the Holiday Special and is embarrassed by it, in reality it was the only piece of Star Wars that he did helm. And since 1997, he been slowly pushing the entire franchise in that direction. Brilliant!
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|I have had this case on my iPhone since February. It is now September and the case is still holding up. The rubber has wear and tear but looks very close to new.

I recommend this case if you want something sleek!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I didn't have a problem installing. I used the notes from others before and uninstalled the free DTG from the Market, then installed it from Amazon, then installed the unlock key. I was able to edit and save the first doc I opened. Did this for both my stock NexusS and my gTablet w/cyanogen7.1.  This app currently has the best compatibility with office doc features, which is what I as after. It doesn't handle embedded objects but has worked with most other needed features (like formulas in xls docs).  Like others have said, you have to choose edit then show the keyboard to edit docs, but I'll live with it for the better compatibility this app offers.
B005COO1X6|3.0|You know an author is deeply embedded into popular culture when he references one of his own books in a subsequent effort (and gets away with it). In Mile 81, King returns to the road and car covering ground similar to Christine and From a Buick 8 (the latter which is standout for me). This short story moves with speed and entertains but is not iconic King. There is no deep thinking or message here with the exception that good samaritans are often not well rewarded. Still worth it though - it is the perfect length for a quick road trip ... as long as the reader is not behind the wheel.

I cannot say enough good about it. The photos are awesome, too!  Oh, and if your wondering how easy they are to make... they're (very) easy! Happy cake popping! :)
B004SBX112|1.0|Game itself is just as fun as ever, be it the original, seasons or Rio..  but with this latest update to Seasons there are now pop-up ads in it.  What was the point of paying for the ad-free if they are allowed to do this?
B005COO1X6|2.0|This short, and I do mean short, story exemplifies the problems I have had with more of King's recent work. He has a great concept <SPOILER> a car that isn't a car which eats people </SPOILER> but can't seem to find anywhere to go with it. The main character, I guess, is a boy that we don't follow after the first chapter until the very end. <SPOILER> The use of the magnifying glass to end the story defies logic.</SPOILER> Again with most of King's latest novels, he usually is best at short fiction nowadays, I find he has a great premise, good prose, good characterization (though not this time as none of the characters are ever really developed), but a horrible ending. He seems as if he looses focus at the 10 yard line and then just tacks on an ending.... This short story falls flat, it could have used another 20-30 pages and more character development, and a much more thought out ending. The magnifying glass, telegraphed that it would have something to do with the end from a mile away, really? Lazy writing.... Considering how long we wait for these digital shorts, I was expecting more.

B0053Q9DHW|1.0|I wanted to buy this movie as a companion to my Masterpiece version with Tobey Stephens and Ruth Wilson.  I ordered it on Comcast first, and I am glad I did. I only wasted $5 rather than the full price of the dvd.  I love the story, but this version is disjointed and bland as dish water!  It's like the poor man's version of the BBC mini-series.

B002RI9PKO|3.0|Outliers enlightens. It tells us that success isn't just a gift, but borne out of family history, dating back the ages; it's about luck, timing and old-fashioned hard work. About 10,000 hours honed on one skill will make you an expert.<br /><br />Bill Gates, now one of the world's wealthiest men, just happened to be born at the right time, and was given the gift of a computer by his school, and he discovered his passion with that gift. The rest is history.<br /><br />Author, Malcolm Gladwell, also provides some interesting examples. Like how, in Europe, Jews weren't allowed to own any land, so they migrated to the cities and learned city trades to make a living, like garment making. Those that made it to the New World, as in New York, were the foundation of the garment district and industry that flourished. So, ancient family heritage does play a substantive part in a persons destiny, for generations.<br /><br />Why Asian's excel at mathematics says a lot about how misdirected the education systems in some western countries are. With few holidays, and full-year curriculum, Asian students tend to focus and learn more, not easily forgetting the Pythagoras theorem since their vacations are shorter.<br /><br />Outliers are people who have made it in this world, and are usually the beneficiaries of uncommon good fortune and luck, rather than shear genius.<br /><br />Outliers are men and women who have done things out of the ordinary, and this book explores, with some well researched examples, how these people achieve what they do, so well.

B000001FN3|5.0|I was intrigued to discover that not just one, but two discs are in this set. Disc 2 is a remix of the original. There are bonus tracks included. If you've never heard Alan Parsons this orchestrated pop/rock music has to be experienced. This was my intro album and is my favorite(try also \\"I robot\\" and others). The lyrics can be as mean as \\"I wouldn't want to be like you\\"(from another album) and as sweet as \\"To one in paradise\\"(from this album). Try this album if you want to experience musical ingenuity.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|You might ask what's the difference? Answer: it's a lot more like theatre. This version draws you in, so in addition to all the flash and bang, bright colors and fancy images you get old fashioned, deeper toned drama and emotion. Think Maltese Falcon, To Kill a Mockingbird. Not so much the subject matter but the connection to human flaws, needs and values. It's genuine, not overdone. This version articulates and shows visual images of what we may be losing with quick-fix YouTube and Facebook flash images and dumbed-down movies. I've seen all versions of this movie, including the amazing visual vistas of Blu-Ray. This one is the best because we are what is inside us, not just a skin suit reacting to visual stimuli - at least I hold out the hope we are.
0312323867|5.0|What a great ending to the original story. Just read Something borrowed and when I finished decided I needed to check this one out as well. So glad I did because this is just such a cute story. It's interesting to see Darcy's side of the story and see how her luck changes. The sex scenes in the book could be a little spicier, but if you read it you won't be disappointed. There are some twists and turns that keep you guessing, and the best part is the happy ending, which I won't spoil. Thinking I need to check out some more of Emily Giffin's books.
B00000K31V|5.0|What is amazing about this movie,  the strange underworld of one persons game creation... is that no one,  including the viewer, seems entirely comfortable with the concept of reality.  Whose game are we watching?   And has the game ended?  Did they kill someone?  Or were they all game characters?   I've watched it three or four times now.  And I am still not sure that they return to reality... I believe that was the directors intention.  I cannot understand how these reviews miss this.  The fact that it has a different name at the end,  Transcendenz,  this does not mean it was the 'real' game.  The room they are seated in,  like the room in the beginning,  is a very bizarre room to do a game text.    I have read that it is a nice film because the female lead is not just a reference for sex .  Sure,  thats good.  But thats not what makes the film great.         As the couple enter each new level of this game,  the line between reality and game becomes more obscure.  The cast is wonderful,  and we are not embarressed by any goofy computer special effects.  Its just  good,  simple visual and clever writing.  The game world... so like ours.... We see her running her hand along a gas station wall,  we see him squeezing the leather or the velvet  in a chair.   The characters are experiencing the textures and emotions of real life in this bizarre environment.   This film successfully translates our acceptance of the bizarre.  LIke children,  we accept what  we are told is real.         The story has a woman shut in who creates games,  a hero to gamers.   She is traveling inside her own game,  trying to fix her 'pod'  and the organic material used to make the pod and the game.  Animals are being mutilated to make the game parts,  and people walk like zombies from the forest to Chinese resteraunts.  The male character worries that he is accepting this as real.  He is concerned about the killing, and the well being of his body... reason in an unreasonable world...  He resonates an anti game playing personality in a resonable way.   The double agent who tries to kill her ( they are either yelling death to Reality or Death to   Existenz) is supposedly the 'real'  game creator,  who worries about the anti game theme.    But the resonable young man turns out to be the real assasign of Jennifer,  the game game-creator.   then when she survives,  and kills him,  and yells death to reality,  the game apparently ends. Or does it?   Now they are in a new 'level'  which we think is real,  and yet I am not so sure.  They they kill this 'real'  game creator.  Or do they.          In what appears to be reality,   we,  or rather they,  are taken back to a room that we began in in a GAME.  Can that be reality?  Now the people in the 'reality'  sit and watch without emotion pretty much like they watched people murdered back in the game.   When they kill the people in the 'real '  room,  the heros yell the same line they yelled in the game.   \\"  DEATH TO..\\"   Is it not likely that their game characters are still in play?   And yet,  they seem do so real, especially when the Chinese guy says Guys,  are we still in the game?    and thats the point.  thats the terror,  thats the fantastic ending.   I read a review of this movie that said 'when the return to the Real game'  and thought what are you talking about?  YOu missed the point.  I think. ?    Did they return?  Are we still playing the game?        I love this movie,  I think you will too. Like many great records,  and books,  this film is perhaps made for these times rather than the ones that did not understand them ten or twenty years before.

1416550534|3.0|I bought this book because I'd just read and loved 'The Savage Garden', and everybody seems to be linking them - but really, there's no comparison. Okay, ultimately they're both throwaway summer reads, but while TSG is at times predictable, it's at least tight, entertaining and essentially plausible, while THAR, well, isn't. A lengthy review would only reiterate what others have already said (too long, plot 'twists' glaringly obvious) but I think what really lets this book down is the way that Grace's character is squeezed and contorted out of all probability to make her first-person narration possible. I mean, honestly, do her employers never notice that it takes her twenty-five minutes to find an evening dress in a wardrobe, or that another servant always seems to have a convenient attack of the vapors in order for Grace to be called in and overhear a crucial conversation? And then all of that, \\"Of course, I didn't personally witness this, but Hannah related it to me in minute detail months later...\\" Where was the editor, indeed?    I gave this three stars because I cared enough to finish it, so there must have been something there; but then, I think I was hoping that the whole poet's suicide business would have a more interesting explanation than it ultimately did. The end mostly left me feeling depressed, and annoyed with myself for staying up too late to finish it. Please, leave this one till you don't really have anything better to do.

0316067938|2.0|I loved 'Twilight', but I wish it had just stopped there (or at any rate that I had), because following book 1 this series rapidly succumbs to Series Disease - editor apparently checks out, author rapidly loses the even more rapidly evaporating plot, and everything that made the first book unique and fresh gets repeated until it's formulaic with a vengeance.    Before I started reading this, I chuckled over an amazon reviewer who called it 'emetic', thinking it couldn't be that bad. After 700+ pages, though, I'll not only give him emetic, I'll riff of it too because, given the subject matter, I couldn't help comparing the reading experience with morning sickness: increasingly nauseating, all-consuming, and inevitable. In fact, once I figured out the premise of this book (and really, I never thought she'd stoop so low!), I was tempted to hurl it across the room. Stayed my hand because that would probably have resulted in a broken window (this is a tome of Potter-like proportions - RSI sufferers be warned!)    I hung in there solely because it seemed there would finally be an all-out, blood-and-guts vampire showdown at the end. Rue the misplaced hope! Because instead of the fight the second half of the book seems to promise, we get thirty-odd pages of vampirical squabbling, which culminates in the bad guys - and the Volturi had SUCH potential as bad guys! - stomping off in a snit because...well actually, I'm not really sure why. It had something to do with their inability to do anything else because then everyone might figure out they're not the righteous vampire police they pretend to be. Um, but didn't we already know that?    Oh, never mind. I'm sure my misanthropic reviews can't sway anyone who wants to like these books. And in the end I'm not so much out to trash them as to protest the waste: I mean, aren't vampires bloodthirsty predators first and foremost? Civilised as the Cullens might be in their stately home, it would have added a dimension to, say, Esme, tosee her rip Aro's head off. I guess I'll just go back to Buffy and Anne Rice and stay away from teen horror series. For the moment, anyway...
0609610570|2.0|I had to stuggle through this book.  This book talks about strategic and tactical corporate planning, and how to make the jump from plans to action.  The authors are knowledgeable, and this book might make a decent text for an advanced seminar on the subject.<br /><br />The problem is this book is BORING, blood-shooting-out-the-eyes boring, as they say.  However, it IS a business book, so I wasn't too surprised, and willing to endure.  I persevered through it, and learned some things.  My stomach was turned, however, when I got to Page 204 and saw what these guys are really about.<br /><br />They are not at all above manipulating government to give themselves an edge in the marketplace.  They actually endorse influencing government to pass regulations to give them an edge.  The same sleezy tactic shows up on Page 223.<br /><br />As one watches Jeff Immelt engage in his brand of crony capitalism, it should not be too surprising the authors have a long history with General Electric.<br /><br />My advice--if you can bear another boring business book, you could pick up some nuggets of wisdom.  But this is a book on business tactics and strategy, not character building.<br /><br />If you do read it, I suggest you pick up Burton W. Folsom's INTERESTING book, \\"Myth of the Robber Barons\\" to counteract the Robber Baron mentality of Bossidy and Charen.

0316098329|3.0|After seeing so many rave reviews I was disappointed.    I had a problem connecting with Jack, the 5 year old narrator of the book. A child who knows negative numbers and that 8:57 is three minutes to nine would never speak so poorly. Ridiculously bad grammar that made both reading and listening to the book (I gave up reading the gibberish and tried listening to it from audible and cannot tell you which was worse) simply awful. Jack lacked the originality and creative ways of a 5 year old. All the things I like about children were missing here because I could not relate to this gibberish speaking narration. I heard an interview with the author and she said she copied her 5 year old's speech pattern and claimed every 5 year old makes the past tense by adding \\"ed\\" and says \\"winned\\" instead of \\"won\\". I do not agree.  As a former teacher and grandparent the 5 year olds I have been with do not make the past tense that way. Especially one that is as bright as Jack.      The basic story was good enough to get past this problem and certainly not everyone I know felt this way.    Beyond that I think much of the book is not realistic at all.  However, it was an easy read and certainly held my interest.

0140120416|5.0|This was the first book I bought when I first started to learn to speak Russian. And at first, I hated it. The lessons seemed incoherent. At first, the structure of the book seemed bizarre and purposefully unnecessarily confusing, like Nicholas Brown is playing with your mind. But now as I have come to stand on my feet with this challenging language to learn, I have come to sincerely appreciate the decisions made in how the book is structured and sincerely respect the book as the definitive guide to navigating through Russian. Now, I would be lost with this book.    Best is the incredible depth of information that is available in 528 pages. I know, I know, this sounds HUGE, but the book is really easy to carry along and flip through. While I still would prefer that it be organized slightly differently, now that I know my way around in the book, I can find answers for virtually any question I encounter on the Russian language, with clear instructions on what to say and how to handle it.     While it is set at A-level fluency, Russian Course will enable you to achieve any level of fluency you want. This is a great strength: you can select the level where you want to be.     This book, along with maybe 3 other absolutely essential resources on the Russian language, will get you where you want to be with Russian. But you shouldn't be going anywhere in Russian without this book as your primary and essential guide and companion.

0553583182|1.0|Another Amazon customer generously provided me with a link to a female lottery winner named Cynthia Stafford after I wrote a critical review of another Murphy book called \\"How to Attract Money.\\" Anybody can Google her name. Being the only student of Murphy whom I know of to speak out about her success using his techniques, after her reading of The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, I think her story is worth commenting upon as it relates to this book.     She directly credits her diligent application of Murphy's techniques to her winning the lottery. I am biased against Murphy and all other \\"Law of Attraction\\" gurus because I read this book 30 years ago, read it multiple times over the years and did all it said to do with diligence. Nothing ever happened. Therefore, I think the \\"Law of Attraction\\" is a con designed to sell books. Before I continue with Cynthia Stafford, I want to first comment on Murphy's Yahoo Group forum.    I have not looked at it in a couple of years but when I did I expected the forum to be full of similar stories as in his books. I found NONE! Instead I read airy ramblings about feelings and spirituality. Why no concrete stories from modern students of Murphy to match what Murphy claims in his books? It's as if, while he was writing, there were tons of demonstration stories to share. But after he stopped writing and then passed away somehow nobody else who read his 30 or so books found similar success(as in his books) which they could share in Murphy's own Yahoo forum or anywhere else I can find. I smell a scam. Not just with Murphy but with many other similar authors going back a century to the present day. Somehow there are endless demonstration stories from the authors' \\"files\\" while they are alive and writing books but after the books are no longer being written, all subsequent demonstration stories dry up. And in this age of the internet there's no excuse why not one person (besides Ms. Stafford)would not share their success on forums, chats etc. They need not even reveal their true names. After all, the authors' death should not slow down current and future Murphy students' demonstrations, correct? We have his 30+ books to study and make our own demonstations now and forever, right? And yet there are zero stories to be found after the books are no longer being written except for Ms. Stafford.    If Cynthia Staffords' story is honest and her diligent application of Murphy's techniques directly caused the \\"Universe\\" to give her that winning lottery ticket then I would happily eat my words. But even her story is suspicious because I have to notice how freakishly rare it is for these techniques to work--if Cynthia's diligent application of those techniques are indeed what \\"caused\\" her to end up with a winning lottery ticket. If these techniques worked at anything resembling scientific consistency, then would there not be at least hundreds if not thousands of similar lottery winners as Cynthia Stafford who could directly credit Murphy? Or indeed any of the dozens of similar authors for teaching them the techniques that \\"got\\" the \\"Universe\\" to line up circumstances that put those winning lottery tickets in their hands? Not just a single, one-in-a-billion winner(Cynthia Stafford) who can directly credit Murphy's teachings?    I'm not being cute, flippant or over-the-top with that last paragraph. If, for the moment, we accept that what Cynthia claimed is precisely true. I.e., the cause of her \\"marriage\\" with that winning lottery ticket is absolutely the result of her 24/7 devotion to applying Murphy's techniques, then all I can surmise is that these techniques seem only to work when an \\"insane\\" devotion is applied to them. If so, that is fine. After all, if \\"insane\\" devotion, for only four months, as Cynthia claimed, was enough to \\"make\\" the \\"Universe\\" respond and make her financially independent for life, that is a remarkably small price to pay for her millions.     Therefore, we might reasonably conclude that anything less than nearly round-the-clock devotion simply will not be enough to \\"make\\" the \\"Universe\\" respond. Again, that's fine. As long as we humans know the rules.     But there is another problem. Careful reading of Murphy's stories, in this book and his others, generally, with some exceptions, do not indicate this kind of diligence(however \\"diligence\\" is defined?) is required. For the most part, Murphy makes it all sound very easy(i.e., get in a sleepy, drowsy state, feel and visualize 15 minutes 1-3 times per day); persist in not allowing the negative thoughts in(nearly impossible by the way--negative thoughts are far too fast and sneaky to effectively keep out in my experience. And Murphy's answers--endless repetition of affirmations and constant reorientation of one's visuals to the desired goal are flat-out non-effective. It's mentally exhausting to keep that up more than even five minutes much less hours, days and weeks); and in one to three weeks, on average, you get your demonstration. Sometimes several months. My guess is, as long as we are assuming her story is exactly what she claimed, Cynthia's intense efforts(by-the-way, how does one precisely define \\"intensity\\" of \\"effort?\\") went far beyond anything Murphy mentions in his books. Perhaps she was able to do what I find impossible--really able to keep the negativity out 24/7 for four months straight without a single slip-up. Something virtually nobody else is able to do I suspect. And Murphy does not help us by implying all this is much easier than it really is. Assuming any of this is for real.    That might explain why maybe only one person in a hundred(my pure speculation) ever gets results like Murphy claims in this and his other books--if indeed any of those stories are even true and not just made up to sell books.    Our odds of success are better if we just remember what started and built this country: insane hard work. It's hard to imagine George Washington defeating the worlds' greatestsuperpower's army (with nothing more than a cowardly congress, mercenary foreign officers and hick-farmers to back him up) by sitting on his behind and \\"visualizing\\" and \\"feeling\\" his future successful defeat of that superpower's army twenty minutes a day. Then continuing to sit on his rear waiting for the \\"Universe\\" to line up the circumstances to defeat that same British army using the \\"Law of Attraction.\\"     As stupid as that sounds to me, that's what Murphy and all the other \\"Law of Attraction\\" cons expect us to believe: Visualizing and feeling success rather than monster 24/7 hard work for decades. Of course, Murphy ridicules massive hard work as(paraphrasing), \\"The fastest way to the graveyard\\" in this book \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind.\\" Murphy prefers, instead of monster hard work, sitting on your rear-end and \\"feeling\\" until the \\"Universe\\" responds. Fine, if it really worked.     If our Founders sat on their butts doing that that there would be no America as anything like we know it today.    Think I'm being over-the-top? In another book by Murphy that I reviewed, \\"How to Attract Money,\\" Murphy nearly \\"brags\\" about how his did absolutely NOTHING to get one of his books, \\"Magic of Faith\\" published in France. All he claimed he did was \\"visualize\\" that book being published every night for several weeks and during that time happily did NOTHING else. Of course we are told the \\"Universe\\" then lined it all up for him and his book was published without him lifting a finger other than signing a contract that appeared out of nowhere in his mailbox.    If only George Washington had known that sitting on his butt and \\"visualizing\\" his dreams would have defeated the British army while he rested in the 1700's version of a LA Z BOY and \\"affirmed\\" his way to the British defeat. Sure.    By Murphy's logic, all Washington was doing by working insanely hard instead of letting the \\"Universe\\" orchestrate the defeat of the British army for him was fast-tracking himself to the graveyard.    The \\"Law of Attraction\\" or \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\" in my experience is a con designed to sell books.    It's all nonsense.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I can't wait until Lucas releases new versions with all of his horribly awkward dialogue taken out. The real question about this release, though, is why Lucas is even bothering to do it at this late date. Doesn't he think the world is going to end next year?
B0051XI9FO|5.0|I couldn't find this car anywhere and I wanted it for my Grandson named of course, Miles!  I also purchased one for myself.
B000006TRV|4.0|I had never had a CD version of Pink Floyd, so when I was asked to play some Pink Floyd at a recent gathering of friends I was stuck. My new pre-amp didn't have a Phono input for my Vinyl records so I decided to look for a copy of \\"The Wall\\" on Amazon. The purchase was painless and shipping was reasonable. The used version seemed perfect, so I decided to play it straight away in the solitude of my bedroom. It was almost as good as the Vinyl copy I remembered playing years ago, but there was something wrong. The highs seemed to be lacking a little. Not quite as musical as I remembered. Are my ears not what they used to be, or is it something else? I decide that I needed a comparison so I found a phono pre-amp and dusted off my vinyl copy. There is a subtle difference between the CD copy and the vinyl one. Can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it's in the recording? Maybe it's the 40 year old recording technology? I will play the CD version for parties, but I will listen to the vinyl version when I am alone.
0143038095|5.0|I loved this book for a multitude of reasons and it will be one that I hold on to and will read again down the road.  It is a story of joy and pain, hope and loss and how the human spirit continues. I especially like the relationships between the women. For me it was really an amazing book that makes you think.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Joining the club. So sorry to hear about all  the changes. We need the original versions in blu ray George.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|this album is the best one yet. queen monster has out done herself yet again. this is full of inspirational lyrics and fun dance beats. its the complete package. every little monster should purchase this album if you are a true gaga fan. it will not disappoint!
1451629184|5.0|I've read other reviews that say this book is too graphic. This little girl, which she was at the time lived through each and every one of these experiences she writes about. To edit or water down things would fail to express the selfishness and sickness of Phillip and Nancy. The descriptions that she uses and the profanity that sometimes go with it are simply what she was hearing and experiencing at the time. Jaycee Dugard, and it's very important that she now has that name back, is an amazing, brave person that endured and prevailed through 18 years of mostly pure hell. Her innocence was taken, her mind was brainwashed, her soul was bruised and battered but she overcame and to in anyway criticize this book is pure ignorance. Jaycee is a mother, a lover of animals and a hero. She deserves any and all good things that come her way. Lord knows she has had enough heartache to last a lifetime. Wonderful, wonderful book!
0439023521|4.0|A literary epic Big Brother where the contestants representing the 12 regional districts of a post US America living under tough economic conditions imposed by the intellectual kicking boots of a dictatorship called the Capitol are humiliated and forced to participate yearly in a tournament called \\"The Hunger Games\\", all contenders must kill each other until only one of them survives for the game to be over. The plot is fast paced and entertaining though sometimes gets slow and tedious, it speeds up even more near the ending where some twist and turns provide colour and action. Is the law of the jungle, cruelty, and violence are the features in motion, The whole story is told from the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl skilled with the bow and the arrow, the main character. Adults will not find this book interesting enough for a read, as I said in the caption it is suitable for teens
B0050PYNP8|5.0|One of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.<br />Excuse me but I don't see an attempt to poke fun out of religion per ce.<br />Ok let's be fair.<br />Flat earthers just can't be reasoned with.<br />The film depicts the life of extraterrestrial Paul who decides to escape Area 51 where he has been held prisoner for an extended period of time.<br />The chairwoman in charge of Area 51 turns out to be a retard who is intellectually incapable of handling a 21st century philosophy based on understanding, sharing and empathy vs. needless secrecy.<br />The nut lady chases Paul and two of his friends throughout the New Mexican desert and eventually Paul earns the trust of his two friends.<br />The film is a seriously funny comedy which pokes serious fun out of a lot of stupid ideas, such as the claim that ufo pilots are demons and so on.<br />I was determined to watch this film but didn't expect as much fun and humour, but in the end I saw it and was amazed at it's ability to touch every laughing nerve in my body.<br />This film is a truly fantastic tribute to the evolution of today's comedy.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Let me get this right. George doesn't color correct anything, doesn't change back anything that a majority of the fans have begged and pleaded for him to, adds more stupid stuff to the original trilogy and still wants my $100? Are the fans (myself included) finally going to wise up, not buy this insult, and collectively tell this guy what him and his perversions of a once great work of art can go do with themselves? Only sales figures will tell, I guess.
B0058A119G|5.0|Barbra has done it again!  Of course when you are using the songwriting talents of Alan and Marilyn Bergman it's hard not to come up with a beautiful and breathtaking album.  This project showcases both Streisand's incredible vocal styling and her sense of creating very memorable music.  I hope she keeps singing and releasing such wonderful songs forever.  In particular I love the way she does \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye\\" which I first heard as the Theme to the movie Ice Castles.  If you've had a stressful day, pop this cd in, crank up the volume and if you happen to have a nice bottle of wine to go along with the sound even better! The deulxe version has a second disc of hits that Ms. Streisand had previously released that were written or co-written by the Bergmans and it's a wonderful companion to the first disc.  Highly reccomended!
1439177783|4.0|Like others, I bought this book after seeing Miss de Rossi on Oprah.  I'd liked her character on Ally McBeal, and I love Ellen, so those were two reasons to consider it.<br /><br />The book grabbed me from page one.  I was mesmerized by her accounting of bulimia and anorexia, and couldn't believe that she could continue to function on so few calories!  I found myself thinking about her unsettled life well after I put the book down.<br /><br />I do wish, however, that she had described her childhood a little more.  We were led to surmise that the eating disorders were the results of her young modeling career, but why the self-deprecation?  I also would have liked more detail about her recovery.  I believe that information would have been tantamount to the devoted reader.<br /><br />All in all, though, a good read.  Well done, Miss de Rossi!

B0040ZN9WM|2.0|I purchased two pairs of these for my girls.  My oldest wears a size 9 and my youngest is a 6.  Neither of my girls like wearing these.  I bought these because I felt they looked nicer, they came in whole sizes, and had a solid heel strap.  I thought they would fit better than the traditonal mary jane that comes in the two size range.  However, the solid heel strap gave both of my girls blisters because the strap didn't move with thier foot.  They also gave my youngest a blister on the top of her foot where they also rubbed.  We will be going back to the traditional mary jane hoping crocs will start to sell them in individual sizes.  My family has always worn crocs and raved about them.  These crocs are a big flop in our house.
B005CSWOHC|5.0|I like this album. Its a feel good, sexy and more commercial offering from Ms. Kelly. I can tell it was more aimed at producing at least 5 hit singles. I play it in my car everyweek and got another copy for the crib. Very under rated. Im sure many other singles will be relased from this offering. My top faves are Keep it Between Us, All of the Night, Feelin Me Right Now, Turn It Up, and of course Motivation. They all come in a row on the album. I love!
B004GYY714|3.0|great app in some ways. I love the ability to listen to radio stations from all over. I wish the scheduled recordings had an option for silent recording. I can not always listen to a show at that time and need my phone to use for other things, plus during record mode it records everything. Also it is difficult at times to kill. Splash screen to ask if you are sure and then just goes to the main menu of the program.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Gaga out did herself with this record! Every song on the album is great with a few that really shine bright. Definitely a great record to dance to! And it also happens to carry a powerful message!
B0052YAKS6|4.0|I would've given it a full 5 stars if werent for the fact that most long time Guetta fans will be a bit disappointed.  If youre a long time house lover, look no further because youll feel betrayed with his new cd, full of more pop and hip hop elements.   However, any casual listener or pop lover (like me) will have a blast with this new record! Its full of promising top 40 hits and makes a good party mix.    Nothing But The Beat starts out with the two quick hit singles, \\"Where Them Girls At\\" (featuring Flo Rida and Nicki Minaj) and \\"Little Bad Girl\\" (featuring Taio Cruz and Ludacris). These two party jams and gems definetely make this CD, theyll be spun the most. Track 3 is the catchy yet easily forgettable \\"Turn Me On\\" (featuring, you guessed it, princess Nicki Minaj). Next is a Snoop Dogg remix originally produced by David Guetta, mostly instrumentl and might please original DG fans a little more. (Oh yeah, its called \\"Sweat\\"). Track 5, \\"Without You\\" (featuring Usher) is a definite highlight that no type of music listener will resist. Great vocals and touching lyrics. Tracks 6 and 7 are what will really piss off long time Guetta fans. Titled \\"Nothin Really Mattters\\"(featuring will.i.am.) and \\"I Can Only Imagine\\" (featuring Chris Brown and Lil Wayne). Although Chris's singing is a nice touch, both tracks are heavily auto-tuned and take part in the new hip hop/dance craze. I like them, but most wont. The next song, \\"Crank It Up\\" (featuring Akon) is worthy for a one time listen. Otherwise its more of an annoyance hearing it. Track 9, \\"I Just Wanna F.\\", (featuring Timbaland and Dev) is a collab of both Guetta's and Timbaland's mixing. VERY ANNOYING. Sounds nothing like DG, more like Missy-era beats. Avoid It, its the only song here I have to say is just TRASH. I Think where this record really shines is the last few tracks, \\"Night of Your Life\\" (featuring Jennifer Hudson), \\"Repeat\\" (featuring new star Jessie J), and \\"Titanium\\" (featuring Sia). These last three tracksare all brilliant dance cuts, with powerful vocals and meaningful lyrics.     Disc 2, with guest mixing from Afrojack and Avicii, will please the hardcore house audience. All 6 tracks, \\"Lunar\\", \\"Sunshine\\", \\"Toy Story\\", \\"The Future\\", \\"Paris\\" and \\"Glasgow\\" are all longer, sunny instrumental dance tracks. I highly recommend spending a few extra bucks on the deluxe version so you can get these 6 worthy compositions.    By the way, If you use itunes, theres an exclusive Nothing But the Beat track called \\"Im A Machine\\" featuring Crystal Nicole. GET IT!!!! its a massive club banger!    The album's fun to listen to, hearing contributions from cool A-list stars like Nicki Minaj, Usher, Afrojack, Jessie J, Akon and  more.    Overall, your reaction to Nothing But The Beat just depends on your taste. As Ive mentioned MILLIONS of times, all pop, dance, and hip hop lovers will have a few favorites, while strict David Guetta fans will be very displeased. Thanks for reading, hope it helped your purchase blah blah blah.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas has destroyed this much hyped release with editing that was not needed. Adding random reflections to a scene to changing the Ewoks eyes. Why? Saved me $90.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Definitely one of the best albums ever created.  So Great, So Powerful, So inspirational!!! It's not your typical pop, it's not your average rock.  It's the most exciting and epic album ever! It's truly avant-garde techno rock. Such a great sound! 5 Stars!!!!!
0316069353|3.0|This is the fourth novel detailing the struggles of down and dirty attorney Mickey Haller who usually works out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car.<br /><br />In this case, the economy has taken a downturn and there just aren't many paying clients so Mickey has resorted to working with people at risk of having their homes forclosed.<br /><br />He longs to be back in the courtroom where he's at his best. Then he gets an emergency call that one of his forclosure clients, Lisa Trammel, is accused of killing the man who headed up the mortgage loan division responsible for the forclosure action against her home.<br /><br />There is a dispute between Mickey and another person who are both trying to get the rights to a book or movie deal out of the case.<br /><br />As the reader might expect with Michael Connelly, the novel is well written and the court scenes are like a tightly contested tennis match with one side winning points and the other countering.<br /><br />Mickey Haller is an excellent character who shows how difficult it is to earn a living and having difficult clients. He manages his business and family life with constant emotional and financial struggles that are common to many of us. In this regard we can relate to Mickey, enjoy the other characters and cheer for his success.<br /><br />Connolly tops it all with an ending that it like a grand slam home run in the bottom of the ninth inning.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|So I read that this thing worked on Mac OS 10.6.8 and made the purchase.  And what a mistake that was.<br /><br />First, the item came with a disc with the drivers, but the disc is one of those mini discs that will not work with a Mac laptop.<br />Second, I went to the Alfa website to locate the driver, but the download link is broken.<br />Third, I located a driver from an after market developer, but it did not work.<br />Finally, after copying the driver from the disc using a Windows desktop, I was finally able to install the driver, but now the program doesn't execute.  Thus, it is not compatible with Mac OS 10.6.8.<br /><br />Guess I'll be returning the item and some other company will get my business.  What ever happened to PRODUCT TESTING??<br /><br />Update: I emailed customer service and they sent me a link in order to download the driver.  So, after several hours of downloading a 30 MB file at 2k a second, it turns out the driver for Mac is not in the file.  FRUSTRATING to say the least.<br /><br />Update: I was finally sent the right driver for Mac OS 10.6.8 and this thing now works like magic.
B005CMSDKA|4.0|Think of the reverse of Alice in Wonderland, where a strange girl wanders into the normal world, but there is still an evil queen and her huntsman looking to catch her... Pretty good story overall and the soundtrack really added some punch (I'm not even a fan of Chem Bros).
B00359XZIW|5.0|This is a very nice digipak version of BLACK SABBATH's 1970 debut. It opens up to reveal a graveyard scene and a picture of the band under the plastic cd holder. It comes with a 20 page informative booklet. It doesn't have 8 songs however. 7 total tracks:    Black Sabbath  The Wizard  N.I.B.  Behind The Wall Of Sleep  Evil Woman  Sleeping Village  Warning    Very nice remastered sound

B004EPYZXK|3.0|Here we have another \\"found footage\\" movie which does nothing to expand or explore the genre. This is a shame as there are some aspects of this that are genuinely good, but, at the end of the day, it fails.    Here's the scoop. An Apollo mission is sent to the moon at the behest of the D.O.D. Getting there is fine but upon their arrival they find the Russians had already been there and something obviously went wrong. Before long things start going wrong for them as well.     This is actually directed quite well. The mixture of film and video footage does give the viewer the feeling of being there with the crew. The sets are good. I felt as though I were on the moon and in the landing module. The acting was real tasty as well. All three of the primary players gave very natural, compelling performances. The scares, however, were cheap. They were almost all of the \\"jump\\" variety. There were a few things that were scary/creepy but not enough. That is a shame because, given the premise, this could have driven the creepy dial to 11.    The problem comes in at the script level. The writers tried to be subtle in the way the various plot points were introduced but, at the end, I was confused. What was the point of the mission? This is difficult to write about so as not to introduce spoilers, but, were these guys merely bait? How much did the D.O.D. know before they introduced the mission? Some of the script pointed in the direction of us checking out if the Russians had, in fact, gone there. Other plot points pointed indicated that the D.O.D. knew what these guys would find when they got there. If that's the case, then what was the point?    This didn't hurt to watch by any means but I felt as though my time would have been better spent elsewhere.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I am glad that I read that Documents to Go Main App from Amazon had to be installed first -- not from any other vendor or site, such as the Android store.<br /><br />Oh, no, what was I to do! That would so cut into my day!<br /><br />Oh wait. In the time it took some of you to read this far, I'd already uninstalled my current version of Documents to Go Main App, and ordered it from Amazon.<br /><br />Then, in the span of many seconds, I purchased, downloaded, and installed the Full Version Key.<br /><br />Up, running, bada boom, bada bing.<br /><br />If you're limited by technology in removing your currently installed Main App, fine ... but if you can't be bothered to uninstall it, then reinstall same from Amazon, maybe your negative review is more reflective of yourself, than the product.<br /><br />Nothing bad at all to say, and glad to find this item at nearly 50% off.
B004HO6I4W|2.0|The first delivery had a defective blu ray.  the replacement was, too.  Both were tried on 3 different players that are new and regularly play blu ray at 2 different households.  Since it would be futile to request yet another replacement, we'll just do with the standard dvd and not bother with the blu ray combo packs.  As an aside, one member purchased the same movie as a separate blu ray dvd at a local store and it played fine.  Perhaps the manufacturer packed rejects rather than the real item?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|There is no excuse for the original versions to be missing from a \\"complete\\" set. A very, very poor value compared to the discs for Alien, Aliens, Close Encounters, Blade Runner or Apocalypse Now. (to say nothing of the hundreds of blu-rays of films from the '70s and 80s, from Roger Corman schlock to Raging Bull and everything in between. Releases that somehow managed to make the effort to create brand new HD discs from the best elements available. An effort that is apparently too much to ask of this billion-dollar series. (And yet not too much for TANGO AND CASH.) Order canceled.
6304696515|4.0|I Have seen both movie adoptions Valmont and Dangerous Liaisons as well as read the novel which the story is based on. This movie holds *more* faithful to the novel than Valmont which is done in a *lighter* mood in comparison. For Example; \\"The Overall Ending, Cecile's hair color (Blonde), Madam de Tourval's eventual fate as well as some others\\" Trivial things but yet of some importance.<br /><br />Overall, this was an Excellent period film with lavish customs and a Higher budget than Valmont and with bigger Screen Names who despite being Miscast in those roles in terms of Physical appearances did a marvelous job in delivering their role believably and convincingly enough to render an Oscar Nomination and hunt the audience.<br /><br />John Malkovich does a Splendid job portraying the heartless rake in this movie however I believe he is the Most mis-cast character in the entire film. Valmont from the novel is undoubtedly a notorious womanizer without a soul but he had a charming side to him which is very effective in attracting all his victims (ladies) that I think is somehow lacking in this movie. Malkovich is good enough looking but the role needed a more [handsome] actor to play the great Parisian womanizer. Which in this case I'm obliged to say that Colin Firth is a better choice in regard to appearances and more believable as Valmont.<br /><br />Uma Thurman is another mis-cast this film has made. The Cecile from the novel is a naive, 15 year Old who has been living all her life at a convent and doesn't know much about the world. Uma Thurman just like Malkovich does a very convincing job with what she had but again I'm forced to say that the Cecile [Fairuza Balk] from Valmont was a more believable portrayal of the actual Cecile.<br /><br />I'm Not sure about Glenn Close's character the MARQUISE DE MERTEUIL, Glenn Close is undeniably good in acting her role but I found myself not believing her as the enchanting seductress the novel had us believe. I also found myself not believing Annette Bening in this role either. Glenn Close although more mature was a bit older for this role and Annette Bening was a bit too soft.<br /><br /> Madame de Tourvel played by Michelle Pfeiffer was the most convincing and believable portrayal of what the actual Madame de Tourvel would've been. I liked her a lot in this role.<br /><br />I recommend you watch both Versions Valmont and Dangerous Liaisons and possibly even read the book if you have the time. Rent both films, borrow the book from the library. Then You Can make your own comparison and preferences and can always if you wanted buy the movie you liked most thus run the risk of spending your money on something you might or might not like.ing in this role either.

B00000E9O7|5.0|I remember rolling my eyes when reading, sometime shortly after the Beatles' breakup, that \\"someday Paul Simon will be recognized as the best poet of our time\\".  \\"What about John and Paul?\\" were my immediate thoughts.  But guess what. The Beatles were great at what they did (playing, recording, writing sound and memorable pop songs that everyone can sing along with now), but Paul Simon is a *poet*.  Although his later CDs push his lyrical gifts even further, this particular CD encapsulates not only Simon's writing  talent (and his gift at bringing together many forms of music from around the world, recognizing exactly how to blend them in order to create a whole greater than the sum of those pieces), but also brings up for display and contemplation the thrust of the culture at the time it was written.  The American culture, yes; but even more the culture of our time, of those who grew up never knowing a world without rock and roll.<br /><br />The title track is not just a song about pilgrimage, and far from just a song about a guy going to visit Elvis' old house with his kid, it's about searching in a larger sense, like the \\"girl who calls herself a human trampolene\\" who the protagonist tells us about as he sings:<br /><br />And sometimes when I'm falling, flying<br />Or tumbling in turmoil I say<br />Oh, so this is what she means....She means we're bouncing into Graceland<br />...losing love<br />Is like a window in your heart<br />Everybody sees you're blown apart<br />Everybody feels the wind blow<br /><br />The subtext of the song is loves and connections lost, perhaps even loss on a grander scale, touching on poverty, divorce, and of course lost love.<br /><br />The highlight musically of the CD is the contribution of the great group, \\"Ladysmith Black Mambazo\\" in the first recording they did that was marketed in the states, I believe.  Ladysmith sings one song accapello, \\"Homeless\\", which is heartbreaking in its innocence and hope (not in the lyrics but in the major key in which its sung, as well as the soft English and African words) in the face of desolation.<br /><br />But whether with Simon or comusicians Ladysmith, Linda Ronstadt and others, the songs continue on a theme of hesitant connections amid the stunning shock of loss.  Most poignant, though it sounds funny at first, is \\"All Around the World/Myth of the Fingerprints\\", which was the last song on the second side of the original vinyl.  It tells of a modern star, a \\"former talk show host\\", who has become so wrapped up in a conspiracy involving the army (whose?  who knows?) creating a myth that all fingerprints are different, that he decides to withdraw from life, the last chorus ending, \\"that's why we must learn to live alone.\\"<br /><br />The crusader-like picture on the cover doesn't conjure up a knight seeking treasure and the heads of Muslims as much as a Middle English pilgrimage, and one can see \\"Graceland\\" like a modern day Canterbury Tales, each person, each character talking about their hopes and their hurts, often in a humorous context, but always in a way that will draw you in with Simon's careful entwining of words and experience.<br /><br />It should be noted that some songs were not composed by Simon alone but most were and he contributed on all.nglish and African words) in the face of desolation.    But whether with Simon or comusicians Ladysmith, Linda Ronstadt and others, the songs continue on a theme of hesitant connections amid the stunning shock of loss.

It tells of a modern star, a \\"former talk show host\\", who has become so wrapped up in a conspiracy involving the army (whose?  who knows?) creating a myth that all fingerprints are different, that he decides to withdraw from life, the last chorus ending, \\"that's why we must learn to live alone.\\"    The crusader-like picture on the cover doesn't conjure up a knight seeking treasure and the heads of Muslims as much as a Middle English pilgrimage, and one can see \\"Graceland\\" like a modern day Canterbury Tales, each person, each character talking about their hopes and their hurts, often in a humorous context, but always in a way that will draw you in with Simon's careful entwining of words and experience.    It should be noted that some songs were not composed by Simon alone but most were and he contributed on all.

B000021Y77|5.0|This is a stunning film.<br /><br />The story is simple and spans a period of only twenty minutes. Lola has to raise 100,000 German Marks or her boyfriend will die, and the film tells the story of those twenty minutes through three different storylines. Each reflects the effects of slight changes, moments of delay, minor deviations, alternate choices and each plays out the effects these have on the future.<br /><br />We see how the future is written and rewritten by a glance, a moments hesitation, and act of chance connection or disconnection. Three stories are told, but we glimpse the infinity of stories that could and are taking place in every moment and the chain of interconnections that mean that each change changes everything.<br /><br />The film style matches the frenetic intensity of the impending deadline. The music and cinematic style create an energy such that the viewer doesn't simply view but experiences the heart pounding exhaustion of the race against time.<br /><br />It is a film that lays before you the immensity of opportunity that exists in every one of our moments, if only we are alive to see them.<br /><br />I found the name of this film scribbled on the back of a piece of paper deep in a jacket pocket. How long it lay there and quite what chance made it surface and not be discarded or overlooked is of course the story of the film. I thank whoever it was that gave me the note and heartily pass on their recommendation that you must see this film.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Unfortunately, the versions of these films that won 8 Academy Awards are not on this set.  George Lucas continues to tinker with his original trilogy and his changes are often distracting.  He has every right to alter his own movies, but that doesn't mean that you or I should support it by buying this inferior product.    Certainly the most controversial change in this set occurs at the end of Return of the Jedi, when the Emperor is shocking Luke and Darth Vader must decide between his son and the emperor (and the light side of the force v. the dark side).  Director Richard Marquand handled this scene with subtlety as the viewer has a clear understanding that Vader is starting to question his master, but the final act of saving Luke still happens suddenly and with terrific emotional pay-off.  In these Blu-Ray editions, Lucas has decided to add dialog for Darth Vader as he looks between his master and his son, having him say \\"No...Noooooo!!!\\"  This ruins the subtlety of the moment as Vader's intentions are telegraphed to the viewer ahead of time and lead the viewer to wonder why the Emperor didn't hear him and do something to stop him.  Silly as this addition is, you have to wonder what Lucas could possibly have hoped to achieve with it.  The scene worked as it was for almost 30 years.  Now it's broken.
0062515675|3.0|I confess that I have somewhat mixed feelings about this book. I read it on holiday and began by expecting and hoping to read an insightful story. For the first few pages this seemed to be the case, however the book then changed direction.<br /><br />In many ways the author of a book designed to help people change, what are often termed `self-help' books, faces a dilemma. For the help to be successful it has to be self-help, that is it has to come from within the reader. The use of stories or parables that awaken understanding in the reader derive their power in this way. However after reading the story the reader is then left with the question of what to do with this awakened understanding; how do they actually change?<br /><br />The alternative approach is to provide a change instruction manual which prescribes changes in the hope that these then create change from which new understanding will follow. The danger here is that unless understanding is changed, the result is the mindless application of prescribed rituals, or the rejection of them.<br /><br />This book attempts to bridge these two approaches. It begins with the story of a lawyer forced to re-evaluate life following a major heart attack. However this story quickly becomes a rather simple framework for what is largely a monologue describing a set of self-change techniques.<br /><br />At the point where the book transitions from a story to an instruction guide I almost gave up on the book, but was later glad that I didn't. I found the pretext of the story strained almost to breaking point, but suggest that if this is overlooked the second half of the book contains some powerful advice for personal change. I did have the feeling of ideas collected together from elsewhere, but amongst them is a structure of practical changes that have the potential to profoundly change your outlook and achievements.<br /><br />The measure of value of any such instruction guide rests not in what the reader is instructed to do, but in what the reader does with the advice. For my part, a little surprisingly, I have taken a number of the change suggestions and am applying them. The book therefore has had a greater impact than many.the advice.

0807014273|5.0|This is an astonishing book that I strongly recommend. Victor Frankl was a Jewish Austrian Psychiatrist imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps including Auschwitz during the Second World War.<br /><br />The book begins with the remarkable biographical story of life in the concentration camp in conditions that are scarcely imaginable and where the prospects for survival were bleak. The second half of the book takes these experiences and their understanding as the basis for development of what Frankl called Logotherapy. At its heart is a belief that striving to find a meaning to ones life is the primary motivational force within people. This may be contrasted with striving for pleasure, or striving for power which are respectively at the heart of Freudian and Adlerian psychology.<br /><br />The description of life in the concentration camp is chilling in what it describes but this appears multiplied by the manner of the description. The narrative is largely free of gruesome details and uses simple matter of fact language to convey and amplify the all enveloping abject awfulness of the situation faced by those imprisoned. They are described as having been transported into an incredible and inexplicable world where every normality is replaced by ever present abnormality. Yet in this utterly abnormal world we see there is space for the acts of saints as well as demons.<br /><br />It is a book which provides insights into the nature of life and meaning and thus should be read by all. If its relevance to those involved in change needs to be stated, for me it is captured in clear imagery that life in the concentration camp which removed so much from the inmates, was denied removing one crucial thing, described thus:-<br /><br />\\"In the concentration camp every circumstances conspires to make the prisoner lose his hold. All the familiar goals in life are snatched away. What alone remains is \\"the last of human freedoms\\" - the ability to choose one's attitude in a given set of circumstances\\".<br /><br />It is this choosing of attitude that sits at the heart of the inmate's ability to survive, for those that did survive are characterised by having a clear vision, a clear imperative that they must survive for they have work yet to be done.<br />When so much effort directed at change focuses on what to do and how, Frankl powerfully quotes the words of Nietzsche<br />`He who has a why to live, can bear with almost any how'.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as one that will change your perspective on what people and organisations can achieve and the incredible importance of establishing meaning; of answering the question `why?'his choosing of attitude that sits at the heart of the inmate's ability to survive, for those that did survive are characterised by having a clear vision, a clear imperative that they must survive for they have work yet to be done.

0142001104|5.0|I remember seeing Benjamin Zander at one of his lectures seven or eight years ago, and being inspired by his message. This book captures much of Benjamin's philosophy in the topic area of the subtitle, `Transforming Professional and Personal Life'.<br /><br />The book is jointly written with Rosamund Stone Zander who is a family therapist. Drawing equally on Rosamund's experience and that of Benjamin's conducting the world's orchestras, including the Boston Philharmonic, the book takes the form of a `How to' which instead of providing strategies to overcome life's obstacles, invites the reader into a world of opportunities.<br /><br />With many references to his life in music in the form of analogy and experience, the book sets out a dozen practices which will bring the power of opportunity into your life. The practices are all simple. Each provides a story based explanation of its value drawn from the personal experience gained in the USA and UK by the two authors, and straightforward instruction on its use.<br /><br />As always with the best advice, there is no rocket science here, though the book is more powerful for this, not less. For example `Giving an A' simply suggests that by approaching everyone we meet prepared and ready to see their best, this very act has already created energy to improve outcomes and create new opportunities in what they achieve. The book's graphic examples bring these simple approaches to life and provide evidence of the power of apparently simple ideas.<br /><br />This is a powerful book. I read this book on a flight to Khartoum, and found some of the insights and examples quite moving. Occasionally the musical references left me struggling a little, but served to highlight a need to learn more and in no way diminished the value of the messages.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book to everyone determined to improve their lives and in search of simple ways in which to begin.

1400032717|5.0|The story this book tells is of itself quite unremarkable. At its heart is a family breakup and the impact on those affected. What is intriguing, illuminating and utterly engaging is the way in which the story is told through the eyes of its main character Christopher Boone.<br /><br />Christopher is fifteen and suffers from Asperger's, a form of autism. The book tells the story of its writing as a school project through his eyes, experiences and way of seeing the world.<br /><br />Christopher has a photographic memory, he has a brilliant understanding of science and mathematics, but can't understand human beings. His mind is utterly logical and whilst it can manipulate numbers with astonishing ease is powerless to understand a raised eyebrow or fathom the meaning of `raining cats and dogs' other than literally.<br /><br />We are drawn into Christopher's world, we see things as he sees them and in doing so we come to understand a little of Asperger's and Autism, but beyond that we begin to glimpse how easily we assume that our way of seeing the world, is the way of seeing the world.<br /><br />A wonderfully insightful book for anyone who wishes to understand autism and more generally become more aware and understanding of other people's perspectives.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|Using an uninspired plot gimmick as an excuse to throw a number of attractive young actresses into a series of video game style battle sequences could easily have made a terrible movie, but in this case provides a surprisingly thought-provoking offering.  The film manages to work in enough plot to provide the action scenes a sense of purpose while, at the same time, acknowledging their hokiness.  The action scenes are very well crafted, and avoid the current tendency to run on too long.  The recent cliché of overusing inconsistent progress of time, however, is only too well represented.  The visual imagery makes good use of the available CGI technology, and in some instances the artistic composition and use of color are superb.      The entire movie adopts thematic elements from such a wide range of earlier films that it is hard to single out any particular one; it is likely that video game enthusiasts will catch an equal number of references missed by this reviewer.  It does appear incongruous that so much of the protagonist's imagination is expressed in terms of modern video games despite the story being apparently set in a time before even Pong on the Atari.  In a film so meticulously crafted, that does not appear to be an oversight.    The film's intended message of personal empowerment is largely undermined in that the only tools given Ms. Browning's character appear to be violence and sexual appeal.  Violence is clearly shown as having undesirable consequences (a message that more action films might do well to adopt).  The message to young women of self-determination through being alluring to men would be much more offensively misogynic if the film did not clearly acknowledge and criticize its own exploitive nature.  At times, the abusive asylum setting appears to be offered as a metaphor for how the entertainment industry treats its female talent.      The would-be inspirational message is also muddied by a lack of clarity, and could well be interpreted as suggesting that one should persevere by taking refuge in fantasy.  There are enough distractions from life that one hardly needs any encouragement to further ignore one's surroundings; it is easy to miss out on genuine experiences if one wastes too much time watching movies on DVD, and perhaps wasting even more time reviewing them afterwards.
1461190460|5.0|Antoine De Saint Exup&eacute;ry was a French airman killed in action one year after this book was published in 1944. The Little Prince is a book for children and adults alike. By way of introduction, Saint Exup&eacute;ry describes a picture he carries around with him of a boa constrictor eating an elephant and how adults who see the world through adult eyes, are blind to what the picture really is. They see only a picture of a hat.<br /><br />The book contains a simple story, simply told of how, in our adult lives at least, we live seeing only what we are able to see.<br /><br />It tells the tale of an airman who makes a forced landing in a desert where he meets the Little Prince of the title. The Little Prince has also fallen from the sky, but this time from another planet. The story follows the prince and narrator as they journey around the planets meeting a procession of people who see their worlds their way. We for example meet the conceited man, the king, the accountant, the drunkard, the geographer and the lamplighter, each serves as a parable for a way of adult thinking and seeing.<br /><br />It's a simple, poignant, thought provoking and insightful book that everyone should read as a child, to share how you see the world, and far more importantly as an adult to understand how much you have lost and how blind you have become, and perhaps how you might re-open your eyes.<br /><br />Simply brilliant.
B004EPZ070|1.0|I saw the previews and was interested in the movie, but after reading the book first I was really disappointed by the characters in the movie.  I really enjoyed reading the book, but the movie was awful.  I thought the most believable character in the movie was Kate Hudson's portrayal of Darcy.  \\"Rachel\\" and \\"Dex\\" were very weak in the movie and although \\"Ethan\\" was funny his character was nothing like the character in the book.  Anyway, it was a terrible movie in my opinion and a waste of time.
1577314808|5.0|This is a stunningly powerful book.<br /><br />In the introduction Eckhart Tolle describes the origins of his thinking through a simple but powerful illustration, He talks of waking up with a feeling of deep loathing for the world and a deep sense of dread. The repeated thought that `I cannot live with myself' leads to a sudden awareness of how peculiar this thought is. `Am I one or two?' If I can't live with myself, there must be two of me, the `I' and the `self'.<br /><br />This thought and the impact of pursuing what it means are at the heart of what the book explores; the means to stand outside the thinking-self and observe, to be a watcher. A key thrust of the book is that thinking, the ability to think, represents a key advance for mankind, but like all advances can become a ball and chain preventing further advances. Eckhart proposes that our current thinking represents a level of development which should now be replaced by a more advanced ability. Indeed his frequent references to Buddha, Zen masters and others indicate that this transformation has been signposted for some time and may be long overdue.<br /><br />As Eckhart says, he can tell the reader nothing that they don't already know. I suspect that five years ago I may not have read beyond the first five pages, if indeed I had ever picked the book up. Now this book is one I'd like to recommend everyone to read. I wouldn't, simply because as I wasn't, many may not be ready for it. For some the language may be too `new-age'. It is important to recognise that the words are symbols for ideas, even so I found that to some I attached personal meaning and consequently found them grate. The underlying ideas when I was able to see them were however deeply profound.<br /><br />It is impossible to attempt a summary, but to provide a glimpse of the transition beyond current thinking and its applicability to change. Eckhart refers to research identifying that ideas are not the product of thinking, but of some other process. We don't get ideas by thinking, perhaps walking the dog, taking a bath, through physical exertion, but not by thinking. We actually get ideas when there is no thinking. What we need is not more thinking, but less. Less thinking, but better controlled, focussed use of our minds.<br /><br />He goes on to describe our minds as in uncontrolled overdrive, processing thoughts in a random and ad hoc manner. It's as if in our mind we each posses a super computer, but the program controlling it is written by chance rather than being written by ourselves as computer programmers. Thus events, situations and experience each form part of the programme and our thinking as a result begins to constrict understanding which in many ways limits, rather than extends what we may achieve. Our thinking builds attachments to our past and restrictions on our future and avoids the present moment, the Now.<br /><br />Eckhart then begins to develop the means by which we can take control of our thinking and rather than be described by behaviours that result from this ad hoc programming, what we do connects with what we are. The consequences of this transformation are wide ranging and dramatic.<br /><br />The book deals with what are extremely challenging ideas in a way that is remarkably accessible and uplifting. The format follows the style of a dialogue between a questioner and Eckhart's responses, which aids the accessibility by allowing the questions the reader may have, to be posed on their behalf.by thinking, perhaps walking the dog, taking a bath, through physical exertion, but not by thinking.

I just spent 2.5 hours in the car with my three kids listening to the album two times through, plus a few thirds for the favorite tunes.  I am excited to hear more from AWOLNATION.

0316010669|4.0|The subtitle `The power of thinking without thinking' nicely captures the essence of this fascinating book.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point, here sets out to explore why it is that sometimes the thinking in the blink of an eye provides greater understanding and insight than that which follows a mountain of analysis. He asserts that our subconscious is continuously collecting and processing information, much of it directing our actions but in ways totally unseen by our conscious mind.<br /><br />The book begins with an introduction to some intriguing examples to illustrate this power of insight and introduces the idea of `thin slicing', the ability we all have to evaluate a situation very quickly, capturing core information on which to base a decision.<br /><br />Having introduced the concept Malcolm is at pains to explain that he is not simply advocating the abandonment of analysis in favour of gut reaction. Our instinctive judgements sometimes prove correct but at other times can lead us astray. His key message is that they offer different approaches to creating understanding, and both analysis and intuition may be performed well or badly. However in some instances, particularly in a rapidly changing world, there is simply not the time for the laboured analysis required in an attempt to understand everything, and the only viable course of action is to thin slice.<br /><br />The good news is that thin slicing skills can be learned and honed. We all collect this information, all of the time, the subtle skill is in being able to use it effectively.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book with ideas of relevance to everyone dealing with change. What makes it particularly engaging is the breadth of examples used to illustrate the ideas. Many of these may have you rethinking not only what you think, but how you think.<br /><br />For example there is a study made by insurance companies of the risk doctors face of being sued. The study identified that the risk had little if anything to do with the quality of the doctor, or even the number of mistakes they made. Rather the level of risk was a direct result of how much the doctor was liked by their patients. The risk was not a function of what the doctor was doing, but how they were being.<br /><br />Another example brings into question the confidence we may have in conducting any kind of customer testing. There's a fascinating account of the testing of types of brandy which deduced that the stated taste preference of customers had nothing to do with the brandy at all. Subconsciously and unbeknown to them it was the shape of the bottle that made the brandy taste better.<br /><br />Once we become aware of this priming of our subconscious, we can use it to our advantage. For example studies have shown that test scores can be dramatically influenced simply be priming our minds with thoughts of success. Students answering questions from the Trivial Pursuit board game scored 55.6% after they had spent five minutes thinking what it would be like to be a professor. In contrast when they spent five minutes thinking about football hooligans they scored 42.6%. Just thinking about professors, primed them to achieve more.<br /><br />Profoundly disturbing is the example of what can happen when we are pressured to rely on our subconscious when it has been miss-primed. The case of Amadou Diallo who was shot by four police officers is used to illustrate the effect similar to autism that is created when our intuition is inappropriately primed.<br /><br />This is an engagingly written account that had me hooked as I read it cover to cover. It develops an interesting idea using examples that will set your thinking running in new directions. An enjoyable and stimulating read. It leaves you at one and the same time seeing things as far less and yet far more simple than they've ever been before.th the quality of the doctor, or even the number of mistakes they made.

0061122416|4.0|I think to a large degree for a book to be enjoyed and understood it has to speak of things that you are ready to hear, and perhaps already understand. The role of the book is then to allow you to see better that which you already understand.<br /><br />I came across this book just before going on holiday and bought it because I recollected someone mentioning the authors name a few weeks earlier.<br /><br />The book is a novel telling the story of a boy on a journey, a journey following his destiny. The story is all about change, and in particular our fear of change. The story reveals how our fears drive us to act in ways that we believe protect us from the dangers of change, but in reality trap us in its effects.<br /><br />For those ready to hear, the story contains some profound and important messages about change. I tried to imagine how I may have reacted to this book if I'd read it six or seven years ago. I think I might have found the mystical references a little difficult, but that would have reflected my deficiency, not the book's. A key message of the book is that we too easily lose sight of the difference between symbols used to represent ideas, and the ideas themselves. We become focussed, we might say obsessed, by the symbols, the words in the case of a book, and our minds become blind to the ideas they represent. If we are able to avoid this trap then this is a very powerful story that may well deserve the claim on the back cover that it is a book that changes the lives of its readers.
B000YAA68W|5.0|This is just a funny, sad, and poignant French animated non-fiction film.  It's not quite the same as watching a Superman or Wonder Woman animated film.   This film delves into the childhood and young adulthood of a young Iranian teenager/woman growing up in Iran and in Europe.  It's gives you a different perspective on things, but it actually isn't as different as one may imagine.  Aren't all of us young, one time in our lives and don't some of us have issues growing up as adolescents and aren't there always some economic, political, or family difficulties when we were growing up?   Sometimes, it's just a part of life.  These are the times in which we grow up.    I just watch it for more of an entertainment value rather than a history lesson in Iranian life and politics or about growing up in Europe.  I found no need to argue or to to overanalyze the film, I accept it as an autobiographical work, done in an unusual, but entertaining format.    Watching it in French with English subtitles is really funny.   I recall a scene with her falling in love with a Spaniard, and I had to laugh at how it turned out.  It probably was the most funny scene in the film.    The nuns in Austria were hard on the girl.  Just imagine the ultra strict and tough nuns that you see in the film \\"The Sound Of Music,\\" without the sweet Maria and without any music and joy.    The film is mostly done in a simplistic French cartoon style.  If you look at the cover of the blu-ray, you will see a representation of the style.
0714834491|5.0|This is simply an astonishing book that is a joy to own.<br />This is a large book with over 500 large format pages. It is described by its author Alan Fletcher as the work of a visual Jackdaw to produce an exploration of the workings of the eye, the hand, the brain and the imagination.<br /><br />As he describes it 'The book attempts to open windows to glimpse views rather than dissect the pictures on the wall. To look at things from unlikely angles.... The book has no thesis, is neither a whodunit or a how-to-do-it, has no beginning middle or end. It's a journey without a destination.... It is unlike most books, those that are concerned with the mechanics rather than the thoughts, with the match rather than the fire.'<br /><br />The result is not a book to sit down and read sequentially from cover to cover, rather an environment of ideas and stimuli through which to journey, an exploration in which to become immersed.<br /><br />Reading the other reviews, many seem to come from graphic designers, indeed the author is a renown graphic designer himself. The result is a book that is a delight to hold. The different paper types and textures, intriguing layouts and inviting formats mean that every page turned leads to new discoveries even before their content is examined. Its merits as an exemplar of the art of design are clear, but this is much more than a role model for designers.<br /><br />It is a book that in infinite ways serves as a catalyst for thinking. It has a multifaceted ability to present aspects of the world in new ways, that defy you ever again seeing them the way you always have in the past.<br /><br />Through the imaginative use of images and text, quotations, snippets of information, and a host of other approaches, this is a feast for the mind as well as the eye.<br /><br />It's not simply a book that I can't stop dipping into, I can't stop smiling at the fact that Alan Fletcher took the time, care and attention to detail to share it with me. It is quite simply a pleasure to hold and a feast to read.d.

But that doesn't matter, it isn't being deceitful, it's the very point of the book. It presents itself as a best seller as part of becoming a best seller. I bought the book at the airport en route to a conference and I suspect that this bold claim tipped the balance in favour of selecting the book over others, so it works.<br /><br />So it's a small book, easily read and cheeky. What else. Well it's cheap and does have one or two useful ideas. Often the lasting effect of a visit to a conference may be one or two new ideas, so at the price it's a bargain. The book contains lessons, or thoughts from the experience of a marketing man. The final few pages began to feel specific to this target audience, but for the most part the thoughts are widely applicable. It's nicely produced and has plenty of pictures again projecting the message `be what you want to become'.<br /><br />As an example of what you'll read, I liked the thoughts about right being wrong being right. In a changing world if you think you know the right answer, then it's highly likely to be wrong as the world will have changed since it was right. By the same token being wrong opens up the opportunity of trying new things and maybe becoming right.<br /><br />It won't make a dent in your wallet or diary and perhaps contains nothing profound, but it illustrates how a simple message can be communicated in a straightforward and concise manner with style so that how you say, reinforces what you say.a straightforward and concise manner with style so that how you say, reinforces what you say.

0393320928|5.0|Having read Genius by James Gleick, I'd discovered the fascinating work and life of Richard Feynman and was keen to learn more. This is the second of two books Feynman wrote. I happened to come across this book first and perhaps I've read them in the wrong order, no matter.<br /><br />The book is autobiographical, but in a typical spirit of nonconformity is not a biography. Rather it is a collection of anecdotes written about episodes in Feynman's life. The first half of the book is a selection of these short stories, in no particular order, each describing in a matter of fact fashion an aspect of Feynman's life. Each as a side effect provides an insight to his thinking and attitude to life and learning. Clearly this material was a key resource for James Gleick's work and I had the feeling that these were stories which didn't find their way into Feynman's previous book `Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman'. As a consequence Gleick's book provides a more rounded and complete picture which ties these snippets together. However Feynman's book has more to offer.<br /><br />The second half of the book has a detailed account of the work on investigating the cause of the Challenger Shuttle disaster. This description will be of interest to anyone who wants to find out the technical details of just what went wrong, but more interestingly has some fascinating insights into the afflictions that can infect the thinking of large organisations. In the case of NASA this led to mistaken understanding of safety and risk, which when compounded by poor communication between management and staff created a widespread blind spot, which extended well outside NASA, about the challenge and dangers of space flight. There are lessons here for any organisation, which even if they don't surface as safety issues, will undoubtedly have impacts in some aspect of the organisation's performance.<br /><br />On a personal note, I've left the best bit of the book until last, appropriately because it is the last nine pages. Here is reproduced a public address given in 1955 to the National Academy of Sciences titled `The Value of Science'. Feynman gives a brilliant description of the absolute and essential role of exploration in creating advance, and the fact that non-scientists have little comprehension of the real learning process by which this advance is made. For me this short concluding section of the book was worth the price alone, illustrated by the books concluding paragraph..<br /><br />\\"It is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress which comes from a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance, the great progress that is the fruit of this freedom of thought, to proclaim the value of this freedom; to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and discussed; and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations.\\"<br />In short, if you want to find out about Feynman, Genius is a more complete read, having read that you may be inspired to read this book to find out more. However if you want to learn of lessons from the Challenger disaster, or simply read the description of exploration in `The Value of Science',this is a book well worth reading.e is reproduced a public address given in 1955 to the National Academy of Sciences titled `The Value of Science'.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|4 is proving to be a bit of a controversial album for Beyonce in the sense that so far it doesn't seem to be selling like most people think it should, although it's been certified platinum for about a month and a half. Many reviewers find it boring with too many ballads and fillers, plus the first single, \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" was recieved with mostly lukewarm reviews. I personally loved the song the first time I heard it and thought it was very different, but loved the risks she took with the song. The next song I heard was the demo of \\"End of Time\\", which I thought was okay, but as soon as I heard \\"1 +1\\" my excitement for this album only grew stronger. The album actually leaked three weeks early, which many people thought would kill album sales when it was officially released, which may be true to some extent. The first time I heard it there were a few songs I loved, some I enjoyed, and some I didn't care for at all. However, I felt there was something special about this album and now I love it and listen to it almost daily.    \\"1 + 1\\"--possibly the best Beyonce ballad behind \\"Halo\\". It has a very simple, bluesy feel to it and the lyrics are simple yet beautiful, and her vocal delivery is very raw and passionate. The basic meaning behind the song is that even if the world ended and everything crumbled, as long as love exists, that's all that matters. A truly beautiful song. 5/5    \\"I Care\\"--not bad. One expects the song to go a certain direction in the beginning, but as soon as the chorus starts its like a different song. Her vocals really save this song, and her imitations of the guitar riffs towards the end of the song are incredible. 4/5    \\"I Miss You\\"--some people find this song very boring, but I love it. It is a short song and she sings almost all of it in her lower register, but the music is very atmospheric and almost trancelike. A very chill track, it manages to relax me while still keep me on my toes. 5/5    \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\"--the official second single from the album. I heard alot of good hype about this song for a few weeks before I actually heard it, and I don't think that helped it. I do think its a very good song, but there's something about it I can't quite figure out. It doesn't really do anything special for me, but by no means do I dislike it. I love the piano in the song and once again her vocals are top notch, but I do feel as though its just a tiny bit overrated. 4/5    \\"Party\\"--I love the chill 90s vibe to the song. The harmonies are flawless and take the song to another level. This is a great summer jam and everytime I hear it I picture my friends and I driving around with the windows down blasting it and singing along. Andre 3000 kills his rap verse as well. The title suggests that this song would be a very upbeat dance song, but even though its a very chill midtempo track, it still works very well. 5/5    \\"Rather Die Young\\"--probably the most R&B sounding song on the album. I love how the song is at once quiet and haunting, then all of a sudden the chorus kicks in with a punch and she rips the vocals up. She goes back and forth with this a few times, giving the song a particular range that is quite impressive. 5/5    \\"Start Over\\"--the only song on the album I don't particularly care for. I'm sure it will grow on me over time as it is not a bad song at all, I just feel like it never really goes anywhere. 3/5    \\"Love on Top\\"--LOVE this song! This was the first song I heard on the album that I loved instantly. It has an old school soul feel to it and just makes you feel so happy. It's about finally finding the one special person that you love, and you can certainly feel the love that she does when she sings this song. And can we talk about the 5 key changes that she TEARS APART flawlessly? It's incredible. I saw her at the Roseland Ballroom August 18, 2011, and this was one of the best moments of the night. Seeing it live is amazing. This is probably going to be a classic Beyonce song and one that will mean alot to her and her fans, since she famously went public with her pregnancy for the first time when she performed this song at the 2011 VMAs, unbuttoning her blazer at the end of the song and rubbing her baby bump. This will always be one of my favorite Beyonce songs. 5/5    \\"Countdown\\"--This song is sure to be a hit single. It has catchy hooks and a fun countdown chorus that I believe she sampled from a Boyz II Men song. One of the few dance songs on the album, its a harmless, upbeat, fun song to jam to. 5/5    \\"End of Time\\"--Another highlight of the album. It has a very tribal feel to it throughout the song, and the harmonies in the beginning gave me goosebumps the first time I heard it. It is very catchy and sure to be a hit in dance clubs. 5/5    \\"I Was Here\\"--I DID NOT like this song at all the first few times I heard it, but after she closed the Roseland show with it I have grown to enjoy it alot more. She was fighting tears throughout most of the song, and now that I realize she was pregnant during the concert, I'm sure she was thinking of her unborn child and how she wants to leave an important mark on his/her life. Sometimes it takes a video or live performance to take a certain song to a different level, and that is certainly the case with this song. 3.5/5    \\"Run the World (Girls)\\"--probably her most controversial song to date and with good reason. It is very abrasive and in your face with some intense Fela Kuti-inspired beats behind it and aggressive \\"girl power\\" lyrics, but that's what I love about it. She took major risks with this song, and for me, it worked. It does stand out like a sore thumb when you listen to the entire album as it sounds VERY different from everything else, but I still love it. Her performance of this at the Billboard Music Awards will probably be right up there with Michael Jackson's Motown performance of \\"Billie Jean\\" at the Motown 25 concert, and Beyonce is already said to be the Michael Jackson of our generation, and with good reason. 5/5    Overall I think this is her strongest work to date. There are lots of old school soul/throwback jams throughout, but she took chances with these songs and it pays off. It seems to be the best reviewed album of her career thus far with the major critics, although I feel as though it is very underrated with the general public. For this Beyonce fan, it is a fabulous collection of songs that showcase her incredible voice and personality. A great album.
0061673730|5.0|This is not an easy review for this is not an easy book. One thing I think I'm sure of is that it's not about Zen or motorcycle maintenance.<br /><br />On the surface the book is the story of the author and his son with some friends travelling across America. However this provides the environment for the author to share and explore a range of questions and issues including rationality, attitudes to technology, philosophies of life and the meaning of quality. What the book does is create the opportunity and invite the reader to explore these questions and others that they are stimulated to identify themselves. It's a book that provokes and requires the reader to think. In a sense the book becomes and is what the reader makes of it.<br /><br />What I made of it, and what makes the book exciting for me, is this approach through the vehicle of a novel of creating an environment in which the reader is teased into thinking through a range of extremely challenging philosophical questions. Many readers unwilling to engage in this process may see little in this book of value viewing it as being over complex and lacking in immediate gratification of a standard novel. Others looking not for questions but answers will be disappointed that the book has not the rigour they are looking for and provides no solutions.<br /><br />However for those who want their thinking stimulated and their understanding challenged this is a demanding but very rewarding read that will probable warrant being reread several times.<br />I realise that the above says little about what the book is. I take comfort by quoting a passage from the book that I think releases me from having to describe what it is and invite you to find out what it becomes for you.<br /><br />As Persig says, \\"The trouble is that essays always have to sound like God talking for eternity, and that isn't the way it ever is. People should see that it's never anything other than just one person talking from one place in time and space and circumstance. It's never been anything else, ever, but you can't get that across in an essay.\\"<br /><br />All I can say is that whilst this isn't everyone's cup of tea, it's the kind of book that just might change the way you see yourself, your world and your future. If you decide to read the book I recommend the 25th anniversary edition as this has some additional explanatory information by the author and also an interesting exchange of correspondence between the author and publisher which gives an insight into the creative process.been anything else, ever, but you can't get that across in an essay.\\"     All I can say is that whilst this isn't everyone's cup of tea, it's the kind of book that just might change the way you see yourself, your world and your future.

0439813786|5.0|Part artwork, part novel.  You cannot understand the story unless you read the pictures along with the words.  That alone is fascinating.  Add in a thrilling, superb story, and you've got Hugo Cabret! A must read!
B000003TA4|1.0|nirvana's music is depressing and drab.  i like the to enjoy some depression in the form of radiohead, for example.  but this cd is really crap, i just don't get the hype.  i assume the media glommed onto it, said it was something new and different, and thus the hype began, shaping american music pop culture for a few years.  it is funny to me that every time you read a review of this album it speaks of shaping the music of the 90's (in america), thus elevating it to must-have status.  first of all, a trend is a trend.  soundgarden and pearl jam were much better than nirvana.  but if i had to rank pop trends, grunge ranks extremely low on my list.  nirvana and its ilk could never have happened and we would be quite happy.  shaping a few years of music does not make a record great; influential, yes; great, no.  this is not a great album, and it sparked a rather bland and uncreative period for pop music.  glad it's gone.  now let me hear some led zeppelin or black sabbath (the real grunge, in my opinion), and i'll be much happier.
B0053YEM7U|4.0|The great Yes albums are in chronilogical order:  Yes  Time and a Word  The Yes Album  Fragile  Close to the Edge  Tales From Topographical Oceans  Relayer    Fly from Here doesn't belong with these, but in my view it does belong with the next tier of very good Yes albums like: Going for the one, Tormato and Drama, and is clearly superior to anything from 90210 forward.  So for an old Yes fan like myself, it's pretty exciting!
0439023513|4.0|I admit, I was very angry when I finished the book.  Nothing I wanted happened, some of my favorite characters die, and - this was the most painful thing of all - the ending gave a grim but *realistic* account of a war's aftermath, not a rosy, happily-ever-after conclusion that many fans hoped for.      I have a lot of respect for Suzanne Collins for doing something risky that she knows will alienate a lot of readers (you can tell just by looking at the reviews of Mockingjay, compared to those of the first two books in the series).  But there's a reason why she does it, and that's to illustrate the true horrors of war.    This series is *not* about Katniss.  It's about war, how horrible it is, how it must never happen again.    Sure, we all felt betrayed.  We were upset at how Ms. Collins lured us into this third book with high expectations, wondering whether Katniss would choose Peeta or Gale.  By the time we are finished, we feel disappointed, the same way a war results in no winners.  Ms. Collins did use and manipulate Katniss to convey her message, but what she did was brave and necessary to prove her point.    This series is more than just a story about a girl, a romance.  Read it if you want to understand the author's views on war and to experience the aftermath of violence yourself.  If not, skip it and imagine your own happy ending.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This book really kept me laughing, in the same way that the first shopaholic book did, if not more. I really love Kinsella's style of writing and would recommending this to any one look for good chic lit with a bit of comedy thrown in.

B004HYGF18|5.0|The 1st thing I noticed was this CD was crystal clear some of the newer more recent music I have bought have sounded like I am covering my ears with my hands and sound even muffled at times. The Vocals are perfectly pitched and are slightly louder and clearer than some of my other favorite Cd's similar to this one. Bass is outstanding full and deep and visceral at times. I give the audio quality of this CD 5 stars and the CD it self 5 stars. I took a chance with this one and bought it based on the reviews and what I heard on Amazon and I was not disappointed.
0061205699|5.0|I read this book when I was in my teens and I was very affected by it. I identified with Scout and Jem, who were full of curiosity and innocence, and were coming to know right from wrong, not just in small matters, but in large social issues such as jurors voting against evidence and for their own personal prejudiced views (despite the evidence). It's difficult for children to understand why adults behave like this, and I think Harper Lee does an outstanding job of depicting children coming to grips with right and wrong. I also loved the character of Atticus, the children's father. Years went by and then I read this book again, as an adult, and was still struck by the power of the story. I can see why this book won all the awards it did.
B0058A119G|5.0|If there was only one song on this album, it would be worth it.  The title song, What Matters Most, is absolutely gorgeous.  No one sings with as much emotion in her voice as Barbra Streisand.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I wasn't sure about this movie from the commercial, but decided to get it after talking to a few friends who saw it. Boy, am I glad I did.<br /><br />The story is original (something you don't see much today), the cinematography is fantastic, the CGI is obvious but that gives it the \\"other-worldliness\\" that makes the story work. The sound is well balanced; most happens in the front to keep your attention, with just enough surround to create that immersed feeling.<br /><br />If you like the CGI of '300' or 'Sin City', you'll like this.<br /><br />If you like scantily clad women kicking a**, you'll love this.<br /><br />This is what I would expect Rod Serling would be involved in if he were alive today; the ending has a bit of a 'Twilight Zone\\" feel to it. I'm surprised to hear myself highly recommend this; the commercials didn't do it justice.
1416550534|3.0|After having read \\"The Forgotten Garden,\\" I was eager to follow through reading all of Kate Morton's books.  While \\"The House of Riverton\\" captured many aspects of the key elements with thoroughness and an air of authenticity, the story seemed to drag at times, as though the weight of the burdens carried by the characters made the movement of the story onerous. The characters were well-developed and believable, there were no loose ends, and overall, I'm glad I read it.  But only occasionally did I have trouble turning out the light or putting it down, a personal measure of a book's outstanding components. I still look forward to reading \\"The Distant Hours,\\" but my eagerness has been tempered with the somewhat slow pace of this story.

B000AMUU94|5.0|I have always loved David Bowie but this is the 1st CD I have ever bought of his. So I put this CD in and overall it does not disappoint with it's audio quality. The vocals are nice and clear Bowie's voice has a good pitch and volume for the music not too loud and not too soft. The Sound stage is pretty good and sounds are distinct and not meshed together. Bass is decent and matches the music just fine. Usually older music lacks good bass and punch and have almost no deep bass at all. Hiss is completely absent in the back ground witch is very important to me and something that can become very irritating and distracting to me if it is too loud. I am happy with this CD my only issue with it is Aladdin Sane is one of my top 5 favorites from Bowie and the version on this collection is not the one I was looking for. I even bought another Bowie Cd and the song was the same one found on this collection. I wish amazon gave the option to listen to the Bowie disc's that I purchased from them. Other than that the music is still the same and amazing. I give the audio quality of this CD 5 stars and the CD it self 5 stars. You can't go wrong with this Bowie Collection.

I went back and watched the ones not available when I first started watching and have only four to go for the season. Emissary aired in two parts but the segments were rolled into Emissary. When DS9 aired I saw an occasional episode and am really enjoying watching Deep Space 9 from Season 1 Episode 1 without having to spend a lot of money to buy the series. Spending about three hundred dollars to watch once would be too big an investment.

The plotline, characters and background are solid, well-developed and well-researched.  In \\"The Search,\\" Ms. Roberts maintains a consistent level of depth in the characters, the story, and the background of the training of the search and rescue dogs.

B001O7JHJ8|5.0|So now on to my beloved Erasure, I used to own the 90's version of their greatest hit's CD but it has been lost throughout the years and I just recently bought this version. Erasure has always been one of my favorite groups since I 1st heard them in the 80's. So I put this CD in and was amazed at what I heard!!! It sounded like the music was recorded just yesterday and has audio that rivals most newer music. I have never heard Erasure sound this clear and distinct and with this much clarity in all the sounds of the music,instruments or synthesizers. The music has a very large sound stage and none of the sounds are mushy or meshed together all sounds are very distinct. I can hear every little detail and sound in the music like I have never heard before. Bass is nice deep and full I found myself lowering the bass a bit witch I normally don't have to do with older music or albums. Usually older music lacks good bass and punch and have almost no deep bass at all. Hiss is completely absent in the back ground witch is very important to me and something that can become very irritating and distracting to me if it is too loud. I love this CD and find myself playing it over and over again although I like the 1st disk better. The audio quality of this CD to me rivals most new Cd's. I give the audio quality of this CD 5 stars and the CD it self 5 stars. You can't go wrong with this Erasure compilation this one is the best yet.

1416549447|2.0|In ChiRunning (and its other marketing permutations, including workshops) Dreyer advocates a running technique that is used by many world-class runners. It has to do with particular physical postures while running such as a forward lean. Dreyer didn't develop the technique nor was he the first to write about it. But to his credit, he did recognize that the technique works and adopted it in his own running. However, Dreyer was undoubtedly confronted with a challenge when he sat down to write his first book - how does a woodworker (his vocation for 15 years) who began running ultra-marathons as an adult sell books and workshops on running in a culture that wants to know what your credentials are? The answer is add a pinch of Eastern mysticism (Tai Chi) and voila, ChiRunning! Understand that the running technique that Dreyer advocates did not arise out of Tai Chi. Rather, Dreyer resorts to referring to a Tai Chi master he bumped into while running as someone who is supportive of the running technique Dreyer advocates. Dreyer (and many others before him) already used the technique; this particular Tai Chi master has now also given his benediction. In fairness to Dreyer, he does use Tai Chi principles (such as \\"going with the flow\\" and \\"the path of least resistance\\") in his mental and spiritual approach to running. But these principles are separable from the running technique. You don't, for example, need to \\"tap into your Chi\\" to begin running with a forward lean. Not surprisingly, Dreyer's explanations for why the technique works are a hodge podge. Lacking a background in physiology, anatomy, biomechanics, or physics, his explanations of the mechanics of running movements are, at best, amateurish. As a result, the reader is confronted with absurd section headings such as \\"The stages of learning effortless, injury free running.\\" The most technically efficient runner in the world expends plenty of effort while running (and trains accordingly). And even Dreyer admits he took 3 and ½ years to prepare for his first ultra-marathon. In these instances Eastern mysticism serves as a smokescreen for Dreyer's lack of expertise regarding the fundamental physical forces and principles at work while a person runs. The book is also woefully short on drills for implementing the changes most runners will have to make to implement the physical techniques Dreyer recommends. As anyone who has ever participated in a sport knows, learning even basic techniques requires concerted effort and practice. Dreyer's short list of drills includes such admonitions as concentrating on rotating your pelvis from the T12/L1 spinal column level (ever tried that one?) and to have someone shout at you to \\"Stop Running!\\" to make you mindful of how you move when you are trying to move fast but can't run. ChiRunning will introduce you to a more efficient technique for running. But if you want to have a substantially similar technique explained by someone who actually knows about the mechanics of running and has a more systematic program for incorporating recommended changes, I would recommend Dr. Nicholas Romanov's Pose Method of Running. Romanov is a Russian trained sports scientist who has coached Olympic athletes and has the sports and running expertise Dreyer lacks.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This album is one of the best I've heard in a long time! There are so many different styles of song, and they all make you want to pump your fists!! Marry the Night is the perfect song to start off the album, it really sets the mood. And it ends with The Edge of Glory, also perfect as the last song since it's about death. I recommend listening to it from start to finish so you can really get a feel of what she has accomplished. Amazing!

B004E0Z4XK|5.0|So now on to Rome, I recently bought around 300 Cd's to rebuild my collection of my music and replace many CD's that have been lost throughout time. This Cd popped up in my recommendations section after I had bought another disk from a group that sounded similar or is in the same genre. I gave it a quick listen and was impressed and then read the reviews and decided to buy it. So I put this CD in and was amazed at what I heard!!! I am not a fan of Norah Jones but the songs that she sings on this track are absolutely amazing and beautiful. The Norah Jones tracks blow me a way and I always find myself listening to them and this CD. The music has a very large sound stage and none of the sounds are mushy or meshed together all sounds are very distinct. I can hear every little detail and sound in the music . This CD is very very bass heavy I find myself lowering the bass when ever I play this disk. My only issue is, in my opinion the vocals should be a bit louder and the vocals seem slightly muffled. I give the audio quality of this CD 4 stars and the CD it self 5 stars.

B005IKZ1B0|5.0|It's ridiculous to even doubt that David Guetta is not one of the most successful DJ's in the world. His last cd One Love was an international success, and the Party Album of 2009. When \\"Where Them Girls At\\" the summer hit premiered in June, I was pretty sure David Guetta would surprise us with the new album, Nothing But The Beat. NTB, is energetic, fun, fresh. With lots of stars featuring, it may surpass One Love. And the thing is all of the tracks scream hit. The negative reviewers were believed that the album was too pop, and they are right. However, in the bonus edition there are solid House tracks as well. Either way NTB is great for your party, great to have fun!    Key Tracks: Repeat(Ft Jessie J), Titanium (Ft. Sia), Night of Your Life (Ft. Jennifer Hudson), Lunar, Without You (Ft. Usher)  Avoid These: Crank It Up(Ft. Akon), I Just Wanna F (Ft. Timberland and Dev)
0385737955|4.0|I'm surprised by all of the negative reviews of this book.  To me, The Maze Runner was an excellent read.      The entire book reads like one giant cliffhanger - the reader has no clue what the heck was going to happen next, but knows SOMETHING is coming. It had elements of mystery, suspense, some horror, a little sci fi. A great combination, but maybe not for everyone. This is ultimately a dystopian fiction with a twist - the reader doesn't get to see the actual dystopian world because the entire story is set in an artifical environment consisting of approximately 100 teenage boys trying to survive and escape a very peculiar living arrangement.    Like most YA books, the writing was simple and easy to follow, allowing for the reader to get sucked in from the first page. The horror is palpable, but there's not too much blood and guts - and no sex.  The writing skill was a bit lacking, however, with too many cliches.  This can pull the reader out of the book, causing distraction - but I doubt most of the youths reading will even notice.  Nonetheless, better editing would have pushed my review up to five stars.
0316098329|5.0|This book looked interesting so I bought it and it was amazing, had to keep reading it until the end.  Recently I reread it with the same experience!!

Tell ya what, why don't I just ship my wallet over to Switzerland and call it a day.<br /><br />Just don't buy this app, you're wasting money.  Better yet, don't play Angry Birds at all.  You don't think this will still be fun two years from now anyways, do you?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This addition to a classic is a complete failure. I do not understand why the Lucas camp thinks this was a great idea. It was a failure in III, and now in a classic. Ruined my childhood. Thanks Lucas, I was really looking forward to this coming out on Blu-Ray. ROTJ was one of my favorites growing up....and amazing scene....gone bad.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This is an amazing album! If you look at the state of pop music today, it isn't really good. But this album blows everything out of the water! It's amazing!    I love  Heavy Metal Lover  Electric Chapel  You and I  Government Hooker  and  Americano   The most. They are all really really original! Give the album a listen.
B00319ECGU|5.0|What can be said, this is the ultimate Dirty Harry collection to date. Set back and let Harry's calm demeanor tame the savage criminals and sooth your aching mind. Decent Blu-ray extras and bare bones packaging make this a lethal dose of classic viewing. Watch one per night, or do a marathon. I did notice one glaring fault in the video, but i don't have the dvd to compare... in Magnum Force when Brigs? enters the movie in a scene outside, his face goes completely blurry/out of focus, and does it again later when he's got the gun on Harry with the bomb, I'm thinking it was a directorial/ cameraman error in actually filming, but like i said i don't have a dvd copy to compare it with. But it's not enough to fault the collection.
B001K98MFU|2.0|I watched Innocence in theaters when it originally came out. I recall finding the film frustratingly dense in spite of its gorgeous visuals. As a fan of the franchise, I picked up the blu-ray a while ago thinking that a few years of maturity and a deeper understanding of the original manga might help me appreciate this film more. Alas, this was not the case.    Innocence is an ambitious film that tries desperately to repeat the successes of the first Ghost in the Shell film. It is a classic case of a work of art trying too hard. Where the film does not explicitly copy its predecessor (the opening montage, the festival scene, etc.) it awkwardly strives to achieve the same gravity of effect in its visuals and dialogue. Innocence is somewhat successful in the former area and deficient in the latter.    The film's greatest strength is its lush, exquisite imagery. There are numerous moments in the film where one could pause the disk and have a work of art on one's TV screen. In spite of a few jarring moments of badly mixed cell animation and CGI, the film is a visual feast on par with the original.    Unfortunately, the images lack the power they had in the earlier film because they are not tied to a coherent narrative. The actual plot - the sequence of events that occur in the film - is quite simple; a group of female sex doll cyborgs malfunction, two section 9 detectives investigate, they go to where the cyborgs are manufactured to learn the truth, and then the film ends. Like Solid State Society, the film takes some of its inspiration from Shirow's original manga.  However the contrived, pretentious dialogue combined with the plodding pace (40% of the film's runtime is comprised of slow walking, scenery shots, and close-ups of basset hounds) makes the story feel vastly longer and more complex than it really is.    The basic problem with the writing can be summed up in one word: Quotes. Half of the dialogue is a quote. Does Batou have an opinion about one of the antagonists? Confucius quote. Does Togusa want to express his anxiety? Time for some 'Paradise Lost'. The film is saturated with dozens of quotes, from all manner of writers and philosophers. This over-reliance on canned smartness creates two huge flaws for the film.    For one it hurts the characters. The film does little to further characterize the members of section 9 (aside from a bit of development for Batou and Togusa's relationship). Having Aramaki and Ishikawa spout quotes instead of finding their own words does not allow us to get to know them as well as characters, as the quotes are clearly just sentiments Oshii (the director) wanted to express. The dialogue feels like a vehicle for Oshii's navel-gazing and not an expression of real people interacting.    Secondly, copious quote usage cheapens the effect of using quotes at all. The viewer finds that once the film is over, he can't remember any particular quote among the dozens he heard. The earlier film only used a handful, and as a result, its dialogue is much more memorable (I still recall the major's quote at the end, Corinthians 13:11). But in Innocence, with so many quotes from so many different sources, it is hard to know which to care about and why.    Bad pacing and dialogue are not the only problems with Innocence's story. There are a handful of exasperating scenes. In particular, the virtual experience maze I found to be needlessly tedious. It is only partly comprehensible because Batou is made to explain how he bested Kim's trap. What's more, the scene near the end where Batou scolds the little girl for not worrying about sex dolls is bizarre to me. In the original manga, it was bad enough for Batou to blame the girls and not their captors for the \\"innocents\\" (people who use a product premised on child murder are not terribly innocent in my view) who suffered from the sex doll malfunctions. Here, for Batou to worry about the dolls is beyond callous, and Motoko's concurrence (\\"If dolls could talk theywould say 'I don't want to be human!'\\") is both asinine and damaging to her and Batou's characters.     The last couple of frames of the film suggest that Oshii thought he was saying something profound about humans and their need to recreate themselves via dolls and cyborgs. Unfortunately, the film wasn't really concerned with making this or any other particular idea comprehensible. In fact I think many viewers will come away from Innocence with the feeling that the movie wasn't really speaking to them, but rather to itself. It is a shame, because Ghost in the Shell is a powerful franchise that has always managed to be entertaining, exciting, and thought-provoking all at once. The further it removed itself from Shirow's somewhat campy original manga, the more consequential it became, first as the film, then as the brilliant Stand Alone Complex series and film. Innocence is a step in the wrong direction both in terms of style and substance.

B0051QO4QY|5.0|It isn't just pop, electronic, or dance.  GaGa has transcended these genres, throwing in soul, rock, country, trance, and euro-underground club sounds.  The album is loud, fast, furious, and refuses to let you go.  The chanting, ululations, and sonic assault that BORN THIS WAY becomes proves that it is the most ambitious, progressive, refreshing mainstream pop album (and I use this term loosely) that has been released in my memory.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Lady Gaga teased us with this album since 2010 and we were at our wits end come the release on the 23rd of May. Songs were leaking everywhere but I remained patient and waited until it was available to buy in stores. I wanted to have the album in my hot little hands rather then a ripped version from the internet.    I can still vividly remember my reaction to hearing the title track, Born This Way when she released it earlier this year. I was expecting a slow, meaningful and heartfelt song and instead I got a 90's inspired dance track which was passionate and embracing. I sat outside a bar in Cronulla and cried when I first heard it, I knew she had created another number one hit.    When I got the album I was so excited that I ran home. Finally, FINALLY, the album had dropped and I could listen to it on repeat. Firstly, I love the flow of the album, the songs mesh together perfectly. The first track, Marry The Night fits perfectly with Born This Way following it up second. I screamed when Government Hooker started, so dirty and will be a summer anthem is she chooses to release it as a single. Another track I adore (and probably my favourite from the album next to Born This Way) is Fashion Of HIs Love. The song she wrote for McQueen is a track worthy of Whitney Houstons vocal range.    If you haven't already listened to this album I highly recommend it, it is my most played album of the year!    xxx
B004BLTNJI|5.0|If you like unique fantasy fairy tale  type movies with a slightly dark egde then you'll probably enjoy this. If you are a parent thinking this is for children, watch it first perhaps then decide wether or not your child should view it since some of the imagery and storyline might seem too horrific/dark. The stop animation really pops in HD. The only thing I didn't care for was the one brief musical type song the \\"other father\\" broke into at one point in the movie... it was just a week song, and if you're going to do a musical then you have to fully commit to it, and... Don't hire Danny Horrible Song Writer Elfman to do it as in The Corpse Bride etc. But that's another topic altogether.
0553582038|4.0|After watching \\"A Game of Thrones\\" on HBO I picked up the next two books and stormed through them at a break-neck pace.  I waited several weeks before picking up AFFC.  I admittedly read some reviews here before I picked it up.  Bad call.  While the pace was not nearly as frentic as books 2 and 3 the underlying tension in AFFC made me keep picking it up and reading a chapter every chance I got.  I.e. I don't agree with the complaints from other readers on this book about how it does not stand up to the first three.  Will AFFC be anyone's favorite?  Probably not.  But for my money the slow-building tension with some of the main characters is incredible.    For my money, Sansa & Samwell were my least favorite POV characters by far.  Everyone at the Eyrie could jump through the moon door or leap from the sky cells and I'd be much happier.  And poor Samwell is just painful to read about.  I can't imagine he'll ever turn into a brave and integral member of the Night's watch as a Maester, so I'm hoping his chapters in ADWD are brief.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|Coming off what is probably their best album, in Rust In Peace, Megadeth decided to shift their style away from the thrashy style of their previous albums. The focus was more on songwriting, rather than playing as fast as possible. heck this album isn't even nearly as angry as all the previous ones. Now this isn't a bad thing, as this shift led to this album, and its follow up, Youthanasia, which along with Rust In Peace and Hidden Treasures, were my 4 favorite Megadeth albums. Sure I wish they'd at least kept some of the thrashy elements, but oh well. No sense complaining about a decision made nearly 2 decades ago, and I did give this album a perfect score, because it's a classic to me.     If I had a complaint it's that there aren't really any memorable musical pieces. The music is solid, but aside from the main riff in Symphony, there just isn't anything that blows me away.     This album's strength, and why I give it a perfect score, is in the songwriting. While I like the previous albums there aren't that many songs on those that I can just listen to, and enjoy outside of the context of the album, Peace Sells, Chosen Ones, Holy Wars, Hanger 18, Tornado Of Souls, In My Darkest Hour, are some of the exceptions, but overall I find those albums, more enjoyable as whole albums than individual songs. You can do both with this album.     Again, I don't understand why this was remastered. I haven't heard the remaster, so i can't really compare, but the original sounds just fine. They really didn't need to remaster it.     Skin Of My Teeth 9/10 starts the album off with a nice fast paced song, sure it's not Holy Wars, but still a very nice opener. Nice chorus. I don't know if this was a single, but if not, it should have been. Very nice opener.     Symphony Of Destruction 9/10 Probably Megadeth's biggest hit, and it's a very good song. It's more mid tempo, more of a focus on rhythm than any previous Megadeth song. Classic riff in the verses.     Architecture Of Aggression 8/10 another mid tempo song. Love the intro, some sort of string or keyboard, not sure what, but whatever it is sounds peaceful, then you hear what sounds like a missile, and you just feel like whatever was so peaceful got shot to s***. there really isn't a whole lot that catches my attention about this one. it's just a good song.     Foreclosure Of A Dream, 9/10 the first Megadeth ballad, thankfully it's a hell of a lot better than those cheesy 80'a ballads, although I sadly enjoy some of them too, uh we all have our faults. The acoustic guitars in the verses are solid, and the song gets heavier for the chorus, and has a brief part in the instrumental which speeds up a bit, and kind of reminds me of the 80's, kind of that is.     Sweating Bullets 7/10 kind of a different pace for them. Dave's vocals are kind of interesting on this one. It's a pretty good song, but there are better choices for a single. Dread And The Fugitive Mind, from their 01 album The World Needs A Hero, reminds me of this song, except way better.     This Was My Life 9/10 is kind of up tempo, with a sort of slower part at the start of the verses. Love the vocal melodies on this song.     Countdown To Extinction 10/10 an environmentally aware song. Kind of a ballad too. The verses are mostly drum and bass with some guitar licks thrown in, before a consistent riff comes in. This is another song I'm surprised wasn't a single.     High Speed Dirt 9/10 another favorite of mine. Finally a fairly fast paced song, with a cool little acoustic part in the instrumental break. Mostly though it's just a fast paced rocker. There isn't really a chorus, maybe an instrumental one, kind of Black Sabbath, ish in that respect, faster than most songs they do. Nice solo as well.     Psychotron 8/10 Kind of Angry Again-ish. Slightly upper tempo, slower than the last song. Dave brought out his snarling vocals again for this one.     Captive Honor 7/10 uh I had to deduct a point because of that \\"Your soul better belong to Jesus\\" part. Uh creepy. The song starts with an acoustic intro. This song has a bunch of vocal samples. Something that'd later bug me about later releases, especially Hero. Risk was a crap album anyways, so it didn't really matter.     Ashes In Your Mouth 9/10 Ending the album on a strong note. This is probably the thrashiest song on the album, at least the intro anyways. The verses tend to follow the same tempo most songs on here do. The chorus and instrumental break are fairly thrashy too.     Overall this is a very good album. It was my second Megadeth album actually, and for some reason if you haven't heard it yet, then go get it. It'll be worth your time.
B004LROMSO|5.0|This show was great.  Hoping they will continue esp given it ended with Merlin leaving Camelot so it was being set up for the next season to focus more on his character arch and journey.  Excellent writing to have Merlin as a sorcerer who had rejected his gifts because it took him to \\"the dark\\".  A believable and fascinating approach.  We need to see where this goes!  I can't believe they cancelled this show!  Joseph Fiennes, as always, was excellent.  The visuals were stunning, esp the opening sequence.  I only wish they had given Morgan more depth and complexity.  they painted her 100% evil.  typical - the man sorcerer is the hero, the woman sorcerer is evil - if they ever bring this back they should make Morgan more complex and develop a side of her that is sympathetic (check out Mists of Avalon for another reading on Morgan).

It was a well written book, as a Yale law professor the author has the analytical mind and CAN really write!She also narrated the book in the CDs, which in my mind is even better than the book that she imitated her daughter's voices and tell the stories vividly, it's so captivating that my DH and my kids got drawn into the story that we had some good laugh on the road. The book on the other hand gives us really good morale boost which I believe every parent needs . Now DH is a self proclaimed \\"tiger father\\" and constantly quoting the tiger mom lingoes from the book :D
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars is a story, a book on film, nothing that George Lucas has added changed the story or the meaning of the story what so ever!!! So STOP your CRYING!!! I personally saw Star Wars in the movie theaters back in May, 1977... I grew up with Star Wars movies, I own them on VHS's, THX VHS's, wide screen DVD's, and now the Blue Ray's. I have enjoyed seeing my favorite movies up dated with current technology. I would rather see George Lucas play around with the original trilogy adding cool special affects, than seeing a remake of the original Star Wars movies, with different actors... I shudder at the mere thought of Star Wars being remade. With new Technology's being created every day, George Lucas can continue to update his movies without having to remaking them. As Long as the original story has not been altered in anyway, and original actors performance's are not being altered, then I say go right a head George Lucas have fun keeping the Original Star Wars movies made back in 1977, 1980, and 1983, current, fresh, and up to date, 34 years later, capturing a whole new audience... You all know George Lucas will release the original 1977, 1980, and 1983, trilogy on blue ray soon enough because there is a market for it... However I do agree the Original Star Wars Trilogy should be included with this Blue Ray box set!!! People enjoy the Story... that is what it is all about! Not the color of the lightsabers...<br /><br />I just bought STAR WARS the Complete Saga on Blu-ray and it looks and sounds so bloody AWESOME! It's like being 9 yrs old all over again, watching Star Wars for the very first time! I own them on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray and I couldn't be happier! With-out a doubt the best Blu-rays I own! I even think the addition of NOOOOOOO by Darth Vader at the end was a welcome addition, it makes the scene work much better, it makes the transition from the dark side to the light side much more Dramatic. I personally love what George Lucas has done with his Master piece! Now I still believe the Originals theatrical versions should have been included with this box set, not that I would have ever watched them. Just like I don't watch the theatrical versions of the Lord of the Rings any more, the extended versions being so much better. I watch my blu-rays on my 55 inch Samsung, LED, in company with my Marantz, Boston Acoustics, and Velodyne Home Theater... It's going to be a EPIC STAR WARS WEEKEND! Life is so Good! Thank you George Lucas!!!Now I still believe the Originals theatrical versions should have been included with this box set, not that I would have ever watched them.

0393338827|5.0|This book was an excellent read.  Not only was it very informative of exactly how the Wall Street Bond market and our banks collapsed our economy, but Michael really knows how to bring the people's personalities out which makes it a fun and enjoyable read.  Be prepared for some unique and slightly complicated dissections of exactly how the Bond market worked and how things go out of hand and our economy nearly collapsed but helps to see exactly why nearly no one say it coming.  Would recommend this to anyone as the informative part is important for people to know.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Anyone who has struggled with mental illness should be able to relate to Portia De Rossi's struggle. I picked up this book after I saw her interview on Oprah, and although a book with this sort of premise (struggling with self-image, a celebrity I barely know) would normally not interest me, I could hardly put this one down. The book is very well-written and honest. From her childhood to dealing with social pressure and repressed sexuality to a complete mental and physical deterioration, you will be rooting for Portia all the way and even if these problems don't reflect your own life, don't be surprised if they touch your heart deeply. This is an unforgettable set of musings from an unquiet mind that healed just in time to survive.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I went to see this movie while in Fitzgerald GA visiting family and I am glad I did.  I absolutely enjoyed this movie thumbs up. The story line couldn't have been any better. I also commend the author who wrote the book because after watching the movie I didn't  hesitate to order the book which I am reading right now. I will defintely get this  movie on DVD and recommend that everyone go see it. The people that played the various characters were supurb!!   I was glad to see that the whites embraced this movie and my hope is that when they left the theater they had a totally postive outlook
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Was excited to get this, but will have to pass.  Some people say, \\"get over it - it doesn't change the story\\".  Great stories are defined by great moments.  Great moments should not be changed.  If an original version is ever released on blu-ray I will buy.  And when I say original, I mean one where Han shot first.
B000LC55F2|3.0|I was intriqued by the reviews of this book and knew there was a movie. I thought reading the book would be the place to start...and was I right. As a beats-all reader of all types of literature, my overall reaction is that this is too clever by half. After starting as a kind of men compete in the mysterious business of magic. In the quest to get more exciting tricks at least one (you can never tell whether both men) contacts tesla who creates another clever device for transporting something from one place to another. One side effect, it seems, that if something is living it won't be after the transfer - at least the duplicate as we finally get the picture that when something is transferred a copy is made that turns into ice or stone or something, again not sure.    From this point, all belief transferrs to stone but without a duplicate. The tricks of both the magicians and the book become more fantastic until we have \\"half people\\" running around. People who can melt through doors; and scary burial chambers filled with identical stone guys.    Getting to this part made me wish I could get transferred to another book read.    The book goes on for another couple of months (seems like} of confusing reading the book kind of peters out. Very little of this is explained. There is some completely opaque subplot about someone's brother who gets stoned in the tesla magic box with no hint of what happened and why.    Go see the movie. It cuts out about 2/3 of the book and has some pretty sparks.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This will not be the version we all long for nostalgically as adults, this version has been vandalized.  There are many changes that alter the look and feel of the original, and they are not well-done as the Star Trek TOS Blu-Rays.  This has been hamfisted and poorly revised.
B0051QO4QY|4.0|You know I love Lady Gaga, I really do.  In fact I loved her so much that the day the album was released I WALKED over to the nearest Best Buy, which has recently become my only means of purchasing anything entertainment related, the walk was a good mile away, but I persevered.  The only down side, walking a mile home to listen to it.  Now the album, I felt lost some of the edgy-ness 'The Fame Monster' brought, back in 2009, the reason I feel is is because listening to 'The Fame' its pretty much nothing but hard hitting dance tracks, so when 'The Fame Monster' came out, people were more shocked that there were songs like 'Speechless' and 'Teeth' on the EP.  'Born this Way' almost feels like a climactic plateau of Gaga's entertaining and provocative bizarre-ness, though it isn't bad.  The deluxe version does a good job, of creating a good list of songs that you can just listen to.  Though to be all honest the album doesn't have the same replay value that 'The Fame' or 'The Fame Monster' has (of course that could be because I am in a Britney Spears mood as of late)    As I am reviewing this there are 4 singles, the two standard pre-release, 'Born This Way' and 'Judas' and then the two post release 'The Edge of Glory' and 'Yoü and I.'  Which are 4 of the best tracks on the album.  Definitely playing to the albums strongest tracks, and if you like those songs, I recommend that if you haven't purchased the album yet get it.  The only other song that I would put into single form is 'Hair' but that is just me.    Now lets talk bonus, there is a plethora of bonus content in this version compared to the standard version.  Three original songs, as well as an entire disc for remixes.  Now I am not one for remixes, especially when they clock in twice as long as the original song, and there are a few that do this.  If anything get the deluxe version for the 3 bonus tracks, they are well worth it.    All in all, if you are one of the few people who haven't bought it, and are wondering whether you should based on the singles, I would recommend it.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|The beats are orgasmic, the lyrics are unique and new, unlike any other generic pop song. They go under the surface, and each song has a different mood and feel. The guitar, the piano, the screaming. This is the album of the decade.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Lady Gaga was brilliant when it came to making Born This Way. I love this song so much because it has a meaning for the world not to just one person. Instead of the Star Spangled Banner being the national anthem it is now Born This Way. Maybe we should start singing it at important events. The special edition totally rocks!
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This has to be her best album of the year, all the songs are fresh and unique. Everybody buy this album if you love Gaga or good pop music.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I watched the cartoons when I was a kid.  I loved them!  I was so excited to see them \\"come to life\\" again!  The movie was great, a must own!  My family loved it!  Ahhh, the memories.  Hope theres more to come!  My two year old is still singing La La La La La La sing a happy song!
B000G7PMD2|2.0|The EQ/Mastering for this disc is very poor.  The songs, although well performed lack bite and sound dull, lifeless and flat.  Listening to the opening song (Root Of All Evil) I found the drums to be less than thunderous yet the air horn/alarm noise is up front and louder than the rest of the band.  When the entire band kicks in it becomes a flat EQ/compressed mess of sound.  This continutes for the entire 3 disc set.  Also, I am not impressed with the orchestra.  Out of tune and did not mesh well with the band.  Too bad beacuse I have seen the DVD of this show and it was very impressive (first set).  I also did not like how they cut out LaBrie's in between song comments.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This album is fantastic. It's not the same music of 'The Fame' and 'The Fame Monster'. This time Gaga used breathtaking lyrics and powerful instruments. If you haven't hear it yet, I recommend you this album!
B004XWMXX8|5.0|I like this album a lot! It seems like every album Selena makes gets better & better. Selena really shines a lot on this album. It has an even more dance pop vibe to it. My top 5 favorite songs are: bang, bang, bang, when the sun goes down, outlaw, whiplash, & hit the lights. the whole album is awesome from beginning to end. I hope Selena will release hit singles / videos of the favorites i mention soon. She is a good role model for young women and i hope she continues to make more music. she has a good singing voice.
0316069884|4.0|Awesome read.  These issues need to be discussed irregardless if one is vegetarian or not.  Foer makes the read entertaining while still remaining informative and authentic about his concern.
0061537969|5.0|Most touching and tenderest book I've read in awhile.  After the first 10 pages, I just couldn't put it down.  Well worth reading from any age group.
B0054N73EY|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers not only released an all around great album but took music to a whole new level.Other reviews previously written from other fans basically explain to you in more detail just how great this album is.I can't honestly say this is there best work to date but its up there in the Top Five Albums.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|When will the people who gave this Blu-Ray set (which HASN'T been released yet) alot of flack get the point?    George Lucas is a visonary filmmaker.  All he's doing is show his vision of his films that he had all the way back in the 1970s.  This entire saga is like cooking, it needs some more spice in it.  It's like painting, it needs a couple of dabs painted on.      I'm somewhat of a fan who likes to see some little changes in films.  BTW, THAT'S the key word I can discribe with the changes in these films: little.  Not major, not big, not masive.  This isn't the 30th anniversary version of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" for crying out loud.  It doesn't have an extra subplot made decades after the film was originally released, and it doesn't have a different film score.    Anyway, I'm A-Okay with the changes as long as it doesn't interfere with the most important thing in this entire saga: THE STORY.    I'm also okay with Vader screaming \\"No\\" as he's about to bring Palpatine to his end, and I completely understand why Lucas did it.  He lost his mother, he lost his wife, and he was about to lose his sone at the hands of this man whom he trusted since he was 10 years old.  What I'm saying is, \\"complainers and 1-2 star voters, think before you speak.\\"    Honestly, this is getting very tiring and pointless as every Kardashian show ever made.

B000HKYBXA|5.0|I watched this movie while reading Hamlet for a Literature class. It is Shakespeare: word for word. I made an A on that test. Awesome way to study!
B0055EDBIE|5.0|If your a die hard lenny kravitz fan you will find a million reasons to love this new album from him because it not only rocks but its just classic feel good music from Lenny.I have enjoyed majority of his work except for a few albums which were questionable but other than those this album is just amazing.No matter who you are and wherever you live you will appreciate this album so I recommend picking yourself up a copy of this one.

B005JN988I|5.0|Doctor Who just keeps getting better!!!  I can't wait for the next episode.  It will be my first task on Sunday to grab it here.
B005COO1X6|5.0|uncle stevie at the top of his game.  only one downer. kindle version slightly annoying because last 20 percent of this book is an unfortunate preview of his upcoming novel.  he should stick to writing more stuff like 81 or a sequel to salems lot.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|if your gonna do all these changes at least put the Original Theatrical Versions on blue ray short selling everyone on this
B0051OZ564|3.0|There are a lot of great things about this movie but also many bad.  The ending just sucked and that pretty much blew it for me.  It makes me sad this movie was awesome in parts, the twists and turns got me interested but if you've seen Skyline and thought the end was weak then is even worse :(    I can't mark it too low.  There is some great action and three stories in one but a max of 3 stars is all I could give it.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I love this album!  I especially love the song Born This Way, because it encourages me to have pride, face and overcome my fears, and remember that I was born this way, baby!
B000FC13MM|5.0|My copy of Garth Nix's Sabriel has been with me since it was first published in the United States, and it certainly looks that old, for it has been very well-read!  A bit of water damage from an unknown source, some faded pages, and a spine that shows just how often it has been opened.  But this is a book that I keep near me - whenever I move or travel to a new place, it is one of the first things I pack.  My favorite book, one that has a very special place in my heart as one of my very first encounters with proper fantasy as a child.  It is a story that can be read over an over again, and you can still find something new every time.<br /><br />As a young adult reading it for the first time, you will find an amazing adventure and, as necessary for every great hero, an innocent love story.  As a teenager, you will find Sabriel to be a young woman you can relate to, a character you can see yourself in as you struggle to find your place in the world just as she does.  And as an adult, you can see Nix's wit and great intelligence on every page, giving you a novel with such depth that you can't help but laugh and cry right along with the characters you come to know so well.<br /><br />Nix has created here a classic tale of high fantasy that is so rare to find nowadays, and one that truly showcases the author's incredible talent.  Sabriel is definitely worth a read.  After all, who doesn't love a good story of fantasy and adventure?
014241722X|1.0|Grisham should stick to writing for adults. Theo is an unrealistic teen from a cardboard family. All they live for is being or becoming lawyers. Even their dog is named Judge and their entertainment is watching old Perry Mason reruns. Really?? The plot is plodding, never thrilling, crammed with long paragraphs explaining the legal system. One character named Omar is supposed to be scary but he never makes a move. The presumed murderer isn't even scary. The ending is flat. Nothing is at stake for Theo, and after a few chapters, the reader doesn't care anymore. Grisham should read some books for kids to understand you need to hook them early and keep the pressure on with page-turning excitement. This book does none of that.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I had heard nothing about this movie, all I can say is WOW!!! One of the best movies I've seen in many years.  It's a real thriller, it had me and my wife on the edge of our seats.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Reading the other reviews, I see disagreement about which is better, Planet Earth, or Life. Planet Earth is the more comprehensive, but Life takes the opportunity to zero in on some especially fascinating examples of the animal kingdom. This is quite simply the most gripping and spectacular nature series I have ever seen. If you must choose between Planet Earth and Life, your decision could very well hinge on how big you would like your nature library to be. If you don't care whether or not you get the most complete coverage of all wildlife, and are happy to get the most intense thrills with the least number of discs, Life could be your better choice.<br /><br />The videography knocks your socks off. I've never seen CGI or special effects as spectacular as what the film crew has been able to catch from real life. One sequence of crabs walking on the ocean floor reminded me of the huge machines on stilts from The Empire Strikes Back--I half expected the John Williams score to enter; but I guess that would have been too obvious.<br /><br />The musical soundtrack, ominous to whimsical, goes beyond the routine to become a treat in itself.<br /><br />Attenborough's writing and narration hit just the right tone, darkly dramatic to humorous. The facts dazzle in their own right: did you know that coral, yes the stuff of which the reefs are made, actually come to life and fight (eat) each other at night?<br /><br />And, as if the programs themselves weren't amazing enough, the \\"On Location,\\" behind-the-scenes bonus material left me in absolute awe.<br /><br />It is true that there is, in a general sort of way, some redundancy between Life & Planet Earth; however, almost all the actual footage is different in Life; and I believe that those who own, or have seen, Planet Earth, will find enough new in Life to make it worthwhile, and indeed almost essential.
1609611543|5.0|This extraordinary book will explain how the bread in the Old Testament, the bread scattered throughout human history, even the bread your grandma made for the family; isn't what we are eating today as \\"bread.\\" Not only is the wheat a distant genetic relative, but industrial food processes have put it in EVERYTHING.<br /><br />We are not eating the backbone of the agricultural revolution. We are eating its Frankenstein's monster.<br /><br />With history and self-experimentation and case histories and lots of well explained science, Dr. Davis lays out his experience, and his contention: that every single human will experience health improvement by giving up modern wheat. In a fascinating chapter, he even explains why we find it so difficult to \\"live without bread.\\" It has natural morphine-like qualities that makes us act like any sick and despairing junkie!<br /><br />Even though this book just came out, I have been reading Dr. Davis' blog for almost a year. I came from years of happy low carbing. But it was his writing that eliminated my occasional \\"cheats\\" with wheat products. I went totally gluten free.<br /><br />I didn't expect much of anything... I'd already lost sixty pounds and kept it off, gotten the blood sugar & triglyceride & blood pressure improvements, and was sleeping well with better moods.<br /><br />But I got my world rocked all over again.<br /><br />By completely eliminating all grains, I lost ten more pounds without even trying. My rosacea, dwindled but still subject to flareups, now told me what had been causing the flareups; it was wheat and their accompanying seed oils.  People spontaneously started saying, \\"What did you do? You look great!\\"<br /><br />And I was someone who wasn't eating wheat much at all. Dr. Davis is right.<br /><br />After all the genetic manipulations of recent decades, it's no longer the \\"staff of life.\\" It's poison.
0061784788|5.0|James Rollins does another great job of crafting a suspense/thriller and continuing to build up his characters. One of my favorites yet.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I bought this book for a summer beach trip but made the mistake of picking it up 2 days before we left.  Needless to say I was finished before I stepped foot on the beach.  I was wary of the storyline at first but the plot held my interest completely.   I tend to figure out twists in books and movies before they happen so when a book can surprise me I appreciate that.
B004G8QTS4|5.0|I have to preface this review by saying that I am a huge fan of Don Winslow. I've read most of his stuff, including his earlier works when he was formulating his style and not yet the writer he is today. His past few books have been as close to perfect as one can get and this latest doesn't disappoint. What I enjoy most is the way he handles narration, using a mixture of bravado and street jargon reminiscent of Elmore Leonard. This latest story brings back Boone Daniels from The Dawn Patrol. If you enjoyed that one, you'll love this one as well. Daniels is a great character, and the story is solid with a few nice twists. Doesn't hurt that it's set in San Diego, my hometown. Definite recommendation from me.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I've seen every Jane Eyre movie made and this one is my favorite one so far.  It is fabulous.  If you haven't seen a Jane Eyre movie, this one might be a little confusing the first time around, but once you know the story line, you will thoroughly enjoy it. It was creative, the scenery was beautiful, and the music score was wonderful. The story line stayed true to the book, which I always enjoy.
B000Q67876|5.0|I've seen a few Stephen King adaptations to movies and I have to say that I have been underwhelmed thinking perhaps his novels do not translate well to film until I saw this.  I thought the storyline of \\"The Shining\\" was really stupid but I managed to still enjoy watching it because of the brilliance of Stanley Kubrick who somehow managed to make my eyes addicted to watching the film not for the storyline but for the wonderful images we get to watch courtesy of the Kubrick genius.  I detected some Kubrick influences here like the scene of the soaring overhead view of the prison near the beginning which has its parallel in the beginning of \\"The Shining\\" but overall as a film with a great script, great casting and great directing of a Stephen King story this has to be the best one ever.  Is there any film that is better at extolling the virtues of hope over incredible odds or how good finally triumphs over evil?  This Blu Ray release has excellent picture quality although there were a few frames with the odd white spot here and there but overall thankfully this doesn't overly distract from the enjoyment of the film.  The sound quality is also very well done making this together with the very well put-together digibook format among the best blu-ray releases that I've ever seen.<br /><br />Great script, great acting, great storytelling makes this film a must-see and this blu ray release the definitive version to have in your video library.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Wow. It is very difficult to comprehend all the haters out there. I should say that I read a lot of reviews that severely criticized this movie. However, I didn't read one review that was written by a journalist that had any comprehension of the history of Green Lantern. Most of the formal reviews I read gave me the impression of writers who were very impressed by their own subversive scribblings more than anything else. I've also met a few journalist in my time and boy were they FULL of themselves. Every single person I spoke to who saw the movie, and there were many, were very clear that they thought it was fantastic. I believe that if there hadn't been such a negative journalistic campaign undermining this movie then probably a lot more people would have been curious to see it. In any case Green Lantern was an exhilarating transfer of genuine comic fun and action to the big screen. Very impressive, well acted, everyone involved looked like they were having a good time. The producers/director captured the spirit of the characters and the universe exceptionally well. I urge people to open their minds and indulge in some excellent comic/cosmic adventure in the form of Green Lantern the movie.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Born This Way definitely in the album of the decade. Unlike most albums today that have collaborations of modern day, current artists; Gaga has taken legends of the past and brought them back. With saxophone pieces from Clarence Clemons and guitar instrumentals from Brian May, this is definitely an album you need to consider buying. It has an 80's sort of vibe, although it is very becoming. Gaga has once again changed pop music with this album, and it is my favorite album I own. This is a purchase you  won't regret!
B004WOJ9E8|5.0|After listening to just the first two tracks on this Album, i was Floored. it totally blew my mind. The level of Musical Proficiency that this Band has is Incredible. Michael Romeo is a Genius. The Guitar lines that he plays are Darn near Impossible. The Arrangements are simply Brilliant. This is Power Metal at it's Finest. Russel Allen's Vocals are simply amazing, Very Reminiscent of Ronnie James Dio. This is by far and away one of the most Provocative and Compelling Albums i have heard in years. Don't waste another Minute. Go out and buy this Album today.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is going to be a quick, easy, and painless review. Nothing too wordy, from a film lover who loves all the Star Wars films...  The best thing about this blu ray release is the sound! The sound will blow you away!!  You get 4 cinematic masterpieces (A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and Revenge of the Sith)  The old trilogy looks great, even though there is a slight hint of grain whenever you see the sky. That must be the film stock though. A New Hope looks so good I gave away my limited edition theatrical version on DVD. Who gives a crap who shot who first, this HD is amazing!! Plus the Han/Greedo scene is improved and feels slightly more ruthless than the Special Edition on DVD.  I don't care about the changes. I like Vader saying \\"No.\\" It makes sense because he has regained his humanity.  You get 2 fun and entertaining films (Phantom Menace, and Attack of the Clones)  Phantom Menace is the most improved film here, blowing the DVD transfer out the water and replacing the rubber looking Yoda with CGI Yoda, fixing continuity with the other prequels. I felt as if I was watching this film for the first time. Magical.  The bonus disc that covers the original trilogy is awesome.  However not all the deleted scenes have high replay value  one deleted scene from A New Hope is worth checking out and should have made the final cut, the Toshi Station scene. Great character development here!!!  one deleted scene from Empire Strikes Back is worth checking out and should have made the final cut, the scene showing Luke and Leia almost sharing a very deep and passionate kiss after he was rescued by Han. This scene would have made it a completely different movie!!!  Three deleted scenes from Return of the Jedi should have made the final cut, one showing Vader telepathically calling Luke as he creates his new light saber, the sand storm scene had good character development and shows Luke's wounded hand from rescuing Han, and a scene where Vader strangles anofficer who says the Palpatine doesn't want to see anyone.  All the new overviews and interviews were great.  Bonus disc for Prequels is great too, EVEN THOUGH DELETED SCENES FROM DVD EDITION WERE NOT INCLUDED, SO HOLD ONTO YOUR BONUS DISCS!!!!!!!!!!!  New deleted scenes for Phantom Menace all sucked, completely worthless  Two new deleted scenes for Attack of the Clones were great, one dealing with Dooku's origin and another dealing with Anakin losing his memory of his mother. Should have been included in the final cut of film!!!!! Great character development!  One new deleted scene for Revenge of the Sith was great, dealing with Palaptine further seducing Anakin into the dark side. Should have been included in the final cut of film!!!!! Great character development!  All the new overviews and interviews for prequels were great.  Bonus disc with documentaries and spoofs was a mixed bag, especially if you own the awesome \\"Empire of Dreams\\" documentary from the dvd release. All the docs for the old trilogy didn't cover anything new that \\"Empire of Dreams\\" did and were boring. If you haven't seen Empire of Dreams you should, otherwise you might like these docs.  Spoofs was the best thing about this disc, freaking hilarious!!!  Star Wars Gadgets doc on technology was okay. i'd never watch it again.  documentary on the 501st was okay, i'd never watch it again  Empire strikes back 30 years later was the best Doc but not essential, it's hard to top Empire of Dreams in my eyes.  The only bad thing to this set is...  The case flat out SUCKS!! Don't like sliding my disc in and out of sleeves, even if blu rays are more scratch resistant, i don't care...  I used my old DVD cases and switched out the DVD's with the Blu rays. Feels more secure and guarantee to not get scratched!  So, this is a great set, just switch the cases with your dvd set and keep your bonus disc from the dvd's!!!  I wouldn't buy this set for the list price of $140.   Amazon price is okay, $80, but I got it for $70 used. If I were to put a value on it I'd say that's about right. 10 bucks each film and 5 for each bonus disc...

B00008G9JM|5.0|A Passion Play is one of those real `love it or hate it' albums that can get really bitter critiques and really impassioned defenses at the same time. The record is essentially a very long and interesting song, a song about death and the afterlife from several different perspectives with a mixture of humor, clever observation and inventive lyrics.<br /><br />This was the band's sixth studio album and had the unenviable task of following up the pair of unstoppable classic albums Aqualung and Thick As A Brick. Historically the album has not only been seen as inferior to both, but altogether as a step too far. It can be seen as too pretentious, overambitious and the sound of a band disappearing up their own backsides. If you have ever disliked an album because it was too pretentious, then stay away!<br /><br />I am in the camp that sees it as a masterpiece. The album is a bastion of superb musicianship, powerful creativity and features some of singer Ian Anderson's finest ever vocal performances. The piece is split into two tracks, into four movements, into sixteen sections. Some CD versions will let you skip between the sixteen individual sections while some will feature only the two tracks to replicate the two sides of the original vinyl. There are recurring themes, from funereal piano sections, to the hard rock riffs of `Critique Oblique,' and `The Memory Bank,' to the ghostly twinkling of `Forest Dance' and `Life Beats.'<br /><br />The standard of musicianship, performance and complexity is unmatched by anything else in the bands career except the similarly structured Thick As A Brick record (possibly the best album of all time) and this is a record you can really fall deeply in love with, absorbing every little nuance and detail.<br /><br />The album expands even further if you listen to their next album `War Child' and their `Night Cap' collection, which shows all the various directions the band could have taken with the material they had written at the time, possibly making a film like Pink Floyd's The Wall, the inclusion of many now omitted Animal themes etc.<br /><br />Overall; The idea of one, incredibly dense, heavy and solo filled song may seem a little too intimidating and the inclusion of sax parts may not fit with your ideal vision of the Tull sound. If not, this may not be the album for you. If however you like the heavier parts of the Tull sound and are up for a challenging but rewarding grower of an album that unveils more and more creativity with each listen, then pick up a copy of A Passion Play.oyd's The Wall, the inclusion of many now omitted Animal themes etc.    Overall; The idea of one, incredibly dense, heavy and solo filled song may seem a little too intimidating and the inclusion of sax parts may not fit with your ideal vision of the Tull sound.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|The real George Lucas died many years ago in a galaxy not so far away. He was then replaced by a clone George Lucas. Sometime in the early to mid 1990's, the clone Lucas received a holographic message from Palpatine. \\"It is time Mr. Lucas,\\" Palpatine said, \\"execute order 66.\\" The clone then looked into the hologram and said \\"It will be done my lord.\\" And starting in 1997 we received the special edition vhs tapes, followed by three prequels.....then 2004 special edition dvds and now.............the complete saga. The circle is now complete, STAR WARS IS DEAD.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|I have really enjoyed Kevin Smith's movies since I first saw Clerks when it came out, but this was another beast entirely.  This movie is his opus.  I can say no more other than this is his greatest film to date and proof of his ability to comment on the state of things today.  Thank you for the first rate edutainment Mr. Smith.

B0000AYL16|5.0|I won't blather on and on about how awesome Frampton Comes Alive is - that has been done with vinyl, cassette, CD, and now SACD releases.  It's simply the best live concert recording EVER!    My only complaint comes about packaging of this disc set.  Why spread both Stereo and Surround tracks over two discs?  The simple plan should have been to put the Stereo mix on one SACD and the Surround mix on the other.  I want to cue this up in my player, sit back, and listen to Frampton Comes Alive! all the way through.  With this set split over 2 discs as it is I have to swap discs midway through the performance.
B005F9TQ9C|1.0|When this album was released 40 years ago, I was still a Dylan fan, although I liked his first three LP's, the folk/protest period, better than the rock or even the country style he had progressed to. However, the reviews were so uniformly negative, I did not purchase this double set. Last week I found the CD in my local music store for four bucks, and decided it was time to give it a spin. Not everyone on it is forgettable, but about 20 of the 24 tracks give a listener no reason to hear them twice. The best thing on it is his version of Lightfoot's \\"Early Morning Rain.\\" Some of the others are ridiculous, some just tedious, many are carelessly tossed off as if the artist thought his fans would buy anything with his name on it. Bob is a songwriter, who, at his best, can write lyrics that even other people can perform successfully. But he cannot be successful singing other people's lyrics. This proves it. Save your money. I'm giving this CD to a charity garage sale next week. For really timeless Dylan, get his debut record, and a greatest hits volume one, and a bootleg live concert from the mid-60's.
0061537969|3.0|I found the book engrossing and inventive and enjoyable, but there is a key flaw: Enzo has awareness and intelligence, yet because he cannot use spoken words, he doesn't intervene. Why is this? Remember Charlotte and Templeton? Why doesn't Enzo scratch out words in the dirt or place Tinker Toys into words on the carpet? Enzo can bark twice for \\"faster\\" but he can't pull down an anatomy book and put his paw on \\"Malignant Tumor\\" and use the other paw to point to Denny's wife? He manages to vomit as an act of defiance, but that seemed pointless (and dangerous). This is a major flaw in the book: The author gives him sentience and compassion but he limits his ability to act. Enzo loved Denny and his family, and Enzo had the sensibilities of a human, but he doesn't use creative or even simple tools to let everyone know that he \\"gets it.\\"    The only theory I can concoct is that the author feels there is an unwritten \\"prime directive\\" in the dog world, that dogs cannot intervene to change the course of human lives, that it is the dog's job to observe and care but not to act, even in dire situations (presumably he would have pulled the daughter out of the path of a car but he wouldn't have told the pediatrician that the vaccination was going to kill her). The author implies Enzo is not the ONLY dog with these gifts, yet other dogs seem banal or invisible. So Enzo is special, he's a \\"pre-human\\" but for whatever reason he can't communicate with this owner he loves so much, other than in limited dog terms. Can Enzo read?     I did enjoy the book, except for the hopelessly treacly ending, which smacks of Richard Bach and Nicholas Sparks and other authors whose names and work I try not to conjure.
B0055D3EOG|1.0|If you want a movie that is a waste of your time..watch this one. There are two or three scare parts and the rest of the movie is horrible. Dont wast your money on this movie.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|As many know Kevin Smith is (for now) \\"walking away\\" from making movies in the coming years. He has one more movie in the hopper to make. His last movie will be a hockey movie called \\"Hit Somebody\\" that will take place over two movies. Red State however, is proof he can make a serious movie. As with any Smith movie there is a LOT of dialogue. Michael Parks goes on a good bit preaching and while it may seem to go on forever. Actually listen to the content because it where they are coming from and why they do what they are doing. Park was OUTSTANDING in this movie and should get some recognition. The camera was not a typical Kevin Smith movie either. The way Red State is show is very fitting for the atmosphere.    I have no idea why some reviewers (not necessarily here) are saying the movie is inconsistent. Sadly they are laying a stereotype on Kevin Smith because of past movies or his \\"stoner\\" ways. Because he openly talks about it why or how does that reflect on his ability to make a movie? Some of these critics need learn to wipe the slate clean with each movie because a movie maker can grow. Look at Peter Jackson! He went from Dead Alive to having the Lord of the Rings fall into his hands. Give this movie a chance when you can.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|So unlike many other Star Wars fans, I wasn't greatly bothered by the changes made in the 2004 DVD release. Disappointing as they were, they were too minor to ruin such otherwise great movies for me (although the CGI sarlacc was really dumb). However, this release is an entirely different matter. One of the best scenes in Film history where Darth Vader is finally redeemed is completely ruined by the insertion of Darth Vader yelling \\"NOOOO\\" several times. It messes up the entire suspense of the scene and turns it into nothing but a joke. I don't want the next generation to grow up watching this version which why I urge everyone to rate this set 1 star. Casual fans of the series or parents looking to buy this for their kids need to know that this is not the version to go with.     On the other hand however, I look forward to watching the Blu-ray prequels. Apart from the replacement of the Yoda puppet, they have been left unaltered.
B00006CJOY|5.0|By pure accident, I saw this Band on PBC a few months ago.  Loved the music; Loved<br />the energy.  I thought, at first, the group was Manu Chao because that was the title showing on the screen.  After searching on the internet, I learned the name of the Singer/Leader, was Manu Chao.  All of the words are in Spanish and I do not speak<br />nor understand Spanish. However, I think music can speak to us in one form or another.  So, I am clearly a fan.  Maybe you will be too!  Take a chance to enjoy<br />this group.
B004LWZW42|5.0|The original 3 movies never felt right. Between the acting, uninspired story, and the terribly sterile design (God I hated the look of those movies) of the sets and costumes(some of which oddly is seen on the cover of this DVD - that cool drab blue mirrory thing annoys me), they were rendered very forgettable. The Wolverine movie was about as bad as the third X-men movie, also forgettable.     This movie is what the series should have been all along. You really feel the characters. The costumes are better, the characters are more interesting, and the story is more engaging. Magneto's helmet doesn't look like a molded plastic toy, it's actually red. The chief villain is far more obviously sinister. Finally an X-Men movie that lives up to the myth of the comics.     Looking forward to sequels, and maybe even a retelling of the modern storylines that doesn't include everyone dying.
B0045NXMMQ|4.0|`Micmacs' is a quirky and yet strangely beautiful French film.<br /><br />Following a group of homeless people with a variety of unusual skills, we see them plan and carry out their own unique brand of revenge on a pair of arms manufacturers with often hilarious results.<br /><br />As others have mentioned this film is shot with soft light and it is also infused with a certain sense of humour.  I love the little touches like when a car drives by the exact same scene was portrayed on a billboard above them as an advert.  Small and silly, but it shows the attention to detail.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple, but completely engaging and everyone acts their roles very well.  It does feel VERY French at times and if you enjoy French film then this should be right up your street.<br /><br />This has quite a gentle pace to it and I found it enjoyable enough and whilst it isn't as amazing as some 5 star reviews make out, it isn't nearly as dire as others have said either.  It is a stylised piece of film making, with a decent story and decent acting and made for an entertaining evenings viewing.  I'd say it's at least worth a go.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I cannot endorse this revision of history any longer.  I am truly sorry I bought the DVD's. This is a turning point for me.  I've bought all of them.  Every version on every video format. I don't even like the Special Editions and I bought them in 2006 just to have the crappy laserdisc port of the originals.  Never again.  Even if they release the unaltered films at this point I'm not sure I could even get behind it again just because of what this company has done to it's fanbase.
B0058H8V6K|5.0|This album really surprised me, very catchy songs. Her voice sounds great and some fantastic dance beats. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes pop.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Totally worth the $2.99. I play this game on my Motorolla Xoom so I can work with a bigger screen. Loads of fun, and quite challenging at higher levels. Great to pass the time for a few minutes.. or longer. :D
B003PIUBZS|1.0|One of the absolute worst biopics I've had the misfortune to view (and purchase). Written by someone with waaaaay too much testosterone and addiction to video game mania, this Spartacus could have been of value. It IS nice to look at but spends waaay too much time displaying boobs, butts and buckets of blood. Totally unrealistic in its gore and sensuality; the characters spew F bombs and bathroom terminology at every opportunity. Most annoying to a former English teacher is the anachronistic use of terminology displayed in the very first scene and then frequently throughout. \\"Come on\\" the guy in the crowd yells. I don't think so. Spartacus promises to \\"continue this discussion at a future time\\" - uh, uh --- don't think so on this one either. What happened to editors; and editors who understood context and anachronism? This series even features women in the crowd scenes with boobs prominently displayed. Seems no one kept their girls in during this period of history.<br />There are too many errors and irregularities to mention here. I suppose every teenage boy will find suitable titillation and gratification in this series. Too bad; I expected more. This writer and director must know someone with $$$ to burn. The actors are poorly served by the script, the effects and the inconsistencies.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Outstanding series.  Just couldn't figure out the 4th season until I got the first.  It came before schedule, in very good shape.  All in all a a very good seller.
B005COO1X6|4.0|This is a pretty good short story. It's classic King, in which you know something bad is going to happen, but can't help but watch as characters meet their demise at the hands of a very peculiar enemy. It is a fairly quick read 20-30 minutes for most readers, but you'll be entertained the whole way.   The only reason it doesn't get a full 5 stars is because i find it a little irritating that King feels he has to insert contemporary cultural references as if to show he's still relevant (he mentions Justin Bieber, Ipads, Words with Friends, etc).   We know you're a top notch writer Stevie, no need to go at lenghts to show that you know what's \\"cool\\" and relevant today.
B0059R5Q08|4.0|I have seen this film twice.<br /><br />First Viewing:<br /><br />I am a die hard Jane Eyre fan and have seen almost every movie version of this story. The first time that I saw this movie, I was very disappointed. I think I was bias because I love the 2006 and 1985(Timothy Dalton) version so much. I can't quite put my finger on what was wrong. The acting was good...the cinematography was gorgeous...but it was lacking something. There are some scenes that were amazing and worth seeing (Scene where Rochester comes clean about his wife and begs Jane to stay with him). They had to cram a lot in a 2 hour movie and I think that is what hurt it. Her years at school are cut short and the Helen Burns story is almost non existent. The love story happened to fast. It was like Jane meets Mr. Rochester and BAM their in love. The movie would have been a lot better if they had been given more time to tell the story and if Jane had showed more emotion (After my second viewing, I changed my mind about this). The movie is different from all the other versions because it is told in flashback and not in the order of the book. I thought that was creative, but it was like watching a documentary and not a love story. Perhaps the audience was only seeing Jane's most important memories. Not sure.<br /><br />Second Viewing<br /><br />I have to say that it is much better than I remembered. I compare my initial reaction to this movie to the way I felt about Kiera Knightley's Pride and Prejudice.  I hated that movie the first time I watched it, but have grown fond of it on later viewings.  Both movies suffer from the same symptom, to much storyline crammed into 2 hours.  Michael and Mia did an excellent job with the script that they were given.  At first, I was frustrated because Mia rarely shows Jane's feelings for Rochester until the marriage proposal. On second viewing, this makes more sense to me.  I mean this is a character that grew up in a all girl's school and is unaccustomed to men or flirting.  It was actually kinda of funny because you see Rochester trying to flirt/make not-so-subtle romantic overtures to Jane and she is confused/doesn't know how to react to his behavior. Very believable. I recommend watching it a couple of times before deciding whether you like it or not.inda of funny because you see Rochester trying to flirt/make not-so-subtle romantic overtures to Jane and she is confused/doesn't know how to react to his behavior.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I was not born till 79 so i didnt see these movies in the theater. I just recently got into bluray and love seeing old movies looking better than i've ever seen them before, but... i want to see the old movies the way they were. the way they were originaly made! The point is to make old movies look like new. Not to make a new movie. Sorry George but you could defintly learn something from Speilburg. Just bought Close Encounters of the Third Kind which included the theatrical release, the directors cut, and extended edition. I was so excited when i heard about the original trilogy being released on bluray, but after reading the reviews about no theatrical release. i think i will pass

B000LQE6UI|1.0|I was considering buying this because the image showed the original cover and the descriptor indicated that it is subtitled - both facts leading me to believe that I'd be purchasing the original, not the dubbed version. I'm glad I read the reviews which advised otherwise. What's of greater concern, however, is that the first review pointing out this problem was written in 2005, and the most recent in 2011. So, 6 years of feedback to Amazon about this inaccurate information and still no change. Thanks to those of you who set me straight.
B003ZHQVJO|3.0|As a person who absolutely loves Kid Rock, I was extremely disappointed with this CD. It was nothing like his past CD's, very mellow, more country feel to it. The product its self came well packaged and made a good gift. But Kid Rock could have done better on this one!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|All I can say is that with all of the changes George Lucas has made to these films over the years, these are no longer the movies I fell in love with as a kid. I don't understand why it is so hard to give the fans what they want. Just give us the theatrical cuts of the original trilogy and also offer the altered editions for those who are interested. I guess I could rant and rave as some others have, but the truth is I am just too heartbroken over this to put too much time and energy into it.

B0055FR5PS|5.0|Great movie,  lots of action,  loved the characters.  I agree with another reviewer,  if you liked Independence Day you will like this movie.  Same kick ass spirit, not the same comedic content, it is strictly an action movie, but well worth watching.

B004SUDQ4U|5.0|I'll avoid the temptation to give a lengthy, specific detailed review of this movie.  Simply stated, this is arguably the greatest submarine war film ever made. It is impossible to overpraise or hype a film of this stature. In truth, one of the greatest war movies ever made and it can be watched over and over and never get boring. A true MASTERPIECE!!!
B00004XQ83|5.0|I purchased this music for my Uncle, and he absolutely loves it.  He had seen the movie and mentioned that he wanted the music trac.  I went on line and ordered it for him and he is so very happy.
B005BZQVJ8|1.0|I didn't find this movie all that funny because it has the maturity level of a 16 yr-old. I just can't connect with a little green man because it is just plain dumb. The makers of this movie managed to inject an opportunistic, self-serving smear of Christians... or all religion for that matter. It took away from the movie and the comments prove that. I choose to be a believer and found the smearing of religion a bit insulting. So I suppose that makes me close-minded... big deal - I wouldn't have liked the movie if the religion smear was left out. So I could dislike a movie for any number of reasons and would not be labeled close-minded... To be sure, are people who did not like \\"Heaven's Gate\\" close-minded? I'm only close-minded if I don't like the PART of the movie where creationism is just dismissed out of hand. So when I think back about the movie, that is about the only thing that sticks with me. I feel it was just uneccessary - but the movie wasn't that great to begin with. I believe people should not be distracted by the religious part of the movie and go ahead and watch, let the athiest have their day. Make up your own mind. If you believe your ancestors were apes, monkies, or a hippo, you will have no problem with this movie. If you believe in creationism, be prepared to possibly be offended. Just don't let it get to you because it is a dumb movie to begin with that revolves around a little green man. And when it comes to little green men, call me an athiest.
030788743X|3.0|I picked up this book because I am a bit geeky.  I like all the stuff this book is about - computers, games, comics, junk like that.  And the book isn't bad at all, really.  Neat story, neat idea (sort of like Snow Crash without the satire/tongue-in-cheek humor.  I want to let everybody know that I like this book, and will likely reread it in a few years.  I am going to point out a couple of things that bogged the book down, and at times made me want to stop reading.<br /><br />First, this book panders to nerds.  That isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but you get the feeling very quickly that they are in there just so that nerds reading can think \\"HAH, I GET IT!\\" And instead of just throwing them in there so that people into nerd culture get them, he explains every single one.  So not only do you immediately recognize the references, but then you get to sit there as he explains them anyway.  If you're not completely turned on by having things you know about name dropped and then explained, this will bog down the story.  Oh, Family Ties is a TV show from the 80's? Glad you explained it.  Thanks.<br /><br />Secondly, there are two types of nerds.  Generally decent guys and girls with nerdy hobbies, and then anti-social, smug, condescending, pseudo intellectual nerds who are incredibly unpleasant to be around.  These are, in popular vernacular, known as \\"Monvilles\\".  Sometimes the author veers very, very close to outing himself as a Monville.  A perfect example is that he includes a long, out of place rant about how he's atheist (he's speaking through the protagonist, but it is clear he wanted to rant against religion and used his protagonist as the mouthpiece) in the first chapter.  He even includes \\"Deal with it\\" during this rant.  It's out of place, silly, and I could see reading it on a message board, but here it's awkwardly inserted so that the author can say \\"I'm atheist...deal with it!\\"<br /><br />Then there are a couple of parts that deal with working as technical support...and these are even worse.  I've worked tech support jobs before, and they are incredibly frustrating.  However, Cline uses these instances to show just how smug and unlikable he would be in real life.  He has such utter contempt for anybody who dares spend their time doing something other than learning about computers.  The people who need tech support are all halfwitted, slobbering subhumans who refuse to \\"think for themselves\\" and need a nerd (who is, of course, incredibly smart) to show them the way.  He wastes a ton of time ranting against the people who call into technical support.  Cline has said he worked in tech support, so when you call these places realized bitter, poorly socialized nerds are on the other end, furious with you because you have the audacity to ask questions about computers.<br /><br />Then there is the dialogue.  There are several instances where it becomes clear that Cline isn't very socialized.  The dialogue reads like it was written by somebody who had never had a conversation but was told how they work by somebody who had.  The book is pretty great when it's just the protagonist doing this thing, but when more than one character shows up it gets really bad really quick.  There is one conversation about Swordquest in the book that is truly cringe worthy.  The dialogue is so bad, so forced, and so unnatural that it makes Cline seem autistic.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the book.  I'm not trying to rag on it, I just want other people (who might not be unwashed, unshaven, obese nerds who love to sneer at the plebes) to understand the problems with this book.  I think the really, really geeky will love the parts I've outlined above, but most normals will find them childish and unpleasant.are even worse.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|Wanna watch a series about a guy that cooks and sells \\"meth\\"?<br /><br />No, not really? Me neither.<br /><br />The idea of romanticizing something like \\"meth\\" just didn't do anything for me personally. After multiple friends raved about it to me, I \\"broke\\" down and gave it two episodes to hook me or not. As it turns out, two was more than needed.<br /><br />Despite the seedy backdrop of the series, its still very human, and relevant to modern social situation. Having taken a page from British TV, the cast is comprised of everyday schmos that most people can relate to, and that's what makes this show as entertaining as it is.<br /><br />The plots of the main and sub story are predictably tangled, yet somehow I kept watching and thinking to myself, \\"Ok, now what are you going to do Walter?\\"<br /><br />I recommend!

B005FJ7DOM|5.0|The storyline is based on the journey genre and it works excellent.  The characters all stay in character so their roles are believable.  It is rooted in what would realistically occur if a virus broke out that turned people mad and even worse than mad.  I will not go into further details about the tale.  The cover for this movie nor the title for the movie does justice to what is the actual tale.  Watch it.  It is worth the time.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|I've rented this movie before at the Blockbuster down the street but the past couple of times I've gone to look for it, the movie hasn't been on the shelves. I don't know if they got rid of it or if someone's rented it out but it's a lovely movie, one beautiful enough to have at home where it's easily accessible. The cinematography is wonderful and the three main actors portray their own stories which intertwine in a believable way. It's also really hilarious.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is really quite sad to see Lucas continues to only listen to his own ego and think fixing things that aren't broken to be just so very important.  Anyone who buys this is only reinforcing his delluded notions that what he is doing is right andc good for the franchise.  From what I've seen, from what many fans have felt and stated quite vocally, this is not the case.  Lucas isn't listening to our words however.  There is only one thing that will get his attention, and that is money.  Vote with your dollars - BOYCOTT IT!
B005F82X48|4.0|I've been a fan of Icon For Hire since a little after \\"The Grey\\" EP came out, thanks to Anvil and the Hammer podcast. I liked the idea of a post-hardcore female-fronted band since as far as I know there isn't another Christian female-fronted post-hardcore band. And if there is I doubt they're as good as the older EPs were.  However, I am slightly disappointed overall with this full-length, mostly with their slight transition to more pop-oriented ground and the rather bad re-doing of the amazing song \\"Pernilla\\". \\"Only A Memory\\" is a great song by itself, but for those who have heard the original \\"Pernilla\\" it's no contest which is better. I understand their screamer/bass player (Josh Davis) is not with the band any more, but if they had gotten a guest appearance like a previous reviewer said, or perhaps one of them had been willing to scream, it would have been better. OR maybe they could have not re-done Pernilla in the first place! Sorry for the rant.  My only other problem other than that re-recording is the fact that they are putting a more synth-pop flavored sound into their music. I didn't at first realize why so many people were saying it sounds like it's been done before, the reason is obvious to me now, as no one is suffering from a lack of female-fronted pop/rock bands like Paramore. I do however still think it's unfair to compare them to the rather dark-sounding Flyleaf or the metal band Fireflight, as they are rather different sylistically. Had Icon For Hire kept their heavier, more post-hardcore-oriented sound, many fewer people would be saying that they have heard this before. Now is this a bad album? No, it is however not as original as this wonderful band could have done. The previous EPs they have released are great, and if you're looking for something that is somewhat fresh and original, but without being too much so, get this. Or if you simply want a great girl-fronted rock/post-hardcore/pop act check this out, in all honesty it really is a stellarrecord, and much better than most of what you'll hear on the radio these days, but if you've come expecting the old Icon For Hire, it may not be too far away, but I will give you a small warning anyway.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas has finally managed to destroy the original trilogy (episodes 4-5) to match the lameness of the later trilogy (episodes 1-3) by having Darth Vader tip his hat to his final move before he makes it. Dear Mr. Lucas, don't you know the impact of the scene is that no one sees it coming? Not anymore. Ruined for all time. I will not buy the blu-rays and I'm ditching the DVDs of was once the best sci-fi fantasy trilogy. Not it's just so much drivel.

B000F9RB9Y|4.0|Did anyone else notice that this is a slightly different cut than the theater version?  Example: There's no shot of Arnold holding the heart at the beginning of the film in the scene with the punks.  Sound is slightly different too - if you pay attention to the scene where Reese is sleeping/remembering in the car - listen to the radio and compare it to the original, it's slightly different, etc., iI's just a slightly different cut.  Is this the Director's version?  I hope so.    Otherwise, still a very decent disk, if you don't get too hung-up about particulars.  And the sound is great too.  Still a classic.
0439023483|5.0|Was skeptical, with hype but after the 3rd chapter couldn't put it down! Finished it in a day. Quick, easy, entertaining read.
B0018OAMPA|5.0|We are huge Star Wars fans and have now made our children, HUGE Star Wars fans.  This set is excellent.  Quite a few modifications from the original movie I saw as a kid in the Walk-In Theaters, but it is to this day quite an amazing movie. Episode V is our favorite.  What a collection, what a series - Super A+.  But I really do think everyone already knows this is a MUST.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee made the right decision when she decided to write this book in her own words. It is a riveting book. I picked it up and couldn't put it back down until it was read. Jaycee writes with sensitivity and intelligence. She shows maturity and remarkable resilience in light of the path that her life took. I am a trained Victim's Advocate and have been involved with domestic violence for years. This is an excellent read for any one who has been a victim of any kind of violence or anyone involved with helping victims of violence! Excellent job, Jaycee!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple and addictive.  Very enjoyable. Buy it.  Its calming and moody and very easy to get in to.  Difficult to master but very addictive.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Dont read what this about in advance and you will have a great time.  I watched it with low expectations because the actor seemed not familiar but I like the moon so I thought I would give it a shot. I ran across trailer by accident. There were nice surprises and twist and turns and I came away thinking. Where has this movie been hiding. Everything was a cool surprise and I never knew how it could possibly end until the end and then I was pleasantly satisfied. The Cover of the dvd looks horrible though.
0373774184|4.0|I am always very pleased with my purchases.  Venetia was very good and I was very pleased with the purchase.
B000S95KTY|5.0|I love this directors cut. The added effects showing more of Vgir are excellent. Planet vulcan redone in the beginning is much better than original one. Only thing I dont like is the explosion they added for destruction of asteroid when trying to get to warp speed. Looks to cartoonish and looks obviously composited and to rich in color. The original one was fine. I wish they would put that one back. I was satisfied with the extras. I like this movie better than others because it seems more big in scope and vision like a 2001. I am not in a hurry when I watch so I dont mind the slower pace sometimes. The other movies are more like tv series style which is good but not as thought provoking and space doesnt seem as deep and spacious if that makes sense. I hope they do directors cut on blu-ray...and with luck they put the old explosion back in.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|A great flick, unpredictable, will keep you glued to your seat. Kind of like a Tarentino flick but more stripped down and real. Enjoy!

B004JZBGWI|5.0|The newest updates were smooth and helpful.  I didn't lose any data like previous reviewers (I have a Samsung Galaxy S).  The latest update allows me to go into edit mode and delete with one click instead of going into each item to edit.  This is great.<br /><br />I love lists, and in the days before my smartphone, I went through stickies like crazy.  Now I keep my grocery list, my to-do list, my wish list, my resolutions, and lists for each room I'm redoing in my house on my phone.  I never forget my grocery list anymore.  If I'm out and about and see something I think I need for my remodeling projects, I can look at my ColorNotes to see if I already picked it up.  I can even create lists for each store I have to hit to keep me more organized.  I use the color coding to quickly see shopping lists, to-do lists, or remodeling lists.<br /><br />Once I discovered the widget and started pinning my stickies to my wall, it was even better.
0312588887|5.0|I read this book a long time ago and it's been in my list of 3 all time greatest:  Ayn Rands, The Fountainhead - John Jakes, California Gold and, not necessarily in this order, A Woman of Substance.  I don't know how many times, over the years, I've recommended this book to a girlfriend who's been struggling and I''ve used Emma Harte, myself,  as a memory-bank  back-bone when I've found myself in uncharted waters.  There are books written over the years that would/should make the excellent \\"required reading\\" list because of their timeless emphasis on values, discipline and honor.  I just put A Woman of Substance in my cart for another go-around. And, during these struggling times, this might be a perfect year to give this amazing story as Christmas gifts
B0034G4ORC|2.0|Oh dear. Oh VERY dear.    This had so much potential - a sci-fi thriller about an alien attack on Los Angeles, with a band of hard nuts defending the city - but I got a sinking feeling right from the first words spoken by the characters in this film. The script. My God, the script. Chris Bertolini, the writer...you need to go around your house and destroy every pen, throw out every laptop, break every pencil, in fact get rid of anything that will ever allow you to write again, such is the monumental awfulness of the dialogue in Battle: Los Angeles. There are so many clichés packed into this film that they almost create their own little cliché vortex. Every single character in the film talks in a meaningless stream of utter drivel, spouting \\"snappy\\" gung-ho one-liners that stare utter dullness in the face, and dare it to go one better.    There are some things to admire here, notably the special effects, which are absolutely top notch, and some of the acting is of a good standard...well, as good as it can be when faced with lines like \\"When invading a place for its resources, the first step is to wipe out the indigenous population!\\" or \\"I need you to be brave for me! I need you to be my little marine!\\".    Surely SOMEONE in the production team would have been brave enough to call for a rewrite, or for someone to reboot the dialogue? All of it? From scratch?    Ack.
1742840523|5.0|Harald Blomberg and Moira Dempsey explain what should happen in the developing brain and body in an easy to understand way. They highlight why a lack of both movement experiences and normal rhythmical baby movements wreak havoc on the developing nervous system and how this lack of input can lead to problems with attention, emotional regulation, motor challenges, etc. Connections are made in regards to how the retention of some of the key primitive reflexes can adversely affect both emotional and physical development, and how we can help people to remediate these problems. Truly a remedial approach that helps to \\"fix the foundation\\" to help a vast array of challenges. If we don't focus on helping to stimulate the formation of new brain connections and integrating retained primtive reflexes, our foundation will still remain \\"shaky\\" and we will still experience problems with various aspects of development.<br /><br />This book is a great resource to have when completing the Rhythmic Movement Training courses because it gives a greater background into why movements that seem \\"so simple\\" can have such profound effects in the body. I highly recommend it!
1451629184|5.0|I was only a few years older than Jaycee when she was kidnapped and it was nearby, so her story always resonated with me. I remember being in high school and convinced I was going to see her somewhere, help find her. When I heard she'd finally been found I was at first in shock, then burst into tears.  I was conflicted about this book because I knew it was going to be hard to read, and it was.  But other than  few very bad chapters/incidents, it's an amazing and inspiring book.  I'm so glad she wrote it so that people can see how she not only survived but is thriving.  I know some people are put off by the focus on animals but that part was very poignant to me, as an animal lover myself - they were her only real source of love and comfort. I've talked to a lot of people who are afraid to read this book, but it's pretty obvious from the chapter titles which ones to 'skip' if you don't want to read the details... and the spirit that shines through in the rest is amazing.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This is a very good movie and the packaging is very sharp. If you like any of the Marvel Comics Movies I recommend that you see them all. You need to watch through the credits in all the movies because they are placing scenes there to tie the movies together involving the 4 characters that will be in the Summer 2012 release of \\"THE AVENGERS\\". The price of this movie was very affodable and the quality was WELL above what I expected.  Two Thumbs up.
0971407614|4.0|My purpose for buying this book was to get some good exercises to supplement my strength training routine without weights while traveling.  Think you have a good squat/deadlift?  Try to do one rep of a full pistol squat.  Good luck.  Five stars for this purpose.    I have some issues with the other sections.  The initial sections on general fitness information are full of the psuedo science you'll find in any other book.  Maybe correct, maybe not.  Experiments with 4 people don't prove anything.  Let's see multiple hundreds that are actually monitored full time to see what they've really done during the 23 hours of the day they're not participating in some steady for college credits.  The author actually did have a mini-lab with special forces recruits but I'm sure they trained much harder than what's prescribed in this book and did lots of aerobic exercises like running which he's against.  (FWIW, I agree that less is often more).    Bodyweight is also a bit of a farce if you want full flexibility in making some of the exercises harder.  He often mentions milk jugs or loaded backpacks.  I get the point that these items are easier to come by than weights.  But, there's nothing inherently wrong with using a barbell.    Finally, be careful with some of these exercises.  A 3 hinge steel entry door is pretty strong.  A two hinge internal birch door is not.  Nor are most bookshelves.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I loved it before I listened to it!  I like its rock sound. Tracks like Heavy Metal Lover, Eletric Chapel, Bad Kids or Yoü and I.  My favourite \\"hit\\" of the album is Scheisse. It's so catchy! I'm obsessed since I first heard it. It needs to be a single.  I think the worst song is \\"Americano\\", though I like it, it's so strange. I've got mixed feelings with this song. I'm Spanish and I love the fact that she sings in my language.  Clarence Clemons made two great appearences on Hair and Th Edge Of Glory. So sad he has passed away :( may him RIP.    I love the whole album! I own the standand and special editions.    Love Gaga, can't wait to see her live on her new tour!
B000FC13MM|5.0|This entire series is fantastic--the characters are interesting and engaging, the setting is vibrant even in its darkest locales and the mythology of the world depicted in these books is highly original.  The Abhorsen--the title of the main character--is one whose job it is to manage the dead, so to speak.  The theory of necromancy will be familiar to fans of high fantasy, but the methods you will find here are not your typical dusty-scroll- and magic-tome-found chants.  A set of bells, each with a name and a special purpose, is used to guide the dead and dying to and from the afterlife and all its stages.  Do not make the mistake of believing that the Abhorsen is an all-powerful being in these books, however.  You will be on the edge of your seat while reading because the world of the Abhorsen Trilogy--both the world of the living and the world of the dead--are fraught with danger and intrigue that the protagonist must face, endure and attempt to survive in more ways than one.  I highly recommend this entire series!  I very rarely read a single book more than once, but the Abhorsen Trilogy is something that I have since purchased in a box set and will be enjoying for the rest of my life, and I know it will be something that I will be passing down to my children some day in the far future.

B002HWRYJE|2.0|I'm a 43-year old man who watched and loved all the original episodes as a kid. I've seen Star Trek 2, 3, and 4 numerous times. I have not followed any of the other TV spinoffs or movies very closely.<br /><br />My main gripe with this film is the degradation of the characters. The \\"new\\" Kirk is arrogant from start to finish, failing to develop any degree of maturity (and he can't hold his own in a fistfight). The \\"new\\" Spock is cool as ice, unless you dis his mom-at which point he becomes an unstoppable fighting machine. And the \\"new\\" Uhuru-I hate to say it, because it's so disappointing-is easy. She sleeps with Kirk, and maybe Spock. Hers is the most troubling character because of the example she sets. I have no idea how many adolescent black girls watched this film, but I can think of few worse role models for them than the new Uhuru. This character says \\"You can excel in your field, wear mid-thigh miniskirts, sleep with the top brass, and still get respect.\\" If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you on the recently black-holed Vulcan. Some might object \\"It's just a story\\"; but the stories we tell ourselves and each other inexorably influence how we think and what we do. This Uhuru's impact is potentially catastrophic for girls who would imitate her.<br /><br />Minor gripes: the \\"lens flashes\\" (or whatever they're called) were like the stars one sees after a knock to the head or a crack in the windshield, and twice as annoying as either. Was this a concession to internet junkies who can't follow a train of thought and require frequent prompts to refocus their attention? Did the plot have to use time travel, again? Are we really supposed to believe someone can keep a hoppity horse-sized blob of black hole-producing \\"red matter\\", pull out a drop of it at will, and shoot that drop into the same kind of cylinder used to move your documents from your car to the bank at the drive-thru teller without suffering any relativistic effects? And are we to believe thata rogue band of Romulan hard-rock miners can skip around the universe packing overwhelmingly greater firepower than a Federation starship? The sex scene with Kirk and Uhuru was unnecessary, as was the scattered profanity. Were sex and swearing included to score a PG-13 rating?<br /><br />Recommendation: Do not buy or watch this film. Instead, buy and watch \\"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock\\" and see the original characters pull for each other to rescue one of their own. Star Trek 3 offers loyalty, sacrifice, and a realistic grappling with death.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The year was 1977, I was 8 when the original triology made its debut in Springfield Ohio, now some odd years later and the technology has improved tremendously.  I personally could care less if its the original version or the special editions, its flippin' STAR WARS for cryin out loud.... it's not a cult or a religion or whatever, its a movie... and its come to Blu ray FINALLY.  I for one am tickled Wampa pink that it has, I love it and have been a tremendous Star Wars fan since Memorial Day 1977 and will be untill the day I die.  I don't care what you Lucasfilm haters think.  I will gladly give my money everytime it comes in a new format, this takes me back to my childhood days and has helped me cope with several life altering situations.  So if you yahoos cant find anything better to cry and whine about, GET A LIFE will ya
030726999X|3.0|Yes, Stieg Larsson was a good writer and we all lost a great talent with his too early passing and he did a good summary in this story of the first two \\"Girl\\" books, but in this one there was not enough Lisbeth Salander for me. The trial toward the end with Michael's sister, Annika Giannini, defending Salander was the highlight for me. The author did develop strong characters in the police department in both good and bad cops. There is a lot of good vs evil in this story. We would all like to have Salander's Geek Squad on our side in this day and age, especially in time of a modern war. I have a new title suggestion; \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Net\\".
B0054N73EY|4.0|I have been a fan of the RHCP since Blood Sugar Sex Magik. I must say, I was hesitant to purchase the Peppers latest album after hearing that John Frusciante left the band. Like after his first departure from the band and the addition of Dave Navarro, the sound was not the same. This album is no different. John Frusciante is one of my favorite modern rock guitarists and his presence is missed on this album. However, I think this outing without John is more successful than that on One Hot Minute. Yes, the sound is different, but there is more chemistry and the songs each have their own creative exploration that I haven't heard in previous albums.     After watching the live performance on Fuse shortly after the release of the I'm With You, I was disappointed. Josh Klinghoffer was sloppy and lacked chemistry with the band on stage. I also didn't care for the new single, The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie. As a result, I almost reconsidered purchasing I'm With You. However, the album is a success. The band and their sound evolve, while sticking true to their roots. Flea and Chad keep the backbone of the band in tact and recognizable to even the fair-weather fan. Josh seems to be more comfortable in the studio than on stage.     I like the direction the Peppers have taken with this album, in particular their song writing process of jamming and allowing the songs to form organically and then expanding from there. The album has funk, punk, rock, hip hop, jazz, psychedelic sounds, and more.\\" A lot of the songs sound like they could belong on the By The Way album. Fortunately, that was my favorite album since Blood Sugar Sex Magik.    This album was refreshing and admittedly a bit of a surprise. I was expecting to be let down and witness the beginning of the end of the Chili Peppers. I'm glad I was wrong. This albums rocks, is funky, chill, and reassuring despite John's absence.    Favorite tracks include Police Station, Even You Brutus, Meet Me At The Corner, Brendan's Death Song, Goodbye Hooray, Monarchy Of Roses, and Factory of Faith.    Least favorite tracks include Happiness Loves Company, Dance, Dance, Dance, and The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie.
B004LROMSO|5.0|I don't understand the hate for Camelot. You just can't go into it comparing it to anything else. You have to know it isn't Game of Thrones II. It's a bit campy, a bit tongue-in-cheek, and there is a bit of scenery chewing. But it was, for me, an incomparable light fantasy escape. My boyfriend hated it, but I loved it! With the love triangle being a primary focus, and with pretty boy Jamie as the lead, it makes me think Camelot is better suited for females.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|While sensitive to the critical comments I have read, I would add that for me, the most grievous flaw lies in how the series ended, with the putative \\"redemption\\" of Vader. The problem is that in the earlier episode illustrating Vader's transformation to evil, he is depicted as personally responsible for mass murder, in the killing of the Jedi. In this context, it seems a profound moral flaw in Lucas' story line that someone at that level of evil should be considered capable of being redeemed at the end even he turned to cast his boss the Emperor into hell. Lucas lost me at that and, as someone who was quite transfixed by the first and closely watched them to the end, this was far more disappointing than the revisionist \\"Noo\\" that seems to have crept into these final revisions. That being said, I still have my laserdiscs for the originals of the original trilogy and am purchasing the blu rays for the system I have now.

B0051QO4QY|5.0|Lady Gaga has topped herself once again with her extremely inspiring album, Born This Way. Where The Fame was typical pop and The Fame Monster brought on a really edgy, darker vibe, Born This Way offers a complete new twist to pop, and it's so inspiring. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes pop music, Lady Gaga, or is just looking for a different side of pop music.
B000000OPW|4.0|In case Amazon decides to include my review along with the remastered version, please be advised; the one I bought is the 1986 version (with the extras Execution, Lullaby, Umbrella, Cities in Dust extended).  Reviews of both versions are crammed together.  I wanted to give mine a 3.5 but we no longer get that option.<br /><br />Amazon and their misleading descriptions: \\"2009 digitally remastered and expanded digipak edition\\"... and at the moment of purchase, the MP3 title track (javascript portion) was missing; so I could not see track listing.  I have the Downside Up collection so I ended up with songs I already had. However, I will be as fair as possible and focus in the original release, as the remastered (2009) version would get 5 stars by me.<br /><br />Well, Tinderbox...  it seems an awful struggle began after two great guitarists were gone from the band: McGeoch and Smith.  It's hard to give 4 stars to anything that comes from Siouxsie, but I must be honest.  John Valentine Carruthers just wasn't meant to be \\"Banshee\\" material.  He is not bad, but just not a Banshee at heart.  Appeared to be quite a downgrade to the previous guitarists.  However, I must rate the album based on the farfetched decision of the band to recruit him.  Even in the photoshoots, Carruthers looked way different than everyone else, more like a schoolboy in a Punk band.<br /><br />\\"Candyman\\" (4)<br />\\"The Sweetest Chill\\" (4)<br />\\"This Unrest\\" (5)<br />\\"Cities in Dust\\" (3)<br />\\"Cannons\\" (3)<br />\\"Party's Fall\\" (4.5)<br />\\"92°\\" (4)<br />\\"Land's End\\" (5)<br /><br />Note there are only two songs that I rate with a steady 5.  \\"Land's End\\" truly saves this album from being just average.  The fact that the album needed the push of Siouxsie's voice to keep it under control is evident.  After the band's previous successful album \\"Hyaena\\" with Robert Smith, the group probably wanted to get more mature in their approach (too premature). They had done so great on Hyaena, so this was unexpected to me. It didn't quite match the greatness.  And this is where things went haywire for the band.  They didn't improve until \\"Peepshow\\" saved the band from an imminent doom.  Apparently, the Banshees felt the same way since they let go of Carruthers soon enough.  (This is not intended to be a personal insult to Carruthers)<br /><br />\\"Cities In Dust\\" is a song that should have had much better potential.  In my opinion sounds too much like a Madonna/Cyndi Lauper kinda song.  Add monotonous repetition and this is what we get.  If the song hadn't been so repetitive, I would give it a (4).  Perhaps a variation of rhythm and sound somewhere in between would have made it much better.  One of the album's icons \\"92 Degrees\\" is a great song with also lots of potential.  The feeling is somewhat similar to Cities in Dust, not sure why this song got so popular, but it could have been better.  The display of Siouxsie's voice in 92 degrees is extremely artistic, and I wonder how it would sound without music, just \\"a capella\\".<br /><br />My biggest issue with this period of the Banshees is the fact that you know they should have been a \\"5 stars\\" band all the way.  Then came \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" a cover collection which probably should get a 3 (but I can let go since none of those songs were theirs).  I really wanted the remastered, and I would have been pleased with the investment.things went haywire for the band.  They didn't improve until \\"Peepshow\\" saved the band from an imminent doom.

B0000004V2|5.0|Fortunately, I found this by surfing through the Amazon website.  I read some of the reviews, heard the samples, looked over some critical reviews, and bought it.  What a find!  Up to four weeks ago I had never heard of this group, let alone the album.  Having listened to it five or six times I am convinced that there is no weak song here.  The music is melodic, inventive, fun, complex, and diverse.  With so magnificent a start, one wonders what mountains the group would have climbed had they remained together.  This may be the best first album ever.  The group is wholly self-assured and rightly so - their craftsmanship leads nothing to be desired.  One of the few albums I wish were longer.  You will not regret purchasing this work of genius.
B001GJOL22|5.0|If you are a Rush fan, this is a must own!  If you watch this, you likely will become a Rush fan. Been a Rush fan for 35 years and this is by far the best performance I have seen.  Even beats the two live shows on Snakes and Arrows tour I saw. I challenge you to find any band or musician that can perform at this level of quality, let alone after over 35 years.  These 'old guys' Rock, and can do so for nearly three hours.    The video quality of both DVD and Blue Ray are some of the best I have seen.  The Blue Ray is fabulous, and the video shots, mixing, and production are going to be hard to beat. Easy and pleasant to watch.  Was at the Cleveland concert where they recorded the video for Time Machine and the performance these guys gave put Snakes and Arrows to shame.  Can not wait to see the video when it gets here.  As for the sound quality, those who comment that it is not great either need to invest in some new equipment, or are tone deaf.  May want to make sure your audio setting are correct.  Can not imagine this not sounding good unless you don't have a real sound system.    Have the Time Machine video pre-ordered on Amazon at a great price.  Order both and enjoy.
B00139XTG4|5.0|I read this book just after completing a masters degree in economics.  The author pretty much invalidated my two years worth of education, but I agree with his points of view.  I also enjoy how this is a philosophy book and not a do what I did book.  Please read and contemplate, it will change your perspective on the way you view the world.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|UPDATE:  Just got the Blue Ray, and honestly the second best concert video I have seen to date.  First is Snakes & Arrows, but musical performance on Time Machine has slight lead.  Genesis Live over Europe is 3, except they need a blue ray version of that.   The band and production people did not disapoint. Excellent audio and video production. Almost as good as being there, and I was!! True Rush fans and Audiophiles will enjoy this till it is worn out.  Get a backup copy for emergencies!!!!!!! Ironic this performance was recorded a few blocks from the 'Rock-n-Roll Hall of fame.  News Flash, April 15, 2011, Quicken Arena was the Hall of Fame!       Since this is not out yet, can not comment on the audio or video quality.  If they match or exceed Snakes and Arrows, then it will be amazing.    Saw them live the first year of the Time Machine tour and was at the show in Cleveland when this was recorded.  Flawless and amazing performance in Cleveland.  This will be awesome unless they totally blow the production of video.
B0054JURZA|4.0|So everyone likes Bon Iver.  His sales are always at the top of charts, and he is rated by people who know music (like the editor's review) very well.  So I download his music am extremely confused.  I don't like it.  But then something strange happens.  I listen to it again, and again, and again, and again.  Then I ask myself, why do I keep listening to this if I don't like it.  But I'm drawn to it like a moth to a flame.  I can't explain why I listen over and over and over again.  I usually have no idea what he's singing about and it is often only slightly above a cacophony of sound.  But I listen, and I am pulled to the way his music makes me feel.  There is emotion here that I can't explain and I am always coming back for more.  I hope you enjoy this album.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Never a fan of \\"The Band\\", I started following Robbie Robertson after the release of \\"Music For The Native Americans.\\"  After \\"Contact from the Underworld of Red Boy\\" (another gem), I waited patiently for more music.  It's been a while, but this album does not disappoint. A fine collection of soulful blues, these songs allow for plenty of introspection and yet are guaranteed to lift your spirits. Listen to the samples, then buy this CD and enjoy.  It is terrific from start to finish.
B004LWZW4M|2.0|**Some Spoilers**<br /><br />I've seen several of the old Planet of the Apes movies. They were original and a little philosophical, the movies made you think about what really makes a person a person. These originals gave me a look at cultures very different from my own. The apes were people yet not people. Not that the old movies were perfect, the special effects were iffy and the dialogue not the best.<br /><br />Saying that I went in to this movie not expecting much, I knew the ending and understood this would be a very character driven story. I didn't expect a lot of deep thinking in this summer blockbuster but at least I thought the movie would draw some creative characters and maybe some interesting ideas. The movie disappointed on both accounts. The entire time I was watching the movie I felt I had seen all these people before. The scientist who's trying to cure a loved one with an experimental drug, the boss who's all about stockholders and money, the girlfriend who was purely there to support the main man and the misunderstood subject who, thanks to the experiments done on him, is able to break free from his captors. I could go on and on, not one person is unique to this movie. Not only that but these characters are woefully inconsistent. For example: one second the boss would never think about bringing an experimental drug back for more testing and the next he won't stop the testing for anything. What?!?<br /><br />The characters were not the only thing lacking in originality every plot device and even most scenes had been done before and better.  If a movie is not going to be original in plot and characters than at least they need to create an interesting version! I didn't care about what happened to anyone in the movie. I didn't relate to the scientist, the monkey, the boss, or any of the other characters. The movie just didn't give me a reason to care; the characters were just too poorly developed. Caesar didn't develop as much as make huge changes in his character. He acted like a human. Not like an ape becoming more human like but just a human in an apes body. Everyone else was just b.o.r.i.n.g.<br /><br />I also struggled to believe the world was real at all, too many incredibly stupid and unrealistic things happening. A company that is in the business of experimental drugs lets someone who was possibly exposed to a drug just keep working as normal? The scientist keeps a monkey in his house for five years and no one says anything? This same scientist is able to steal many doses of this drug to give his father for several years without anyone noticing? The monkeys are able to battle people with guns and win with very few casualties? The virus which is, I assume, transferred by blood only is able to wipe out the population of the world? The movie didn't convince me these things were plausible.<br /><br />I've read the reviews and I feel like I really missed something in this movie. What made it great? The characters were awful, the story clichéd, and the action dull.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I find it funny how every one of the people that gives this atrocity 5 stars (or more than one for that matter) tries to paint those that are angry about his lame revisions, as \\"fan boys\\". The real \\"fan boys\\" are the ones that buy whatever Lucas puts out regardless of quality.    They're buying a $90 (discounted price) set that includes 3 classic films that have been mutilated and 3 films that were never good to begin with.     And we're the \\"fan boys\\"?    I'm going to spend that $90 on something that's worth $90. If someone wants to give me this set for free I wouldn't mind... I could use some beer coasters. I used up all the old AOL free trial discs I used to use for that purpose...
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic.  I paid full price for the Kindle version and have been kicking myself up and down the house seeing that it is now on sale.  It's WELL worth full price.  I've only read 2 books by Sanderson and they have both been phenomenal.  Grab this book while it is on sale and get ready to be swept into a completely different world.
B000PMG16U|1.0|Hey George. How about instead of messing with the ORIGINAL TRILOGY, you change the movies that need changing? You can start by replacing Hayden Christionson and Jar Jar with new characters.     Even that sadly would be like putting a band aid on the stump of a decapitated head.

B0059R5Q08|4.0|I've always loved the story of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, and have watched numerous adaptations. My favorite by far is the 1983 BBC version starring Timothy Dalton as Mr. Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre. I missed the theatrical release of this recent version but managed to get the DVD and watched it a couple of days ago.<br /><br />Some have reviled this cinematic adaptation of Jane Eyre as not being faithful to the novel. Though it is true that this adaptation takes too many liberties with the original plot, I felt that given the constraints of movie-making and adhering to a set time limit, the movie was actually quite good. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, and the score is suitably haunting and subdued. What made this a compelling movie to watch was the amazing performances of the two leads, i.e. Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and brooding Michael Fassbender as Edward Rochester. Wasikowska plays Jane with an otherworldly ,ethereal quality that truly brought the Jane of the novel alive for me. As for Fassbender, there was just something compelling about him, and the strong chemistry between Jane Eyre and Rochester is credibly conveyed through the actions and words of the two actors.<br /><br />The supporting cast did a good job too - Dame Judi Dench makes for a suitably convincing Mrs. Fairfax, and Jamie Bell as the missionary St. John Rivers also did a good turn in his role. It is never easy to compress a great novel into the limits of a two hour dramatic film, but I think director Cary Fukunaga did an above average job with the limitations she was presented with.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|I decided to go against reviews and rent I Am Number Four anyway since the trailer appealed to me and it was the type of story that I enjoy.  I did not find it worth my time or money, however.  There's just no interesting substance, character-wise, to this movie, nothing to engage with to get you invested in the story.  It's like they adapted the most generic, bland fan fiction they could possibly find about an alien high school teen coming into his powers and then paid someone to add some really CGI intensive action sequences to it.  I can't tell if the main actor is really that bland or whether he was doing the best he could with the poor script.
0375842209|5.0|Interesting use of language, sad in places and a totally different perspective on war torn Germany. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading historical novels and the resilience of the human spirit and the devastation of war. Excellent read.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|Who is number four?  The first three are killed shortly after the movie starts, and in the rest of the movie we watch John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) with his guardian (Timothy Olyphant) try to blend in and survive.  Any romance?  Sure, John Smith gets tangled with Sarah in high school, and that complicates everything.<br /><br />This is a light movie, and you have to suspend your logic and disbelief.  In some ways it reminded me of X-men series of movies.  The movie ends in such a way that there is a possibility for a sequel.<br /><br />One more thing: John Smith punishes the bully and his thugs in high school and gets the girl.  I also liked the number six with her special abilities.  The special effects look cheesy, but who cares, it is an entertainment.<br /><br />It is a mindless light movie to watch at your own risk!  :)
B000RZIGSG|3.0|Here are the songs in the Bonus CD :   - Flashdance  - Manhunt  - He's A Dream  - Lady Lady Lady  - Romeo  - Maniac    The above songs are the same versions as that in the soundtrack.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Love it. Satisfied with my purchase....<br /><br />First impression.....I like it alot. It's a little stiff and not real easy to snatch the light I bought at the same time, in & out of it. But I'm guessing with daily use it will break-in a little and become a little more pliable. It's stiff. The option to rotate 360* is going to come in handy with daily use at work.
014132161X|5.0|\\"Five Children and It\\" is an AWESOME book!!!! The five children Cyril (nicknamed Squirrel), Anthea (nicknamed Panther), Robert (nicknamed Bobs), and Jane (nicknamed Pussy) are at a new house, right between a chalk quarry and a gravel pit that used to be a beach. When their parents are away, the five children go digging in the gravel pit with their spades. When the children are trying to dig a hole to Australia, Anthea finds a creature in the hole known as a Psammead or Sand-fairy that goes by the name of It. It has promised the five children to grant them one wish a day. The children wish all sorts of things from being beautiful as the day, to having wings, but sometimes their wishes can spin out of control. This is an excellent book by E. Nesbit, with a cover illustration by Quentin Blake (illustrator of the Rald Dahl books), illustrations within the book by H. R. Millar and book extras at the back of the book. I would recommend this fabulous book to anyone.
B003UESJEM|3.0|I had high expectations for \\"The Company Men\\" with its great cast and very relevent subject, but I was disappointed. The producers couldn't resist turning this into a feel good sort of film. These stories don't usually turn out this way in real life. Try \\"Up in the Air\\" for a story that's more true.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why must you do this to us George Lucas why? All I wanted was decent versions of the OT. It's not like it's not within your power to produce this for us. I shall never show these versions to my children. I shall dust off my laserdisc player and show them these films as close to how they should have been seen as possible. Damn you George Lucas. Damn you straight to hell.
B0058ZWRVC|1.0|I wouldn't categorize this movie as a comedy whatsoever. It's definitely more of a teen angst drama.  I honestly can't remember laughing at anything, and I like to laugh at all kinds of jokes. This was pretty painful to watch.
B0055JP7BI|5.0|This is an amazing episode and so much of the past season and a half (more?) has been building to this point. This is an amazing example of bringing together foreshadowing and working to make a TV show REALLY great. Worth purchasing the past 2 seasons JUST so you get the payoff of this episode.

B0051QO4QY|5.0|When Lady Gaga first came on the scene, I thought her music was catchy, and kind of just nodded along to the beat. But after I researched her, and listened to more of her stuff, and as she grew an as an artist, I grew as a fan. By The Fame Monster, I was addicted. Bad Romance is STILL my favorite music video (by any artist) of all time. I went to the Monsterball, and it was more than spectacular. I never thought she would top herself. Then, Born This Way came out. It's got a great title single, that can make ANYONE feel good, and it was only an appetizer of the rest of the meal. The beats suck you in and don't let go until the end, and the lyrical genius that is Lady Gaga, is a once in a lifetime wonder. Gaga knows how to write a song, she knows how to sing it, and she knows how to outdo the Queen of the unimaginable, by sticking to her guns and producing hit after hit after hit. Gaga doesn't have a fan in everyone, but those who won't give her a shot are missing out. If you haven't bought Born This Way yet, now is your chance. Get it now, so you can say that you were a part of history, and you owned a copy of one of the greatest albums the world has ever know.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Didn't get around to using it for a while, as I could see there was a bit of an initial time investment and I have quite a few apps installed.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Tons of bugs and it freezes all the time. If you paid for this you shoud be asking for your money back. I've seen software written by middle school kids that was more stable. The worst part is the developer has not even attempted to fix any of these problems with an update.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|What once was the perfect science fiction story has become a doodlers mess thanks to its creator George Lucas. How far this mighty giant has fallen is left to personel interpretation (a.k.a. how royaly pissed you are by his changes).  The sad thing is, Lucas feels so right about it. How? The man who stood up in front of Congress in 1988 condemning the change or even alteration of any kind of art has now become the biggest of perpetrators. Was the vision not clear enough George when you initially made the films? What's next? And, how far will you go to clear the haze of misunderstanding you have with your masterpiece? What's Wrong With It George???
B0007OASII|5.0|This album should be on anyone's melodic, slightly progressive heavy metal five album desert island list!

B005KGPC4S|4.0|This is  not a feel good happy ending movie.  No heroes who save the day.  More reality than most people would like to admit. Kevin Smith gives you something to think about.  What is \\"right\\"?  Who decides?

B003Y5H542|5.0|Rango is the best animated feature I've ever seen.  After this movie, you know you can never trust what you see on TV again.  The movie pays homage to many Westerns including the metal beak on the hawk that brings up memories of 'Cat Ballou' and a cosmic Clint Eastwood clone.

0143039431|4.0|If any novel could sum up the tragedy the Great Depression was for the working classes, this is it.  I liked almost everything about this book--the characters, the story, the history, the dialogue.  One of the only complaints was the abrupt and pointless ending, although I do commiserate with the author because how do you end a novel such as this?  This novel is a masterpiece in itself as well as in what it accomplished by bringing to light the impact of the Great Depression on the working poor.  It's hard to know if this story is the worst of the worst or just the story of an average family during this time.  Either way, it's a tragedy and very moving.  As a sidenote, Steinbeck definitely exhibits a hope in communism and socialism to bring equality and end the kind of poverty illustrated in this book.  When this book was written, history hadn't yet judged the communist/socialist experiment which has now been shown to be responsible for more injustice and poverty than what it replaced.  Along those lines, the novel's villains are the \\"big bankers\\" and \\"big farm owners.\\"  Ironically, FDR's New Deal policies dictated price controls for farm goods and wages which led to mandated government destruction of food during the Depression.  So, the New Deal was just as big a \\"villain\\" as the bankers and farm owners even though the book leaves that part out.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Lady Gaga promised to deliver an album of the decade to her Little Monsters, and she certainly did not fail at doing that. The only person who can top this album, musically and lyrically, is Gaga herself. There's no one like her in the game. This album is definitely not a normal pop record. She created a whole new genre of music. It has catchiness of a pop record, fine-poetry-like lyrics and boldness of a rock/metal album. The music on this album is so advance and so futuristic, so avant-garde. Gaga, RedOne, DJ White Shadow, and Fernando Garibay - the musical director of the album, did a great job.<br /><br />Even though I love every single song on this album, there are a few songs that stand out from the \\"rest of the crowd.\\" If you want to listen to a song that's completely different from everything you ever heard, check out: Marry The Night, Government Hooker, Bloody Mary, Heavy Metal Lover, Electric Chapel and The Edge of Glory.<br /><br />Although many songs  on this record aren't very radio-friendly, they have a great industry-changing potential, and will for sure change and influence every upcoming pop album.<br /><br />Put your paws up, you were Born This Way.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Why must you continue to destroy the original movies that we have all come to love? Why must your ego always get the best of you? Why can't you just release the movies the way they were in 77', 80', and 83'? Epic fail Mr. Lucas. You have taken the Star Wars Original Trilogy and yet again ruined it even more. I hope your new blu ray release fails epically. I have the original theatrical versions on DVD and that is that. I will not waste my money on your ego driven changes that have ruined and destroyed the movies I grew up with from their historical originality. Shame on you Mr. Lucas!! Shame on you!!!
0345505387|1.0|This was my first graphic novel and I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  If you never read \\"Outlander\\" then you'll most likely be lost with this chopped up plot.  Can you really digest 600+ pages of plot into a handful of text balloons? Nope!  The art work at initial glance was nice -- but not great.  Upon further inspection I found myself continually confused on which character was depicted in the frames.  And Claire -- really??  Her robust bosom should have been falling out of the rags she was drawn to be wearing.  And why introduce a fresh character when you've already got us confused on the existing characters?      Truly no stars from me on this one but Amazon is insisting I give at least single star in order to post this review.  I'm quickly shedding this book from my collection.      That being said, I'm still a fan of Diana Gabaldon's writing and I truly enjoy her Outlander series.  I just think she went a bit daft on this off beat idea.

0802473156|3.0|My husband and I have been married 43 years.  The book was too elementary for us.  It seems to be targeted to a     group married about 1 to 5 years.  My husband and I read the book together.  We'd look at one another as to say     \\"Duh!\\"  Many times we would just jump a chapter or two.  The questions near the end of the book were fun.  It was     funny; we discovered we were almost exactly alike in our answers.  I guess that was worth it!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I had high hopes for this release, but ever since viewing the changes they had made to the movies...I can't bring myself to spend money on this tainted atrocity. I could handle the couple of changes introduced by the special editions and the original DVD releases, but this is just going too far.     George, you probably should have called it quits years ago - hell, maybe have handed it off to a new team altogether. I know it's your baby, your brain-child, but we've got to be realistic here; if you had had complete artistic control from the get-go, this would likely have all ended up as a poorly-received flop of a film that would have been torn apart by Mystery Science Theater after a couple of decades. You simply don't add dialogue to a key scene in a movie like this and expect everything to be hunky-dory with the fans.    Unless there is going to be a release with what would be the original theatrical versions, but updated to fit Blu-ray/high-def standards, I won't be spending my money on this crap.    Say what you want people, it may not be out just yet, but two weeks isn't going to make a whole lot of difference in the grand scheme of things.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Once again Stephen King shows how great a writer he is. I loved this short-novella length story (although the price was a bit high for the length). It is an engaging story, with vivid characterizations of normal people that you can't help caring about even if you know what is going to happen to them, pertinent references to current culture and catchy phrases. The Doctor Who discussion really caught my attention. I'd give 4.5 out 5 stars. I'm taking off .5 because the price is high for that length.<br /><br />Of course, it is obvious this was a trick. Price is a little more than what you'd normally pay so your on the slippery slope to buy the next novel in November (that is outrageously high priced). Plus the vivid characterization and flawless prose remind you of just how good a writer he is...here's hoping Walmart will sale it at a big enough loss to change my mind of buying any version priced this way.
0439023521|5.0|Three years after its publication I finally read Hunger Games. Published as a young adult novel, its popularity has spread and the book has fallen into, and been loved by adults as well.<br /><br />I was hooked right from page one. Main character Katniss Everdeen's name is pulled from the lottery and she must participate in The Hunger Games. But what are the Hunger Games? We don't yet know, and I won't tell you either, as finding out is part of the fun of reading the book.<br /><br />The Hunger Games of Panem which is the main plot of this book, is gruesome,  so this is truly a book for teens, or those tweens who don't seem bothered by glimpsing the dark side of humanity, injury and death. It's nail-biting suspense reading, the type that keeps you awake reading yet another page and more and more chapters after you'd planned to go to sleep.<br /><br />The plot seems straightforward and single tracked until glimpses of something more complex begin to peek through. The reading is easy and this is sure to be a winner with anyone who likes dystopian fiction or anyone who just likes escape reads that pull you in. Collins did a fantastic job developing the character Katniss, a heroine who every reader can't help but love and root for as she tries to win The Hunger Games.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for young adult readers. This is also the type of book that typical \\"non-readers\\" and reluctant readers will happily read.<br /><br />(My thirteen year old son loved the book as well. Every teen boy and girl I know who read this book loves it.)<br /><br />Note for parents: This book provides some good talking points about alcoholism, drug use and addiction, reality TV and suffering for audience's entertainment, dressing in a sexy manner or showing nudity in order to entice and gain favor with TV viewers, and ethical questions about when it may be seen as acceptable to intentionally break government law (black market selling and poaching). Those are some topics in the book that parents need to realize exist before putting this in the hands of children who are not yet young adults.<br /><br />MOVIE: In 2012 a movie based on this book is due to be released. PLEASE READ THE BOOK AND THE FULL TRILOGY FIRST! It always seems the books are better than the movie, so do treat yourself by reading the books first!exist before putting this in the hands of children who are not yet young adults.

B0021L9ME6|4.0|Catwoman is the most underrated film I have ever seen. I can't believe so many people think its bad. Has anyone seen Green Lantern this year? That was bad. This is a very different Catwoman that's been seen before. Halle Berry does what she can with a lack luster script but all and all, she's a decent Catwoman. Sharon Stone plays a great villain too. Her scenes with Berry are very good. The rest of the cast is okay. Benjamin Bratt is not in the same acting category as Halle Berry. He is a bore to watch. All I can say about the Catwoman costume is that it is unique. I have never seen nothing like it. However, it grew on me. Catwoman is a very connect the dots kind of movie. There is nothing special about it, other than it features Catwoman. If you're a fan of the character or like campy movies, check Catwoman out.<br /><br />There are a couple special features that you will find on the Blu-Ray disk. However, most of them are on the standard DVD. You will not find the theatrical trailer or the animated feature Chase Me on the standard DVD. The best special feature on the disk is The Many Faces of Catwoman Documentary hosted by the late Eartha Kitt. It includes interviews with Julie Newmar, Lee Meriwether,  Eartha Kitt, Michelle Pfeiffer (The best Catwoman) and Halle Berry.<br /><br />Catwoman  3 out of 5 stars<br />Bonus  4 out of 5 stars

B003ZSJ212|1.0|OK. I bought the silver-box widescreen DVD version of the original trilogy, which is a pretty good version if you can ignore the \\"Han shot first\\" edit. I was leaning toward buying the complete Blu-Ray set, until I found out about the looped-in \\"Noooooo\\" during the final Vader/Emperor scene in ROTJ, which I watched on YouTube. WTF! Is Lucas so thick that he cannot tell how wrong that decision was? Is he so deaf to the people around him and his inner creative voice that he has no consciousness of such idiocy?    It was pretty obvious that Lucas himself had jumped the shark artistically when Phantom Menace came out (ex: JarJar Binks - really?), and the final Vader scene in ROTS \\"Nooooo\\" was too hackneyed to be believed. I suppose Lucas is so incapable of depicting true emotion that he has to resort to lame exclamation. What a squandered opportunity to depict the birth a truly iconic character.     Don't even get me started on Crystal Skull.     The latest liberty with ROTJ is typical Lucas, screwing up a previously well-balanced scene by adding an unneeded and distracting voice-over, which deflates the tension like an ice-pick to a basketball. The best film in the franchise (Empire) was not even directed by Lucas and this is a prime example of why. Lucas should be restricted to the special-effects lab and allowed nowhere near the director's chair or editing room.    Lucas long ago demonstrated a nearly complete loss of creative integrity. His early vision was evidently corrupted by success, special-effects technology, and whoring after easy-money licensing deals (ex. Jar Jar Binks 3-Bean Salad, I kid you not). His contribution to the art is now limited to f******g around with his earlier work in ways that are completely unhelpful.    George needs to quit screwing around with these movies and find a new hobby. I will not be buying these on Blu-Ray in their present form.    Maybe Jim Cameron could send John Connor back in time to terminate Lucas in 1990 and hand the reins over to  one of the talented and hungry new directors like Christopher Nolan or J. J. Abrams. Imagine what we might have had.  :(

B005FJ7DOM|5.0|This movie way surpasses the genre of Vampire/Zombie/Crazed Cannibals and incredibly over the top religeous zealots who also happen to occasionally be vampires, zombies and crazed cannibals type of film. This is a story showing how incredibly fast EVERYTHING will fall apart if our normal situations in life really go to hell and go there FAST.<br />The movie's hero is a hard man on the outside and has survived for being so. His absolute and full tilt, \\"I'm not playing your game\\" outlook is buffered by the same true humanity that makes him the survivor that he is. He saves the life of and raises and trains a boy knowing full well to avoid what has become of little enclaves of make-do civilization and seeking the one goal his mind is set on; reaching Eden. Eden is supposedly far enough north to have escaped the ravages of what has become of mankind and the entire movie is one long fight to get there by any and every means possible. And every means is pretty much covered in this great film!<br />We are talking about things getting so bad that pulled vampire fangs are used as barter for lifes necessities (and for some not so neccessary items that man tends to need anyway).<br />One reviewer mentioned that the acting is horrible. The reviewer had to either be watching something else or was kicked in the head by a horse as a child as EVERYONE pulls of their roles superlatively. The most evil of the evil, a cannibalistic \\"preacher of the one true faith\\", pulls off his role perfectly. \\"Mister\\", the hero of the story was perfectly cast. A man whose face mirrors the horrors he has seen and at the same time mirrors the hatred he holds for the \\"things\\" that most people have become and has developed only two goals, killing every \\"Vamp\\" he comes across and reaching the ever longed for goal of making it to \\"Eden\\".<br />Some might gripe that the religeous types are only shown as being incredibly evil and who knows, when things get so bad that all the politicians run away in fear after allowing for the fall of Washington, those that used to be the good just might be the first to go REALLY bad. The boy that is taken in by Mister plays his role quite well and semi narrates the story line. Despite being saved by Mister time after time the young man remains fairly innocent until he begins to truly grow up and see the world for what it has become. The still good looking Kelly McGillis plays a prominent role as a former Nun, rescued from true violation by our hero, the man known only by one name, Mister.<br />There is much more to this movie than just another horror film. It is full of action and satisfies the most blood thirsty of any audience member and certainly contains enough violence to rile up a stadium full of PTA members. The movie also has a decent amount of true humanity still in existance where with less hard men than Mister around, there wouldn't be.<br />Heck, the movie even has a Shane like ending (with the exception of Mister riding off into the sunrise unwounded). You KNOW he will survive! He seemed to have hung around the boy until he could see that the young man had grown up to be the combination of good and necessary evil that he had to be to survive...and even left him with a gorgeous babe that can cook and shoot a bow and arrow as well as one nice old high performance Chevrolet Pickup not far from, you guessed it, Eden.<br />This is one great movie that I have seen several times and enjoy it at least as much every time. If there is ever a reason to purchase a movie then this is one of those reasons. You will want to watch this again and again.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable in every respect, action packed and a horror buffs delight yet also one with a subtle message that good lies in the best of men and not in social gatherings and most certainly not in politicians and in this case MOST certainly not in the type of religeous zealots Mister and the boy and a few other good people picked up along the way come across.<br />Just watch and enjoy. Take the message or leave it. This is one great film just to sit around with a cooler of beer and enjoy. I just wish like all hell they would come out with a sequel!!d enjoy.

B004EPYZXK|3.0|\\"Found footage\\" horror films are a dime a dozen these days, having started to wear out their welcome, from \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" to \\"Cloverfield\\" to \\"Paranormal Activity\\", one can't help but feel that \\"Apollo 18\\" falls into the trap of trying to ride on the coattails of those who came before, and at a time where the genre seems to be wearing itself thin.  Thankfully however, \\"Apollo 18\\" manages to distinguish itself enough to stand on it's own legs, and deliver a satisfying experience.    \\"Apollo 18\\" follows the tale of the final, top-secret mission to the moon.  Assembled from top-secret footage taken during the mission itself, we follow the three astronauts as they head to the moon to put up several audio recorders, so the good old US of A can get an edge on those pesky commies in Russia.  However, shortly after landing, they make a shocking discovery and realize that their mission has become incredibly dangerous.    There's a lot that can't be said about \\"Apollo 18\\" without giving away some nice surprises, but I can say this:  \\"Apollo 18\\" has the advantage of multiple camera angles and intimacy going for it.  Unlike similar films, the action here is filmed from multiple angles (mounted cameras in the spaceship, hand held, cameras on suits, etc.), so that we constantly have new things to look at, rather then shaky footage shot from a single camera.  I also really enjoyed the sense of loneliness that the movie creates:  We never leave the three astronauts, and as the film goes on, the tension and dread really build, and culminates in a very memorable climax.    For all that it gets right, there are a few areas where \\"Apollo 18\\" stumbles:  For one thing, it's not all that scary.  Creepy yes, and with a great atmosphere of dread, but there are few outright scares (though the scenes with a strobe light are REALLY well done).  The main characters also are fairly generic (the all around nice guy, the chipper pilot, the determined commander), but because there are only three of them, we're still interested in what happens to them, so that can be forgiven.    All in all, \\"Apollo 18\\" manages to carve it's own unique identity in the found footage genre.  Despite the lack of genuine terror, it's sense of isolation and dread goes a long way to creating a very effective atmosphere.  While it probably won't win any awards or revolutionize the genre, \\"Apollo 18\\" is still a memorable, enjoyable film, and is easily recommended.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucasfilm has released Star Wars on the best format ever but they have altered key scenes in the old trilogy that make this Blu Ray set an abomination. I used to never care about the additions to the Special Editions in 97 and the DVD changes in 2004. After seeing Darth Vader howl NOoooo! when he chunks the Emperor down the shaft in Return of the Jedi, I decided to never buy another Star Wars release. This has to stop. I buy the movies for what I saw and loved in theaters as a kid. I put up with the changes made a few years ago but it just keeps changing and changing. What movies are we going to be watching in 20 years??? It is time to stop supporting these changes by buying everything Lucas puts in front of us. Only fans can make him stop. The problem is he makes millions with every little change he makes so he thinks the changes are welcomed be fans. Show George Lucas and Lucasfilm that they are wrong. DO NOT BUY!!!!    If you disagree then buy it and have fun watching something soulless.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Intense and exciting! It was just like the first for me; I couldn't put it down! The ending leaves you wanting more, thankfully there's a third book!!

The only thing that I kept asking myself was....\\"this seems to be happening to fast\\"  I guess thats bound to happen when the try to fit 1000+ page book into 10 one hour long episodes...The show was amazing...just wish it broke down the book into more episodes

B004RLSPSM|4.0|Sometimes a book just calls you.  My two friends and I were on a bus ride at 2:00am (do not ask why) and the bus driver suddenly asked:  \\"What is your favorite book\\"?  My friend since high school pointed his finger in the air while rocking in his seat and shouted:  \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\"!  I knew it was an honorable book to read, but somehow I missed the opportunity to read it in my twenty four years of existence.    Two weeks after that occurrence I was headed to a basketball game.  I had a half hour to kill before game time so I made a pit stop at the library one block away.  I sat in the community study area browsing for books when I glanced at a crossword puzzle.  Of course, the answers to the crossword puzzle were formatted for To Kill a Mockingbird.      One, I wanted to find the answers to the crossword puzzle.  Two, this was no mere coincidence that the book was brought to my attention again.  Cliché as it sounds; it was destiny that I read this book.  I feel dumbfounded that I did not read this in high school.  I hope to teach this book to my students in the future.  Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is in the literary cannon for a reason; it theme still touches home today.  It is a must read.

B004WCTLNY|5.0|I actually didn't know this was a sci-fi movie based on Philip K. Dick's novella. I read somewhere that it was supposed to be a 'romantic thriller' and I still don't understand what that means. Maybe the 'focus group' thought that a sci-fi label would turn viewers away?    In any case, this isn't your typical sci-fi movie with guns/ships/lasers and aliens. This movie stirred the 'romantic' in me and it's refreshing in this era of cynical 'dark' and 'realistic' cinema. It goes past the science jargon and gets to the point quickly. In the end it's about two people who cannot be together due to circumstances out of their control.     Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have turned in superlative performances and they carry the movie effortlessly. The story is good, the dialogue is crisp and the pace is brisk.     Ladies, keep some tissues with you and don't let the mascara run.
B0000264PW|3.0|Europe was riding high after 1986's The Final Countdown which was a very successful album for this band from Sweden. Following a hit album is never easy and chances are that you can never quite replicate yourself. Out of This World doesn't try to be another Final Countdown, Europe does not try to reproduce their hits in a poor manner, it goes further down the pop route and goes for a softer image overall (after it worked extremely well with The Final Countdown). If you don't like Glam/Hair bands with catchy choruses, hooks and keyboard then you won't like Europe. Some people would consider those bands and Europe \\"guilty pleasures\\" but I actually like this style of playing. Europe know how to craft a catchy pop-rock song, they can write and they don't sing just only about sex, drugs and Rock'N'Roll which makes them somewhat stand out from other bands (plus I think out of all the 80's bands they had by far the best and most prominent keyboards). They write genuinely great songs that are undeniably catchy and they're good musicians.<br /><br />\\"Superstitious\\" opens the album in nice fashion; it's one of Europe's most popular songs. The album's first single is catchy, melodic and so unmistakably Europe.  \\"Open Your Heart\\" was first released on the 1984 album \\"Wings of Tomorrow\\" and was also a single from that album. It's essentially a more polished sounding version of the 1984 (even if that was one was very pop to begin with, one verse is different), Joey Tempest's vocals sound better on here but the original song rocks a little more and features a better solo. I like both versions but I heard the Out of This World version first so I tend to lean towards this one a little more. It's a highlight of the album and one of my favorite Europe songs, the acoustic opening is fantastic. \\"More Than Meets The Eye\\" sounds like it could have been on The Final Countdown, it's a great up-tempo song that's fun and catchy and has a great solo courtesy of Ken Marcello. I love the \\"Sign of the Times\\" is I feel an underrated song and is possibly my favorite song here. The keyboard on this song are exceptionally epic and haunting, they provide great ambiance and along with Tempest's powerful voice contribute in making this a great song. What makes \\"Just The Beginning\\" work for me are the soft acoustic guitar parts mixed with the melodic keyboards because they blend so well together. \\"Never Say Die\\" is a more upbeat track and is very rooted in the 80's with its \\"Ah Oh Oh\\" chorus. \\"Let The Good Times Rock\\" and \\"Ready Or Not\\" are the most guitar oriented songs on the album. \\"Let The Good Times Rock\\" is the heavier of the two and was released as a single. \\"Ready Or Not\\" has aggressive guitars but they are not the focus here although it's a good song and I would consider it the better of the two. I feel that \\"Lights and Shadows\\" and \\"Tower's Calling\\" are nothing special, too generic and only take up space but that's only my opinion. I feel like they could have been better songs but something is missing somehow. The album ends on a much more positive note with the beautiful piano ballad \\"Tomorrow\\" in which Tempest plays piano and delivers a heartfelt vocal performance.<br /><br />Guitarist Ken Marcello replaces John Norum who departed in late 1986 not satisfied with band becoming more commercial. Marcello does an excellent job and even though he only played on more Europe album (the other being 1991's Prisoners in Paradise) his playing is solid and constant throughout Out of This World. There are parts where he is overshadowed by the keyboard but he plays some surprisingly neat solos and has some noticeable acoustic parts on \\"Open Your Heart\\" and \\"Just The Beginning\\". Europe is known for their use of keyboards since The Final Countdown. Mic Michaeli is amazing on keyboards and he proves himself once again here with some fantastic keyboard work. They are often the highlights of Europe's songs and certain passages really stand out. The keyboard sound of Europe is very present and is just as important as the guitars it turns out. Joey Tempest was always one of my favorite singers of the 1980's era and his voice is clear, powerful, distinctive and touching at times. Nothing has changed there. Bassist John Leven and drummer Ian Haugland form a tight rhythm section but are ultimately overshadowed by the rest of the band.<br /><br />One could make the argument that the band used to play more guitar-oriented material and were heavier in their early days. This is true as Europe went towards a pop direction that so many bands took at that time but they did better than almost anybody. Even if some of their songs are too pop for my liking I will admit they are well crafted pop songs. It could also be said that The Final Countdown was a bit more rocking than this one even if it went for a pop/glam sound. Truth is Out of This World is a soft Glam/Hair Metal album that relies mostly on its (excellent) ballads and softer songs, there are no real heavy or hard-rocking sounds, and this album is really a product of its time which is what it should be enjoyed for. That's the biggest problem on Out of This World, its perhaps a bit too soft and full of ballads but it doesn't rock as hard as Europe's previous offerings.<br /><br />Out of This World proved that there was still an audience for Europe and despite not being as successful or as good as The Final Countdown (it still managed to earn Platinum status in the U.S.) is still a good album and a worthy follow up. For many The Final Countdown is still THE ultimate Europe album but that doesn't mean Out of This World doesn't have its share of good moments. I personally feel this follow up is a little weaker but it also has some of the band's best and most underrated songs. It rocks a little less than the band's previous album and goes for an even more melodics style of music and it has its fair share of ballads. If you like melodic metal or previously enjoyed Europe I suspect you will find many of the songs on OoTS enjoyable. 3.5/5 stars, an enjoyable yet softer album.

B0058A119G|5.0|You can write volumes about her magnificent voice and her charater as a human being. To be brief, she is the best female singer of the 20th century & probably the 21st as well. For more than 50 years her voice has remained unchanged, hitting notes that only can compare as high to a moon landing. This album at 68 years old is one of her finest ever. There will never be another Barbra. I saw her live at Madison Square Garden, what a thrill, I can scratch it off my bucket list now.

0891419063|5.0|I read this book originally because a deceased, beloved, former summer neighbor of mine fought with the 81st Infantry on Peleliu and I was interested in knowing more about that battle. What I discovered was a book that described more perfectly and powerfully the horror of war in all its most \\"awe-full\\" reality. Sledge makes the reader relive that horror along with him as he describes the conditions and minute by minute circumstances he and his brethren endured, as well as the intractable resistance of the Japanese. Iwo Jima as pictured in \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\", and Afghanistan as described by Marcus Luttrell in \\"Lone Survivor\\" are powerful and important contributions that every American should read to understand the lengths to which our finest young citizens will go to preserve our way of life. But \\"With the Old Breed\\" is equally a must read...and should be required reading in every school in this country. It gives genuine meaning to the expression we so casually repeat that \\"war is hell\\". It is, as Sledge describes it.

I feel that the actors did a great job with bring life to a old movie in a action packed adventure to the center     of the earth where they explore the core of the earth. With a few twist and turns a long the way as they over    come a few hidden dangers along the way. Three main charters in the story did an amazing acting job in the      movie they were Brendan Fraser,Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem.

0307887898|5.0|Winston Churchill once said that we can depend on the United states to do the right thing - after they have exhausted all other alternatives. The same can be said for the startup company in cutting edge fields - they have to keep trying so many different options on the various product features, target market segments, pricing, technology architecture, and so on before they hit upon the right formula. And since companies will not have the necessary resources to try out the various permutations and combinations, most of them fail before they achieve success; unless they are phenomenally lucky.<br /><br />But Eric Ries in his book `The Lean Startup' shows that it doesn't have to be so. He explains that startups cannot use traditional planning an management tools because their product and customers are unknown. So, what else? Here he comes up with his Lean Startup Methodology - which is a scientific approach for creating and managing startups. Since the product and customer are not known, startups needs to develop a process of \\"validated learning\\" through which they can learn to build a sustainable business. This is different from learning through failure - which is a very expensive and wasteful process. Startups need to have a \\"Build-Measure-Learn\\" process and get continuous feedback from the market, so that they can decide whether to continue with the current plan or `pivot' into other directions. Eric shows the various ways a startup can pivot: Zoom-in pivot, Zoom-out pivot, Customer segment pivot, Customer need pivot, Platform pivot, and so on. Eric also explains how the normal metrics which he calls `vanity metrics' fail to show how a startup is performing and he comes with solutions of defining new metrics for the startup which takes into account the continuous innovation that a startup should perform. I loved the concepts of `MVP' - minimum viable product and `power of small batches' which allow companies to be agile and experiment quickly without committing too much resources.<br /><br />Over the last 25 years of my career, I have been involved with over 20 startups in various capacities - Founder, Investor or Advisor. Though every startup has been a different challenge, there are many commonalities that run across them. And the doubts that plague each one of them are the same - are we doing the right thing? are we making progress? should we presevere with what we are doing or change strategy? The `Lean Startup Methodology' is an excellent tool, which I wish I had known before. It is not that some or most of the things that Eric mentions have not been executed by me or other entrepreneurs, but we lacked the scientific approach and process that would have enables us to plan and manage better.<br /><br />We look at successful startups and often feel that those winners just happened to be at the right place at the right time. With many real life examples Eric shows it is not just luck. The successful ones were able to manage the startup well through many of the principles explained in the `Lean Startup Methodology' - whether consciously or not.  Further, after you move past the startup phase, how do you continue to get the company to innovate and be agile? How can large companies foster entrepreneurship? Can the smart startup maintain the spirit of entrepreneurship? Eric thinks so and lays out his thoughts of how that can be achieved.<br /><br />Some caveats on the book though - please note carefully how Eric defines the entrepreneur and the startup. There will be many businesses and organizational structures that will not match that. It does not mean the `Lean Startup Methodology' will not work for those - but it will have to modified and fine tuned. Similarly Eric's experiences and the examples he quotes are mostly from the high tech fields and hence the learnings may not be exactly applicable for many traditional industries. Lastly, the book assumes that the Startup is good in execution - which from my experience, is not often the case. The management team in most Startups will have many gaps - some of which they are not even aware of - which leads to serious problems as they try to execute. However there are many other books and large number of consultants who can help the startup to solve those problems.<br /><br />If you are an entrepreneur or involved with a startup in any capacity - this book is a must  read; you will not regret the investment of the time and cost. I commend Eric Ries for making a significant contribution to the field of scientific entrepreneurial management.am in most Startups will have many gaps - some of which they are not even aware of - which leads to serious problems as they try to execute.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|The changes made to the film destroy some of the series brilliant moments. Picture might look slightly better but id rather watch one of the better versions of the film. Bonus material is weak as well. They could of included much more and yet it seems theyre holding back. Probably to include it in a new and \\"improved\\" version of the blurays theyll want you to buy next year. With a digitally remastered yoda in empire strikes back! Ugh
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Back in the days of ancient Rome, when a conquering general would have his triumph through the city, a slave rode behind him whispering in his ear \\"remember, you are only a man\\"...lest the event go to the hero's head and give him ideas above his station.  It was a good idea, and for the most part it seemed to work.  George Lucas needs the same thing...only his little follower should be screaming in his ear \\"leave well enough alone.\\"    Every version of Star Wars gets altered every time he re-releases the films.  At first, his claim was that he made changes to the visual effects because he had been unable to make the movies look the way he originally intended because of technological limitations.  Most people could buy that, and the new effects for the so-called special editions were an improvement and pretty harmless.  Unfortunately, they also gave Lucas a taste for easy editing via CGI...and doing so was like giving an addict their first taste of crack.    He began altering dialouge, changing scenes and action, all the while claiming it was part of his \\"definitive vision\\" and how he intended the story to go all along.  Thing is, it's total bunk; he's not making changes because he couldn't have made back when he first produced the films, he's making the changes the way a kid with ADD colors in a coloring book; whatever idea pops in his head that he thinks will look or sound good, he does it, because with CGI he can.    Take his infamous \\"Greedo shoots first\\" change.  It not only ruins the character, it looks like garbage; the editing is on part with something someone would do for a Youtube video mash-up.  Or how about his replacement of Sebastian Shaw in the end of Return of the Jedi with Hayden Christiansan?  Not to wax philosophical about a fantasy movie, but it's a ruinous change becuase it invalidates the whole story.  See, when he appeared as a ghost lookinig like he died when he died, it meant Anakin had indeed \\"returned\\" as a Jedi...that he died as a good guy.  By changing it to how he looked as Hayden, it's supposed to imply that he's gone back to how he looked when he was last a Jedi.  But that would mean he DIDN'T die a Jedi at all...ruining the story and even the title.  And as with the Han and Greedo confrontation, it was shoddily done, simply replacing Shaw's head with Haydens, using footage taken from a costume screening.  The actor didn't even know it was being done, nor was he given a chance to actually \\"act\\" the scene.    The outcry from fans and critics alike about these changes should have been enough to convince anyone who wasn't totally self-absorbed that they were a mistake.  Enter George Lucas, who not only left these horrible changes in the latest blu-ray editions, he added more. More CGI creatures wandering around the screen, more egregious changes to dialogue, including what is surely the most awful change ever made to a movie...Darth Vader yelling \\"no\\" as the Emperor tortures his son.  What was an intense scene that left the viewers wondering what Vader would do has been reduced to a joke, all because Lucas suddenly realized that a key character always yells \\"no\\" in his other films...and needed to here, as well.  It's all part of that \\"poetry\\" line George keeps feeding us about his films.  There's no poetry to these movies anymore; they have become the cinematic version of \\"Here I sit broken hearted\\".      Bottom line?  If you want to see a good version of Star Wars, don't watch this one.  If he'd simply had the decency to include hte original versions on the disks it might have been okay, but he didn't even do that.  For a man who openly expresses concern about preserving our film heritage, he sure is a hypocrite for trying to bury the original versions of these wonderful stories.  Save your money...don't buy this garbage.  Just wait for the inevitable fan edits that will be out; they'll eliminate the more egregious changes, and the effects will probably look better, too.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I grew up loving Star Wars and I still adore it. I have been looking forward to owning the Star Wars Blu-ray set when it comes out. The news in the New York Times and the clips on Youtube of Darth Vader have completely confounded any desire that I once had to own this series on Blu-ray.     I won't buy it, Mr. Lucas. I'm sorry, but you're destroying this artwork by doctoring your film over and over. I know it's \\"just sci-fi\\" and you \\"own\\" it, but what you're doing with these idiotic and dispeptic edits is as essentially artistically unethical as putting a frowny face on the Mona Lisa. You should be ashamed.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I loved it and would definetly recommend the seller. It all went awesome with such a great experience. No doubt the set is a must have. Need to order another set.
0765322889|5.0|This is a review of the entire series.  Let me start by saying that if you intend to read this series you need to be fairly intelligent to really enjoy it.  The world Erikson created is so grand in scope its almost impossible remember everything and the plot is very intricate.  I have read each book in the series, except book 10, at least 3 times and with each read I discover something that I missed or was unable to make the connection in an earlier read and because of this these books are better with each read.  I love the characters, honestly cant say enough about them.  Some you will hate immediately only to have them become one of your favorites down the line (Karsa for me).  If you like black and white fantasy this series is not for you.  Erikson doesn't write about heroes and villains, he writes about people.  They are flawed and each has their own agenda but that's life and that is part of what makes this series so good.  These books have the perfect mix of humor, action, suspense, and tragedy.  The fight scenes are written very well, the best i have read actually.  The way Erikson writes the scenes it is very easy to visualize exactly what hes seeing without feeling that he is droning on.  Do yourself a favor and read this series.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This show is awesome!!  I love it!!  And as always, amazon had the best price around!!  If your looking for something new to watch I highly recommend this show!!
B00432QAKK|5.0|i am a big fan of married with children. i love the series, actors and the scenes. if you married with children, you will enjoy this...lots of laughs!hated to see the series end.
B00436GNVC|5.0|I love love Duffy!!!  She is such a great artist. I would recommend this album for anybody from teenagers to the very mature. She is great.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's a shame. I don't think that George Lucas realizes that once an artist creates something it is no longer their's. . . it belongs to the world.  Michelangelo  didn't continually re sculpt The David down to nothing, Fitzgerald didn't re-write The Great Gatsby every five years.  sometimes you just have to learn to let go.    This just proves what I've suspected for years -- the Trekkies were right all along. Lucas was a hack who had one good idea and he built a carrear around milking it.  Roddenberry was the true visionary.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very pleasant game to play. The sound and music make for a zen-like experience, and the premise is simple but the gameplay and aesthetic are magnificent. I was unsure about buying it at first, but I took a leap of faith for 99 cents and I'm glad I did.
0385339100|3.0|This book was disappointing. It is based on a rather complex story line about a law partner who hides millions of settlement dollars from his firm, stages his own death,takes on a new identity to live a new life and then gets caught. The book starts with his capture in Brazil. There a number of different parties tring to learn what he has been doing for the four years on the run and what happened to the money. The book is an intertwining of descriptions of his past activities and of his current tangles with the legal system and those who lost their money. You soon start to realize the author's approach and the questionable plausibility of some events, and that deadens the suspense.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|This was our first LED purchase and I am pleasantly surprised.  The quality of light is good.  I used it in my bedside lamp and have no problem reading by it at night.
B00004CZVT|5.0|My husband wanted me to find this movie for a gift for his parents. Though this was a region 2 edition, we were able to convert it to work on DVD players used in the USA. They are very happy with the gift.
B0036T31YY|5.0|...you can't wait to wake up from.  I was very pleased with this movie!  It definitely put a spin on deja-vu.  You won't be sure of the truth and that's not a bad thing!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This was one amazing idea!  I read this book in 2 days and loved every second of it.  It really made me think about the idea of beauty. Scott Westerfeld is a master of story telling, and it was awesome to have a look at the future.
B0053VKP8S|1.0|It didn't work with my new Samsung plaza TV. It sounded like a car alarm stuck on the most annoying setting. There was no sound setting on the TV that fixed the problem. I guess I'll have to buy an A/V surround receiver to hear TV shows through a sound system.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|So much fun and i have no issues with it. Better than the original, just more interesting levels. Addictive and frustrating, lol.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This is simply her best album yet, it is much different than her other albums, but it is still \\"Gaga.\\" The beats are amazing and the vocals are so strong and beautiful. The lyrics make it even better, its a very political album and focuses on many issues, such as gay marriage, immigration and freedom. All in all i think it is definitely one of the best albums this year, and may very well be, as Gaga said, the album of the decade.
078681859X|5.0|I usually not interested in the fantasy genre, I mean really, you read one and done, right? WRONG! This book completely dominates all the competition of the \\"magic wizardry\\" stuff, and is a must read. I've read it at least a dozen times over the years, and find another hilarious, witty comment to \\"lol\\" about. I curse the name of those 1 stars, don't be led a astray! Its a must read.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|What can I say? Now I own a copy of what some film makers say are classics among classics. The extra commentary footage is by<br />itself worth the price... Bravo, Coppola.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Lucas can tinker with his works all he wants, but at least allow a choice of which version we'd like to see. Blade Runner boxsets contain all four versions. Apocolypes now's Blu Ray has both the 1979 version and the Redux in it. The Star Trek season boxes have both the Remastered and original effects in them. Even just for the sake of historical accuracy, give us a choice, George. Without the original theatrical cuts I'll just have to pass on seeing this in HD.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Well, this recording / video will certainly bring back fond memories of some great music. Was a great price and delivery was fast.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I was excited to find this app but when I download my phone anti-virus alerted me that it was malicious! Uninstalled immediately. I didn't want to take the chance. Be careful!!
0470932139|5.0|Book is very simple to read and understand.  It has lots of pictures and descriptions.  I have referred this book to friends who love to cook and take beautiful pictures of the end results.
0316098329|3.0|The plot -- you no doubt know the story if you found my review -- is straightforward but you must unlock it by brushing aside needless observation (what is a blind or a rock or a leaf) and decode the narrator's child speak.  For me this became annoying, reminding me of two books which made excellent use of unconventional narrators:  Time's Arrow and I Am A Cat, the former unwinds the story backwards from the death to birth of the narrator; the later shows us the world from an eloquent feline.     There are several scenes (including the interview, the trip to the mall, grandpas visit) that play out of sync with the characters.  They feel cliched to make a point or push a button.  Oddly, most of these scenes are dialogs between the adults.    To my mind, three stars is a signpost that I've read the book and can neither recommend, nor not recommend.      In short, The Room tells a horrific story in a well-constructed, but over-used voice which will either grate on you, or endear you.
0071752854|5.0|Wow. That about sums it up. This is not just one of the best business books I've ever read; it's one of the best books I've read in any category.  Pitch Anything succinctly describes the nature of social interactions in a way that is both illuminating and captivating. Full of incredible insights, strategies and tactics, yet it's also a very easy read. I read the entire book in just a few hours.  I don't pitch business deals like Oren. But I do build brands and products from the ground up, and I also market and sell them. And the system outlined in this books is applicable to my line of work as it is to pitching deals. Moreover, it codified and articulated much of what I've thought about the true hot buttons that lie at the core of any and all decisions people make.  Too many businesses look at their customers as robots - just give them the right combination of benefits and features in some sort of logical order and they'll see what we do: that this is a great product. But nobody looks at their lives through your lens. We all look at our lives through our own.   Do yourself a favor: read this book. You'll never look at pitching, selling, branding or marketing anything the same way again.
B00322PK2G|1.0|This watch didnt fit me and I returned it over a month ago and the company still has yet to refund me.
1439153663|5.0|If you're interested in southern plantation life, this book is a marvelous journey into the cultural life of plantation owners and their slaves. The story is told from the perspective of a young Irish girl who becomes indentured to a plantation owner and a mixed race teen-age daughter of the same plantation owner -- they both grow up in slave quarters and serve the family.  The research and detail that Grissom provides in this fast-paced story is truly impressive.
B0014Z4ON4|1.0|I totally agree with the previous review.  I watched the film last night with my wife and kids... somehow I'd missed it when it came out.  I recommended it based on my enjoyment of the first and third films in the series.    Temple of Doom is a celebration of cruelty, terrible violence, and some terrible acting.  Kate Capshaw, she is a rotten performer!  Harrison Ford looks like he is hating every minute of his job getting this movie made.  The non-stop action is so poorly paced, the audience has no room to experience climaxes or dramatic tension.      But mostly, the cruelty and torture was unrelenting and, as the previous reviewer mentioned it, a lot of the cruelty is directed toward children.    I would not recommend this film to anyone.  It stinks!
0439023513|5.0|but the book itself is great, got it from the library afterwards...  (by the way, i tried buying the book at least 5 times, still would not download)
B005KGPC4S|5.0|Friend told me I should download and see this.  This is the best movie I've seen in a long time.  There should be some Academy nominations out of this.    Riveting    So many people did such a good job, I don't want to say the names of just the ones I know off the top of my head.
B000FBJG04|5.0|When I was growing up, my dad and I watched old movies of WWII especially the ones with Audie Murphy who was the most decorated war hero of WWII.  He became an actor after the war.  He later died from a plane crash at the age of 46.  I then became interested in the lives of the soldiers.<br /><br />The title Band of Brothers is taken from Shakespeare's Henry V.  This story follows the lives of the paratroopers in E Company during the war from D-Day to Market Garden to Battle of Bulge to Dachau to Eagles Nest to V-E Day, which incredibly, E Company had participated in all.  There are details that I never knew about like the soldiers were given a drug similar to Dramamine to combat airsickness on D-Day.  Can you imagine going to battle loopy from that drug?  There are other details about the paratroopers' experience that Ambrose wrote in great details and he researched the men in E Company really well. This is a great book and I highly, highly recommend it for the human aspect of a war told by the men who were there.  (Watch the HBO series too.)
B002ZG976U|5.0|I've loved this movie since the day I saw it in theaters with my friends on a night out. The music and dancing was wonderful. The love story behind it was great my sisters still joke about how much they want a cookie. If you havent seen the movie youll understand once you do. I give it major thumbs up and I cant do a review on this movie without saying does Cher never age or what she looks phenomenal in this movie. So if your questioning on buying it I say go for it and if you have questions hit my review with a comment I would be glad to answer.
B005D0PLKQ|4.0|I really love the way this record \\"sounds.\\" It is impeccably produced, and is sonically both retro and adventurous. I appreciate that these songs, while contemporary, are grounded in the best traditions of rock and rhythm and blues. So many artists today have no sense of where their music came from. Although these songs are simple, they are all well crafted examples of exceptional songwriting. Finally, the record grooves from beginning to end. What a breath of fresh air!
B00364K6YW|1.0|It's a beautiful miniseries. Unfortunately I had to send back the 'restored' DVD for a replacement as it would not load consistently. The replacement also suffered from the same problem, so I returned that as well. Such a shame! I've read bad reviews about the quality of the earlier DVD version as well.
B00521B9B6|4.0|I love the cd. I don't love the fact that I paid $35+ for the \\"deluxe Edition\\" which is only 2 more songs. I am so disappointed. It should at least come with a dvd of some recording in the studio.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I will not be buying these so called Star Wars Films. Even though I would love to have them on Blu-ray, The changes that were made and the new changes are completely laughable.    Not matter the limitations of the 70's and 80's, the films were great as they were. I am sad for Lucas thinking he has to change his films.      I do not recommend anyone buy these on Blu-ray.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Honestly, fiction doesn't get much better than this. The main character in this book has great depth. That makes a great book. I read the whole thing in a weekend it was that good. And it's even got a bit of sci-fi in it which I enjoy.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|If you ever plan on the resale of your phone, you should get an OtterBox. This line of protective cases not only stands the test of time but they also pass the drop test, the ran over with my car test and, the Holy Crap I dropped it in my toilet test.  OtterBox makes cases for tons of electronics and keepsakes if its important to you get a OtterBox! I'm picking up the new OtterBox for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 and the OtterBox for iPhone4 is great too, so there's something for everybody.
006621131X|5.0|I have been an admirer of Patti Smith for a long time; the woman is nothing short of incredible, and this extends past her music and poetry into the realm of prose. I cannot recommend this book enough, for any fan of Patti Smith, or anyone with even the remotest interest in rock n roll counterculture. Smith writes with such grace and has the remarkable ability to evoke the deepest of sympathies from her readers. You will be moved by this book, I assure you.
B004XQO90E|5.0|Source Code feels like a roller coaster ride, especially when it ends, because it makes you want to ride it all over again.  I usually buy movies based on whether I will watch it more than once, and Source Code is one of those movies. The story raises issues about fate and free will that I've always been intrigued about.  Plus with all of the clues and details embedded in the story, you just want to start over and look for them the second and third time around.  Moreover, I truly enjoyed the characters -- not just how the A-list actors brought them to life, but the characters as written made you really care for them.  I especially loved the ending which, while somewhat corny and hard to accept from a realist perspective, does address and answer the central question raised by the movie about destiny, time and freedom.
0061784788|5.0|I have become rather tired of \\"search\\" novels that have very little search and way too much shooting and killing.  I have nothing against \\"bad guys\\" getting their just desserts, but when it takes up, collectively, 4/5ths of the novel, it gets rather boring.<br /><br />I, however, really liked this one.  It had mystery, search, logic, history, bad guys and, for once, a credible, albeit fictional, retelling of American Indian History of early America.<br /><br />This book is not only interesting, but fun and I read it in two days.  I had to stop and do other things, otherwise I probably would have finished it in one day.  I found it very hard to put down.  This is not a kitchen sink novel, it is a novel of disparate and interesting bits that make a fascinating whole.<br /><br />I cannot begin to tell you how much fun it was.  And it would, also, make a good movie.  Also, I appreciated the way the author wove mysteries of American History into the plot that are not generally appreciated by the average reader.<br /><br />Kudos to the author.  I gave the novel five stars.
0345529057|5.0|What can I say about the books? They're just perfect, everything in them. As for the box set in particular I found it to be more than what I have expected. The quality of the print is ok, and the covers have some little details worth of consideration. Even the shipping was fast, since I live in South America, only 3 weeks are... wow. The only thing I have to complain about is that the box came with a small crack, a bit crashed, but it's not Amazon's fault, just be careful with your post office :S
B004XQO90E|5.0|I'm like another user, I won't go into lengthy details, but this dude gives an Oscar winning performance! This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I haven't been into a movie like that in a while! Thrilling! Exhilarating! Heart pounding! Just get it!
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Great game for tactic and rpg lovers. Elite version is a must for any star trader fans. You wont be disapointed.
B004EPYZXK|1.0|There are enjoyable bad movies that make you laugh and then there are bad movies that make you curse for wasting your hard earned money. Apollo 18 is the latter. The premise is that moon rocks are deadly aliens waiting to turn you into blood dripping guys with blood shot eyes! I guess whoever wrote the screenplay of this godforsaken movies couldn't quite make up their minds: zombies or hemorrhagic plague victims who miraculously no longer need air. Next off there is zero atmosphere on the moon. Sorry there is no life. If there was any life at one time it was sterilized by the sun's radiation billions of years ago. If there is any life, it would be microbial and it would have a hard time knocking over flags and tipping over land rovers! Next the government has sent four previous Apollo missions to the moon. By that time if something kinky is going on do you think they would send three of the most highly (and expensively) trained men on earth to certain death just to set up a bunch of monitoring cameras? Please! A simple quarantine would do! The aliens don't have factories building rocket ships! And if the moon rocks are so dangerous, what are the astronauts doing bring MORE back to earth? Duh? Sorry, tea-party fantasies aside, even the U.S. government is not that moronic.<br /><br />This is a depressing and boring film that leaves you feeling empty when you leave the theater. The only reason I sat through it was because I was hoping with all my heart that something unpredictable would happen. It's never a good sign that about half through the movie you know exactly how it's going to end. I'm a sucker for science fiction but this is the last straw! I've learned my lesson and I'm going to read the reviews carefully next time!

0553386794|4.0|and murder will likely find this to be a pretty good read.<br /><br />I purchased Game of Thrones because of its popularity with Amazon.com readers, thinking that my 12-year-old bookworm son, a fan of fantasy, might like it. Fortunately, I decided to preview it before handing it off to him, during which I quickly realized that I was wrong. The book's mature themes and graphic descriptions of violence place it squarely in a category best left for adults. Although fantasy is not a genre I generally seek out, I found Mr. Martin's storytelling utterly entertaining, in spite of its above average level of brutality, the descriptions of which left me feeling nearly queasy. The author develops his cast of over 200 characters well and is somehow able to flawlessly keep track of the extreme number of interrelationships required to put together a compelling story about, as the title says, the \\"game of thrones,\\" a phrase characters use throughout the book. Thankfully for readers, the author includes an appendix cataloguing the seven different families, their relative relationships, and other relevant information, which should not be referred to unless absolutely necessary as it includes some spoilers. The book's hook, provided in the prologue is intriguing; members of the Night's Watch have a run-in with some otherworldly characters. Its first chapter is told from the perspective of Brandon \\"Bran\\" Stark, the seven-year-old son of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, in which he sees his first execution. In the second, Eddard's wife, Lady Catelyn learns that her sister's husband, Jon Arryn has died under suspicious circumstances. Eddard Stark suspects the king, a longtime friend, will ask that he accept the responsibility of becoming the King's Hand. The author spends the rest of the 600 plus pages spinning an intricately plotted tale, alternately told from the perspectives of these former three, plus two of Bran's sisters, his half brother, a spunky little person named Tyrion Lannister, and a brave, proud 13-year-old named Princess Daenerys. The \\"game\\" involves such things as: honor, violence, betrayal, revenge, the consumption of an entire uncooked horse's heart (as well as fermented mare's milk \\"thick with clots\\"), and to top it off...sex between siblings. In summary, readers who enjoy fantasy and can tolerate the bad behavior that tends to go along with warring royalty, will likely find Game of Thrones to be a thoroughly entertaining story. Also good: Watership Down by Richard Adams, The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.and a brave, proud 13-year-old named Princess Daenerys.

031261246X|5.0|In these days when IT security becomes more and more important. This book shows a scary realistic picture of what IT security is about. The story that is written like a movie takes the reader through scenarios that show how much we depend on connected systems and how connected systems can ruin our lives when terrorists take over.     I think that every IT Pro and IT Manager should read this book. It will make them aware of the rat race that we are in today and that just installing security software will never be enough to secure our business (and lives).
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Great product..just wish it were easier to find!! I guess they are slowing doing away with this type of card, so buy it now!!
0439023521|4.0|My high school book club is filled with the type of kids who still read Harry Potter yearly, who have breezed by Percy Jackson and moved on to adult(ish) things. As hard as we tried to read some serious literature, we all were craving an \\"easy read\\" that would be fun and exciting for a children's novel. This book satisfied our apetites, but it did not blow us away.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is about Katniss Everdeen, a young girl in a horrible future who must hunt to feed her family. Society has decayed to the point where children are forced to competes as tributes in a government sponsored event called The Hunger Games, brutal live TV that resembles something between \\"Survivor\\" and \\"The Running Man\\".<br /><br />The plot has a lot of setup before it gets started, and as such, the first few chapters are littered with soapbox rants about everything the government has done wrong in the future and all the complex systems its formed to feed the people and such. Not exactly a thrilling opening, but these first few scenes begin the tangled relationships nicely, and they lay down the rules of the road for not just this book, but the other two volumes in the series as well.<br /><br />One thing that really stands out about this book series is that it is a refreshing mix of basic \\"complex relationship\\" style plot (a la classic authors like Jane Austen and Emily Bronte) and a more \\"action-oriented\\" storyline along the lines of Tom Clancy or Clive Cussler. All of this in a young adult novel! Granted, Suzanne Collins has her moments of predictability, and the pace drags a bit during the actual games, when it isn't about the marriage between action and story, and mostly about just action, but she draws great characters and there are definitely some great twists along the way.<br /><br />The biggest flaw of this book-- and the rest of the series as a whole-- is the lack of credibility. The writing comes across like this is a possible outcome of the present society, but in no way illustrates exactly how our country squandered into a measly, grim setting as that of the novel. Once you accept that this is pure fantasy, however, the book becomes quite fun, and even the more ridiculous aspects become interesting.<br /><br />This book is great, and could easily work as a stand-alone novel. In all honesty, I almost wish I stopped with this one. [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] is a decent sequel, although dissapointing. Read that one if you need more. But [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]] kind of ruins the series and makes me regret continuing on to finish the story.<br /><br />Kids should definately read THIS book. Whether they want to continue on and read the whole series, leave that up to them. With the new movie coming out, they may want to. My full reviews of the next to books will be coming soon.untry squandered into a measly, grim setting as that of the novel.

It is very sturdy and can handle little hands, it is colorful, bright and inviting, and is interactive and fun!    I'm definately happy with my purchase and hope to find more books like it from this author. :)
030788743X|5.0|Answer yes to any of the statments below, and you will most likely find this book enjoyable....<br />1) You remember the thrill of finding the black dot in Atari's Adventure.<br />2) You know what it means to type global thermal nuclear warfare when a computer asks you what game you should play.<br />3) You know what a flux capacitor is.<br />4) You know what it means when someone places quarters on an arcade game.<br />5) You've ever made the shape of a cross with your arms to pretend to shoot laser beams.<br />6) You know the origination of the theory that witches weigh the same as ducks.<br />7) You know who Mallory, Alex, and Sam are.<br />8) You remember when MTV played videos and showed the Title, Artist, Record Company, Recording year at the opening of every video.<br />9) You remember when the best computer games came on giant squares of floppy plastic, required a separate cassette deck to save, and featured nothing but text descriptions of what you saw.<br />10) You still are reluctant to give quarters out to make change because you never know when you will find that mythic arcade of your youth where table top versions of Donkey Kong, Wizard of Wor, and Defender reside alongside the Pacman, Asteroids, and Burger Time games.<br /><br />Now is this book as original and well written as the sci-fi classics like say Enders Game...no.  Is it as viscerally entertaining as the Hunger Games...no.  Is it as mind bending as the Matrix universe...certainly not.  But if you have fond memories from any of the items in my list above, this title will be worth every penny.  You will smile like an idiot over some fond memory from your long forgotten youth. You will laugh out loud at some forgotten reference, movie line, or song.  You will revel at how geeky you actually are even if, like me, you knew you were a geek to begin with.  And then after it ends you will wish that such a game existed so you could immediately plunge into the world again.

B003INBNXO|4.0|Watching a Hong Kong action films is a hit-and-miss affair. Some are great, some so-so, others just terrible, and ever-prolific actor Donnie Yen is no exception. As for his 2008 film \\"Ip Man,\\" an action-packed bio-pic loosely based on the life of the martial arts legend Ip Man (and master of Bruce Lee), this is definitely a hit.    Set in the bustling city of the 1930s Foshan, the movie follows the story of Ip Man (Donnie Yen), a mild-mannered martial arts grandmaster respected in the community, whose life undergoes a drastic change when Japanese army invades China. Now impoverished, Ip Man works at a coal mine, where some of the workers are chosen by the Japanese soldiers to fight at the dojo of the Japanese general and karate practitioner Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi).    One of the greatest assets of the film is, of course, its powerful martial arts fight sequences choreographed by Sammo Hung, especially the two battles between Donnie Yen and Fan Siu-wong as the leader of travelling martial arts fighters challenging Ip Man.  It is also notable that Donnie Yen has successfully created a unique heroic figure, an accomplished martial arts master of the Wing Chun style, who is also a wealthy family man. His likable portrayal of Ip Man greatly helps make the character believable, together with Donnie Yen's amazing martial arts skills (including the super-fast punching that will be seen in the sequel again).     The storyline itself is pretty familiar, but acceptable. One thing I didn't like about the film is its rather short climax. Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, himself a judo practitioner, does his best as a Japanese general and karate fighter, but as a martial artist he is obviously no match for seasoned professional like Donnie Yen. \\"Ip Man\\" needs someone more convincing as a fighter, like Hiroyuki Sanada or actors of that caliber.     Still, \\"Ip Man\\" is an exciting martial arts action film, much better than Donnie Yen's previous \\"Flash Point.\\" With the excellent musical score of Kenji Kawai, \\"Ip Man\\" is one of the most impressive action films from the Hong Kong film industry of the new millennium. Also, don't forget the sequel where Sammo Hung himself appears opposite Donnie Yen.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|\\"Revelator\\" is a strong set.  \\"Midnight In Harlem\\" sounds like a kissing cousin to \\"Rainy Night in Georgia\\" with the organ setting a moody late-night reflective feel, Susan's voice passionate and Derek's lead guitar oozing emotion.  \\"Learn How To Love\\" pulses with a bluesy vocal by Susan Tedeschi, \\"So take my hand & follow me to ecstasy.\\"  \\"Love Has Something Else to Say\\" is a funky workout with a whirlwind of pulsing rhythm.  When I saw the first song on this set was \\"Come See About Me,\\" I thought it would be a cover of the old Supremes' hit. It's not!  This is a strong set that whets our taste for more.  Enjoy!

B000KLRUJS|5.0|I bought this Elektra on LP when it first appeared in about 1967 and have treasured it ever since.  The reason is Birgit Nilsson as Elektra.  The reviewers who said it's one of the great all time recorded performances are not exaggerating.  Strauss wrote a work with an enormous orchestra in the pit, but the soprano singing the lead part has to be heard.  What Strauss heard in his imagination and put on paper creates serious challenges for the lead.  She needs extraordinary stamina, a superb upper register, volume, acting ability, good diction, and physical credibility in her death dance at the conclusion.  Everything, in other words, except coloratura.<br /><br />Nilsson is commanding throughout.  She sings all the notes (there are no cuts in this version), sings them in tune, gets in the character's skin.  The role of Elektra has most of its other exponents sounding strained because of Strauss's demands.  However, Nilsson's gleaming high register and extraordinary stamina allowed her to sing and act the part without forcing.  Her subtle characterization matches the febrile intent of the libretto and music.  Her exchanges with Klytaemnestra, taunting her with what will happen to her when Orest returns, are extraordinary--the diction, command of the notes, and the rapid tempo give a feverish and intense feeling, topped with a tremendous high C and B at the end of the scene.  The recognition scene is equally compelling in its own way.  Later, as her brother Orest strikes the fatal blows at Klytaemnestra offstage, Elektra's cry for her brother to strike yet again is, well, electrifying.  (Sorry about the pun).  And those high notes!  Was there anything ever like them?  No swooping, no cheating, no cutting them off, no wobble.  This is an extraordinary performance because it fully realizes what is in the score, and the human dimension implied in the libretto.  Comparably great performances in recorded opera are few--very few.  I've heard the other Elektras on CD; many have great virtues, but none puts the whole package together as Nilsson does.<br /><br />Decca/London's opera sets of the 60s during the John Culshaw era were theatrical for sure, and this one is no exception.  It seems clear that this hyperdramatic opera was an irresistable temptation for the producer to go all out with vivid sound effects.  Many of them are effective, but one can take or leave some of them.  Marie Collier has a tense tone and overplays the neurotic side of Chrysothemis.  Her electronically enhanced wailing at one point seems overdone.  The bottom of the barrel echoes around Regina Resnik's voice as she cries \\"Lichter, mehr Lichter\\" (Lights! More lights!) after her scene with Elektra are fairly extreme, too.  Resnik is magnificent nonetheless as the creepy Klytaemnestra.  If you know Gerhard Stolze from the Solti Ring or Salome you know what to expect of him as Klytaemnestra's lover Aegisth.  He plays Aegisth as an effete weakling.  It's pretty campy, but it works.<br /><br />Solti is Solti.  Give a conductor who loves drama a score like this, a unique lead soprano who can meet his demands, plus the Vienna Philharmonic, and fasten your seatbelt.<br /><br />Can you tell I like this recording?virtues, but none puts the whole package together as Nilsson does.

0618918248|5.0|What is it about the human race that allows it to hold on to ridiculous ideas in the face of overwhelming evidence? Just as the media have sold us the official story of 9/11 in the face of overwhelming evidence of an inside job, we have reached the 21st century with a majority of adult persons either believing or pretending to believe in the notion of deities. The evidence is clear: Man invented gods to serve his own purposes, at first to try to deal with natural forces making his life miserable and eventually to allow opportunists among us to control the masses through mystery and ritual, aided and abetted by an educational system which makes critical thinking beyond the reach of most of us. We gave up Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. Come on, children, review your religious beliefs and confront reality. Start with Dawkins's book.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I would like to start off by saying that George Lucas \\"had\\" three awesome films that I have loved since was at least 7 years old.  Looking back on those films all I have to say is why Lucas why.  Why did you take one of the best trilogies of all time and pollute them with prequel trash such as Attack of the Clones.  Seriously what were you thinking.  I mean sure the effects were good, but movies are not just about flashy effects.  Take episode three for example.  It had one of the best openings I have ever seen and the lightsaber fights were simply stunning.  However it takes more than effects to make a great movie.  Moving on to your first special edition release in 1997.  I enjoyed them.  The changes were minor and did not change the pace of the films.  Then in 2004 you made yet another special edition.  The lighting made it seem like Luke's lightsaber was green in A New Hope (when it is supposed to be his fathers and BLUE!!!!) and having Hayden in Return of the Jedi was not really needed at all.  Now in 2011 you have made another special edition.  The biggest change being the Nooooooooooooo! in Jedi.  Why o why.  It was the best scene in the trilogy.  The original scene where Vader has to choose between the dark side and the light side. What made that scene so bad ass to begin with was because Vader did not say anything. And it drove home the fact that Obi-Wan was right and that Vader had become more machine then man, and the scene showed the audience that the \\"man\\" in Vader was struggling to overcome the machine qualities within himself. In the scene, Vader looks at his son then looks back at the Emperor and then Vader finally chooses the path of a Jedi and throws the Emperor to his doomed fate down the exhaust shaft.  The other changes like the CGI rocks in the Krayt Dragon scene and the Krayt Dragon call were changes that I could deal with however the Krayt Dragon call really does sound like a kid hitting puberty.  The Ewoks I lids really did not need to be changed either.   This is why I say Why Lucas Why.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|Kudos to those that brought Hobbits, Narnia and Harry Potter to the screen.  Everyone knows how hard it is to bring a book to life, and those that read the books expect to be a little disappointed with the movie.  It's obvious that the makers of Percy Jackson (the movie) weren't looking to make sequals.  It's unfortunate because it could have been the next big money maker.  If you didn't read the book, then I guess it's not a bad movie - if you did read the book, then avoid this movie at all costs.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas in 1996... \\"On your special edition, do you expect any backlash from fans who might resent your tampering with a classic?    I don't know. It's my classic. On the one hand, I'm doing this, while on the other hand I'm on the Artists Rights Board, a foundation that's trying to protect films from being changed--which I feel very strongly about, because with the technology we have today, anybody can go back and do this kind of thing. I can sort of see the future, and I want to protect films as they are and as they should be. I don't want to see them colorized, I don't want to see their formats changed, I don't want to see them re-edited, and I don't want to see what I'm able to do now, which is add more characters and do all kinds of things that nobody even contemplated before.\\"    Lucas, in 1988 testimony before Congress said:    People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.  In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.  Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.

Admit it, if you got a new Flash Gordon Blu-Ray that collected all the original serials, and there was new audio or new CGI elements that were nothing like what you remembered from your childhood, you'd be pissed. Please, give the fans what they want -- theatrical cuts on Blu-Ray.

That being said, it could've used one or two more fun songs to really dance to, but overall, it's worth buying.
0439023513|2.0|My high school book club all read [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] together after we were bored and looking for something that would play into the inner-circles of our young-at-heart-but-teenage bodies. Needless to say, the first book was a satisfying adventure. Most of the other kids in the club moved on (as did I) but a few kids decided to finish the series, and we had some talks of our own discussing each and every novel. One common reaction for everyone who actually took the time to finish this book was dissapointment.<br /><br />(There are Spoilers below for those who have not read Book #1 or #2. There are no spoilers for this volume)<br /><br />Mockingjay picks up basically where [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] left off. Katniss is basically aligned with District 13, she is stuck in a (forced) love triangle between Peeta and Gale, and life in Panem basically sucks. Katniss and the other members of District 13 must align and prepare themselves for war against the malicious President Snow.<br /><br />Now, I am going to try and take this step-by-step. The book needed to wrap up 1) Katniss' story with District 13, 2) The Love triangle, and 3) the fate of Panem as a whole. It does that. It does that fine. If all you care about is closure, you will receive some. But *how* all of this occurs is not the right way to do it, most of it is the easy way out. ( I won't give any examples because of Spoilers, but other reviewers have commented on this exact issue as well).<br /><br />The writing angle of the series changes drastically with this entry. Katniss is no longer the strong, independant young woman we saw who volunteered herself for her sisters' place in Book 1. Not that she wouldn't do that again, of course she would. She loves her sister very much. It's just that Katniss has become very touchy-feely with her narration of events. In this novel( especially toward the ending/resolution), the story becomes less about what is happening, and more about how Katniss feels about what is happening. This might not be a bad thing if the issues were of such polarizingly realistic stakes, but they really aren't.<br /><br />In Catching Fire, I felt that the love triangle developed a little quickly, but it was at least semi-plausible. With Mockingjay, Katniss is constantly thinking and weighing her emotions toward either Gale or Peeta. The whole presentation comes off as sloppy and a tad irreverent. I was hoping that, since the reader (and author) has spent 2 books with these characters already, we could have some deeply-rooted conflicts. But Katniss' dillema never really expands beyond upon the daisy petal antics of \\"He loves me, He loves me not\\", and the conclusion to this \\"major\\" problem gets wrapped up neat and tidy and VERY quickly, with a plot device out of nowhere.<br /><br />Many things went wrong with this entry, but many things went right. Suzanne Collins has shown her talent in weaving some interesting socio-political commentary into character's interviews and public outings, and she continues that trend in Mockingjay. Its a stark contrast, because the meaning behind the capital's interviews and the meaning behind District 13's are quite different. Also, except for a few silly sections, this book has some decent pacing, so it will keep you entertained.<br /><br />All in all, this is a sadly unnoteworthy ending to what was a fantastic series. I don't like to ret-con my feelings about books, but this book actually made me rethink my stance on the other two in the series. Instead of the action packed, pulling all stops finale it should have been, it really just came across as a cheap Twilight immitation, minus the vamps and werewolves. If I could have, I would've stopped with the Hunger Games, which was satisfyingly self contained (with only a few loose ends). Maybe then I wouldn't have NEEDED to know what happened to all the characters from Catching Fire.atniss feels about what is happening.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|No need to review these films.  George Lucas had dollars on his mind the minute he realized the merchandising potential of what he created right after the first film.

Spend it wisely, George!
0439023491|4.0|[[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] was an intriguing foray into the world of Panem, a futuristic America where Children are forced to compete as \\"tributes\\" in a nationally sponsered survivor-esque battle royale. My high school book club read it looking for an interesting children's novel, what we got instead was an action-packed book that can be read on many levels, kids to adults. A few people stopped at just the Hunger Games, but me and a few others decided to continue on. I have published reviews for the other books in the series if you click on my account.<br /><br />Catching Fire is the continuation of Katniss's, Peeta's, and Gale's story from the first novel. Panem is having its world famous \\"Quarter Quell\\", a special version of the games that takes place every 25 years. These competitions have special rules, and for this one, the rule is that all the competitors in this challenge have to have won in a previous Hunger Games session. Katniss, who would have been exempt from future hunger games forever, now finds herself forced to re-enter the awful tradition.<br /><br />This entry in the series finds the development of a Love triangle. These are becoming more and more popular in teenage literature these days, and I guess Suzanne Collins is obviously jumping on the bandwagon. Although the triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale seems a tad forced, Collins does a good job developing the complexities between these star-crossed lovers.<br /><br />One thing I personally enjoyed about this novel is that the actual games were far more interesting this time around. Once again, there is the political interviews that occur before the games, there are shocking lies presented to the public in order to make the viewers win over some \\"gifts\\" from public investors. The Actual Games, however take place in an stadium that is much more interesting than the \\"bleak northern forest\\" of the first novel. I don't want to spoil anything, but there are many twists in this setting.<br /><br />Katniss as a character proves to be developing and maturing as a strong young woman. Beneath her child-like bow-and-dress public fashion statment, she has a rough core that has been forged in the woods surrounding District 12.<br /><br />This isn't just a good sequel, it works well as an individual book, as well. Unfortunately, the next entry in the series, [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]] isn't as great, but this and the Hunger Games are two very good books, for anyone of any age.r /><br />Katniss as a character proves to be developing and maturing as a strong young woman.

Great Casting and best of all -- Great monkeys.    This is based off the real story of planet of the apes. Watch it now!!!

B000002UVX|5.0|I was 16 years old and had already been a very frequent visitor to Bill Graham's Fillmore East. But who could resist seeing our favorite guitarist play there New Year's Eve for the late show?  The Fillmore was relatively small venue and our seats on the balcony were very good.  At the stroke of midnight a giant Joe's Light Show clock on the stage screens shows the most incredible 1960s decades bowing out in seconds.  We could dream what the 1970s had in store for us...and Jimi Hendrix was the first to lead us there with Auld Lang Syne.  This new Band of Gypsies was very different from the Experience, but with Jimi at the helm, just as incredible.  We could still hear Hendrix's wailing guitar in the sounds of the subway hours after the concert was over.  What a way to enter the 1970s!  This album always brought it all back to me in living detail...
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great App. Saves me a tone of time trying to text or email something. I love this app. i think the only other thing that would make this app better is it had an option to swipe text.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Mojo is perhaps another turning point in Tom Petty's long, forever searching career. Always keeping true to himself and duly helped by Mike Campbell and his other Heartbreakers buddies, Tom just keeps evolving and writing great music. This time around, he brings us an astonishing album with a blues flavor along with room for some Zeppelin twists, echoes of original blues players from a far-away past but totally done in his own inimitable way: this, mind you, is still very much Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. I'm amazed at how this album sounds so fresh and organick, free from anything that's untrue. And yes, this is done in 2010! Such great news.    I must make sure it's pointed out that songs such as First Flash Of Freedom, The Trip To Pirate's Cove, I Should Have Known It and the closer Good Enough are all classic, great examples of the diverse sounds this band can produce. Also, Takin' My Time, Running Man's Bible and Something Good Coming are other obvious highlights.    Mike Campbell is maturing like good old whiskey, his playing so sure of itself like a secret within the music. His contribution shouldn't be ignored or understated: he's key to all Tom Petty's projects.     The album is also very well produced, making this seasoned band sound relaxed and solid, real tight. It's impressive that at this point in time, after so many past highlights and 35-year-old career, Tom Petty manages to create this gem of an album, one which will resonate for a while in my head and probably will make me rethink the future of credibility in rock. The mojo's still working...

B001FOPODS|4.0|It's an artistic and intelligent presentation of Peter and the wolf. I am fond of it, My grand-children, 8,8 and 6 who where fed from age zero with Walt Disney and Japanese comics where surprised, and not really pleased. But now they adore it when their mother tells the story. I think the best way to give the little ones a resl pleasure is to first tell them the full story before watching the DVD.  Lily.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally worked on my DROID X after I did a system update. Graphics aren't as good as they are on PC but I didn't really expect them to be. It's the same great game at its core.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm boycotting this release like I did with the Lord of the Rings Bluray Theatrical release. Don't buy this release until they fixed ALL of the problems!
B0054N73EY|5.0|I am going to do a track by track review of this new album from RHCP, then some other thoughts :)     Monarchy of Roses: The beginning, sounds like Anthony is being put through a tunnel or something, then breaks into this disco/pop sounding chorus, with a very fast, disco guitar part. The best part of the chorus, is the back-up vocals made by, If I'm not mistaken, Josh. Not exactly their best track of all time. 2/5     Factory of Faith: The song opens with a kickass bassline from Flea, and some drums. At points, I even hear some techno drums. It just sounds really cool, and this soung could've fit on one of the earlier albums, with Anthony's slight raps, and what-not. The new guitarist, Josh, brings in a VERY background guitar part. Like a \\"blink and miss it\\" one, but in the end, it gets into this cool \\"wah\\" guitar sound. The chorus also brings a classic RHCP sound. This song is a great recovery from track 1. 4.5/5    Brendan's Death Song: The song opens up with the sound of Acoustic guitar. Very clean, and great sounding acoustic guitar. Then, as Anthony's vocals kick in, you realise that this man's voice has in fact, improved. This song then breaks into a rockin' and cool song. Flea's bass part is distant at first, but gradually kicks in, same thing with Chad's drums. Sounds kind of like a song on \\"By the way\\" or an album around that time. A worthy track from this album, and one of the best. 5/5    Ethopia: This song starts off, again with another kick ass bass-line. The lyrics seem very corny, and the guitar under the voclas makes the song feel scattered. But then, the chorus comes. This chorus sounds like \\"Dani California\\". It has that vibe, the signature RHCP sound again. Josh's solo is basically the same pattern over and over again. Nothing to write home about. Basically, this song is all Flea, and Anthony. 4/5    Annie Wants a Baby: The song starts off AGAIN with Flea (Which is a great thing!), and it sounds like his bass is trying to mimic the \\"By the Way\\" guitar part, which sounds rather cool. Then the drums kick in, then guitar along with Vocals from Anthony. The song breaks into this very mysterious sound, right before the chorus. Very cool. When the chorus kicks in, it sounds like a new RHCP song. I can't really compare this one to any other song. The guitar is to be noted for this track though, I think that Josh's part brings alot to the song. 4.5/5    Look Around: This track reminds me of a track from \\"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\". You get to hear Anthony rap again, which is always good. The bassline is very pimp (haha), the drums are consistent and great, the guitar is... distant, much like all the other tracks on this album, but it still fits pretty good. I even hear some orchestra in the background at some points in the verses. One of the greates things about this song, The break at the near end goes into a 90s sounding guitar part, overlapped by hi-hat, and Flea's slap bass, which sounds amazing. This song is definately one to be remembered from this album! 5/5    The Adventures of Raindance Maggie: The first single from the album. This song starts off with, yet again, another bassline, overlapped by drums. It kind of sounds like it was all recorded in the same room, together. Anyway, the guitar part sounds like he is playing only licks, and noodling around. Anthony's vocals sound like Classic RHCP, once again. This song really does sound like a radio hit, such as Californiacation, Scar Tissue, and the others. And, there's also cowbell! How great. I got used to this song after a while. It takes time for this track to really grow on you, and when it does, it gets stuck in your head, and goes down to be a good new single. 4.5/5    Did I let you Know: This song starts off with  brilliant drumming from Chad, then goes into this Jazzy sounding bass and guitar. Anthony's vocals sound great, like always, especially in the chorus. It sounds like a new sound for RHCP, but it really does fit them good. It goes into a solo with a trumpet in the middle, which sounds very, very cool, and fits the song very perfectly.This song is one to be played in the summer at an event, or boardwalk or something. The guitar solo from Josh is also a very good one, that sounds kind of, like \\"You Never Give me Your Money\\" by the Beatles! It has that feel with the time signatures and notes. Remember, you don't need to play 500 mph to have a great solo. This track is an excellent one. 5/5    Goodbye Hooray: This song sounds like a classic, early RHCP sound. It was one that caught my attention while I was listening, and still does catch my attention. The guitar is the standout in this song, along with Anthony's awesome vocals. Mid section of the song, the song turns into this mysterious, \\"Spacey\\" song. It sounds really cool, and is a great turnaround for the song. Overall, this is one of the greatest on the album. 5/5    Happiness Loves Comany: So Happy together with a mix of Good Day Sunshine. That is basically what this song is. The song opens with a piano part, that sounds VERY much like \\"So Happy Together\\", and then goes into a chorus that kind of had me thinking \\"Good Day Sunshine\\". And to add to the \\"So Happy Together\\" thing, I even hear \\"BA BA BA BA!'s\\" in this song as background vocals! Overall though, this song is a great one! Anthony's vocals sound BEYOND improved, and the addition of Xylaphone (Idk I spelled that right), Piano, and all of the other RHCP specs, this turns out as a great, experimental song. 4.5/5    Police Station: Oh my. This song may have a corny name, but it is definately one for the books. The guitar has a certain \\"Wah\\" effect on it, that stands out over everything. Then Anthony's vocals kick in. His vocals in this song, sound better than anything he has ever done. Quite really. This song is a perfect one. A laid back, chill, and uplifting song, that brings a chorus in that sounds magnificent. 5/5    Even You, Brutus: The song kicks off with a depressing piano/guitar and bassline, but then goes into this \\"Jamaican\\" sounding track. It sounds like a track off of \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magyk\\" in a way, actually. Anthony's vocals over power all other instruments, and he is Rapping once again, which fits so perfectly. This track is a worthy one. I really enjoyed listening to it, and hearing all of the instruments in it, which, once again, there are lots of far back minor instruments. I'm pretty sure that this song would go great at a Haloween party or something along the lines of that. It has a eerie/mysterious tone, that I personally love. 4.5/5    Meet Me at The Corner: Flea is playing chords on the bass, which sounds godly. The bass part almost acts like a guitar part, which is GREAT! Josh's guitar is very distant, apart from when he plays some high notes when you can hear it. Anthony sounds very mellow in this track, with the addition of the classic RHCP backup vocals. Chad's drum part is very far back, but it feels about right. In this track, we actually get to hear Josh sing on his OWN. It fits perfectly. I loved the addition of that, and it makes this track unique, and brilliant. 5/5    Dance Dance Dance: Meh. I don't like this song very much at all. It sounds like track 1. Disco and poppy, but I did love the chorus to this song. The chorus sounds like a TOTALLY different song, so its kinda' weird but, hey. 2.5/5    Overall, I am very pleased with this album. At first listen I was skeptical, but after the second time, I loved it so much. I'm not complaining about Josh. He adds good parts to these songs, and great backup vocals. Fleas bass has gotten BETTER, Chad's Drumming is really the same, but It still sounds as great as always. Anthony's vocals have improved Substantially. With the addition of 2 bad songs, this album is full of great tracks, to be remembered.     5/5 album.
B0053F042G|5.0|It's rare these days that I rave about a movie, but this is one of those rare few. If you're at all into science fiction or action films with an odd kind of a twist, I absolutely guarantee that you'll love this movie. Think of 12 Monkeys meets Groundhog Day. I don't want to give away too much. Just click to rent or own. You won't be disappointed. I'm going back to watch a 2nd time...
B000VWYJ86|1.0|Was waiting to write a review as I did not remember if I purchased from Amazon on from one of your contributors.  Purchased over a month ago and just placed in my DVD shelf.  We finally had a free evening a few days ago and dcided to watch it.  What a surprise there was no DVD in the sleeve.  Just put it aside because I did not know where to complain.
B000JIHP88|2.0|Like many other reviewers, our mobile had issues with spinning after a few weeks. The music played and the light worked, but when the parrot got to a certain point in the rotation it slowed down to a snail's pace for about a third of the rotation. I called Fisher Price and they were willing to replace the defective part. However, they wanted me to ship it to them before they would send out a new part, which they said would take 5-7 weeks (which was way too long to go without one for our then 3 month old). So I had to pay for a new mobile and wait to get a credit for the defective one. Almost immediately the new one also had issues and one of the leaves stopped flapping. This was a fairly minor issue but still frustrating.
