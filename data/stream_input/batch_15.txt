B0008F68MG|5|Did just what I wanted it to.
B00B9ANMDW|5|Great Tunnel Bag,<br />Thanking you for fast shipping.<br />Pat Reno.
B0031IBRZA|5|Fixed my car ...thanks
B00WAOS9B6|5|Thay fit great even my wife put on
B004N2KLSW|3|This fridge/freezer is ok.  Draws more power than claimed.  There was an issue with the lid.  Would pop off easy as they claim.  The adapter for car plug in doesn't fit well into universal car outlets.  They want you to buy there's.  Kinda a rip not to include it in my opinion when buying this $1000 item.  Or at least tell you it hardly works in a standard outlet.  Nice product overall but pretty disappointed with all the conflicts.
B008CE0O8E|4|They were as advertised and worked great. I used them to secure a dyna super glide custom and a street glide without issue.<br />The only note is that the bolts that come with it are designed to be used with a wooden trailer and did not work for me as my trailer had a steel bed.
B00QMO5ULM|5|It worked fine except need adapter for tranny lines. Its cool
B0013FSX8C|5|Me like!
B004JPTJ2W|5|good fit
B000C9E4Y2|5|Great price... Delivered promptly.  Saved $150 by installing myself.  It took about 15 minutes to accomplish.
B010VUZ99U|3|The &#34;diamonds&#34; were more like dimples to catch the light. So I was disappointed in that aspect. BUT for the price, it really was a good option.
B00HX1ZY7I|5|Love them, they look just like my original one. Great price for 2.
B000066OC7|5|great
B00L3ODK5E|5|Good price. Good product. Speedy delivery.
B007TY054Q|5|Got here on time and fit on jeep perfect
B007NU0FOQ|5|I put this on my truck and it reminds me of knightrider .great lights thank u
B0054T95ZS|5|very sturdy
B00DBRWVRY|1|Did not fit a stock 2009 c50. It clearly advertised that it did. Can only be used with after market grips. BEWARE.
B00VVFF93G|5|fit perfectly and runs great now my wife can see out the rear window
B001FCAXT0|5|Just the ticket for my motorhome battery refilling issues.  No more holes in my shirts, no more dread of doing this job.
B0026I5Z22|5|Our body guy was able to provide a clean install on a glass/carbon hood that already had conventional pins installed -- customer loved it.
B00IO95ILU|5|this items arrive on time, installed and like it.
B0031BJV6Y|1|When I received it the words were cut, had to return it.
B00U9YX4PU|4|Good product for the money asked.
B00MIJQCIK|5|It was a gift to a farmer and he immediately put it on his truck !!!!
B00JA3BMDW|5|Ordered by the League for Animal Welfare group in Cartersville, Georgia, these temperature guns will be used to outfit the local police and sheriff patrol cars. They will be used, in part, to read internal temperatures of cars with animals inside.
B00IJQOJEU|5|Works as advertised!! Coolant temps are 15 degrees lower, and the installation went smooth.  The hard thing was pulling out the old radiator.
B00UIPS8Y2|5|Very proud to put this on our truck window. Love it.
B00Q4JT0SE|5|Arrived timely and works great. Added to the front of my UTV for foggy/snowy driving- solid construction- is better than I thought it would be
B00MEQTQJO|5|Love, love it.....my car is silver and looks so good on it....Believe is my favorite word....
B0031C3UG0|3|Color matches perfectly but the paint is very thin.  After applying 3 or 4 times you can still see through it. But it's better than the chip on my bumper.
B00HXC908Q|5|Five DB drop either way installed. CLOSER to good lade back sound in reverse, want to sound like a beast mount the wider outlet out. I love the look and smoother tone of slime outlet out. Think there was more responsiveness on wide out. But I'm closer to 50 than 21 lol. Its my commuter.
B00ZOT9NNW|4|Works great came alose after first use but screwed back together
B00BYH6C1E|5|If you have a dog or kids it's a big help when it comes time to clean!
B00074Q2A6|5|serves the purpose.
B00684TIVE|5|Works as advertised. I was able to program both keyfob's myself from the included instructions.
B008VOLV5K|5|Bought this for my daughter who loves her farmer husband and the beef cattle they raise.
B0082GKQQW|5|I am very pleased with the floor mats. They were exactly as they were presented, they fit my SUV with very little trimming. I would highly recommend them.
B00495UQT2|5|Kewl!  The OEM replacement for my pump alone was $40.  This came with pump, bottle, wiring, hoses, connectors, nozzles and a push button actuator with its own bracket!  All I used was the bottle and pump, fed it into my existing system and wired it to the existing switch.  Works great!  The bottle even fits nicely in the bracket for the OEM bottle in my '65 Malibu.
B009FKWTO6|3|It fit, and it seems like decent quality but time will tell. The reason for only three stars is because the wiring harness is not the same as the OEM unit; it does not include the protection diode that is in the OEM harness (hidden underneath the protective flexible loom). The purpose of this diode is to protect the electronics from the back voltage spike that occurs when the clutch disengages and the magnetic field collapses. I wasn't comfortable with this so I cut off the old harness, diode and connector and soldered them on the new unit. I shouldn't have had to do this. Maybe this diode is buried within the new coil itself, but it was not stated anywhere so for safety reasons I must assume it isn't or risk having to buy a new ECM when it takes the hit and dies.
B000CFAVAM|5|Great product. Fit perfect and stuck on there better than I thought. Looks great on my 04 dakota, would buy again.
B00FL1XJLK|5|Fits great, warm for my cold ride to work at 4:30 am. Love this jacket
B00L843CK2|5|Came on time and was very happy with the product!
B00USBXI9Q|3|Good quality
B004IA92V6|5|The older I get I find the smaller things I work on. I like having them. They work just fine!
B00CMC5DII|5|great buy !
B004D5H3TO|5|Great Service and Product
B00CFXA2DK|5|Great product
B003IXABO6|1|It slit open releasing all of the gel while getting it wet before its first use.  It was a waste of money.  I spent $14.99 for the real cool pad/towel and it was worth it.  You get what you pay for.
B0049IKSJM|1|Very expensive to be not what I was looking for
B0000AZ53A|5|Perfect
B00B9EXNTQ|5|Got here quick! Really happy
B00N42XB70|5|These are just what I needed to fix my hanging exhaust on my grandsons 110 Chinese made four wheeler.
B002L1F9BQ|5|With some cutting to three shafts, it fit my 79 Scout. Much better than a stock rag joint. Tight and high quality.
B00DILDTAG|5|Oem feel and quality on build. Perfect for a daily driver. Couldn't find the oem anywhere. And cheaper too. The uerothane ones vibrated too much and I took them off. A pain to replace but doable from the top.
B001HMV1PI|5|It works great ...
B004QHOOE6|5|Look great and paint never chipped or came off
B00GXRK2A2|1|They didnt fit but they give me a refund!
B00EP29FGE|5|Very  happy with my  purchase
B0093RRSXS|2|they didn't fit at all for the nissan altima. they're too narrow
B001NND4VA|5|these have served our rzr utv awesome having to make some brackets to hold benefits the driver well as too the grandma passenger to see the grandchildren cargo!!!!
B001GN1GKS|3|Great way to protect the trailer hitch tube when not in use.  Keeps dirt out.  Heavy metal so will not break.  But - not the usual quality I have come to expect from CURT.  The paint on the item looks as if it were put on by preschoolers.  Lots of bubbling and I would expect that it will peel after awhile.  But for the price and its function I cannot complain.
B005WBZY58|5|I got the base 2013 Fit model used at the Honda dealership. Not having a center console bothered me. I got accustomed to an armrest. I like this one a lot as it provides flexibility in so many ways. I lost one or two of my car's 10 cupholders so it came at a price (lol). But seriously, it does work well and it was a cheaper alternative. And if I need it gone? Pick it up and slide it out. Boom, done! Better than buying the OEM part and tearing apart the car and putting it in myself, that's for sure.
B001Q8IXW2|4|Product works great.  I used them to apply a vinyl protectant to my car's roof.  Easy to use.  Only draw-back is I had to wash them twice to get the protectant out.  Not sure if that's the protectant or the applicator.
B00UG52P7U|1|It's way smaller than I thought. My son had trouble accessing the touch sensor on the tablet we have. The plastic pocket isn't sensitive enough. There's no way to secure the bottom half of the organizer to the seat. It hangs loose and swings, which is worse when the front passenger has the seat leaned back just a little.
B000EQVY50|5|excellent. thoroughly recommended . meets the expectations
B00TWOFAKA|5|Very cool!!!
B004L1Z4J6|5|The pads went on my F-350 dually without any problems, they are very quiet and there is no squeal at all. So far it seems like they have very good stopping power and fade resistance. One thing to note is the instructions that were included cover several different types of replacement pads and since these are they ThermoQuiet pads do not use any type of noise dampening type of compounds on the rear of the pad such as Permatex Disc Brake Quiet. I also have not noticed any appreciable amounts of brake dust build up, but time will tell.
B00YGBNIPI|5|Arrived a week before it was scheduled to arrive, easy to assemble, love this product!
B00NXRXXBU|3|Never snaps hard into place like others. much bigger connection piece, a little distracting
B0015DMJ2S|5|Great product
B000C9FOA0|4|OEM quality, perfect fit on my 02 Yukon SLT 5.3L, just make sure you have a 4-wire, like this product as opposed to a 3 wire before you order. I originally ordered the 3-wire because amazon indicated it would fit my vehicle, but mine is a 4-wire. The product is 5 stars, but amazon's vehicle information is 4 stars and not always 100% clear if its the exact part for your vehicle. Try to use multiple sources to verify it will fit your vehicle.
B004FKWZL8|5|I put this shield on a biltwell bonanza, ir fit perfectly and looks gnarly. The plastic is very sturdy .
B00EPM4FBO|5|This is a well made piece, fit my '76 'Vette very nicely after I called to get the correct adapter.
B00Q62KJDO|1|It did not fit my tractor and had to return it.
B00DR67P9I|5|Pretty bright.
B00AZ4TU98|5|Worked great had one Crack from shipping though
B002WQLS1K|5|super  they look great my wife loves them thanks
B006N9FHEQ|3|Great product just didnt fit sadly
B000BUR9O4|5|Excellent
B000F5IKUC|5|Great range, good price Buy it.
B0048085AK|4|I actually use these for barrel racing practice for my horses. I love that they're the similar in width as a 55 gallong drum, would be nice is they were a bit taller though.<br /><br />The toggles at the bottom work decently to hold it in 'squished' form but they do pop open from time to time.<br /><br />They have also kept in good condition considering they live in my shed, get packed around by the horses, thrown to the ground, and sometimes hit durring practice. :D
B00I1ASC06|3|Take note only front interior and license plate lights can be replaced. Rear dome lights are different size!<br />They are bright too! Wish they had led for the rear.<br />Ford Explorer 2016 XLT
B0001EX1SI|4|satisfied with order.
B001P29ISW|5|According to the Ratech site, this fits: &#34;Model 20 AMC Axle  pn: 4105<br />7.5&#34;, 8.8&#34;, 9&#34;, 10.25, 10.5 Ford Axle  pn: 4105&#34;....
B0018PSASU|5|Works great, what more can one say out lube
B00U6QQ41C|5|Came fast, good price and look great.
B001SLEPB0|5|Great!!!
B00FDQPCR2|5|This was easy to install and is incredibly bright.  You can change how long the light stays on.  We have it in the breezeway between our garage and kitchen door to light up when we enter and leave at night.  We love it.  No issues at all.
B004MEH78S|3|This tape was used in conjunction with the headlight restore kit.  So, it is just barely wide enough to secure the painted areas around the headlights if you go slow enough.  This tape adhesive is not impervious to water so working with the restore kit involves use of some water which can cause the tape to detach easily from the trim.  Ah but what can you do but be careful in working with it all.
B00D5OFHJW|5|Love this just wish I can get them in a bigger bottle but great after a shower after a hard day at work love the way they smell going to order more!
B00GT0TQ3M|5|It stretches easily over the wheel and is super soft and fluffy!! It makes my car look nicer. I am very pleased with this product.
B001542N8C|3|Package was opened before ie not new..one bearing had been dropped ..with scrape marks on edges did not install and trashed.. use one of the two ordered working well.
B00ULNZ362|5|High quality.
B00BYH6C1E|5|This product seems to work great! My SUV has a seat gap that is practically impossible to get anything that falls down there and this product lives up to its description. It also comes with a cheap led flashlight and a gel stick pad!
B001C6NC7O|5|good price and product.
B00KO8DH4Y|4|I was able to fit 03 Range Rover wheels to Discovery 2 hub with this adapter.  I wish this was available in metal as it felt very thin for what it does; probably quarter of an inch or less in thickness.
B00MJNTP4S|4|Fits well. Looks good. A little noisy but not bad. I'm not sure if it works properly yet as I have not had the chance to wreck real good.
B0002ZG7M8|5|Clamps are really good
B00BTGSGFK|3|The microfiber quality seems pretty good, but both applicators I used ripped open. The spongy material that's wrapped inside the microfiber seems very loose and bunches up causing the fabric to be stretched out and pulled apart. They work but I think I would go with some that are more premium next time.
B005QZQ198|5|Initially, i ordered the Dorman belt tension for my 98 Saturn sl2 from rockauto.com to fix the clanking coming from the old belt tensioner. The first week it worked fine, but after that the noise came back just as badly as the one I replaced. After a few months, I went to amazon to see what everybody else had to say about the Dorman, and all the reviews were horrible. I looked at all the belt tensioners until I came to this ACDelco, and saw that all the reviews were positive. After replacing the Dorman with the ACDelco, putting the serpentine belt on the ACDelco was a huge pain compared to the Dorman because it was much stronger, but it's been a month and there's no noise at all! The Dorman is noticeably cheaper, but it is not worth it, spend the extra amount! I NEVER write reviews for products, but I felt this was serious enough to write one for it.
B002XL2IEA|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B000630G28|5|I've been using these for more than 15 years and love them.  I keep a clean filter on the shelf ready to just swap out when the in-service filter needs cleaning. Just remember not to over oil them to keep the MAF sensor from getting contaminated.
B000HE5G0S|5|Hose is a hose.
B00SJU0R1A|5|This jumper allows you to suppress the annoying dash messages when you are getting your seat belt fastened or when you are working on your Commander.
B00ABW7U6Y|5|Works great
B001P2QDT4|5|Fit is perfect
B008G2B0OE|4|Excess metal that was not trimmed properly makes it difficult to replace one of the low beam bulbs.  Fit was ok until the metal retainer that's supposed to slide down and secure the assembly into place can't go all the way down due to the &#34;tab&#34; being a bit too large.<br /><br />Otherwise, they work, come with bulbs, and look good
B0082365AQ|5|Hurt my neck carrying my kayah over my head... my left pinky and ring finger went numb. This product is way easier than carrying my kayak over my head for sure! Love it!
B003YI5PG4|5|Great product
B001OBF4FK|5|Good quality product, fits as intended on a 7 lug 2001 F150 7700.  Performs well.
B00AN5SJBY|5|Works great, improved stopping without all the dust.
B003SS62PS|4|The fan has noise but not a ridiculous amount. I have it in the back of my van for my kids because even with the AC on they say their hot. I put this in the back and they love it. I have a 4 month old that fell asleep even with the light noise. I would definitely buy again. It's well worth the price. The only hard part was finding a place to put it. I wish the clap was just a tad wider. But like I said overall it's good. If anything changes I will update my review.
B004GESG0W|5|Perfect fit. Excellent service!
B00IO8IP3Y|2|This is a great piece except far the little things that attached to the back of the head rest one of them will not stay it keeps popping back I don't know what to do with it if you have any explanations helpful hints let me know otherwise I think I'm going to return it thanks
B0071I3218|5|It's very good....and on time...
B00BCH4PLA|5|I bought this product in March and have been using it all summer with my 3 vehicles and 38 foot Boat.  The product works extreley well and has held up perfectly to date.  I also bought this with the the Snow Foam soap, in fact I ordered an entire case.  I never really thought you could spray your car, leave the snow foam on it for 5 minutes, rinse it off and presto your car would be clean as new and oh ya I was right.  This unit is in my opinion great for one thing and one thing only, saving you much time running to and from a bucket of suds. You spray your vehicle down after a quick powerwash of course to remove any dirt that if caught in your mitt could scratch you vehicle, cover your vehicle in soap from this cannon, let is sit for a minute then grab your wash mitts and just walk around your vehicle scrubbing without having to run to and from your bucket. You'd be surprised the time it saves you.  For less meticulous individuals looking for a quick and dirty clean up because your cars an absolute mess, yes you can spray your soap on, weight 5 minutes and your car will be much much cleaner than before......I happen to be that guy that washes his vehicles to make them look new again.  Great product, it works really well, its well built and saves me so much time on weekends, I would buy another if this one ever breaks
B003RWNTXI|5|Received earlier than expected and was easy to program.  Very happy 😆
B004GCGLQ0|5|Bumper fits perfectly for my 2002 Honda accord Dx. I've had no issues with installments. My paint job was a DIY, cost in total with 4-16oz. Base And 4-16oz. clear coat came out too $130.
B006UH5ZKC|5|Exact part as described in the add
B00NPIYDWU|5|Very bright and quite happy with these lights but the difference between running lights and brakes on could be a bit more pronounced.
B00OB8E1ES|5|Good item
B000G76OMA|3|Ok
B004X5QNYA|5|Super fast delivery... Product as described.... Great price....
B012Y0BHXC|5|Love it! I needed a new one, received the chance to review this and it was a great choice. Its very long so when u use it, it actually covers the dash completely and in return also stays up with out much propping other then the visors. Love the bright red too as i found when shopping and done, i can spot my car soo much quicker. Very durable material and folds up nicely and i just tuck into the side of one of my seats in the 2nd row. I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B005CLMEHE|5|This part was everything I needed and fit/worked perfectly for my 2006 Equinox
B00NF1T052|5|Removal of the old part and replacement of the new part was a quick and easy process that took only about 20 minutes .  The new part was the same if not better then the original part that was on my truck .
B000CKN76M|5|Great spicer quality. I don't buy anything else. I don't trust China junk on a driveline.
B000X9EGFS|5|Amazing - the only one my friends said to get and it works flawlessly
B000E28LOG|5|A drop in replacement for the original foam and screen style filter. Fit perfectly.
B00KFI1IYO|5|removed old pump and plugged new one in that easy
B002NAS2AU|5|Excellent fitment and service received part less than 48 hours after ordering would absolutely use again!
B001V3B4YG|5|Arrive not damaged and quickly.
B004J0P33Q|3|works good, a little loud though.
B00PV5DQV4|3|Not bad just don't fix my dodge truck
B003JCSDLE|5|Seems to hold up well. I've tried a lot  of covers for my waverunner rental business and these seem to be a good quality cover for the price.
B004D2XAMG|1|These bulbs melted after 2 weeks of use. MELTED.
B000CRER3C|5|fit
B00NAI5PHM|2|Tearing up to fast, only had it in my truck 2 weeks and it's already loosing fibers and bald spots
B009XA8GB8|5|Fit and works good.
B00D8ZA950|5|Best price on a quality strut.
B007NMX0VE|5|Perfect, just as advertised
B0051COC2E|5|As described
B00DOL0E76|5|Looks great! Perfect fit!<br />F.Y.I no gasket -need silicon and re-use drain plug.
B007JYYPO2|5|Just what it says it is in the ad. Perfect for our needs at work.
B00J9Y23SU|5|Great floor mats. Shipping was a nightmare by Amazon.com.
B003PYT1JO|5|These sun shades are great. They keep your car cool, fit well, and best of all, they to are VERY easy use.<br /><br />We had the roll up, bright silver shades in the past. Rolling them up is a pain, and after awhile they start to flake. When I got a Miata (2-seater) I needed something more compact. This shade is so easy to use. It goes in fast and folds instantly. I can stick it behind the passenger seat.<br /><br />My husband liked mine so much he got one for his Ford Transit Connect. He loves it. You will, too.  :-)
B000BQSLAO|5|works well!
B0075MREHI|5|Exactly what was needed and arrived on time.
B003V9TC10|1|2 of the 4 valves did not give me a reading when I used a pressure tester
B0019QFE1E|2|Paint not great.
B000O3M5CE|5|super
B009DK4XK6|3|item returned because connections did not match existing ones.
B0010DZZPG|5|Fit perfectly
B00DPI31N2|5|This unit worked great.  All I had to do was add the oil and power it up.  Have already used it on the intake system of two cars.  One car had some leaks and the other one was not leaking.  Could have never known for sure without this tool.  I hesitated to buy this due to the high price, but it is indeed a quality system.
B000J4GCV8|5|It does what it's supposed to and fits very snugly; unless you want to pull it out, it won't slip from minor tugs.
B00YJL67RQ|5|Product was of good quality and delivery was prompt.
B002YLYJ0U|1|Bought this thinking it was a good deal from BJ's - had it for a couple years and found you don't want to leave it without a charge during the heat of summer and the cold of winter cause it will lose it's charge and once it loses the charge and goes completely dead it will never recharge to be capable of starting anything again. Found it was fine to start my lawn tractor but not enough to start my pickup. The air compressor has not enough power to even bring a completely flat vehicle tire up to an acceptable pressure.
B00144ASC6|5|Killer stuff for plastic.  None better.  I heard they use this to clean fighter jet canopies!  If not they should👍👍👍👍5 star+++
B008OEQ6WU|1|i got mine in the mail like the add said I would but two hours of riding the rubber part of the filter stayed attached to my carb with the clamp, as for the filter its self lets just say its gone, fell off, I mean GONE thank you seller I love the product you sold me.
B00I53W494|5|Everything I wanted at a good price
B0030IMXEU|5|I have used this item for 5 years now. Recently bought this one for my wife. She told me &#34;if I did not get her one, she would take mine&#34;.  It by far is the best solution.
B00J4PFMF0|5|Super impressed with ship time as well as product. Looking forward to higher speed testing!
B00Y5GOS7G|1|This tow hook did not fit my 2005 Acura TSX.
B00ORAU79I|5|Quick shipping and great quality! Thanks!
B007L2JNT4|5|I couldn't be more pleased.  I installed these on my 2013 F150 after buying an 84&#34;-wide enclosed trailer on 102&#34; axles...too wide for me to see the traffic behind me with the stock mirrors.  After a 200-mile round trip, which included everything from interstate to rocky & muddy trails (I use my trailer to tow ATVs and then camp in it once I'm at my destination), the outer mirrors did not come out of adjustment.  There is a tiny bit of shake above 65MPH, but not bad.  I can easily see who's following (tailgating) me now.  The best part is they fit perfectly and absolutely look more like original equipment than an aftermarket add-on.  It takes less than 10 seconds to install or remove each side, and they came with a nice fabric bag to store the mirrors when not in use.
B00LCFHFXM|5|Great  Product
B0040D2RP4|4|GOOD
B00412UOTA|5|Worked perfectly
B0018ETWJ2|4|So far, the size LARGE fits me perfectly. I am 5'11&#34; and weigh about 195. The pants fit snug enough to not get in the way, but I know I could put another layer on if the weather was cold enough. The jacket fits snug over the top of my leather riding jacket, and the collar is stiff enough that I think it will help reduce the wind. I rode for about 40 minutes through a hard rain, and I was completely dry! So far, I really like them.
B00Q1F6LC4|5|Worked fine
B000NUES82|5|Great product works great in my MX5
B00DW6RUF2|4|Shiny would have been better however the product is great.
B00MHT8CM0|5|This was a awesome find. To change the oil filter on my Equinox required a 24MM Socket. They are only made in 1/2inch drive.  Adding a 3/8 adapter and wiggle joint made it even longer.  It was a struggle to get the oil filter cap off. This saves a lot of room and makes it so much easier.
B00H45R002|3|Im sure it has some extra protection over there spray wax, but this stuff is difficult to remove and it leaves streaks
B00681BE2S|5|Good price!
B009DJSP4C|5|Worth the money! These aren't cheap by any means. My Expedition has been running well with these since they were installed!
B00A14PUCS|4|I have not use it yet ,I waiting on some more parts, But it looks good
B0079ZD4BG|5|Awesome lights I love them and they look great on my car
B00D1CQVIY|5|This cable kit makes things a lot easier on you.
B002PBUS8Q|4|The pants are un-hemmed, which is good but the inseam on the size 34 was too short for me to hem and still have the length right. So no hem for me. My inseam is about 34. Aside from the shorter than preferred length, I like them.
B0096CJPPO|5|Best helmet I've ever owned. Extremely comfortable and fit true to size. No rise/movement  at high speeds. I paired it with the biltwell bubble shield and couldn't be happier with the result. Great look and performance.
B00NLQRTIG|5|Great helmet and even better deal!
B00JXLH7CG|5|Working great on two different KLR650s. No issues at all. I sealed the bottom and wire hole with silicone to prevent moisture issues others mention.
B00THH9I7I|1|Bulky for daily use, to big to pocket, Like the add said put in the glove or tool box to big for any other application. Cheap plastic you have to wait to get the reading and retry in most cases. Civilian tool at best. Pro's keep looking.
B00T8ZML64|5|Perfect , honestly Very good price and really good quality Im so satisfied I love it I hope later to put pic for my FJ
B000Q753B8|1|Completely disappointed in this product. Motor for cooling is not sewed in and popped out. After reinserting continued to have issues with it staying in place. Also it does not replace ice. The cooling is so light the beverages still get warm.
B00AK7VXDG|5|👍🏿
B004VF48YO|2|Wasn't what I expected!
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Great quality and looks great on my car.
B0051TPJKG|5|Great small fire extinguisher. Ideal for kitchen, garage and car. Small enough to hide almost anywhere.
B00G6UISRK|4|Easy to read and set up. Pressure relief button is in a good location. Not always easy to get on the valve when checking pressure.
B004A30UHG|5|easy hook up, works great.
B000C8ZAE6|5|It works
B001C6OZ48|5|I'm so glad I bought these. I thought the noise coming from the back of my jeep was normal until I installed these. These rubber stops really work to quiet your rear lift gate down.
B005XRQ694|5|Put these on my 2000 camaro, easy install, no problems and they look great. Totally renews the look of the whole car. Definitely worth doing if your headlights are faded/foggy/dull like mine were.
B00FSCEPYW|5|excellent. thoroughly recommended . meets the expectations
B0002SRCK6|4|works well
B00CMOV8SA|1|Save yourself trouble and pass on that. Unfortunately manufacturer have no idea about vw beakes. This kit will not fit any vw model be course  rotors are 312mm front and 286 mm rear and calipers are for 286 mm front and 260 mm rear. I lernd that hard way. Endless emails and explanations with pictures didn't resolve any issue. Just recived replacement calipers exactly same as in first package.
B00GG9FBJ4|5|Good stuff, love the smell, and seems to work very well. Still making comparisons between this and dodo juice Red tropical mist which is pretty expensive, but works well.
B002XL2IBS|5|Didn't think that I needed one of these but bought it because it is cheap.  Let me tell you, it works!  I used to modify my Shop Vac with a tube and tried to get out the scale in my tank.  It never did the job.  When I opened the package that this tool came in, my first thought was, what a waste.  It is plastic and looked pretty hooky.  But I hooked it up to the garden hose and placed it into the tank.  Damn, it flushed out everything.  This is a great tool.  You can try just and garden hose but it won't do what this does.  I wish that I had bought one 10 years ago.  Well worth the money.  It works.
B0055VVIKA|5|Great Price and Filter
B0099XZIYC|5|fits perfect
B00E9CZLF4|5|Love it just what I wanted.
B0024NSODG|5|exellent
B00FTAZTZ2|5|Works fantastic, and great price too!!
B005VX6EQ0|5|Very good.it fits my 2005 Hyundai Elantra .
B00C4XFMO0|5|Well I have been fiddling with my Jeep's AC for a year now...I just replaced the hoses and recharged the system and it is working tremendously.  I love the Johnsen's products! Now I would give it a 4 star because of pricing but compared to competitors it is priced accordingly!
B000V8WGIA|5|nice products
B00310T6NS|5|Great
B007MUY76O|5|Repair window lift easily and professionally.  Just what was required for the job.
B006VGSETQ|5|Great product
B011BVW0MM|1|Got these for my motorcycle.  Unfortunately, they're useless to me.  The description doesn't tell you that they have three settings: On bright, On dim, and Flash.  I can't use flashing white lights on a motor vehicle.  (Illegal in most states in the U.S. to have forward facing flashing white lights unless on an emergency vehicle)  I specifically purchased these because there was no indication in the description that they would flash. (or have a bright and dim setting)  These lights change each time you turn them on.  First time on is bright.  Second time on is dim.  Third time on is flash.  Since I was planning to use these lights at all times, the chance of having them flash as I go down the road is unacceptable.<br /><br />On the bright setting, they seem like good lights.  Well focused and very bright.  When turned on and flashing, they do a pattern of several flashes and then a pause.<br /><br />The other minor problem is that the screws that mount the lights to the clamps are too long.  The clamps would not mount properly to a round mounting point with the supplied screws.  Some stainless steel M5x8 screws fixed this problem.
B005OXVO5S|5|Replaced the old fresh air/recirculate actuator because it was clicking and making a lot of noise.  Zero problems since this new one was put in.  Fyi it is located behind the glove box to the right.
B010O2RX44|5|An original Kawasaki part, it fit perfectly to give me the extended reach pedals for my new 2015 Kawasaki Vulcan S with the 650cc engine and arrived in about 1 week.  The negative is it's more expensive then you can buy at a dealer but if the dealer is a far drive from you then this isn't a bad way to go.
B001KQ43RE|5|This fit my 1987 Camaro correctly. Replacing this does require some knowledge to disasemble and reassemble the pull down unit. Once assembled your trunk lid may have to go through a couple of up down cycles to sync everything up.
B000PH73SU|5|nice part
B00JRYHG70|5|Put one of these on my 5ver to prevent the cable from getting caught under the corner of the hitch and pulling the pin on a tight corner. Never a fun experience. Solved that problem from ever happening again.
B001N883UC|5|Works like magic !!
B00K779EH6|5|Just what we need
B00DSOUFTG|3|This is a nice accessory to my Sena SMH10R allowing the use of other speakers with better sound.  Since I am using this within a motorcycle helmet, I wish the wire was shorter or there was an option to get it without the coiled extension part.  I currently have that coiled section attached to the outside of my helmet (in the rear near the headset battery), but would love it if I could just tuck the whole wire under the padding.
B007ECE1FM|5|I wish I had this Topside creeper years ago when I was installing my BANKS Engine Tuner
B0070Y36N2|5|Does not discolor and looks great!
B001DH6EYK|3|Right size but flimsy.
B0050CKNT6|5|good bearing great price arrived on time
B00D2KKPW8|5|Worked good for my 3rd gen Saturn SL gauge cluster bulbs.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Worked well, didn't take long at all, great improvement in my headlights for not a lot of work.  Only thing I forgot was the headlight sealant, ran out to the auto parts store and the job was done.  Pretty straight forward and simple, just don't press too hard or you'll have a time polishing out the scratches from the first pad.  Oh yeah, the gray pad is on the sanding head with velcro when you open it, peel it off, attach the first disc and away you go.  I spent 10 minutes until I realized it came off the sanding disc holder to reveal the velcro, not one of my more observant moments.
B0002U2V1Y|5|This is a great product. Many of my friends use it and do so every year. Paint looks great. Excellent price on Amazon also. Quick shipping.
B00KWLKSAO|5|Amazing product customer service. Thank you bike berry! We will be doing buisness again!
B003TPW5YM|5|Works great and smells better.
B007V3BEJA|5|These mats are original BMW - they look great, feel great and perform as described.  They are German mats (probably made in China) and unfortunately they don't have a &#34;magic carpet&#34; function like some other mats that are made in Ababwa, but then who needs a magic carpet when you have a bimmer!!  Buy them if you don't need a magic carpet - you won't be disappointed!!
B0021UQZVK|5|my husband loves this item
B000X21Z7W|4|Good fit.
B00AFV7DHW|1|Spend the extra money and get the actual towing lights. Yes they're 300-400 bucks but they install EASY no wiring just u clip the plug, plug in the new one and good to go. Also they turn blinkers will work even if you do not have them on your current ones. These snap ones rattle, hard to focus and see out of and just worthless.
B0052FRT2A|5|exact match. looks good for the price.
B0073WEZU4|3|Love the size of it but doesn't get very good reception as my stock one did.
B007ZGBLNW|5|Great for a reverse light in my ranger 900
B000W0RQ8C|5|Just PERFECT ! Can't beat it or the price
B000AS3D3S|5|All good.
B00RC81ZKM|5|Fast delivery good product fit with my Camry 2013 SE thanks
B00L4V9ECY|5|do just what they say
B00556MP3O|5|Works great with my 98 Nissan altima. IT DID NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX! I had to call them and have them email me a code to program the fob and then it worked after a couple times trying it. Was a little tricky but they customer service was really helpful. Lock and unlock work but not the panic or trunk button. I don't know why panic button dosent work. I set my alarm off and it turns it off by pressing unlock button but panic button dident do anything and I don't know if its supposed to work or not but im happy it dosent so it dosent automatically go off.
B00P3SLXSM|1|Broke the first time I used it. Don't waste your money on this.
B00XM16S64|3|Update:  After using this for eight months, I am a bit frustrated with the unit.  It worked great when I first bought the unit, but after doing a firmware update, the unit has developed two very annoying issues.<br />First, the unit will just freeze after a few minutes use, requiring it to be either unplugged/restarted.  Second, it will randomly shut itself off seconds after turning on.<br />When it works, it is a great unit.
B005NELVOM|3|They are perfect I love them
B011VXUG6C|3|I have this on my Canam Commander 2&#34; roll bar to mount a Wink mirror. It would not fit on the bar unless the clamp holes were slotted and then in trying to tighten it the bolt threads stripped out. After all that it rattled on the roll bar and I had to disassemble it an add sticky form padding to reduce the rattling. This bracket is very beefy but I'm not sure how well it would work for a heavier item like a light bar.
B00CP6MET2|5|Great
B000182DX8|5|good
B00HXHS8PW|5|This thing just plain old sounds mean. But be advised if you have a fuel injected machine you will need an EFI programmer, carbuerators will need rejetted, otherwise your ATV will run lean and backfire. Otherwise this product is fantastic.
B00COYNZJ8|1|This sun shade made a wonderful present for a friend of mine who is a Star Wars uberfan. Unfortunately, it didn't even last a single summer season in Northern Caifornia and disintegrated into a million flakes that took forever to clean out of the car.<br />A real shame, because the design is fantastic and so much fun, my friend was so bummed out when it got ruined.
B0009YDQE4|5|Good price for these floor mats.
B00PAQJWB2|5|My quest for the brightest  Automotive  Light is this Item.
B008DIZ1S2|5|This comes with replacement gems. I love it, this is so pretty when the sun or headlights shine on it.
B0018EV9QQ|5|Fits very well.  Have not been able to use it in the rain as of yet.
B001JT5DUS|4|good price and product.
B00GRRFLOK|4|Changed out my crank type wheel lock for this 1 on my table lift.  This was a good choice.. Works like a charm ..
B00663XG38|5|nice gloves
B000BKJD48|5|After a couple of recent bicycle-motor vehicle accidents locally wherein visibility was a factor I looked into options for my rig.  I bought the emblem, spade mount, and mounting socket all together.  It was a plus that all three were made in the USA (United States of America).  I stopped at a hardware store and customized the mounting socket attachment for another $3.32.  It turned out great.  Jim
B00D7H6WZK|5|Good quality
B00W63X0LA|5|These make great keychains as well as luggage ids.  I dig em.
B001XLG5FE|4|This is a really cute sun visor and makes my car look like Lightning McQueen from the movie. Downside is that the vivid colors fade in the sun after only a few months.
B007AORLC4|4|Works well.  Easily replaced the old signal amplifier.
B005KJOMIW|5|Placed on a tecumseh oh160 with slight modification and now my battery charges.
B006A3W31U|5|Worked better than OEM. Not as much dust and doesn't get the rims dirty. Very quiet.
B0042NWOLY|4|Works well
B004EDF8HY|5|Great purchase experience. Worked as needed. They do get hot as designed so make sure you mount to metal.
B001Q7WZZE|5|AWESOME AWESOME PRODUCTS AND THIS ONE IS RIGHT THERE TO WOW.......
B0007LZK9S|5|Exactly what I was expecting
B0052VVCAE|4|I have had these for a while on my 1999 Yamaha Vstar Custom 650. I like the way they look and they fit ok. My only reason for not going 5 star was that they would loosen themselves and it came close to stripping the threads and would not stay tight. In order for them to be completely tight and be at a visible angle was difficult. I would recommend thread locker (red) to help with this. However, it is a real pain to get it just right. As for visibility, they are decent for smaller mirrors but it does take some time to get all the adjustments just right to be able to see. I like them, they look cool, their function is fair.
B000CF6L0G|1|Was shipped leaking. Great product. To bad only received half of a bottle.
B00F7NEREU|5|I like this better than the walmart beads. It stays where I need it even though it's small.
B00RW7WSQI|5|Good product, fast shipping. Thanks
B00CL0I5EA|4|Fit was spot on. Wish it had a bit more of a tacky finish to keep boxes or other cargo from sliding. It's not bad but could be better. Keeps my trunk looking new.
B004I1220S|5|Easy to install, good price, perfect solution.
B0060YHP62|5|Great price.
B001QFDVZY|5|Perfect fit, just like product name tuff lift...
B007FZWV2I|5|Both trucks now have these and will never not have one. GREAT product.
B002J8379C|5|Much cheaper than the store and nicer than the generic ones I typically see. Good for a few times as well.
B00P1LVCQE|5|very happy with it.
B00G620ZVU|5|I have 2013 JK w/ aftermarket front bumper and they fit good, only had them a day they came fast and the lights was pack nice,safe.For the price they are worth it, super bright spot light. i would buy them again depinding on how long they last.
B00MUF4Q6M|5|This keychain is elegant and durable.  A great combination.  Item arrived in pristine shape accompanied by a lovely red velvet holder.  Very classy.  I love the easily removed valet keychain, too.  It's perfect for my needs.
B00C9V4EHI|4|Well made product I just can't get use to it.
B00NZHX2S2|5|Good product
B00CT30SSU|4|Came on time. Fits perfectly.
B0002L6NMG|5|I Love My Sunshade HeatShield!! I have a little 2003 Honda Civic which I have babied in the garage since I bought her band new. Now I'm a traveling nurse in Texas. It is HOT. I mean HOT. My little Honda is now outside. This shield is a life saver. I wrote to the company personally and thanked them for this product. I received a very wonderful and prompt responses. This shield is easy to apply into the windshield and removing. It folds back into the original shape and secures tightly with the Velcro straps. My car stays very cool due to the thickness of the material. The steering wheel and dash will not burn my hands when I touch it anymore. Plus it is made in the USA. How fabulous is that!!! Thank you again to everyone in the company for working so hard designing and making my customize heatshield.
B00HT3PP7Y|5|Love it.  It's perfect!
B000CIAWLC|5|Thanks for the help, Luk is by far the best. Shipping came in a timely fashion. Our customer was very happy.
B00PMXZ1YA|5|Very satisfied with these LEDs
B0024NSYYU|4|Matches perfectly and just required a little bit of aiming to get the lights just right. Great price on Amazon.
B00IKQ2LKI|5|fit like a glove  the shipping was faster than fast  easy to install  great part glad I got the metal one  thanks  mm
B001C6Q34S|5|Came on time. Fits perfectly.
B0007LMC1C|5|I thought il the Spokes where too tough and would mess up my wheels but I was wrong... It Made it super easy to clean my wheels I love this product....
B000R3SNJU|5|Great tool for a excellent price.
B00U868BN4|5|Great gadget, works as advertised. Fast shipping. Highly recommend.
B0066TOANW|5|Excellent price, fast delivery
B007KDLQY4|5|Really good fit and they look great.  I feel that they are a great value.
B00D3QUMWO|5|I don't think my filters had ever been changed,  these filters popped right in after getting to the install location
B0146RKB6A|5|These boots are the best for the price!! I brought 3 pairs!!!
B001C6NC7O|5|This has to be the best air hoes out there it is not made from your ordinary rubber compound you can tell that the texture of the hose is different from any other hoes at your local hardware stores so far I have been testing it and it has passed every test I can already tell from a short time that this is going to be a long lasting Air hose I would highly recommend this for any mechanic that uses airlines it is very flexible and allows you to get your air tools into places that you ordinarily would not be able to because of The stiffness of other airlines
B00498MQEC|4|Great fit, looks good, but a slight shake with vibes causing a slight blur occasionally (compared to stock mirror on passenger side). Electric control works great. I'd still buy it again over paying for an OEM replacement.
B00IGFKZS8|5|These emblems look awesome on my Chevy Silverado people comment on them all the time saying that they look cool.
B004VRRCCW|5|Thanks  the item was just as described
B008HZOZ5G|4|The parts are very good but when I search base on my car, the result show that fit my car. Unfortunately when I when to the mechanic the parts did not fit my car 😤
B00UHD4HJA|3|Most of the stickers were dumb. Some were &#34;meh&#34;. A couple were good. Unless you plan on plastering something with stupid stickers, spend the money on one or two that you really like.
B00ECTRBHA|5|These look great. Place them on and they have a very nice 3D appearance and look more expensive than the true cost. I've been through the wash multiple times, no problems.<br /><br />So, easy to put on, look good.<br /><br />Five stars
B009O0AV4M|3|These fit OK for being what they are. The edges need to be pushed in a little bit and the graphic feels a little to big for the emblem itself. I don't know how others think the fir is perfect unless it looks terrible and they do not care. Beware.
B00U16R65A|5|really sticks even to rusted car panels and wheel wells and hides the rust nicely- is a flat but bright white - my car's color apparently needs a slight cream color
B009DK7WY0|5|Easy to install and they do what they're supposed to do.
B00N7KNI1S|5|Fast Service, cool design!
B00B4LAK9K|5|Faster than gm
B00FNAX7KW|5|Fast delivery and good quality product!
B009DJR9HQ|5|Bought it as a replacement for a Hyundai Elantra 2008. It's a great replacement. All the bulbs came included in the light in complete working condition. The lightbulbs shine brightly and I hope they last as long as the OEM bulbs did for me (7 years). The replacement process was quick and easy - two screws on the top and a little bit of hard wiggling and pulling and it comes right out to be replaced. The opposite to put the new headlights in.  Only potential issue is that you may have to adjust the headlight beam up or down because mine was basically pointing 2 feet in front of the car after installation. Adjustments are easy with a small screwdriver to align and adjust the headlights up and down.
B004VUIQJW|5|Great products, fast service.
B00UEOLXEY|5|The set of lights is really good. They draw very low current and can be use with your existing light circuit on your vehicle. I purchased this second set for my van, because it have the old replaceable headlights on my van and they aren't wasn't very bright. I clip these on to the existing power wire using a commercial grade line splice, and that was that. This enables the lights to be supported and protected by an existing fuse and relay. And I stated before, the additional current draw did not make the existing lights any dimmer.
B008BYP89K|4|Product worked great.  The wire length was a little shorter than the original but in my application it did not matter.
B001S21LJ8|4|This was for my 2012 GMC Sierra Denali 1500, with the 6.2Ltr. engine.  The regular Airaid complete kit DOES NOT FIT as I found out.  The snorkel from the air box to the throttle body interferes with the top radiator hose and won't clear it.  Also, the air box design was not in any league with the factory unit.<br />I used this Airaid unit along with a non-oiled high flow element and they worked great.  Much better acceleration with less hesitation, and when you really &#34;get on it&#34; the engine responds, literally, with a roar.<br />Subsequently I had the Engine management computer reprogramed via my local shop, and am getting 19.8mpg at 70 mph.  Not too bad for a big ol truck!
B005LD2C98|5|I've been using it for months and it works great. I recommend it.
B00EVY74AK|1|Wrong part and I've got to spend my money to send it back plus I don't get a full refund
B0017LG6HM|5|Sounds pretty good. It does have some in cab sound but not bad at all.
B00757KJTI|1|Its funny but does not work properly!!! Very small range
B011B25IXY|5|I have this mitt along with many other high named mitts. As far as I can tell they are the same mitt just different colors. Highly recommend.
B000C59WHA|5|2004 Chevy Avalanche
B00K68Q78K|4|This item is exactly what it looks like, though it does have a tendency to leave the occasional fibre on stuff I clean with them. Works best with rubbing alcohol it seems.
B004A6JA2O|5|Great value, especially compared to the OEM part at the dealership.
B000EDUTO0|1|These are not good
B00OBWV06Q|5|I actually was able to repair the &#34;defective&#34; servo so did not use this one...
B005CXM06W|5|Perfect fit. Runs like its new again.
B00MC6H0AI|4|Excellent. Well made.  The use full illuminated area is more than twice as large vs original 2002 mercury grand marquis backup bulbs.  If they last I will give 5 stars.
B00XYRSG16|4|Very comfortable without taking up a lot of space in your boots as a regular pair of socks would. And they breathe quite nicely. Definitely not a winter sock. Although, the sizing was a little too big. I wear a size 12 in most shoes and boots and these seem a little too long<br />long. I have to scrunch up the suck to get the heel and ankle spots to line up in the appropriate places. Gonna have to order a size smaller next time.
B002LWQ40K|5|Ships fast fit perfect
B00BQN5SUW|5|Better than originals! Took 5 whole minutes to install both.
B006QLHDUM|5|I didn't need the whole casing, but the lens fit perfectly into my 2010 Focus that had rusted out its old one.
B00JRE38EA|5|Easy upgrade for the price.  Makes a huge difference over the factory halogen bulbs.
B00B2CG0TA|5|This is a very nice quality mat for the price. The rubber is soft and easily trimmable and only took about 15 minutes to fit to my SUV.I have had much more expensive trunk mats in the past and while you may get  a little higher quality if you pay in excess of $100....for the money this mat is a much better value in my opinion. It had no rubbery odor and looks like it will easily last as long as we own the car. Very happy with this choice.
B000W0OFXG|5|Easy to set combo, works easy and does make my Alumni trailer piece secure.
B001Y8NEX2|5|Works well
B009MB9D3I|5|Perfect fit!
B00D1418KI|5|This item is the perfect item for anyones. I actually used this pump a few days ago when my tire blew and I had to put a spare on. The spare was low on pressure so this pump allowed me to make the 40 miles needed till I got my tire fixed. The Instructions are easy to read and clear cut of what not to do minus a few grammatical errors. Everyone should have one of these in their trunk.<br /><br />*Disclaimer I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.
B002A6RIRA|5|Awesome I love it
B000EQTX5I|5|Cheapest price out there, plus a mail in rebate. No excuse not to change you plugs!
B0079MNXBK|2|Delivered fast and correct parts
B00DV2Z2T8|4|Screw holes were a little off from the originals, but was able to get it to work without much trouble. Worked as it should besides that.
B000CO89AW|5|These are great, look fabulous
B00F0M3FLY|4|Very nice looking, item received as described. Took me 90 minutes to install with no alterations necessary.<br /><br />4 stars because one rail did come with a small dent in it. It was too small to bother returning it. Great value, I recommend this item.
B00386A72E|1|I had to return it because it did not fit the hood scoop
B000C9RRA0|5|exactly what I expected . good fit and the best quality
B000F6F99G|1|Unit was easy to install but the lights on time is much to short. When motion is detected the lights blink on and right back off. The short on time of less than one second makes the unit useless. An email to the company's tech support brought no reply.
B00PZ2ER4I|5|Perfect!
B006FUT0CS|5|This is my second bottle. You can expect 4-5 car washes out of the bottle (medium size sedan). It does a great job removing bird droppings, bugs, sap and general dust/pollen and road grime. It leaves a great shiny finish, better than some waxes. It also makes plastic pieces look brand new and works great on glass. If you follow the instructions you will love this products.
B00J440XAK|2|Heavy/sturdy product but horrible smelling! Didn't even smell remotely like new car; smelled of heavy plastic with cheap cologne mixed in but luckily smell left after opened 2 days:not worth the price
B00YB5GAEA|1|The idea is good, but the product has design flaws that prevent use. The rubber band disengages from the light when any pressure is applied. So you cannot really use it on a helmet or anywhere else for that matter - it'll be lost on your first ride.
B0040CTTH4|5|Door panel clips fit perfectly!
B0045L22I8|5|High quality product. Very chic and well done. Great asset for my Lexus.
B00L911044|5|Excelent box!!!!
B002WV80CA|5|I fought buying this because I felt it was too expensive. But I finally bit the bullet. And I wish I had done it sooner. I was very pleasantly surprised at how much stuff it holds and how convenient it is.<br /><br />Anyone who says it rubs the tank has it installed wrong. It sits perfectly on the handlebars.
B0096A277O|5|a yiempo
B00MFW6HYE|2|Too expensive.
B00QOJW62Q|1|They will not stay in the holes when using ratchet straps to tie coolers down.
B005T21JCC|1|Crap.  don't buy!  very cheap paper filament.
B00E0PSH6K|5|So far they are very good quality. Very easy to adjust and very adjustable. I could lay the frame of my car or go to stock ride height and still have a great ride.
B00Y2DZEOS|4|fits the 2016 Honda HRV. high grade plastic.  indentations and groove fits perfect.
B000ZIZHKK|5|Awesome!!! Better gas mileage, runs like a champ. Was a great price, and the RED coils look bad ass under the hood. Would recommend these to anyone with a 4.6 liter.
B003BZD03K|5|the best way to hookup your hose and avoid kinks
B003RET4NU|5|Though I wasn't sure if it would be a set of two or just a single, the dual mats that arrived are a PERFECT FIT in my old, used Benz--they look GREAT.

B00JAXRZQ0|1|top right corner does not fit flat.  Sure is a long way laser cut in ad. Looks like cheap junk in my Excalade.
B00ZB3ODFY|5|The plate fit perfectly and came with all hardware needed to install. For the cost this is a great option for the BMW F800GSA.
B000C3BB4Y|5|Excellent cooling even if used as a pusher in front of the condenser.
B0002JMIEK|5|This stuff is great !  I learned about it from a friend who owns a 57 Chevy pick up.  My friend had bought Liquid Glass and waxed his truck six times. That was five months ago.  It still looks the same as it did back then.  Excellent retention qualities.  Easy to apply and remove.  We live in Florida,  twice a year we are subjected to &#34;love bug&#34; season. These little creatures splatter on car windshields and front ends. They are difficult to remove at best.  I put two coats of LG on the front of our two vehicles at the start of love bug season.  Though bugs splatter on the front end they are easily removed with a hose nozzle and water.  Not like any &#34;wax&#34; I have ever used.
B00CEXK6R8|5|Love it. Exactly what I was hoping for
B00B9ET8IG|5|Great product but was shipped without instructions but found programming video on to youtube
B001GHUP8I|5|Worked perfect. Way easier than modifying your tank for return line.
B00G0OUGSG|5|Fits perfectly and works great
B00W6IY0SM|5|Simple to install and look great perfect function
B000C91DQE|5|I replaced the muffler and tailpipes a few years ago on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 pickup with extended cab (141.5” wheelbase) and this was a perfect fit. If you’re using a Walker 22719 muffler and have pipes that turn out behind the rear wheel this is the pipe you need. I’d suggest using the Walker site to get the correct part number and then shop around for the best price. I had to replace my engine because it was burning oil so I also replaced the crossover pipe, converter and had to add an extension pipe because the new converter was shorter than the one it replaced. All were Walker pipes (or Dynomax which is also Walker) and all fit perfectly. I now have to replace the muffler again because it’s filled with soot from the oil but I used a compression clamp and it bent the intermediate pipe in the muffler inlet so much I had to cut it off at the muffler and add a short extension so don’t use compression clamps if you think you’ll ever need to get it apart later… I went with the stainless lap preformed clamps the go over the pipes… like the SmartParts 300300 & 320300… and I’ll probably do the same with the 2-1/4” tailpipes.

B008I7ON96|4|Easy to install
B00UVRRFF0|5|Very nice,  I love  it!!!
B004W13MA8|1|While I liked the product, the Pilot and Ridgeline are two different vehicles.  I ordered this to fit a 2014 Honda Pilot, and it shows<br />Ridgeline on the packaging, and is for a Ridgeline, and will not fit the pilot.  The first one I ordered was broken (and the package<br />was really smashed) so I just sent it back, they quickly sent another, but it was still for a Ridgeline, and will not fit. It is on the way<br />back right now.  Got a refund. This may be worth it for a Ridgeline, but not for a Pilot  (which it will not fit).
B005CLL4K2|5|great match & fit
B00Z515O5K|2|bad handles，fall off often
B0023VB5GC|5|was fast and what we wanted thanks
B009F4JHHO|5|Awesome little device, has worked on all three of our cars, 04 GMC, 08 Van, 08 G6. Plugs right in and connected to my phone (G-S4) no problem, right now I'm using the free app but most likely will purchase the full app at some point. Our GMC had the service engine light on and the code was P0420 which is Cadillac Converter so we took it into the shop and in-fact it was very bad stopped up glowing red. Having one of these just gives you extra piece of mind going to a mechanic that he is telling you the truth and not scheming you.
B00S3YXO26|4|Really nice!
B0051XBNDY|5|Worked perfectly to install a camera on our 2015 Jeep Wrangler unlimited. Super easy install.

B003XGYDE2|4|Small and compact.
B0009PCPNQ|5|Love the scent of this as well as how it worked on set in stains
B001KO2G2A|5|Loved em so much I bought 3 sets and did all my bikes. Hint: Use the spray nozzle on an air compressor and shoot inside the grip, they slide right on!
B0018YIKFO|5|Used these shocks on the back of my Road Runner. These are the shocks recommended by Calvert Racing for their racing suspension on MOPAR B-bodies. I bought them here on amazon because of the lower price. I also like the adjustability of them so I can fine tune the way my car rides.
B00062ZOSU|5|Works great......Fast shipping.
B0020RPUBK|5|Love it
B0012OZMAG|5|Worked great
B000LNTN2C|5|it was hard finding one of these small enough to fit on a lower cabinet door, but this fit great. i can hold plastic wrap, a box of small plastic bags and a box of large plastic bags. just enough to get things out of the way in my cabinet.<br />The screws that came with it worked fine for me, but be careful screwing them in that they don't go through the door.<br />quality as expected. i would buy again.
B003L5KSI0|5|Very nice and fits perfect with my gsr swap civic
B00W4YA492|5|I have driven many road trips in my Nissan Altima, 10+ hours. This is the first time I have used a lumbar and neck support pillows, on a recent drive from the east coast to Texas (25 hours). The Love Home car kit made a huge difference! Usually at each stop my back would ache and neck would feel sore. The support from the Love Home car kit kept me at an ergonomic posture the whole time and I did not have the usual pains on this recent trip. The memory foam feels really nice and conforms to the body.<br /><br />A couple downsides: it's very comfortable, especially the neck support so it almost feels like your laying down in bed which is not good when driving on boring highways! Not Love Home's fault of course, but just a note to be aware you need to stay awake despite the comfort!<br />Also, the lumbar support has nice side supports, but the memory foam is squishy so you do slide a bit when making turns. More noticeable with around the town driving, but I have gotten used to it. If Love Home could make the side supports a little firmer it would be a perfect product.
B000MTI15K|4|Works like the 15 year old original, which was a Moeller.
B003V57NUQ|2|For the price you cant beat these. Next time i will consider geting some that will fold down for parking deck and drive thru purposes.
B0013FWACW|5|Spot on, fixed a fault a generic O2 sensor couldn't. Highly rated.

B00YBFV6BM|5|A good product although I had to buy the adapters for it to futvon my Evo
B008JKS8UC|5|for the price it was a good buy, delivery was on time as expected, my next filter will be a Napa.
B00GJKXW8M|5|Was very surprised how bright it is for the size and the cost, mounted to the back of my atv for a rear trail light and works great and holds up to all weather!
B0081KM6Q2|5|He loved it
B00S1WDSK8|5|Excellent customer service. This company strives for a good review and deserves it. The lights look and work great. They were missing one screw and when I emailed them to get this special hex screw they sent me a Starbucks coffee gift card, a whole new set of lights, and the screws, which was the only thing I anticipated was coming. Never been happier with any Amazon customer!!!
B009PHF036|5|Easy to put on and they work great!
B00GWFOSBY|5|works as stated
B00II488NQ|5|tool works great just make sure mandrel is all the way in when using, mandrel backed out and pulled threads out. (my fault for not checking) company took care of it for me and i couldn't be happier
B001FC79EW|5|Wonderful
B0023VMNN6|5|Work great very and was great price
B008BMG3KA|4|Nice
B00GW9N2S0|4|These did the job of aligning the heads to the block, plus keeping the head gasket in place as you lower the heads on. They are pretty good, not cheaply made and are not the split type. These are solid around and I had to gently tap them in the block. They have a good taper/chamfer to grab the head while lowering it on.
B00C5SOWLS|5|Can't beat the Monroe brad. Best price for a Monroe Quick strut. A little disappointed that WA charges tax for online purchases.
B009IXNL8I|5|Worked great
B00UIX4BP4|1|You get what you pay for
B00U8O8VJU|4|I works okay the first couple of times I have used it. but it isn't new. I'm assuming it's a refurb product. There were a few scuffs on the outside casing and the inside smelled like ammonia (it was clean though). I'll keep it because it works and is 1/3 the price of a new unit, but I wish they would have said refurb or used in the description. Also I wish they sold easy adapters for the input and output. I had to McGuyver one together myself. An on off switch would have also been a nice option.
B000CM3I00|5|General notice.  This item only fits original GM mirror housings.  If your mirror is a aftermarket replacement, this mirror will not fit without using a sonic crafter to cut away the plastic surronding molding of mirror housing as the mirror glass is a different size by 1/16&#34;
B007KSPL2M|5|Solid. Good purchase.

B00WRV76AC|5|Luv it and it's fit my VW Jetta 2003 perfect...
B002L9DHX0|2|It has varied very little since I had it and always says the fishing is Great. I guess that should be expected from a company that sells fishing equipment and wants you to do more fishing.
B0082LKFN6|2|Only ONE sanding block - picture is misleading!  Looks like 3 different sanding blocks with different shapes and contours.<br />As far as a sanding block, the ONE that arrived looks to be good quality,  and I'll put it to use.
B008B5TVC4|5|It is the part 8 needed.  Enough said.
B004AHD8EY|5|Is good product .
B004UI1WE6|5|prefect
B007JAMPSO|5|Love it. Like to advertize my business
B001KQA9ZE|4|The seat heating element was a perfect fit and worked just fine. I wish they didn't bother to put the hob ring and hog ring pliers in the kit and the instructions were a bit clumsy for my vehicle (2004MC Envoy) and the reason for 4 and not 5 stars. They were poor quality and  made securing the pad to the seat base cushion harder that it should have been --- I ended up using HD wire ties. Outside of that the pad was a great fit and worked perfectly.<br />BTW: I have been an ASE Master Technician since 1978 and a GM Master Technician Elite from 1974-1995 (laving the auto repair industry for a new career). Getting the sat out of my truck, getting he seat cover off and installing the heater pad was no problem, but even with my considerable skills (and it not bragging if its factual) getting the seat cover back on was more than a bit tricky.
B001KZDFC4|5|Nice quality unit, wiring harness included as well!

B0014DGZ88|5|Good product at a hell of a price
B0041E4KPC|5|I've had this sticker before on my truck's windshield for quite a few years.....well....it needed to be replaced. I found it again through you guys and was very excited! Great price, fast shipping and packaged very well! Thank you so much!
B00CZ1BS1C|2|Shipping was good and fast. Kinda hard to keep track of it but wasnt bad. Quality...well buy cheap get cheap. Had rust on it. Had alot of blemishes in the chrome and a few pin holes where the fit up ad welds were grinded to thin. Dont trust it in a crash. Better off buying aftermarket through HD itself.
B00ZU8S60I|1|Said its works for a kx 250f, without machine work not the case front brake cmater cylinder is in the way along with a lot more, i typed in the box if the would work and it said yes i disagree

B00R6484BK|5|Original decals! Was so happy. Only needed 2 of them. Also came in earlier than the delivery date
B00573N36S|5|I bought this for my Dark Gray Mazda 3 hatchback and I LOVE it! It is such a cool car shade! I can't help but smile when I come out from my classes and see my car. I wish they had a color closer to the shade of my car, but I can't really complain because it still looks amazing!<br /><br />(See photo) :)
B00BITIMIO|5|Worked great.  Thanks will be doing business  again
B0012TPVC0|5|This item work very good.
B00TF7BVWK|5|This works great in my Subaru Forester, and fold neatly when not in use. A well made product at a good price.
B004I16OJS|5|Great product! Very good service
B0067NK2FC|5|Genuine and clean looking
B00NH49NL8|4|I love my Tempo wipes and holder!!<br /><br />My only complaint is the spacing of the hooks. They are too narrow for me to put on my visor and still be able to use my mirror. I put mine on the drivers side door which works well, but no one else can reach them.
B000C93G6Y|5|Worked great in my 92 Toyota Peseo
B00439Q05S|4|Received my item, as advertised,  have nit installed and tested yet.
B0002JMEJ4|5|price was so good I had to order 4
B0015POUXM|1|Attachments need to be sturdier. I am a mechanic not a princess. The hose came apart at the metal fitting, in the picture above its the one directly in the middle at the base of the container after a month of use. It still works but the hose comes apart every time you remove it from the container. I guess I'll fix it too. Silicone won't work the brake fluid eats it up.
B0082XHTCO|5|Excellent product. I am so happy I went with cobra
B000EQMJKY|5|This met all my expectations and the mechanic had no problem replacing the old malfunction Engine Mount with this new one.
B00M0WBM8U|5|Item arrived much earlier than expected, and was in perfect condition and exactly as described!<br />Kudos! 😊👍
B00Y447WEU|5|We love these Bonnet Buffer Polishing Pads. Sure cuts on the the amount of work it takes to polish out cars. Will purchase again.<br />Jeannie Walker (Award-Winning Author) &#34;Forever in My Heart&#34; - A True Story of Coincidence and Destiny

B002PR8ZXK|5|Perfect
B00C6C1I2Y|1|Piece of junk rotted away in 1 season. It has since been thrown in the garbage.
B00BCRMB34|5|I bought this for my Expedition not knowing how well it would fit, but it is sent with clips that keep the seat covers firmly in place. The material is quality and sturdy and it looks great in my car. It's a great set for the cost. Each piece was easy to fit and secure, and will be easy to remove and wash as needed. The colors are just as displayed on amazon.
B0001EFSTI|5|Not for heavy duty use.  It is a very handy light use tool, and you can get it by police security stations attached to your key chain.
B00WOY33EA|5|just the parts needed to fix Fords defective cable ends easy to use works great,
B00LLKHMV8|3|The LED lights work fine. The control box doe's not. I have mine connected with the Red wire to the 12V on/off, and the Black wire to the chassis. The White wire doesn't work.
B006QH56GO|5|Perfect
B00FMW0HRC|3|This is a comfortable seat, but it's not for short people. It seats you to far back.
B00KTJ1SBM|4|Only used one. Thans
B008G4Y076|5|SUPER BRITE REVERSE LITES!!!
B000EEU0IO|1|Too thick, moves all the time. Beads are a bit uneven which makes for odd pressure points. We finally took it off after trying it for 3 weeks.
B00IPS4APU|4|Works well. After you follow the instruction, the chip is less noticable without any haziness to your windscreen. It feels flush to touch but the chip isn't 100% gone.
B00PF0HIDM|5|These are very bright and have a perfect color white.
B000C91G2K|5|Perfect.
B006TMKFD0|4|It fits, it matches the one on the driver's side. What's not to like? On the other hand, it's not as though it's a 1945 Pétrus.
B00W2RBI0K|5|Awesome perfect fit
B00B7R9U4M|5|It was a great fit.
B00YTWXMQY|1|Just installed and they work on the trailer. Put the boat in the water and they don't work. Filled up with water. I spent $200.00 and they going back.
B005DUMADC|5|As advertised, shipped and arrived in 3 days (including Sunday), and plugged right in.  Allowed me to use same charger for different &#34;toys&#34; -- camper and motorcycles.  Didn't have to retrofit anything.
B001RUH8ES|3|Bought for my couch stains. The product smells good but it just is not working for me. I have one more product to try and if it fails as well I think I am just going to call in a professional service.
B004AQZUX2|5|Way cheaper than most of the HID's I've seen on the market. They work.
B00QMWQSAG|4|I bought these for my new 2014 Nissan Sentra because they didn't come with them and they fit, just had to fiddle around with where to place them so they fit. They look great!
B004GBJAOG|4|They did their job. We had a heck of a time getting them to stay suctioned to the valve face, just clean them real nice with a wire wheel and spit on it.
B00029WYEY|4|Brand name.  Can't go wrong
B0092D23WE|5|I'll never forget my first Fox gloves like these that I got in France to mountain bike ride downhill on the ski slopes. They were perfect in 2009 and these are a perfect replacement. Almost identical to that old pair and very durable.<br />Size: Be careful on the size as I got an XL thinking they be just a little roomy, but they are snug. Not so much that I'm disappointed but glad I went up to XL.<br /><br />I don't understand why Fox doesn't do more to market these to Mountain Bikers instead of just Moto.
B004DL2SX4|5|Perfect!
B009DK4XK6|1|Bench tested it and it did not work....will be calling customer service to return the item...would have given no stars but it was not allowed
B00BY8KCFA|5|Nice frame matches the angularity of the new cadillacs
B006YBKT5U|3|I expected the back to be a little higher.

B00BDOCWMQ|5|The best alloy wheel cleaner I've purchased.  Not cheap but does the job! Have proper ventilation and your wheels will shine.
B00REJX5BQ|4|Seems to be a good cover for the money.  Easy install on my '13 ram with 5.8ft bed.  Mine has plastic caps on the tops of the sides of the bed.  So the front of the tonneu wont seal.  Will have to add another layer of weatherstripping, but otherwise, good cover!
B00N03G1IE|5|Just what I was looking for
B00809XHD0|2|Found part was damaged.
B008B5TVC4|5|I was really worried about this purchase. I saw a post on Google, with several photos on how to replace this little fan in our 2003 Tahoe headliner. I was able to replace it on my own and it solved the issue of the buzzing sound, that was driving us crazy.
B004TDMJOY|5|Pads were a perfect fit 2001 jeep Cherokee
B00F0CJD8I|5|EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED
B00VQN5MVW|5|I must say I'm impressed. I placed my order for one of these radiator for my 1995 Infiniti J30 and it was a perfectly brand new direct fit. Shipping was quick and delivered 2 day's ahead of scheduled delivery date...Awesome 5 Stars 👌
B000FQ7R32|1|Did not fit my CJ5
B004GD9AA8|5|Worked great, replaced a busted door handle......
B00GI2CCLO|4|I live in Arizona so the sun is very intense.  This works great in a jam and for the price.  However, depending on the make of your vehicle may not fit perfectly. I drive a Camaro and it was way too big.
B003EOZLEO|1|Although they look great, I should have listened to the reviews. For A product that specifically made for jeeps, they sure don't fit properly. One side fit perfect other side I had to cut and drill to make it fit. Should not have to do this.
B00QPQD1NQ|4|Works great
B001IGGLGC|1|When I opened the shipping container, the red covering was frayed. When I picked it up the damaged area disintegrated to a powder in my fingers. I am not satisfied with this item.
B01191UU62|5|Outstanding
B00L9VWAUC|5|Love it thank youll so much
B00RMW1S6O|1|Doesn't work on 2005 Prius /JBL I think the reason is the navigation. If its mentioned then I missed it in the details but regardless to those that have a Prius don't buy.
B005CWU290|5|Great product
B004OHOC0Y|5|This unit mounted perfectly to my 92' Jeep YJ in about 1.75 hours. The only problem we encountered was a little high pitched noise that was detected by my wife on the passenger side bracket. After re-tightening all bolts on both sides and looking at the bracket carefully, we discovered that the passenger side bracket was flush to the Jeep and the driver side bracket had approximately 1mm clearance. After applying a small amount of bending pressure to the noisy side and getting that 1mm clearance as the driver side has......noise gone. Nicely made and the rolling feature is cool, but it requires loosening a bolt on the top bar, both sides. Worth the money.
B004UR15OY|5|Good stuff
B000UBP0RW|5|After wasting weeks on 3 different plastic in-line type oilers (that all pretty much look alike), this one actually works. Filling is a breeze if you follow the simple directions and use a bottle with a mini fill tip (4 oz. bottle of Marvel tool oil, in my case).  The fill screw can be a bit tricky due to angle and position, but it's manageable.  My first fill resulted in a nasty leak at the fill screw when under pressure.  Unscrew, clean, replace and tighten tight made the seal work as designed, just make sure it's screwed in tight.  Overall very happy to finally find a transparent in-line oiler that works as described and doesn't leak profusely from a poor design and shotty off-shore manufacturing.
B00GI2CBIS|5|I was in the market for one of these be cause mix was torn and needed o e. Well this summer has been a very hot one here in Kentucky. So I wanted to try this one. I'm so glad that I did. It did keep my steering wheel cool along with the rest of the van. Thank you so much for letting me try this shade. It AWESOME!!!!
B0027EKGNI|3|Overall good, it was fast delivery but I guess they forgot to put the two rubber o ring seals in the box. Overall though i dont think my car needs them but still. Sounds cool but you need a good tune to get real power out of it .
B001P5TDM0|5|Does  NOT last.  Plan to use over and over
B00TP42K5U|5|Clutch assembly works perfectly. We are completely satisfied with all aspects of our order from the timely manner that it was received to the great product performance.
B00652G4TS|5|Great product! Better than I expected.
B00KTHZR7K|3|Works well.  Helpful instructions.
B00VKM3Y3C|1|Bad cover,it tore the first day,I would like to have one with better quality ,can u all help me
B00PA2LMD2|5|Finally found the right polishing compound for the paint on my 67 Camaro.  It was easy to work with and removed all the swirls much better than the many other products I've used.
B006UH9U2Q|4|I bought this for my 2005 Acura TSX.  Fits perfectly compared to other products I tried.  Definitely worth the money.
B001O0CBXO|1|When I opened up the bag I immediately noticed that the inside of each lug nut is slightly rusted like they had been used before. I decided to dismiss this and use them anyways so I could get my car on the road. Then as I was putting them on my car I realized there were only 19 lugs in the set! I am incredibly unsatisfied and upset that a &#34;new&#34; set of lug nuts would be sent to me with two big problems.
B007KPX5UA|5|Excellent
B005N53EI2|4|Shiny would have been better however good quality.
B000EDUTV8|5|Fixed problem.
B000ALJ4NS|5|Excellent product.
B000FMVT6W|1|Hitch is good, installation was easy. However, the package was missing some critical things, which I had to purchase separately.
B007LS2D6S|5|Fit perfectly. In perfect condition. Just what I needed.
B00L3KXC38|4|Good fitment.
B000FQ7KK2|5|fit fine
B00511T45K|5|good quality visor and bands to hold it.
B005PBW89K|5|I love this decal, very cool,  good size! I put mine in the trunk, not front but i love it!
B000BP7M8W|4|So far so good. I haven't actually used it yet, so I don't know what the lasting ability will be but I'm expecting it to perform according the way it's used.
B008LMOM9O|5|It was bigger than I thought ;) always love that !
B00LH3IOBG|5|Great fit easy install
B0009JKI6I|5|Works great!
B000BRJUTO|4|NICE COVER fits well.  Looks great, with good air flow! It did let a little rain in when I was parked, but not enough to worry about.
B000KORDBK|5|very good
B00KTJ7U3M|4|Very pleased with the remotes.
B00N59YR70|5|Looks & Works great, mounted easily, Got rid of the rattle up front.
B005MZXFN2|5|Nice magnet that indicates my feelings. Kept one and gave three as gifts to family members. Looks good on the back of my truck with the Flag magnetic, wounded warrior magnetic, and pink ribbon breat cancer ribbon. Good product and price is reasonable.
B00ARJSG4Q|5|Fit the vehicle very well, looks good.
B002DWBCX2|5|Great fit ok delivery time
B000IYR7R2|5|worked out well
B0029TQDLA|1|I had them in the car for 3 days and it has already started to crinkle.  definitely not a value.
B00ZR7WLEE|5|Good product, and they are brighter then I thought they would be..<br />Would recommend this product..
B007XE5LTG|4|Very good
B00HY06S9G|3|All work but One
B0094KV3F8|4|I wish they  were an inch longer. I am looking at my door handles.
B001VE34W0|2|strap is very short.
B00V7B7W84|4|fits well
B000NBWCFC|2|Would prefer to have a much brighter light.  Working in a shop with 16 foot tall doors all around and this is useless.  I have to close the shop to get it dark enough for it to barely shine light.  I thought at first the cheap batteries were weak but after installing a new set of Duracell batteries it was still just as weak.
B00FJGQ64E|4|All bulbs lit up, inserted into the sockets properly.
B00681BE2S|3|Didn't work at all  when I received it took it apart to check the battery the insides were upside down, work's great now!!!
B00UIW18HY|5|Happy with purchase. I had no problem with the installation,it came with extra 3m tape which I did use . Just heat up the tape and bumper with a hairdryer before applying.
B006ZDY1H4|2|it was plastic... thought it was supposed to be stainless polished.... not satisfied.. won't buy again
B00M3RCEQG|5|Great system to hold the journals and planners i'm currently working on with the supplies i need at finger tip length away.
B00T3E8XBC|5|Love it just what I wanted.
B0084L0YR6|5|Worked great fixed my issue with the a/c in my avalanche staying on with the key out. Great price shipped fast would buy again.
B00H4G515C|2|Fitment is crap. Either it's mean for the right side of the bike, or a spring that goes on the inside of the stand. Also the gap is too narrow to fit the bracket on my bike (xr250). I got it on with a bit of hammering, but the foot fits the wrong way, so I will be doing some welding.
B00G6INZ9S|5|Used it on a bike seat and pedals, turned out great!
B00KY6V3NI|5|F***** awesome !!!! Great fit .. if I had 2 bikes I would buy another one lol
B0002SQU9K|5|Worked well, good price.
B000EQ8TQC|5|Two struts were in the package, AWESOME DEAL! Struts went on as described, can already tell a difference in the ride.
B00WVJR0D8|1|Installed on Thursday and the light was decent on bright, but dim was weak and only half the bulb ;left a dark area on half the road. I went riding the next evening and I could barely see upon returning in the dark. So much so I had to follow my friend in. Day three the bulb was completely out, so I requested a return on Amazon of which I was promptly refunded.
B000MWU3QM|5|Just got this<br />Easy install<br />Had a tuning issue<br />Customer service resolved it in two short phone calls<br />Bought my bike used and it had exhaust and air cleaner added with no tune.<br /><br />It ran ok<br /><br />Now it's ball out.<br /><br />Couldn't be happier
B000GKEZGE|3|loud, but too high a pitch. i had expected more of a deep trucker sound.  good quality, though.
B007ZXX7EG|5|This filter seems better then the original Acura air filter.
B00407WNE0|5|Installs easy and looks great!!
B0006IX878|5|works real nice
B00JA80PEO|3|Sound quality could be a lot better.
B001QYFVMQ|5|I'm a decades long believer in Adam's products. Bought my first kit at the OC swapmeet back in the 90s.
B00QX4VIHG|5|Was a Hyundai branded original equipment part much to my surprise considering the stealership wanted over $200 for the same part.
B0045HXOM0|2|NOT WHAT I EXPECTED SO I HAD TO SEND IT BACK FOR A REFUND.
B00KBM6LQY|5|Great product for the price. Did not need the cam gears. Have put about 5000 miles on the car since install and it runs great. A lot of work but well worth the time and money to prevent catastrophic damage.
B004ZJZ4OE|4|I am using this  in the mornings as I am the worst.  It does get pretty hot when you put it at the highest setting. It temporarily  helps with my chronic pain when it is on. However once I take it off my pain is immediately back. What I do like about it is the way it is structured and how it fits around my cervical  and the areas of my upper back and shoulder is exactly where my pain is located.  I would say it doesn't work any better than the other heating pads I have. But it is larger and covers a bigger area. I do tie it tight with the band to keep it more snug towards my skin because this is a little bit too big for me. The price is a little higher. As long as you use it I would recommend it.
B000A2N7K8|5|This product is just what I wanted.  It adheres to the window easily and the numbers are large.  Great product.
B00U4DT5OK|5|This is the first time I have left a review for an item, but I am so pleased with my purchase I felt it was necessary.  The cover is a heavy (neoprene) fabric, the stitching is heavy and tight and the cover fits like a glove!  If the performance over time is inadequate, I will update.  But, the initial satisfaction rating is definitely five stars.
B008JORKP2|5|Just received this today and had it open and burning in less than 10 minutes. Kids already cooked marshmallows on it. Set it up on our wood deck. I literally put my hand underneath it and felt the wood and it was cool to the touch. Definitely take caution and follow directions starting and shutting off. When turning on make sure to turn immediately to low. Stops the big flame burst. It is going to need an enclosure like with pavers surrounding it as I could see someone easily burning their legs on the side. Curious how it will hold up after the Fall season is over. Noticed the price went up $20 after I purchased it, but I would buy for that price.
B000WKBX3Q|5|Fit perfect on 99 R1
B00H6ETIWY|4|I have a Kawasaki Mule and roll cage is 1.75&#34; diameter, Kolpin shows these to fit 1.75&#34; diameter tube. They do not. I had to shim .06 to tube all way around to make the clamp tighten up. Other than the installation I love the mirror and they do not vibrate and stay aimed right where they are adjusted to.
B00GD4NR3Y|5|As advertised
B00E7VFH0G|5|Looks great in my Dodge Dart. Love it!!
B00CN9YECG|5|Nice quality, long lasting decal.
B00684MXL6|5|Seems to work great in my 2002 WRX. Wired up to a Pyle PLDNB78I head unit and had no issues.
B00JG76CA0|5|Used this to make my own stripes for my Dodge Dart instead of buying oem ones for like 200-300
B00URU2ESY|5|Got it for my husbands Harley.  Does the job great!  Thank you!
B00B1HRK6S|2|Bought for my husband last year and the material is wearing down and flaking off.  Feels like vinyl, not leather.  Too expensive for the quality.  The best thing about it is that it's soft.  I bought myself a steering wheel cover from a local auto parts store that was a 1/2 the price for a better quality.
B009PNEIHY|5|I am really enjoying my new seat covers! They were a little hard to put on but I finally got the first one in place. The second one was a lot easier to get on. I wish they had the matching covers for the back seat. I think they're great!
B011D7HY4I|3|good looking sticker, good size, great colors, not sure it' worth what I paid.
B000VKOD9S|5|easy to change. need to make sure edges are right along the frames so there is no space. (it was bit tight so some side warped a bit.)
B008C3SKO0|5|I've been wanting to put a decal under the hood of my Dodge Charger R/T so that when I lift the hood you'll see it in your face!<br />I ordered this and cut part of the top off and BAM! Perfect! :)))
B009L3C9TM|5|These stickers hold up good on my hard hat.  Get alot of, do you have extras!
B004K296N6|5|Awesome product, works fast with 33 inch tires, does well with 35's too
B007FHSB20|1|left non vented cap leaked and destroyed paint.
B00HZSN48K|5|Very nice! Plug and play instulation was easy.  You can see everything while pulling. Just a tad of vibration on bumps or higher speeds with wind. But the stocks did this too. My Ford F150 XLT didn't have puddle lights on the stock mirror, but now I do :) and liking it. Didn't have to do anything. The plug on the truck was already wired for them. Prime 2-day delivery in the manufacture's excellent packaging. Installed them the day before a 2,800 mile trip to Yellowsrone Park for major improvement in view and safety. The price was excellent for what I got!
B006MNLEWW|4|Works great.  Only problem is the velcro does not hold to well.  I added snaps and it stays in place very well.
B00M5DF43I|5|fit and worked as good as OEM, only for a lot less money.
B003177AZW|5|Fit my crf450r perfect.
B0002MABGE|3|Not the best quality, wish I would have bought a better one. But I guess it is ok for the price.
B00AZQXNR6|5|Looks great. Just take your time putting it on.  Update 5/15/2016: The decal still looks great, and just bought another one
B000E3VHVO|4|Did a good job of deepening the tone of the exhaust, but didn't remove all the rasp. I didn't put it further down the line then I would normally but dont know if location makes that much of a difference. I expected better since the reviewers have put this item on a pedestal.
B00BXLEI2G|1|An outstanding set of ramps. the arc design allows loading/unloading my tractor a breeze without removing the deck. I do question the weld qualtity that is typical in today's production. I have inspected all the joints with a 10X magnifying glass and no cracks.
B000VS8DZU|5|Excellent material
B009OXHTGC|4|:)
B00NBN1C78|4|Installation was a breeze. It took 15 minutes, tops. And I believe if one were in a rush, it could get done even quicker.<br /><br />My primary concern was that it was not water tight. Although it is mounted far enough forward on the trailer that it should never enter the water, it is not impossible. One dip would probably do the interior components in. My father had the bright idea of sealing the lid with a bead of marine silicone to keep in water tight. After all, this will only be getting used in an emergency, and if I have to pop the seal, I can just clean it and reseal it until the next use.<br /><br />Now this is steel, so it will rust over time, but I feel that if an effort is made to keep it above the water line, and if it is given a fresh water hose down after being around saltwater, it should last at least a few years.<br /><br />For me, the real benefit of this set is that one will never be without a jack in an emergency...because you know that the one time you forget to throw your trailer jack in the back of the truck is the time you'll get a flat. As long as it hangs out in the $60 - $75 price point, it's probably worth it for the peace of mind alone.
B004308V7M|4|Works really well for a wood deck as long as it is weighed down.
B00KRIJ3M6|5|Great product, high quality. Recommended
B00UKCV2ZK|5|Its a good quality sticker
B002E5HMSC|5|Great filter at a great price.  I think the filter is better than OEM.
B00J58Y3JW|5|It is the oem and fits perfect just a note if you do it yourself make sure to pay attention to which way you took the old one out so you can put the new one in the right direction
B000JFHMVQ|5|Changed oil for the first time with this and was awesome! Love the fact that you can pour the oil out of it right box into the oil cans!
B00CJ0B6KC|3|Unit smaller than original cover.  Holes did not line up, but made it work.
B000C1KIUE|5|Decent quality, no problems. Put this in my 2000 Camaro 3.8 and works well so far. I'd say go for it.
B00MRHKHDY|5|very nice and they got here super fast
B006028WSE|5|Fit perfectly, easy install, and very nice look. Seem to be water proof and have held up well over the past 2 months, only problem is that it took a couple of weeks to come in. Other than that I am very pleased.
B00BGAHXLW|4|Bought this for my 2002 Yamaha yz250f. I didn't like how loud the bike was. Even with stock exhaust, the bike was fairly loud, especially when you would give it some good throttle, it would bark very loud. This takes the bark out of it dang near completly and it seems a little quieter when normally riding. According to the size chart on the website, the next smaller size was supposed to fit my bike but when I measured the actual muffler diameter, it matched this one. So I bought it, and it fits well. I have been riding the dirt bike with this in for about a month and a half, riding about 5 times a week, and it has not moved at all or fell out. The instructions said that the blue color would wear off in about 5 rides, but I have probably done at least 70 rides so far and the color hasn't even faded, but I like it because it matches my brake and clutch handles. I have not had to rejet my bike or adjust the carb at all. It does run a little richer, but it really does not take away that much performance and the bike most of the time starts on the first kick now, hot or cold. I would reccomend this product to anyone looking for a quiter bike and a more flashy exhaust tip.
B000GKEZBY|5|Perfect!<br /><br />Don't Laugh. lol<br />I did not exactly buy these for their intended purpose. But they were perfect for what I needed. The trim was as thin as I was hoping for and VERY STICKY! Stickier even on the second day after application.<br /><br />I am revamping Cozy Coupes.<br />They have been repainted and then I add the trim. The trim sticks very well to the Valspar Spray that I have painted the cars with. It does not pull the paint off either. Bends well around curves. Won't turn too tight of a circle but will bend very nice.<br /><br />Hopefully the pics will give you a nice size reference. The back is sticky with 3M.
B0096QYZ8M|1|Not hard to install but have had engine light issues ever since that cant be found
B0009IR0PQ|5|The best spot and stain remover I have ever used.
B00KQHTF1C|5|VERY bright, dont even need my headlights when this thing is on. Very easy to install, its more of a flood light than a spotlight. I kinda wish it reached out alittle further but its still very good. Was kinda skeptical whether this thing was made really cheap for the price but its solid. Would definitely recommend buying this. Picture is when i first installed it during the day.
B001KSG3NO|5|fits perfectly in the original mirror
B008KKMQ4A|4|Great price. and no dust just what I wanted
B009AA9XHC|5|2004 Chevy Avalanche
B00ZO44J6I|5|I love it, the custom spoiler fit perfectly, the Spa Yellow matched the car, installation was easy I am very happy with the product. I would like to order a front lip for my Spa Yellow S2000.
B0002YM2Y6|5|Its awesome
B004OXBXL4|3|Perfect size and what we were looking for!
B009AA9WVY|5|2004 Chevy Avalanche
B000BXOGNI|4|good product but less $ at WalMart.
B003VDX5D2|5|Perfect for a 5 foot person trying to get in the bed of a 4X4 truck!  Easy to install.
B004TSFZ40|5|This shade fits almost perfectly in the CT200h.  It does what is expected and drastically reduces the heat in the car while protecting the dashboard from sunlight.  It is easy to roll up and store behind the front seats or in the trunk.  My strap came off from the glue after about a year, but I prefer this since I can then put the strap anywhere along the product after it is rolled up.  It prevents loose glue from getting on the inside of the windshield too.
B005N6Y8SG|5|I really love this shirt
B00548VT0I|5|Sounds great in my 2014 Dodge Charger R/T Road/Track Edition. Makes it really sound AMAZING without being overwhelming. There is a slight drone in ecomode but it definitely isn't a killer you'll get used to it after a few weeks. Definitely worth the money!
B0064T4VTW|5|it would of been nice to have programming instructions with it, But other than that it works great.
B00EVIIBGC|5|This little machine is fantastic.  Originally purchased to take camping but now we use it at home as well.  The cubes are small, but work great for beverages and when adding ice to smoothies or protein shakes.  It's small enough to pack and stow for campouts, and next to the Berkey water filter on our small camp table, we always have good water and clean ice.  Makes more ice in a few hours than 2 people can use in an entire day.  The machine does make some sound, but it's minimal, and we get a kick out of the sound of &#34;running water&#34; and falling ice cubes, knowing that soon we will have a full bag of ice in the freezer.
B00158SFNK|5|Works great and does everything I need it to do, very verso tile between all devices, make sure you double check what cord you need though
B000B8N3MI|5|Didn't know not having a fuel cap was making my check engine light come on, until I read reviews on this product.  Great price, fits my 2001 VW Bug perfectly and the check engine light is off!
B00COYNY3A|5|Was super happy with it but after about a week it was already starting to tarnish. I'm fine with it. Has nice weight to it and the paint is still on.
B00VYNFN8G|5|Item fit my 2006 Accord  V6 perfectly. It only took about 5 minutes to replace my old ones.
B00FOOX3FQ|4|Fit well and does the job. Not too much get excited about, but does everything you need.
1844256294|4|Fairly comprehensive manual. Worth the money.
B00JT1RZ8Q|5|Very cute and easy to put on.
B0006SU3QW|5|I don't leave all too many reviews, but Plasti Dip warranted one. This stuff is literally a miracle in a can. I have used it on so many automotive applications. Rather than getting something wrapped, for which you can shell out lots of money, I have used plasti on multiple occasions. Had it over a year on Porsche rims without any issues! You have to touch it up ever once in a while, but that's not a big deal to me. The best part, it's absolutely reversible! If you don't like it, just peel it off, preserve the originality of the car.<br />Miracle in a can, seriously!
B001F7JE8G|5|Installed this Air System this morning in about 30 minutes. Works great and gives the car a stronger sound. No hesitation at all once this was installed.
B000CFS028|5|Improved ride, when pulling trailer loaded behind van.
B00QW7I3Q8|5|Easy to apply and very durable. Pops out and makes all the scrubs jealous. (Ford, Dodge) love the sticker. Will definitely buy more.
B00CTHKHZU|5|Perfect fit for E90 (2006 325i).  Broke the old one with a screwdriver.
B007YLWUNI|1|Don't buy it, it won't fit!!!  Like other reviews have stated the hole for the handle is 90 degrees off.  Not a huge problem, but poor workmanship.  The biggest problem is that it is suppose to be 5/8 inches (.625) and it is really .638 inches.  Doesn't sound like much but it will not fit in the tube on your chair!!!  You can try to grind it down or machine it if you have the tools, but it is then so thin that it won't last.  Stay away from this part.  It cost me $15.00 plus shipping, even though I a prime member, and it won't work.
B008BBTASI|5|excellent product and service
B005JPH5Z4|4|I'm not a pro, I just do my own cars. As a mechanic, I love the fact that they are double sided bonnets.<br />And the 3M quality, makes them last longer than an average one.
B001DRHMMS|5|Perfect fit for E90 (2006 325i).
B001GG6G28|5|Love this sticker.
B00L32L4A4|3|It's OK for the price and function.  Easy to install for someone not mechanically inclined.  Good packaging and not damaged on delivery.  Instructions not very good.  After 1 month still waterproof but I did need to use extra weather stripping, that was enclosed with cover - nice extra to get.  My biggest complaint is opening it.  The latch does not fold back in to the cover and stay when folding up.  I am attaching pictures to show what I mean.  I would not buy again because of this issue.  I can fix it with tape or some other retaining mechanism but would have expected this to be tested and fixed before manufacturing.
B007ONPFC4|5|Perfect fit for Audi Q5 non-hybrid. Well made and has optonal cut-outs for cargo net rings. These can be easily cut with a sharp knife. Well designed product. Much better fit than Weathertech cargo mat, at least in this application.
B003YK96VC|4|Perfect fit, easy to install.
B00XW2JGEY|5|Ver y nice
B000X3EWBM|5|I used this pads to replace my 2001 Land Rover Discovery 2 old pads (Advance Auto Premium pads).  I had the pads for 3 weeks and decided to get this brand.  I had the Green SUV pads before which was good but dusted so much.  I was very skeptical, just as I am with any other purchases that make online using peer reviews.  I am a believer of this brand for my Rover.  The difference in stopping power was immediate after the replacement and I am very satisfied with the quality of the item as well as the performance.  Dusts much less that I had it for 2 months. I will be using this again if my brake pads need replacement.
B00172CQ4I|5|After a couple of recent bicycle-motor vehicle accidents locally wherein visibility was a factor I looked into options for my rig.  I bought the emblem, spade mount, and mounting socket all together. It was a plus that all three were made in the USA (United States of America). I stopped at a hardware store and customized the mounting socket attachment for another $3.32  It turned out great.  Jim
B00W4XNQ16|5|Exactly as advertised.  Excellent quality, sturdy.  Very pleased so I bought a second set.  Arrived very quickly.
B007TY6UJ0|4|Good for the price
B00P2KANI2|5|Watch a U tube video first, then if you are mechanicly inclined it shouldn't be to hard to install. I've had mine in for a couple of months no problems. Some others have said they had problems with the rod attachment, use locktite. For the price and having your car locks work again can't go wrong.
B008Z4DAKK|5|Beautiful gold trim! What a classy mug! Thanks!
B003U6LIX4|4|Had to adjust the angle on the head pipe hangar. Otherwise excellent fit up and leak free joints. Sounds nice WOT and minimal drone.
B0083J7K6M|2|It was ok. Wasn't exactly what I expected but it was ok enough to keep considering I'm selling the bike. But if I was keeping the bike I would change them again for a better quality.
B00P87W0IU|5|Used this product for years on my white BMW and black M-B.  Most of the time I before I apply the sealer I clay bar the car - if you haven't yet tried a clay bar you should as it gets rid of any super fine pollutants on the surface which prepares it perfectly for the sealer.  PL sealer goes on easily (I do it by hand) and comes off easily, without streaking - and on a black car you can really see any and all streaks.  Water continues to bead for months.  Only small issue I have is that if you accidentally get it on nearby black plastic or rubber trim pieces it can be a hassle getting it off after it dries - too bad it doesn't dry clear.  So, you need to be careful when applying near non-metallic dark trim.  It does a great job on the clear plastic headlight covers keeping them cleaner and more bug-free.
B00JWFY906|1|one of the 2 lights i bought has started to fog up inside
B00BD4SJBO|5|I love them. They fit really good on the seats and just enhance my interior of the truck. Now need to get the one for the back seat.
B008R0GPV8|5|Perfect fit over glasses ......kewl look ...... Comfortable
B004ZF44NA|5|Awesome
B001RBCU90|5|It's exactly i was looking for
B000ANXZ7W|5|Works perfect. No mess.
B000BZI7CC|1|While this pump is original equipment specifications. The years this pump was made for had a mandatory recall posted for a wire harness fire problem. Last checked the recall had been performed on 97 percent of affected automobiles. This DOES NOT have the up to date harness. It is square. The updated harness is oval. Make sure of your equipment befor you buy
B003WOXOD6|5|No one stole our stuff, so it works! No noise, no damage. Met our needs and expectations.
B002GUYW7O|3|The taillight looks the same as the old one and replacing it was a piece of cake with Youtube, so no complaints here.  The only thing is it does not fit as smoothly as the old one did.  At the seam with the outside of the car it does stick out a little bit-- may not be very noticeable.  In my opinion this option is better than the $300+ option of having the dealer put it on.
B001B7A2L8|5|Did the trick.  Easy install.  Look it an installation video on YouTube.  Probably took 20 minutes (or less) total.  Product fit my 2005 Civic perfectly.  Buy this for less than the labor cost of having someone do it for you!
B006N9E1IO|5|Excellent quality from a well know manufacturer.  Great price.
B00268JH3A|5|I ordered these for my 2006 Honda Pilot, and received exactly what was stated. They installed very easily and have remained secure with our carrier on top of our vehicle all summer through several vacations. We looked at some aftermarket crossbars at REI, but they sat up a lot higher and we experience much less wind resistance/drag with these crossbars. I am very happy with my purchase.
B001EGT3I4|4|Great product made in USA. Had to heat up the old one with a torch and beat it off (lol)with a 2lb sledge hammer.
B00JAXIXLG|5|Everything I thought it would be !  Great price and right on time .
B000B7PHQY|5|just a spark plug for my mower
B0002KKTT0|5|Used it on a laptop and had to reopen it a week after. Feels like the original stenght of whathever the manufacutrer puts on the screws.
B000760FWU|5|I was needing a way to Raise up my desk and these worked great!
B007V2CZ30|4|The Covercraft windshield shade for my<br /> 2015 Elantra didn't quite cover the whole windshield, but all and all it's a great product.
B00K35RSRA|5|Worked great
B00993O4YC|4|I was hoping for a heavier hitch cap. The one that comes from Toyota kept falling out and I lost several, so I looked around and found this one that locks into place. Looking straight on it looks great, but from the side you can see that it is a very thin piece of metal. So to me it looks a little cheap, but the price was good and it work so I am okay with it!
B00CW9J3OG|5|delivered on time, great price for the amount
B00B09I1YW|4|I like the jacket, don't get me wrong... it fits great and works great.  The removable sleeves are kinda pointless IMO though.  My problem is with their description.  They imply that there is armor in the jacket when there is not.  I complained directly to them and they &#34;made up for it&#34; by sending me a free hat, pair of gloves and liner for the jacket.  Liner is kinda useless too buuut it was nice of them to try to correct the issue!
B003D4KA32|5|Early delivery and an easy install on my Forester S.  Let's hope it doesn't fall off or rust.
B0002U2V1Y|5|Product performed just as described on my weathered 2001 Toyota Land Cruiser that has been neglected in the washing department.  I watched several YouTube videos regarding clay bar detailing and read a few reviews on this specific product.  I can honestly say that my car is back to near-pristeen condition.  I have washed,waxed, and polished this car many times before throughout the years but adding the clay bar to the mix brought it up to another level of detailing by smoothing out the paint and bringing out the shine even more.  I recommend this product and would purchase this again.
B003ELW8LG|5|Works perfect.  No problems installing
B00C2CFE50|1|Broken after 10 times using
B003YDY826|5|Worked great.  Husband was very pleased
B004GE0W7C|5|fit well
B00CFALFXY|5|This is my first time really using microfiber cloths in my cleaning routine so I'm still getting used to them but they are a nice value for the money. They are a good size, sturdy and wash well. I like having different colors so I can use them for different rooms or purposes (kitchen, bathroom, mirrors, etc.)
B002GO784Y|5|Great value. Very easy to install , less than 20 minutes.
B0002STRG8|5|Work flawlessly. Very durable construction. Built in stop-locks retain tension while you work. Wish I bought these years ago. A must for large diameter/high tensile rings.
B00HCTTOJ0|5|Excellent!
B0126YHPQY|5|These are bright and clear, and really affordable. I found instructions for replacement by searching onilne for my car make/model, and it takes less than 10 minutes. Since they are white, they can be seen by others easily. However, as some people have mentioned, they might not be seen as easily in the day compared to yellow bulbs.<br /><br />The manufacturer sent a free sample for reviewing.
B00F9G8TP8|5|Fitted like a glove.
B0036E9VB6|3|Not as powerful as I would have liked. It takes a long time to add 15 lbs to my tires coming off the Beach. It also gets extremely hot.
B007V2BOGE|5|Pretty happy with it so far dealing with az heat. Really does make a difference in car temp
B001CI6UFS|5|As expected
B00EA6TD6M|4|Good price fast shipping
B00FEZMI4M|5|Served my purpose. Perfect fit !!!
B000VKTUJQ|5|good
B00UIUWO1U|5|Great plug and play lights for my 2005 Tacoma
B001MUN57W|5|Arrived fast! Exactly what we needed.
B004RT50NC|5|real good
B00C565VW4|5|An exact fit to my 1994 GMC Safari van. I had hoped for a noticeable change in performance but that has not happened. If my emissions numbers improve at next smog test, that will be the telling factor if this achieved the necessary results.
B00GNG9N30|5|Second purchase of this item - first one went missing.  I am a 50+ female with little to no skill with &#34;car stuff&#34;.  That being said I was able to use this item very easily.  Instructions are clear & concise and took the &#34;intimidation factor&#34; out of deploying the jump starter.  We spend time in rural Oregon & because of this handy little device I was able to get my vehicle up and running with easy & confidence.
B000V2W0GE|5|Thanks for the quick delivery, fine product and great price.  If you need an upstream filter to protect a pump from debris damage, this is what you need.
B001VXXUWK|5|Excellent face shield but it hasn't had a heavy piece bounce off of it yet.  Light weight and comfortable which helps a great deal over time.
B004AL5V90|5|Exact fit.works great.
B013SAJ1FS|5|Excellent set of tools.  Within a matter of minutes I was apple to tune a recently purchased 2 cycle string trimmer that did not run properly straight out of the box.  Evidently many of these small 2 cycle engines are from Mexico - assembled and tested at high altitudes.  Without adjustment at lower altitudes they simply will not run properly.  Adjusting the unit only took a matter of minutes.  Worth every penny.  Also adjusted my neighbors 2 cycle blower.
B00846NIG0|4|Fine product for the price. Slightly less polished finish than I would have liked, but looks great on car.
B000VI4ZGQ|5|I bought two, one of me to reach the top closet shelves. One for my mom to help her step up into the vehicle. It is great and light weight!
B00O3JL3IW|4|Fit great! Easy install. Happily surprised. Only reason not five stars is that it is too soon to see how they wear.
B0031XULF2|4|Somewhat large for trailer tires<br />Good quality
B00I8Y3R00|5|Nice quality and price.
B004VA3G9C|5|Great fit
B00P2VVMLS|5|Delivery was quicker than expected. Installation was a snap. Extremely satisfied.
B00ZYJDFBS|5|Bought as a gift. They loved it thanks !
B000FMO6XU|5|Thanks for the quick delivery, great price and fine product.  If you want to extend the life of your rod ends and other areas that need grease in a boot, here's your device.
B00QXE3RCK|5|The part was delivered in just few days and work just fine good love it
B006X98A7C|3|It came looking a little less than new and with only a 9.6 Volt charge.  So far it seems to be working, but am still concerned about how long it will last.
B001E4E0ZW|5|Great product
B00AIW5XHA|5|If you have a hitch on your vehicle, show your pride without having to place a sticker showing your disgust for this current government.
B00M78820I|2|It's too large for my Toyota RAV4. It doesn't stay in place , the sides to not cover the corner at all. The Rays still come inside. And the at stays hot.
B00KTJ1ZMY|5|It works but I had to pay Chevrolet $75 to program it to my vehicle 😳 and it took about an hour to do.
B00QSA77NE|5|Fast delivery<br />Works as described<br />Would buy again
B00NP61VDQ|5|Even though I live in Florida we get ice on windshields in fall and winter at times. Obviously I have not been able to try the product itself (it is August after all) – but the product is a good quality product – you actually receive two scrapers along with two microfiber cloths that are color coordinated (I kept the pink one and gave the blue one to my husband) – the cloth is pink and the scraper is a cherry red – the blue scraper is more a purplish blue and the cloth is light blue. The handles of the scrapers appear sturdy and are covered with foam – thus allowing a strong and secure grip. The product comes with a one year warranty. With the purchase of the product (and if you leave feedback on their website) you gain access to the VIP area for more stuff to try!  (I was provided a sample of this product through a promotion in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. The information provided is solely my opinion and based on my personal experience.)
B004UR30BK|5|We have used this only once so far.  I have a receiver on the rear of my Travel Trailer and it works nicely there.  I do not expect any problems or difficulties with this bike rack.  I do use additional bunges for add security and peace of mind.  It appears to be a quality product and well worth the money spent on this item.  I had been looking for the price to go down and finally found it at $120.  I have read other reviews on this item but disagree with most of them.  I expect it to perform as it should for a very long time.
B002FE1J0E|5|These are beautiful!! Fit without a fuss. Included the headlight bulb. Flawless. Replaces old faded opaque lenses.  Excellent price for them, quick delivery. Could not be happier with this purchase.
B00AJP4XL8|5|Worked for my yamaha 2004 1700 roadstar silverado. Fuel gauge working again.
B00I250MIU|4|Quick shipping. Ordered it on Thursday and shipped from MA. I live in CA and received it on Saturday. As for the product, I didn't even have to warm it up. The summer SoCal sun did the trick and I applied it very easily. Nice looking and protects my 2015 Forester XT's door handle paint from scratches. Good stuff. I'd give it 4 and a half stars if I could only due to price. But hey, I understand these guys have to make money too.
B00CCZ12WQ|3|This dose not fit the RF-1100 as stated. Its too big and has a differnt visor setup. Asked for refund. I will update with awnser<br /><br />Gave 3 for now. For fast shipping.
B00QW3N4GQ|5|Product arrived on time as described.
B007WPB40G|5|Fit great.
B0043063JU|4|I like this mat because it looks nice and covers my pool deck nicely. The con is that my patio chairs snag on it and you need to make sure it is anchored down! The wind will blow it away :)
B00HEZYVYA|2|I only gave it the extra star because their customer service tried to help. The ledge where the base transitions to the LED array prevents it from going far enough into the socket to rotate on the locator pins.  Maybe it will work with other sockets, but these are stock GM sockets.  Resorted to grinding off the ledge with a bench grinder.  Now it fits into the socket and lights up, but I would hardly call it &#34;super bright&#34;.  Not nearly as bright as the old 1156 incandescent bulb.
B0042U4YFQ|4|Good quality for the price. Stuff sat is large enough to easily store the mat.
B000FKKOK6|5|Installed on the wife's Prius with FIAMM 72112. Now it sounds like a real car !
B005REEAXW|5|Perfect fit and what a difference it makes in the Florida heat.
B00AXE635O|1|NO ADHESIVE.USELESS.
B0031BOQ3M|5|Chips worked perfect. Look great in place on mirror.
B00J9G6P0K|5|Looks awesome on my car.  The colors were not as crisp as in the picture though.
B000C13UF4|5|EASY INSTALLATION,HASSLEFREE!!!
B00MVD62HE|1|They are not of good quality the ends of the mirror covers curl up when the sun goes down
B000SOFLHK|2|It was much much smaller that I thought it would be, especially for the cost.  Only 3 1/2&#34; in diameter.  I wanted something much bigger.
B00GHSEQTU|5|I am satisfied with my purchase, it's just what I wanted.
B000P6WMLO|5|Its the right product, from the original manufacturer.  Took some time installing them. A Q-tip with vaseline applied on the gasket, and in the fitting kept the gasket from getting damaged.  Its a TIGHT fit!
B008NYL80G|5|It was just what I expected.
B007OSL3DY|5|got 2, one for each side.  still have my tailgate
B000CM5C72|5|Fast delivery and accurate description.
B00HAG66D2|4|Good quality stickers
B00902G3OQ|2|Fit a 2007 Trailblazer.  The gray was a little lighter than the truck plastic, and the big switch was very loose in the new part, had to shim it up and back.  This photo is also upside down.  But all in all it works.  Just took longer to install because of the switch shims.  Update:  November 16, 2015.  Went out to kiss girlfriend good bye and discovered that part had broken.  Tab on top/rear had sheared cleanly off.
B002LGXWZG|5|Good price
B00NTSU8WU|5|These kawell lights are amazing...super bright, reliable, durable, and very high quality..the housing is made of cast aluminum with heat fins built into the back  the mounting hardware is good the brackets are steel that are powder coated the bolts would be better if they were stainless but are zinc coated so they will last... My friends and I all have these on our vehicles and atv's and I have a smaller version on my boat...bottom line there great, will last a long time, and can take a beating... You won't be disappointed.. And if you wanna make these Evan better, go to your local hardware store and pickup about $2.00 worrth of stainless bolts..which arnt needed but for those people who want it to be perfect..
B004K82GWI|4|Very good
B004A6JA2O|5|Got rod of musty smell in 2013 tundra
B00CMY0XD6|5|Very happy with this product.
B0001XPC7C|4|I LOVE this little gadget! I only wish it had 4-coin slots
B00AV9EBIM|5|Love this!
B00DSD56LY|5|Easy to apply
B00B29UQLG|5|I haven't taken it on the highway yet so we'll see if there are issues with wind noise at high speeds, but no problems noticeable up to about 50mph. The rack installed easily in about an hour and is nice and secure. I thought it was a nice touch that the seller (autopartstoys) not only contacted me to insure that they had correct vehicle for all the kits, but they even asked what color it was and noted that there was a silver color available as well. Went with Rhino-Rack over other brands due to the carriers they have available. I can now mount 4 kayaks on my rack, and soon will get the carriers for my bikes.
B001U8RCR0|5|perfect... identical to the  original
B00DHQ18SC|2|Did not fit. Was supposed to fit 2012 Escape but it did not.
B00VAJWZD0|3|This is a good product for flat glass. If you have to do any heat molding, forget about it.  Also, it wrinkles very easy.  Very unforgiving!  I would buy this again for my house windows, but not for my car!
B0054WGRBA|1|It broke in a week.
B00KQSW78E|5|Ok
B0031I20JC|1|bought it in may and only lasted till today (Aug 29).  color faded out quickly and i went to remove it and it just ripped near the seat area, there are no sharp points in that area at all.  it does fit great and did not blow off in winds but just did not last at all didn't even get half a year out of it.
B004VKR2VK|4|Good
B005IGRO2S|5|Fit perfect on 2007 Yamaha FX HO Cruiser.
B000BUTDCA|5|Perfect product just as described fast shipping
B00KAPLT64|5|It fits perfectly
B00UYDEKU4|5|I just received this a few days ago and so far I love it! I took it out today in 85 degree weather and it worked great, when moving I actually feel cooler with the jacket on. And when stopped it is still a good temp. I went for a ride last night, it was 60 degrees, I added the insert, and the temp was perfect. I expect I would have to start laying when going below 60. The inside has a great mesh lining, very comfortable. My favorite part is the heavy gauge mesh, most of the black. It feels strong and is very comfortable. I got a XL and I am happy with the size. I usually wear XL , sometimes 2XL in shirts.
B00EELM7PM|5|The hubcaps were easy to put on and made the car look sharper. Very happy with my purchase, I would recommend the hubcaps to family & friends
B008S9QUC2|3|Does the job, looks a little strange sticking out of the back tire.  I wish it was a little shorter.
B00YDDT9IO|5|The best bomprer protector
B00LM4OQMG|5|Just what I wanted works great!
B00NGOY54E|5|Perfect fit
B00I250MIU|2|After install 2 days. One is already missing.  I was install as follow exectly by manual use hair dryers heat air.  First day, still surived . Then second day, driver side is gone and passenger side was almost slip down.  Looks nice and could be protect my car' door handle from scratch. However this is over $30. I could not afford this for use only few days usage.
B002Q1INDM|4|We've had the ARB for about a month and it works as expected.  (My lovely girlfriend bought it so I don't show up as a verified buyer).<br />We bought it for use in our camper/adventure van for camping/surf/mountain bike trips.  We plug it into our Goal Zero Yeti1250, which has its own permanently mounted 150watt solar panel for charging.  We rarely stay in developed campgrounds and do mostly off grid trips.<br /><br />The ARB works great and cools as expected for a $$$ 12V cooler.  We just got back from a 2 week road trip with the ARB as our only cooler.  I did order the canvas travel bag for the ARB, and think it was a good investment, more on that later.<br /><br />A couple notes in no particular order.<br /><br />- The ARB requires 80-90 watts for startup power then the power consumption settles into the 55 watt range. (The goal zero has a power consumption display).<br />- After about 8-9 days of camping (without consistent sunlight for the solar panel),  the ARB ran down the Goal Zero Yeti's voltage to where it didn't have enough voltage to start the compressor.  We were also using the Goal Zero to run our roof vent, charge cell phones, iPads, run LED lighting, etc.  We could hear the compressor trying to kick on, but it didn't have quite enough voltage.  Just be aware that the startup requires decent voltage in the battery.  This is important for RVs and campervans with a house battery.  Plugging in overnight at a campground fixed the issue.  Just be aware of battery usage for long trips.  Definitely would be possible to run down your car battery with the ARB if you were parked for a few days in a backcountry camp spot.<br />-the ARB is not insulated like a Yeti or Coleman Extreme, or one of the other high end coolers out there.  You can feel cold bleed through the metal parts of the cooler.  I bought the canvas travel bag and cut double thick reflectix (foil lined insulation) to go inside the canvas travel bag.  You can barely tell it is there and it made a big difference in my ability to feel cold bleed through the cooler. See the attached pics to get an idea of how I added extra insulation to the ARB travel bag.  Note that the travel bag does have foil facing, but it is pretty thin.  I used a sharpie, straight edge, razor, and shears to mark and cut out double width foil insulation to add to the inside of the travel bag.  Took about 20 minutes.  Pic of the ARB strapped into our camper van (2007 Ford E350 custom conversion) have the extra insulation installed, you can barely tell it's there.<br /><br />Overall we are happy with the ARB.  Not carrying ice is really nice.  We  plug the ARB into the campervan 12V outlet when driving, then switch back to the Goal Zero Yeti when parked.  For longer trips (we are doing a month long road trip next summer through western Colorado), I plan on chaining in a second 100ah battery to the Goal Zero, primarily for running the ARB for long term off grid use.big difference in my ability to feel cold bleed through the cooler.

B006QH6XQG|5|The suggested size fit very well with no difficulty.  Once installed the car started without hesitation.  The adapters provided appeared to allow this batter to work in almost any situation unless the battery was too large - which is was not.  No qualms about this purchase as far as quality or fit.  I do however have one point that I find at fault.  The manufacturer warranties the battery for 36 months, which is excellent, but the battery came with a sticker placed upon it indicating that it was purchased in May of this year and not August.  This effectively shortens the warranty period by about 10% or 3 months.  None the less I would still purchase the battery again if needed.
B000C823UK|5|Excellent product, used in my 95 Buick Regal as I wanted a cooler T Stat for this vehicle 180*
B00A7EQF8A|5|Well made and works well. Used them for the first time this weekend and it made the job much easier.
B001BNAQJU|5|Love them!! Very good product!
B002OVDEGK|5|excellent service and good quality product at a great price, thank you
B007FFYYVY|5|it is even than the picture i love<br />it and would  tell everyone to get one.
B000TYOQVQ|5|Worked perfectly for my 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix! Perfect fit, and like the different color choice for matching.
B00IBG2C9W|4|Love them, they're the perfect size in length and shine brighter than the old ones I had. Only issue, the threads were wider than what they said in the product description. They were 14mm where as it said 8mm and the pic said 10mm.<br /><br />All I have to do now is get them to flash right and I'm all good
B004C443S0|4|Happy with the gloves thanks.
B008FYKV4I|3|Works well enough. Quality/durability is a little suspect.
B00AK91P3W|5|I had heard about this from my a friend; can leave the window cracked and the car does not feel like an oven when getting into the car in this over 100 degree weather.  Would definitely recommend.
B000ALJ4MY|4|Worked very well in filling a 1 inch crack with a small chip.  In fact, I immediately bought two more to fix the rest of the cracks on my windshield I was tired of looking at.
B00O4CV2B6|5|Looks great!!  Well Made!!!
B00K7DNYDK|5|fit perfect
B00CO9PDGQ|5|My 78yr old mom has SEVERE dryness. These work great
B0013I40D6|1|Lasted less than a week!! Bulb burnt out!! Thanks for Amazon for there awesome customer service!!!
B004GE2RXE|5|perfect replacement
B005GL8QOK|5|Everything I get from Amazon I'm very happy with the clothes car cover and the bed spread I'm very pleased and your delivery is fast I'm glad u send it before 1pm before I go to work it's nice I don't trust one of the neighbors i do thank u again for your excellent products.
B00HE7SJ7S|5|awesome lights just put them in super bright as far as quality not sure yet but so far so good
B0002ZQ016|5|This stuff is great!  Packaging has changed but can't tell a difference.  Follow it with 3M machine polish & you''ll be amazed with the results.
B000VLYCCU|5|Works fine
B000CFAVA2|5|2013 Honda Ridgline. I got same day delivery. Cheaper than Autopart store (o'reileys). Super fit and super easy to install. May be easiest thing I ever installed on a a vehicle. I can't speak to how long they last though. Only time will tell
B00TU3UNW8|5|Works
B00VWT4WO8|5|These lights are amazing offering a wide variety of colors, contours and lighting functions. The ability to sync the flash with the music is superb.  Super easy to install under an hour or 2 depending on vehicle and how well you want to hide your wiring.  Literally plug and play and the remote it comes with makes everything that much easier. In fact I lost my remote a couple weeks after I bought these (granite it ships from China so takes 3-4 weeks) and the customer service of this company is so amazing they are sending me a replacement completely free and actually cared about how they were and anything else I'd need.  If your considering buying interior lights look no further then here
B00004Y622|3|Good griping power but nearly useless adhesive on the backside. Plan on using your own epoxy to glue it down or screw it down.
B00WXBYYR4|5|Awesome products as always. DuPont.
B006VXZQXG|4|This product is very nice and the service too.
B00DJ25MLS|1|The lights barely fit, when u push them in the plastic falls off terrible buy for me.
B00UNTU3VO|5|This is a great quality duster! not made cheaply but of solid construction, it also very fluffy and removes filth quickly. however, you need to really shake it up the first few times because if you dust with it straight out of the box, it will leave fine little hairs everywhere on your vehicle from being new. It also comes in a nice bag that you close up when you finished.
B000JFNAAS|5|perfect fit for my gauges and the 12oz 134a freon cans
B000KYYMKK|4|Works great!  Pleased with this little number!!!
B00JX1YL0C|3|The ring was fine, but the retainer was to big i ended up snapping one of the fins off with my hands trying to get it in, i ended up just using the ring with some coated tie wire.
B000QV2D4E|4|Thick rubber with appropriate rigidity and diameter.
B004QXWWOY|5|nice and shiney
B00O5MVIXM|5|Great fit on my 2006 BMW 325xi, looks good and I like it.
B0066Q358Q|5|Quick shipping and just what I wanted!
B004C6OBBC|4|Does the job ...
B00T46K060|2|Cheap pig tail wiring harness sucks. Had to repair wiring to make work.
B002AK98WY|5|Came. Really fast for delivery.<br />Fits perfect. Blocks out all light nice and dark
B00LNLLADG|1|It didn't have one of the packages that was supposed to come with it
B00QK127WW|5|Looks great and fits snug! Exactly as advertised. I will say it's slightly short but not really noticeable.
B002MW6HRO|5|This works great with my new Kenwood DNX-892 HU, in my 2012 Ford F-150 XLT.  Now I have 2 usable usb ports counting my Sync usb port as well.  I installed this in my center console, out of site.  Has a oem look to it, very nice.
B00PMXWFDU|5|well built light good colour
B00G5SF5FQ|5|Great conversation piece!
B00EC2CG9U|4|The metal hooks slide down the cord and are sharp. If you're careful not to use them with anything that's delicate - or fabric - it's fine.
B00B7GHIGA|5|Good deal. Perfect for my application. Honda element, to carry Honda trail90, nx125, no need for big adventure van with trailer. Way easy to assemble, and install. Not for big bikes. 300 pounds would be pushing the limits. Happy to have it. Besides, it goes on front receiver on big adventure Van to carry the swap meet score in the trailer, and trail90 on the front... Cool
B00W8DBZQU|5|Wow!! I had some doubts because I wasn't sure they would fit like a glove and that the quality would be good, but they are awesome!! Went above my expectations!! I was going to invest in some of those Weathertech ones, but glad I found these for my new Jeep Renegade. They even have the JEEP logo and a cool pattern embossed! I am now ready for Wisconsin winters!
B00VR7MWB0|4|A nice touch addition for my jeep
B002SSKFGG|5|This water heater fit perfectly. With the amazon fast delivery I was back on the road in two days.  Thanks
B000AP1N06|5|Gotta love these K&N Intakes!
B00NLLBNWO|5|Got the clutch fast and work with my 1979 Honda cb750
B008LY18XU|5|Right size right fit. Fast shipping I wasn't looking for it so soon.
B00AW1AH0U|5|Good oem.quality  much easier to install and remove than single one piece cartridges
B00HOI904I|5|Why pay twice as much - or even more - for other liftgate supports that do the exact same thing!?!  These fit perfectly and work great!
B00DJBW7O4|5|Excelent!! Thank you
B000CC3EP4|5|Item installed in under one minute. Perfect to reach my roof rack. It does not rattle. I was a little shy about buying this based on some of the other reviews. I have to say it is all I needed and does not stick out when walking behind the vehicle. I sure did not want to play shin bang evey time I needed to walk behind it.  I put this on a Curt 2inch hitch and used a locking type pin. It is doing what it said it would do.
B00HKSNQII|5|Oem plug looks really good
B004OFNJZ0|5|I love these windshield sunshades.<br />I live in Texas and the sun can be really hot. The two part system is so easy to install - and they do a great job to keep the car cooler.<br />They fold easily with a flip and a swish - to store right by my car seat. Love them and would buy again - and will probably consider buying more  to give to others as a gift!
B00R11TDYA|5|Great amount of light for the price. Good quality and easy installation.
B0002UQATS|5|this stuff is the best
B007XCN0XW|5|This emblem makes my car look completely different . The material is very durable and smooth.
B00KGGTF9U|5|This is so much easier to use than our old accordion-style shade... plus, it takes up much less space in storage. The material is very lightweight and comes folded in a small pouch. We keep ours in the glovebox. Like any sunshade, installation against the windshield can be a bit cumbersome. I uploaded a picture of it installed in our 2014 Ford Explorer... I've since moved it to a Ford Focus and it fits better it that (stays up without needed to use visors to hold it in place.)<br /><br />The bulk of the shade consists of two big round circles that spring open; I'm giving the shade 4-stars because if these hoops were a bit larger, it would be easier to to keep it in place under the visors. It's also tricky to keep it in place because of the rear-view mirror. I really wish a shade-manufacturer would take that into account and put a reinforced slit in the shield at mirror height. The benefits would be two-fold... it'd stay flatter against the glass, and the mirror-thru-slit would help hold it in place.<br /><br />To see a video demonstration of the unfolding -- and more importantly, the RE-folding -- here's a how-to video I found on YouTube: [...]<br />I received a complimentary Sunshade from X-Shade for evaluation purposes in writing this review.
B00JAA7B6W|4|Put on a month ago and it looks great!  The only issue is that because it is flexible rather than bent to shape you need to be very careful to place it correctly.  I recommend getting both ends fixed first then working towards the middle.
B000CITGNW|4|The bed rug fit and installed without a problem. A week after installing I had to make a few loads to the dump with some wood and other things and it worked perfectly. I would have given it five stars but for some reason even with cleaning and prepping the tail gate I couldn't keep the liner attached with the supplied Velcro fasteners. I added more Velcro and finally had to silicone it to the tailgate. It stays in place now with no problem. All the features make it a plus.
B00ZM9LANA|5|Great item, good quality, something I will use for years to come. I drive for Uber And LYFT and I have it in the back seat stuffed with candy, gum and snacks which my customers love and they even ask me where I bought that cute handy organizer and I tell them Amazon by autotech,
B000BQSIWK|1|I ordered the charger and opened it pluged it in and the thing don't work at all
B00VU7LC6S|1|the level was great for the 1st week and on week 2 I noticed the front was back at stock height and reliezed that the driver side had collapsed on me
B000W0RQRS|1|Although the lock looks impressive, it didn't last long at all.  It failed to open after week 2.  I fiddled with it using all three keys, bending two of them in the process (not hard to do as they seemed cheap).  It took me exactly two attempts with a bolt cutter to get through outer layer and inner cable which was actually not that large.  Ironclad?  Not really.
B001CI94DS|5|small. fitting was easy and stays in place.  once you fine tune and adjust.  the rear view is great for the size of them.  and my Bike Looks Awesome
B009MV71VO|5|It works perfect and the price met my needs thanks Amazon
B00EI6CKVE|5|Love it just what I wanted.
B00F9RNIPI|5|Cables arrived with nice stowage bag.  Have not used the cables but they look capable.
B00FOOVUK6|1|Broke within a 2 weeks of installation; not even used heavily
B00CRQCFE4|5|Had to get a pro shop to install but only cost $120 so im happy . Great deep sound no popping..... didnt quite match up right to the route of the exaught it replaced. Ill update with pictures.
B0064RNWFS|5|My commander was a lower end model that did not have these rails. I fitted them in about an hour. There is a drill template and you need to have a pop-rivet tool that can pull 3/16&#34; pop-rivets. Result is very nice. Seller returned my inquiries and answered questions about the fit for my Commander.
B004VNKN0O|5|EXCELLENT
B0002SQYV4|5|This product is great, work, and do a great job on my car. I recommend this product to everybody, thanks!
B001DCH33G|5|These work very well, installation was fairly easy and they lift as well or better than the original equipment.
B00JVWDWPS|4|Fits as expected. Does help with the sun on really hot day.
B004A56OII|4|Product was as describe.  Fit my 2007 Tundra perfectly. The big spring (the two red one) does need to be stretched a little so it would go on.  The two little black spring are painted but was cheaply done.  No matter, it still works
B005JVFTTM|5|Works well. Easy to use.
B00KD400OO|5|work great, no problem
B003CJI4Z4|5|Exact fit on my GS500E, changes out in less than a minute with a 10mm wrench and a flathead.
B000C9GZH6|5|Good  replacement  at a good price.
B00E1SNJ6O|5|Great quality and they look as good as they perform. My mechanic was more excited than I was when he saw the hardware. Everything fit snug in my 2001 f150 supercrew 4x4.
B004P23VQO|5|A few observations after 6 months of use.<br />THE GOOD: 1) No leaks. Can't say the same for my factory hard top. 2) Once it's all buttoned up and the material has stretched a bit, it fits great and the panels can be easily removed and reinstalled without issue 3) Look FANTASTIC<br />THE NOT SO GOOD: 1) Material seems to stain easily. Wash mud off the top immediately unless you want a subtle camo patterned top. 2) Tree branches will easily scratch the plastic windows, but we all know that going in. 3)  With side and rear panels removed and windows open even just a bit, the top will beat itself to death at highway speeds even with the cinch down straps tightened up.<br />PUSH: Nowhere near as noisy as the older Jeep soft tops, but nowhere near as quiet as the hard top. The versatility and coolness factor outweigh the additional noise.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this top and would buy it again in a heartbeat. Haven't had my factory hard top back on since installing the Trektop NX.<br /><br />Hint: get a couple of large metal key rings and run them through the zipper pulls for the back window. Makes life a lot easier when opening and closing the rear window.<br /><br />Follow the Bestop and other assembly videos on youtube and installation is not painful at all. No leaks and it looks great. It's a little noisier than the hard top, but not annoyingly so. Only gripe is it's not always easy to get the zippers aligned correctly when you're in a hurry, the result being it takes much longer to remove the top next time. Just have to be more careful with the zippers and try to install the rear and side windows during the daylight. One installation tip. I wasn't able to get the rear window zipped up upon initial installation as there was a 2 inch gap between the rear and side windows. After leaving the rest of top on for 24 hours, then letting the Jeep sit in the sun for a few hours, there was enough stretch in the side windows and rear window to get it zipped. So don't panic if it doesn't zip up initially.panic if it doesn't zip up initially.
B005N6X7L0|3|Wish it fit a little looser around the chest.
B00S2U68L0|5|This was a perfect fit and it looks and works great. It took a little while to get here but when it arrived it was right on time.
B000BPG4LI|5|God product, just as described
B00E0EUJ2Q|5|EXCELLENT
B007BGBBXG|3|Bought in December. Toyota emblem corroding by August.
B00C305LSG|3|I keep my bike in garage all night and every day unless im riding it which isnt that often and ive already noticed the black color fading out from sun damage.. disappointed....which is why i only gave it 3 starts for having poor paint quality.
B009MAT4S8|3|Not an exact fit
B007KPU1CU|5|Perfect fit on my 2011 street glide
B0012XIV82|5|Perfect solution for low-tech kayak car rack. No more knot tying!
B004J38I1M|5|This product is probably the best on the market! My Polaris sat for over 6 years till I decided I couldn't afford to send it out for repair! I took the chance that it was the carburetor that need attention! I was right and am happy to say I saved myself about 400 hundred dollars I didn't really have! I really hope they keep these in stock! And also I found out they fit 1986 right up to 1995 Polaris 250 / ES Boss Carbs!! Thank You to the place that had this on hand!
B003PJFP3A|5|Perfect fit, clear instructions. What could be added is that getting the bolt holes to line up is a chore and best accomplished by having another person flex the bumper up & down to line things up. BTW, it may be obvious but no wiring is included, you have to buy that extra!
B00BVPOC20|5|OEM parts. Came with instructions and spring.
B00Z6LWPKG|2|These mirrors do not mount or work as well as the OEM. I had to repair a wiring harness on one mirror prior to installing. During first drive after installing the mirrors vibrated so badly they were unusable at any speed over 40mph. The OEM mirrors I removed never had this problem. I will be returning these.
B00408KNPA|5|Monster noise. Love it. Idk how it passed inspection in VA but it did.
B00GHON5BE|5|I own many if these for fuel storage and LOVE them.  They are the best fuel containers available.
B013ME9PII|5|A perfect solution for a common dilemma.  No balancing helmet on seat or travel bag.  Didn't interfere with operating the bike, just need to get a lock and will have no more worries.  This Helmet Hook is sturdy construction, not flimsy at all, easy to install and use.  I received in exchange for my honest review.
B00F5MUB66|5|Great product
B005VWZ69M|5|It happen to me when a purchased a cheaper part that didn't work and wasted a lot of time and money ordering the right part. For a few bucks more  its the only way to go.
B00HQQQZ0K|5|Great products, perfect fit, fast shipping , got it in 4 days include 1 business day
B00XJQ22N0|5|heavy duty fit perfect raised my hitch 3inches causing trailer to ride high in front
B004GNCRT4|1|burned out in less than a month
B00FVE9Z6U|5|I've used the EVoCharge over a month now. Great product, very pleased! I'd buy it again. The Leaf charges so much faster than via 110V power it's amazing. A cord that is a few feet longer is the only thing I can think of to make the EVoCharge better.
B005238JOE|5|Perfect fit for my 2010 Toyota Corolla.
B000EM019O|3|Used this on my Prelude front grill, cleaned it with dawn, dried, prepped with solvent cleaner, did 3 coats, let it sit for 2 days. Turned out matte black, looks worse than before. and the color is all blotchy, half what it should be half looks like crap. I also did some door handle covers, prepped the same, they turned out good, but not the grill.<br />I stick with the Rust-O-Leum trim black.
B005GYDBNS|4|Keeps the honda running great.
B006BV7Z4Q|5|Mkv gti must buy these are pregapped and I'm running stg 2 tune big difference in the mpg category I noticed a jump in fuel mileage will buy again
B000KL194U|4|Fits perfect, only thing I would change would be to mold over foot rest on top left corner. Salt collects on the carpet above the foot rest.
B009PIJ96Y|5|I was expecting these floor mats to be thick, heavy rubber, so when I opened the package and saw how light they were I was on the verge of being disappointed, but I gave them a chance anyway and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />It turns out that what I'd associated heavy rubber with in a floor mat, is one that lies flat, doesn't slide around around, and has enough &#34;edge&#34; to catch run-off without spilling it on the carpet. These mats do all of that but are made out of a rubberized plastic that is strong, flexible, and light weight. They're so perfectly shaped, and grip the carpet so well that heaviness is an un-need attribute that would just add weight to your ride.
B00IFND2Q8|5|I use this in the Unit at work because I drive a lot and it does wonders to the body......plus someone else uses my Unit on the weekend and this can be an awesome safe guard from germs left behind....HAHAHA
B00D8DR0AO|5|Best money spent. This will be my go to clay lube from now on. Half ounce to an ounce added into a 32 ounce spray bottle of water creates the perfect lubricity for claying. Very happy with this product!
B002IWYFVS|5|Looks BAD @$$ !!!
B000CITK8S|5|use all the time to charge scooter battery
B0049MAYU6|5|K@N never goes wrong !!! Its like a family tradition i guess !!! Biught it for my mazdaspeed/gmc2500/ and this time i bought it for my fj cruiser 2012 .... Fit perfect !! Its not rocket science !!! And about Hp !!! U feel it haha !! Around 4000 rpm !!!
B000FGCZEI|5|Thank You!
B011KHEHWS|5|It's a great size. One of the better drying towels I have used to dry off my car it really does absorbs quite a bit of water. When it's gets to wet it does tend to just spread water around but over all I would recommend it. I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion.
B000BRMYN8|5|Does what it's supposed to do. Has held up after several months of use.
B00DBERL4U|1|These lights are very weak. Not bright at all.
B005BNP7YU|5|My Ram have a better look
B00E63TI32|5|This is amazing. I never use it for hot liquids, but it keeps my drinks cool for longer than you could possibly imagine. It's a little unwieldy (and I have pretty big hands) if you're drinking out of it, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. This is one of my favorite purchases all year.
B000VSPJIO|5|Excelent
B00ZJJ9CLU|5|Great product everything fits well. The hardware was grade 8.8 very high quality. Came well packaged and the finish is flawless.
B000CF8VUE|5|Perfect fit for chevrolet 2002 1500HD.  Great look too.
B008E7ROEG|5|Fast shipping and great price. It's an OEM part so it fit and works well
B002GTKAHQ|5|Excellmt!
B00K069YCO|1|Totally worthless just a shell. Maybe I should have read more closely.
B00ERXG4TM|5|This is a great product. You don't realize how much you need it until you use it. Sturdy metal. Before I bought this I thought &#34;what if it falls off, will it hold onto the bike well enough?&#34; Well... It holds on very well and you can get it much tighter than you need it to be. I've been riding with it for awhile now without the slightest problem.
B002PGRJN8|5|My 03 Ford Escape was giving me trouble, when the engine was under high load the engine will start losing power. A code for a miss fire was detected, decided to replace all six ignition coils, my local auto part stores sell them for over $50 a pice. When I saw the price that Amazon was selling all six coil packs The first thing I thought was that the quality would it be as good, but after reading the feedback left by other buyers I figure I will give it a try. I can honestly can say that comparing them to the ones I took off my car I didn't see any difference and now with the new ones in,  the car runs great and my issue with the misfire is gone. I replace the upper, lower gaskets, PCV valve, valve cover gaskets and all spark plugs.  Ultimately Fast shipping and great price. It's the same as the OEM part so it fit and works very  well.
B00ECW2T38|5|This thing is handy as hell, everyone thinks it looks great... and it really helps keep people from crawling up your behind in traffic... nobody wants a poke in the radiator from this bad boy.
B0116E8Q5Y|2|Got a H4 Bi Xenon kit, very disappointing, The bulb has the shroud missing that blocks light from entering the HIGH Beam zone of the headlight through the opening in the main shield. Therefore lots of stray light exits acting like you got High Beam on when in fact it's Low Beam. The picture they show of the bulb has the shroud on it so don't know what happen, maybe they changed bulbs, but does not match what is being sold.The slim Ballast is great, takes about 15 sec to fully light up. I am not into blinding oncoming traffic, too many drivers flashed me. I have another brand with shroud on bulb that has no issues. They are going back, too bad. Get your bulb fixed right and it would be a great kit. This is the second kit like it.
B00OAFU9B6|5|Super! It went on great.  Dashboard & spa cover was clean with no residue.
B005LH5S4U|5|Great quality, perfect fit.
B00FNP3YBE|3|this is good, removes golden/blueish stains but it comes back the moment you fire your engine.
B000EQ9Z1U|5|Its excellent for my C230 2007, perfet fit
B00E1L72RS|2|This product was not useful for my 2008 Honda Element:<br />1. the fasteners are suction cups---they are not very strong and easily fall off (I lost mine the first day I used them)<br />2. the actual shades are small…they only covered about 70% of my window.<br /><br />I would not buy this product again and I would not recommend it.
B0083P3X30|1|Absolutely horrible quality.  I had to replace both adjustors in order to adjust my lights.
B000S2SSQ8|5|Great same as oem!!!
B002UC6N0W|5|Even though I clean with bleach, my 1976 Prowler had a very discolored toilet seat.  A friend suggested Amazon Prime and within three days, my seat was replaced with new.!  Couldn't be happier. !!
B00D8ZAAM2|1|Installed them on my dodge and one of the struts went in only 3 months. Do not buy this item.
B00RV83UUG|5|Mounting brackets aren't the greatest, but for the money, top notch! You'll see animals (deer in my part of the country) that are 25+ yards off to the side of the road before you even get there. I tied these to my brights and run great on my Ranger. As long as they are below the center of your headlights and can be powered off with incoming traffic they are legal in Wisconsin.
B00JIGZXMC|5|nice
B0013FT2FU|5|Perfect fit
B00BD4YJOA|5|good
B00VGL6TWA|5|Really good hitch for your car.  Fit well and everything....but our Honda CR-V ended up being too low to tow our small trailer with it, we ended up having to get one that goes up higher, but other than that, it is high quality and durable!
B0117EETEK|5|Worked perfectly on my Honda Civic 2008 LX do to an oil change. Not sure why some people are complaining that these get crushed or slide. I put them right next to my wheels and slightly hit the gas till i felt my car on the flat surfaces of the ramps and stopped. Would differently recommend these!
B000F5EDLW|5|They are great
B00CMR79H6|5|I have a 2015 Sahara and this is perfect
B005JPJGOW|5|Looks quailty
B00CEXKBS2|5|The window visors look great on my truck! very clean and sleek looking. The installation takes a little time and attention to detail because they fit on the inside of your window channel. If you don't get them on just right then the window doesn't roll up correctly.
B0073XMXMK|5|Great reception. I looks great.
B005RH1HIA|5|Just received my red LED lights today, so far everything is fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that it only took 2 days to arrive at my house as well as the installation process was more than easy and it took less than 5 minutes.<br />Due to it being a red colored light it doesn't shine intensely brightly but definitely enough to be able to see around your vehicle. I would suggest this item ro anyone that wants to customize their vehicle yet still stay within your budget.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars
B00CGTVCIC|5|Fit a second generation Dodge Ram perfectly. Nice look, makes the wheel a bit thicker which is exactly what I wanted. No smell at all, although that wasn't a selling point for me. Matches the interior well, has an OEM &#34;look and feel&#34;, would recommend to anyone. I don't believe it's actually leather, but it works well.
B00KS6ACSQ|5|Works like a charm.
B000CC9BSS|5|Very quiet inside the cabin with a nice bark outside. Seems to have just the right back pressure. Very comfortable ride inside for long trips. Installed on a 2003 Suburban.
B000BQYH6Q|4|Does the job - can't beat the price
B005C98WCM|3|Arrived with a dent in one panel. Figured it wasn't worth sending them back. Otherwise fit and looked good.
B006CN9FNM|5|It's all OEM and shipped quickly.  NOTE: If you are using the top fill method, you will only need 5 liters, not 6.  Mine took 4.6 and .15 for the filter.
B003VASEAO|1|i order a END BLOCKER AND GOT SIDE BLOCKER . SENT IT BACK FOR REFUND .
B000BZERJ4|4|seams to work fine, best price
B001L9VTMW|3|Cool. How much can you REALLY do with a phrase, &#34;Resistance is Futile.&#34; Applied well to my laptop cover, actually.
B00GOS6FBA|5|great helmet, does fog but other than that the design is amazing and stylish.
B00SM0PDPM|1|Total length with mounting brackets 44.5&#34; not 40.
B00JLJQYMY|5|Awesome!!!
B00CQ43QJU|5|Perfect fit for my 2015 RAV4 Limited.  It is shipped in a rolled up form, so it does need to settle after you unravel.  One hint:  Be sure to press the inside lip of the tray up against the back seat to get the perfect fit.  I liked this cargo liner so much that i ordered the interior floor mats.
B000C39C9A|4|Fairly easy to fit and does the job.
B001RMT90W|3|Good quality but needed to tweak a bit to make everything fit. Left side marker light now has moisture build up.  Trying to find where the gap is that allows the moisture in.
B005SJBHR8|5|Exactly what I expected!! Very good quality and material.
B008Y9KDJM|4|good but didn't come with any screws, so you better have the old ones (not like me) or have to take a trip to Home-depot!
B0042KJV9U|3|This works and is cheap enough but it would have been much more useful if the wire was longer and I had to turn down the diameter of the metal part to get the engine's plug socket to fit.
B00Y16V0NU|4|cheap an easy and I used them for my toddlers tri-cycle !!!!
B003YJGYPO|2|Tifjd b yd
B000CPJLGM|4|Used on a &#34;5 stud welded elbow on semi truck that's cost me $125 each of the two times I've replaced. Painted per instructions thick coat, but did not cure in oven or on truck. It's still holding 2 months later which is better luck than I've ever had before. Exhaust temperatures on pyrometer have reached 1100 f at exhaust manifold, so at least 800 downstream the turbo.
B000LQ78YY|4|Good
B000C9ODAC|5|Work prefect
B00TDA73RQ|5|😉
B000FW61EW|2|made in france...
B0064D470G|5|It is awesome
B00I6JO878|2|Ok the new Street Flex coilovers have really disappointed me so far.  I replaced my Tein Comfort Sport coilovers after about 7 years because one of them went bad and it would have cost me more to have them repaired than new ones.  So I decided to try the replacements for the old Tein Type Flex.  So far very disappointed in them, I should have listened to the previous reviewer he was right!  They are too springy and not enough damping power.  They feel unstable at speed (50mph and up).  The seller has been unsupportive as well.  I asked to exchange them or advice on adjustments no answer to date.  Had them on for about a month now and tried hardest setting and three clicks softer and still no real improvement.  Softer makes it worst because it allows the car to bottom out over bumps.  I will replace them now...with something else..factory oem felt better and much safer than these!
