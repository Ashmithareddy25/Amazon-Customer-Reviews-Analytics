B003XDZLXW|2|My podiatrist recommended I wear Crocs, so I am willing to give up style for comfort and foot-health - hence my purchase of Crocs. These offer a slight 'cuteness' factor compared to the classic style.  At roughly $20 and free prime shipping, these are a better deal than buying from Crocs.<br /><br />According to the Crocs website, the &#34;Shayna Mary Jane&#34; shoe is a regular fit and should allow a little room while feeling secure on your foot. If you wear half sizes they suggest you order the next smaller size. I would suggest the opposite for this style. I've heard Crocs are sized slightly different depending on where they are made. Mine were made in Mexico, and run small in length by almost 1/4&#34;. I normally wear a U.S. Women's size 9, but I have slightly wide feet, so I ordered a size 10. The size 10 length and width in this style are perfect for my size 9 foot - snug fitting. However the ridge on the insole designed to fit the space between the ball of your foot and your toes sits fully at the ball of my foot and will ultimately cause pressure ulcers. This ridge placement makes the shoe painful to wear, especially for walking or for any length of time. An even larger size might work to alleviate this defect, but I don't care to play the order, return & repeat game so it's back to the original/classic Croc for me.

B00555X8OA|5|Fantastic read; entertaining and eye opening. I plan on reading it again. I do think that he tries to apply some ideas a little broadly--most of these experiments were done on undergraduates, which I don't think you can argue are a perfect representation of the entire human race. However, most people probably do exhibit most of these cognitive errors, and therefore learning about them is extraordinarily helpful for navigating your personal decisions or understanding/influencing the decisions of others.

B0018RFLQ2|5|The film is the story of a father struggling to balance his obligation to help develop his son's genius while not replacing the son's desires with his own.  The little boy struggles to find his path to joy regardless of his love for his father pushing him against his own instincts.
1451666179|5|I think Allie Brosh is actually one of the best writers of this generation. She's able to pick apart her experiences in a way that makes them completely relatable. Like, childhood binging on cake? Yup. The various levels of emotion experienced with depression? Yup.<br /><br />I would buy this book for everyone.<br /><br />Also, it's like, printed super nice? All bright and crap? And the pictures are good?<br /><br />Whatever. Just buy it, loser. As if you really need me telling you.

B0089EHWQE|5|Wow what a love story.  I cried more than once during this book.  Thinking about these characters long after finishing this book.
B004WOJ6XC|3|Well, I´m a huge Rhapsody of Fire fan and I really loved The Frozen Tears Of Angels album, and I had big hopes for this one since Rhapsody cant make anything bad. But it was a bit disappointed when I got it on its release day.<br /><br />While it reminds a bit of The Frozen Tears Of Angels its a different Rhapsody album. I think they tried to experiment on this one, but the result isn't what I had hoped for. And most of the songs seems to lack the love for this kind of music that Turilli and Staropoli always had. You can really see that Luca was trying to get this out as soon as possible so he could quit. I think he have gone tired of doing this after all these years and I think this album shows that as well.<br /><br />But here are some good songs too. The opening track From Chaos To Eternity is really great and seems to pick up where The Frozen Tears Of Angels stopped. Tempesta Di Fuoco is also a good one, their first one with Italian lyrics. Ghosts of Forgotten Worlds.. well, I can only say it sucks. I dont like this one at all, its boring and is a perfect example on that Luca is tired of doing this and rushed the album. Anima Perduta have some epicness to it, but still not as good as it could be. When I first heard Aeons of Raging Darkness it was a bit of a disappointment but later I started to like it more and more and now I think its one of the best songs on the album. I Belong To the Stars is also a good one, a bit different but still catching and interesting.<br />Tornado is a good song, its what you expect of a Rhapsody song, so nothing much to say about that one rather than its a good one.<br /><br />And then we come to the big finalé, Heroes of the Waterfalls' Kingdom. At first I didnt like it, and the guitars where out of place on many places where I think there would be another guitar or maybe some more symphonic stuff, but after a while when you have listen to it a bit more, and listen to the lyrics it starts getting pretty damn good, but still a bitdisappointing ending to this great saga.<br /><br />So overall, I gave it 3 stars because there are too many flaws here, but it also have some great songs. Its a disappointment if you expected a great and majestic finish to this great saga that Rhapsody Of Fire have worked on for so many years. I think its a shame that Luca rushed this, and at the same time the band where talking about how important this album was and bla bla bla. For them I think its a great musical achievement and I would be proud if I came up with something like this, but for the past Rhapsody stuff this dosnt work out that well.<br />I have full respect for the guys and their work on this CD, and I know I should take it for what it is and not for what I wanted it to be, but with Rhapsody thats kinda hard to do.

B000089CPF|3|My first introduction to Calexico was seeing them playing live at Somerset House in London in the summer of 2003, and they were absolutely breathtaking.  As with all live bands, the studio album is always something of a anticlimax, as it's almost impossible to recreate the atmosphere and rush of seeing them live.  Still, it's a grower of an album and is a must for any respectable record collection.
0525457585|5|Having loved the movie version for years, and finally discovering that it was based on a book, I decided to purchase and read the source material.  All I can say is, WOW!  As is often the case with movies that come from books, the printed version is infinitely richer, fuller, and more complete.  As much as I love the first film, it only deals with half the book, while the second is a shabby take off of portions of the second half.  So if, like me, you're in love with the story that never ends, do yourself a favor and get this book.
B00992CF6W|4|I love the game but the update i want is not out yet and it was supposed to 1 week ago. So I'm not gonna play the game no more until the update i want comes out.
B003N5VOUO|5|This is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />The portrayal of Khan's Autism is both accurate and endearing.  It is an amazing story that looks into ignorance and intolerance versus forgiveness, selflessness and kindness.  Part of the story portrays how innocent Muslims were affected by 911- fear, anger, prejudice, but also meekness and forgiveness.<br />There are some political views lightly expressed (the producers favored Obama over Bush), but it really doesn't detract from the overarching theme of compassion and seeking to understand, and doing what you know is right regardless of what anyone else thinks or does.  And the power of influence for good that one man can have.<br /><br />Watch it.
B009YN2M7S|5|This was a very good book. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Will definitely read his other works. Awesome!
0385337388|5|I did my residency in the 1990s and I can assure you that it wasn't all that different than that depicted in Shem's book.  The unbelievable workload, chronic lack of sleep, exposure to illness and death, all mixed with the constant pressure to be brilliant, hardworking, and efficient to impress pompous and seemingly callous superiors is a recipe for warping a person into an automaton.  I just counted down the days until it was over.  But the experience leaves you changed, hopefully not scarred, and now as an attending in a large BMS, I am glad that the schedules are more humane for our residents and interns, yet I somehow feel that they are soft and coddled because they can't work more than 80 hours/wk.  Anyway, this experience is depicted well in HOG, and I think it would be hard for someone who hasn't experienced this to appreciate this book.  If a layperson finds it horrifying, then maybe they will experience a little of what it was like for those of us who had to live it.  The dark humor is extremely real, the sexual escapades were enjoyed by some, but not all of us, in the trenches.  \\"Buff\\" and \\"turf\\" are terms I hear on a regular basis.  I didn't care for the ending of the book; Roy's career choice seemed unlikely, but I'm guessing that's what happened to the author.  Overall, the book brings to light some of the horrors of medical training, but sensationalizes it to a degree.  The humor is at times adolescent, but still I had to laugh out loud at some parts.  I'm sure I wouldn't give the book five stars if I hadn't gone through a fairly grueling internship myself though.

B000002KDX|5|I got the vinyl of this one years ago and never thought as time went on that this one would stand the test of time but it did! When \\"Horse With No Name\\" came out I really thought it was another Neil Young follow-up to \\"Heart Of Gold\\". Well, they had a few singles off this album, another being \\"I Need You\\" and had a gold album. The CD is great even today and highly recommend it as well as seeing them \\"Live\\" which I did a few years back. visit my website \\"Judemac Forever\\" google it and say \\"Hi\\". One other side note, the songs pulled off this one for the America Greatest Hits collection in the 1970's were remixed by George Martin of Beatles fame.

B00CTGVKGQ|5|She, Ella Yelich-O'Connor, (Lorde) gets all the attention.  It should be known that those two &#34;boys&#34; who provide the tunes lay down some mighty fine jams. If they were an all man group they might be called a 'Power trio' ala Cream, Grand Funk Railroad, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Rush et al.  I like her voice and lyrics.  She co wrote the record, but that does not detract from her own ability.  She is one who I think sounds good with layering on her own voice parts.  Everyone knows the &#34;Cadillac dreams&#34; song..... The whole record is good!  I would give six stars if it were allowed. Gweedo
B00CNQ7HAU|5|So well written! Couldn't put down. Interesting plot with twists and turns. Didn't know where name came from till the end!

B0000035E7|5|This is one of Nirvana's best works. I found out about Nirvana not to long ago from my Stepdad who burned a cd and put Nirvana's song \\"Smells Like Teen Spirt\\"(from Nevermind), and Ashley started to learn about Nirvana, downloading music, looking at pictures, and even inteviews she was obessed with Nirvana. I then started to like Nirvana.<br /><br />Kurt's voice was a bit raspy, and good at the same time. I was watching a video about how girls loved him for his looks and voices.Thats not the point though. Kurt was stoned most of his time so his lyrics when he was singing was hard to understand but when you read the lyrics their very dark. Nirvana was prob. one of the best Grunge bands ever. This is their best album if you like Nirvana or are just getting into them. This album is a must own.

0446677450|1|I don't understand why this book is rated so high and why it is a best-seller. The author continues to urge \\"financial literacy,\\" but the book doesn't make a person financially literate in the slightest. I would be surprised if anyone over the age of 12 learns anything from this book--all the key points are obvious if you have ever managed any of your money in your life.

1401322786|5|The Time Keeper by Mitch Albom is a novel about mankind's greatest obsession: time. Some people want more, some people want less. Sometimes it moves too fast, sometimes it moves too slow.<br /><br />The Time Keeper is a story that really gets you to think about time in a different and more precious way. It makes you really think about things in a more insightful way, which is a true talent of the author.<br /><br />This novel follows the lives of three people and their obsession with time. It all started with Dor, the original man who discovered time and how to keep track of it. This \\"Father Time\\" did it just \\"to know.\\" However, as mankind tends to do, it was taken and used as something else, and man eventually tried to control time.<br /><br />Dor is punished and sentenced to thousands of years in a cave. He doesn't age, but everyone else on Earth does. He is able to listen to everyone's prayers about time, but eventually it becomes too much and he rarely hears any single person's prayers or thoughts about it at all.<br /><br />Two of the people he did hear are Victor and Sarah. Victor is dying, and wants more time. Sarah wants less time. She wants to speed things up, and eventually make it stop for her altogether. Dor is finally freed from the cave, if he can help two people the true meaning and value of time. Can he get to them both before it is too late? I'll let you read this amazing book to find out.<br /><br />Mitch Albom has a way of writing that draws you in, teaches your soul a life lesson, and leaves you wanting to read more of his works. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of The Time Keeper, Hyperion, for providing me with a copy of this book for review. All opinions expressed are my own.

B000002U9E|5|I first bought &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; as a twelve year old. This album changed the way I listened to music forever. All these years later, this album still remains my favourite. There are so many layers to this album. From beautiful harmonies, weird backing vocals and strong imagery conveyed perfectly with Kate's unique voice and original songwriting.The first five songs deal about love and understanding. The songs are written in an unorthodox way, but are able to penetrate deeply - making you feel the joys and fears of love. From &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; to &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; to the title track. &quot;The Big Sky&quot; is one of my all time favourites - Kate's many voices are extraordinary. The line &quot;you never understood me -you never really tried&quot; almost reflects the relationship between Kate and the media. &quot;Mother Stands For Comfort&quot; is eerie, where Kate sings &quot;mother hides the murderer&quot;. The next seven songs is probably the most ambitious thing Kate has ever done - her concept piece &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot; deals with the thoughts of a woman drowning. Her past, present and future flash before her eyes, as she tries to come to terms with her mortality. Musically and lyrically it is extraordinary. This album is testament to Kate's continual influence in pop music. Because she is not a prolific artist, some people tend to forget of her importance in pop music.

B00005S6K8|4|The DVD was in good condition, but it was slightly scuffed at one point which caused a slight lapse in viewing.
B005ZUR724|4|Could be better but.... It is pretty great. For a Kindle Fire app it is  very good however does have some drawbacks:<br />1. Price. If you are gonna charge 99 cents a month for a game,  why make it cost 6.99? I will agree that is cheap,  however if you want more people to pay for more months or more purchases of the game,  use one or the other.<br />2. Chat. Sometimes it's good,  other times it is horrendous. Sometimes people are just mean.<br />And 3. Gameloft in general. I have heard bad things about them and their bad customer support. This kind of thing always worries me.ESPECIALLY on an expensive game like this.<br />Other then those things,  it seems like a great game. Enjoy!
B005LAJ16I|5|Homeland is an excellent series about the covert operations that go on right on our own soil. Not only is this series riviting, well written, well acted, but it's extremely accurate. How POW's are seen by the government, what actions are taken in this day in age when they come home, and how the CIA, FBI, and security to our Nation really works is well illustrated in this series. The effect the war on terror has, on our own soil, goes mostly unnoticed on the level this series portrays. Great actors like Mandy Patinkin, Damian Lewis, and Claire Danes compliment this already well written script. Don't miss it, the pilot episode is shown for free on [...]. Check it out, buy the DVD, keep the series in action, help the possibility of more seasons to come.<br /><br />HOMELAND IS A MUST SEE FOR ANY OF THOSE INTERESTED IN THE MILITARY, INNER WORKINGS OF OUR GOVERNMENT SECURITY, INTELLIGENCE, OR ALL OF THE ABOVE!!!
1451627289|5|Never thought I'd say this, never been a big fan of Stephen King, liked him a bit sure, in jest really, but I never put him up there with the likes of Hitchcock, or Rod Serling.  Always been a lover of time travel, Somewhere in Time, It's A Wonderful Life, two of my favorite films, but now after reading Stephen King's novel, 11-22-63, I place him firmly in their company.<br /><br />One thing that's really great about 11/22/63 is how perfectly King utilizes the lexicon and mannerisms of the era that you truly feel you are there, with all the awkwardness of one carrying luggage for a summer trip in a snow filled winter resort! All the information from his own time is no help to him here, so it is as if he knows nothing... or very little... and that comes across beautifully.<br /><br />Okay, I have to add more to my thoughts on 11/22/63 now.  Initially, all I knew was it was about wanting to change an infamous day in history that rocked a nation to its core, changing its worldview forever, the 9/11 of its day, the assassination of JFK, of MLK, of Hitler's rise to power, these fixed points in history are indelibly scarred into our memory, perhaps into our very DNA, into the way we will evolve as a species.<br /><br />But it's more than that.  We have to understand the impetus that important emotional factor that makes one not just want to change an infamous event, but do so at all costs, what sparks the heart so deeply that it would risk everything for it?  It must be deeply personal, it cannot just be an act we all remember, it must be we one we all FEEL in our bones... and thus, King creates that impetus, and that context, with the family, their fragility, their simple humanity...<br /><br />And in this way we want to help them avoid their dark ending... we want to save those Titanic passengers not because it was a tragedy of strangers, but in real people we feel in our hearts, in a visceral way, the loss is our own, and this is what gives our hero the necessary and vital inspiration to commit to creating change at any cost, and why we then can relate to the story being told.<br /><br />Surprisingly, my heart goes out to Sadie, in the book 11-22-63, the novel by Stephen King concerning time travel, JFK and the already well-explored cautionary butterfly effect , but none at such depth as this. The main character is kind of a fool, sometimes I want to yell at him for his lack of empathy, and the unnecessary suffering it creates, but mostly, the contrast and disparity creates a very tense space within which one contemplates the dark issues raised by the story, wandering a dark and narrow path, like skirting a craggy precipice, and always looking down.<br /><br />I think 11-22-63 is worth reading.<br /><br />Having gotten through the thick of the love story and the stalking of the Oswalds I have to say it wasn't as thick, long or tedious as the negative reviews made it out to be, at least to me. In fact, while some of it was a bit drowning in details, we had to feel what 5 years means, that he had come under the spell of the times, that he didn't want to leave, he'd created a life there, full of nuance and detail, he'd created attachments... meaningful relationship... but out of all the people in the book, I cared more for Sadie than anyone else.<br /><br />It is VERY compelling, and I never stopped hoping for Sadie, and pondering on the times... I felt... like I was there.<br /><br />Spoiler:  I don't agree with Stephen King's conclusion about JFK's assassination, that Oswald did it alone purely on the grounds of paranoia, it's possible sure, but all evidence of what JFK was doing, passing bills to reduce the power of the Fed, his issues with Cuba, all of these issues are not raised by the book one wit, and that surprised me... but King also pounds in another idea quite often in the book, an acronym, KISS... keep it simple stupid... and he does this with his plot, and his character's modus operandi.  For good and bad.  It's a workof fiction, and it works here, no reason not to write it this way, why not?  It's a speculative work of fiction, I accept that, and I enjoyed it on its terms.<br /><br />I've read a few reviews stating that it's ridiculous, now spoiler here coming, that two women Jake knows in the book wind up with large scars on their faces at different points in the story... but actually if you're following along it's not ridiculous at all... we know that the past is obdurate, it's repeated many times to get this point across, so if damage is averted in one place, it's found manifested in another... this is how in one timeline one woman has the scar, and in another, it's Sadie... the past harmonizes, it finds a way to manifest, you can't really change anything, not really... and in this way, the book is quite beautiful and intelligent and profoundly intuitive.  The past harmonizes, it's obdurate, what manifests in time, must manifest in time, one way or another.<br /><br />In this way the past is a bit like an earthquake.  Tectonic plates building up tension, awaiting an earthquake, and the longer it waits the worse it gets, meaning, if you stop something from happening in the past, the tension for its inevitable outcome grows until it manifests much much more powerfully.<br /><br />I've been reading and watching King since I was little in the '70s as well. Before him I would sit in the library with huge tomes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and I always loved King's works, but more for fun, never with the depth of Hitchcock until 11-22-63, in all honesty. 11-22-63 imho, is the single greatest work by King I've ever read.

B00KT2Z9WS|5|This is an awesome and amazing game so far and it is worth the amount of space it will take up there are amazing 3D graficks I can't spell that word also the money program is pretty good as compared to some other games. *cough clash of clans cough* and it is addicting so grab your moten and feast like kings cuz your in the middle ages have fun.

1592400876|4|When I bought Eats, Shoots & Leaves, I was expecting something along the lines of Strunk and White's EOS. However, this book is NOTHING of a real guide. It provides the reader with witty  commentary and general rules for all sorts of punctuation, and for that I appreciate it greatly; however, like said, not a real guide. <br /> <br />The book doesn't really delve deep in punctuation itself, and isn't what you're looking for if you want some hard-core punctuation help. This is a book you would read for some general self-help- not distribute to a class of students for them to take seriously. <br /> <br />If you want a fun read, some giggles, and a few laughs, this is a great book. There's also a lot of punctuation history included in the text, as well as allusions to other punctuation books (probably more hard-core, but I wouldn't know). However, if you really want to help your punctuation, Strunk and White are the people to read, not Trauss. <br /> <br />Still, you have to give the woman props. I hadn't smiled so much for punctuation since I learned how to draw a really cool question mark.
B0002IQMKM|5|great album
B0091ICDHU|5|I don't usually write many reviews, there are far too many books to read to spend time reviewing them all. But I just can't help writing this.<br />Firstly, I have to admit that I judged this book, not only by its cover, but also by its title and decided it wasn't for me. Boy was I wrong.<br />I'm not going to go into details and, even though a sparse synopsis was one of the reasons it took me too long to pick this book up, I look back now and know that this story is better when you go in with no expectations; just start fresh. If you love contemporary, young adult romance and brilliantly written, addictive stories then is this the next book for you.<br />It deserves far more than 5 stars.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|I missed you, Mr. Grey. I didn't know how much till last week.<br /><br />Reading this book was a very funny journey for me. This is Christian POV of the Fifty Shades of Grey, and a couple of chapters from the next book. It's nothing new, I already know what happens, how it happens and why and yet I was sooo focused on reading this, I was drawn to this book like if I was reading the story for the first time.<br /><br />I waited for this little precious to show up on my kindle and then I read until 3:30am...yes, on a weekday. My eyes hurt like hell that day but I wanted to know Christian's thoughts.<br /><br />Another fun fact is that day that I had just 3 hours of sleep I had some work to do that made me concentrate more than normal. And I found myself biting my lower lip. Grey kept coming to my mind and I ended up laughing at my own joke. More than once that day.<br /><br />I've mentioned before that I read both in Spanish and English (this been my second language) and that I prefer to read books in their original language. So much is lost in translation. I read the trilogy in Spanish, as it was gifted to me that way. And with Grey I proved once more that so much is lost in translation. Little things like Charlie Tango being a &#34;she&#34; in English. I've spent the last two years thinking Charlie Tango is a &#34;he&#34;. If little thing like this bug me, imagine how bigger things makes me feel. I'll do a re-read of the trilogy some day and I'll do it in English.<br /><br />I knew from the trilogy that Christian was a very complex character and I was amazed to find out that he's more complex than what I thought.<br />Sometimes I felt like if Christian was some sort of bipolar person or had multiple personalities. The controlled man I came to love is actually controlled in the outside but a mess in the inside (I already knew it, it's just clearer in this book). Wanting something, needing other thing but feeling like he doesn't deserve it, like he's not good enough,thinking so negatively of himself...yeah, the fifty shades make perfect sense.<br /><br />And the sex scenes, well they're as great as Ana told them enhanced a hundred times.<br /><br />I loved it. Every word. Every page.<br /><br />PS: Please tell me there will be Grey 2 and possible Grey 3. Please! There are so many scenes I'd like to read from Christian's POV. Like with the pregnancy, the catfight (Elena/Grace), Charlie Tango coming down. I need to know!<br />Pretty please! (Yes, I know, I'm greedy. So what?)
B000003TA4|5|I can't begin to describe how Nirvana and Kurdt make me feel inside. When I hear his voice, it makes me and all of my heartbreaking teenage issues melt away into oblivian. I worship him. I know, it's a little weird, with me being male and all, but I just think he's a dreamboat. His grungy persona is so all-consuming that his voice on all of these Nevermind pop songs has saved me from ending it all more times than I could count. That's right, as selfish as Kurdt was, with his embracing his money and alienating his fans, has kept me alive and breathing. Strangely, his ending his life has kept me alive, because it proves he made the ultimate, most soul-searching sacrifice any human being could choose to make for me. Soul-drenched fancypop scream-alongs like Lithium and Endless Nameless really let you get to know to real Kurdt and how his addiction made him a savior to us everywhere. He was so cool. When I feel I am at my darkest hour, about to pull the trig, the voice in my brain remembers how Kurdt did it for me so I don't have to. I just remember the soothing meloncholia of Drain You, and my soul floats on the same clouds Kurdt's did when he was having hangovers. I am now a true poet. Thank You, Kurdt D. Kobane. <br />1964-1995<BR>R.I.P. (+_+)
B000SEIK2S|4|This is a very comfortable read an entertaining. Characters are reasonably well developed for this type of menu I'd recommend it
1942250002|5|The guy is genius! Would recommend not only English students  :)
0345803485|2|I must say, in spite of the reviews warning of a thin plot and even thinner vocabulary, I couldn't resist a good, old fashioned \\"bodice-ripper\\" for light summer reading. However, this book is so poorly written it just irritated me to no end. Really, I've read Letters to Penthouse with better grammar and more creative wording than \\"Fifty Shades\\". Come to find out, it was originally self-published in ebook format. No wonder. I am sure the writer would have been laughed out of every major publishing house.<br />The writing aside, even the sex scenes were dull. Kinky, yes, but altogether not exciting. The big dealbreaker for me was that the male lead character began stalking the female lead, and it was written in such a way that it was intended to seem romantic. It as not. It was flat out creepy. All in all, I would not recommend this book to anyone, ever.
B00G5G7EXY|5|I got this for my three year old and she loves it!  She wants to watch it every morning when she wakes up.  She's learning the songs and wants to wear gloves like Elsa.  I actually enjoyed watching it with her as well.
B000KFB4PK|5|These are just so creative! My son loves to build with Legos and this Lego watch idea is genious! Good quality (he's six and wears it to school every day and has had no issues). Plus I love that it's totally able to be sized according to the child.
B000K8EQ5W|5|this is a really good movie with a new type of story line that I don't think has been done before.
B004V9MU86|5|Excellent
0385504209|5|A friend refered this book to me and I'm so glad that I decided to read it! It's very captivating and will keep you reading for hours at a time. The story has a great plot and a suspense fills these pages from beginning to end. Myself being a history lover, I have no doubt that the abundance of historical references kept me on my toes throughout this book. Even though I'm a Roman Catholic I found this book a very good read despite the fact that a chunck of it went against my religion. I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to accept other religious points of view.
B00CJKW4WQ|5|Great product, even came a day early than stated.
B00HDMMISA|5|Can't stop once I began reading.
B002MQYOFW|5|First off I hate reading and the only book series I liked was &#34;Viking Quest&#34;.I watched the movie and loved it so I wanted to try the book.started on the first page and I couldn't stop reading it! The adventure and the action was awsome. I think the little bit of romance it had in it made it perfect.I recommend this book to 12-year-olds and up and think even parents will love this amazing book!
B00KZ73VDG|5|Rachmaninoff's superb music is wonderfully served by this package.<br />The performances are top rate, the booklet informative, and the price is excellent.<br />Bravo,to both Vladimir Ashkenazy and Decca,<br />for assembling such an excellent release.
B009UX2YAC|5|Fun game keep me laughing
1416972250|5|*Minor Spoilers*<br />The third installment of the Mortal Instruments, the City of Glass, was a continuation of Clary's idiocy. Don't get me wrong, I liked this book, but.. eh.. there're better ones out there.<br /><br />After reading the first two books of this series, I started to get frustrated with Cassandra Clare. First off, how many times does she want to kill Simon? Or should I say, torture him. By the end of the City of Glass, Simon ALMOST died four times (actually dying one time to become a vampire). I didn't even bother to believe it anymore when Raphael wanted to \\"kill\\" Simon. And then, there were the unnecessary deaths. Out of all the characters, I do not understand why Cassandra chose the most random and innocent characters. Max Lightwood. The cute little boy who enjoyed reading and loved his family. He was killed just because of an insane lunatic. The insane lunatic (aka Sebastian Verlac aka Jonathan) also killed Hodge. Hodge, who got the worse punishment of all for leaving the circle.<br /><br />The second thing is.. Clary is an idiot. I feel like she never knows what she is doing. For instance: when she found out that Jace and the others had left to the City of Glass, she whined like a little girl about how they left her behind and then she made a portal of her own. WHAT. On the other hand, she doesn't even know herself who she loves. She goes on and off the Jace, who is supposedly her BROTHER (untll the end) but then she willingly lets Sebastian (who is her real BROTHER) kiss her.<br /><br />Then there is the ending. I find it hard to believe that Valentine is dead. If he was dead, I'm pretty sure there wouldn't be a fourth and fifth book. Speaking of the fourth and fifth book.. at this moment I do not feel like they are necessary. Valentine, the enemy, is dead. Simon and Maia, Jocelyn and Luke, Clary and Jace, and Magnus and Alec all got each other which is all they ever wanted. The downworlders and shadowhunters no longer hate each other. See whatI mean?
B008Y7N7JW|5|This move kept the entire family on the edge of our seats the entire movie.  Can't wait to watch the next one.
B00IRMTTPU|5|the acting made the story already told many times worth watching. best supporting actress was the correct choice. all good
B002VWONB2|5|The visual quality of the Blu-ray edition is absolutely terrific, almost unbelievably good. I doubt anyone has seen Casablanca this well since its original cinematic release in the 1940s.
0307891372|5|I haven't read the entire book, but for about $17 it was a great deal.  Very detailed, and very big.  It's almost like an almanac for Skyrim.  A definite must for those who play Skyrim and want some help.  Plus, Amazon was kind enough to re-send me another one, when the 1st one(I believe it may have gotten stolen) was resent to me.  Thanks Amazon!  I will reiterate a better review when I've read more of it.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love Candy Crush it is so addictive.  I have been wanting Candy Crush for my Kindle Fire the graphics are great.  Thank you so much
B00280LYIC|5|Omg the gods  I mean  awesome!!!!!!<br />The book is  so good. Percy and Grover are awesome to.<br />Best book ever

B0094BB4TW|5|I really like a good way to keep in touch with family who live away!!
B001ANSS5K|4|Quick, easy read. Really great book. I'm really liking John green, this is his second book I read now. :-)
B002QE3CTY|4|I'm halfway done and the writing is impressive, :)
B008QYT7DI|1|Why isn't it available in Kindle for Mac so that it can be read without the need for Internet access?
B00IRISI42|4|Good development of relationship with his brother and father. It filled in some of the blanks in the earlier two books.
B00AEBB9T6|5|Great movie Amazon is the best about Great buys and getting it to you  they need to get season 4-5-6 of little people big world please please please
B000HZGBLA|3|Not great but entertaining
B002EWANQS|4|works great, but stays very hot (seems hotter than the stove top version) if you want to make more for others right away.
B004AUHWLQ|5|This movie is great and now I have a crush on Shirley McClaine! She was superb! The things that Jack Lemmon could do with his face. So expressive! Funny movie with that has a sad statement on how people treat other people.
B000G8NY4U|5|wonderful really love it
B007BFSYMS|5|I love white noise. I have it for both my kindle and my android phone. Not only is it great at night, but I've used it at the gym, the library, and even at home to help me concentrate. If you're distracted by noises, this is a must have!
B000XUBFE2|5|This has officially become one of my most favorite books. I fell in love with the Characters, I cried for them and loved them. I have read many hundreds, maybe thousands of books and out of all of them I will forever search for a book that made me feel all of the emotions that this one did.
B000QRIGJY|3|This was Michael Connelly's usual good writing, but it is not my favorite of his books.  It did not seem as suspenseful and the end seemed a little predictable.
B00U7VDC7A|5|Fun game but need patience because there is a time on all actions. Nice graphics a little bog time here and there but what else is expected with nice quality graphics. Story line seems interesting so far, with hopes that it gets even better. Don't take my word for it reach your own opinion by playing. Definitely worth giving it a try...it's FREE what else can you ask for!
B00IIU9U00|3|I truly hated it and couldn't wait to see this scumbag go to prison. Greed is ugly so I guess it was successful at portraying that and Decaprio succeeded in making me feel sick to my stomach for nearly three much too long hours. That being said, it had some hilarious moments. Its a wonder to me that people really respond to that carny type sales pitch. I'd have hung up the phone within the first minute.
B007944TE8|5|Gabriel Byrne is amazing!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|I like it more than minecraft and I play pc. It has more bosses and its just way better than minecraft.
B00A0SKFLG|5|I don't remember the original one, but this movie was better then expected. I wasn't going to get it because it was only given 3 stars, but this movie was definitely one of the best action movies I have seen in a while. A+++
B003K07DUC|5|The book features our Shock and Awe mission in Iraq and the struggles of trying to find WMD's. Awesome insight into the politics of finding find the weapons and the number of agencies involved in the search and how they were fighting each other for power. Believe me this move cointinues to build in suspense and was in my opinion an awesome movie.
B000QRIGLC|5|Fabulous book.  Very insightful. Brought tears to my eyes a few times.  Makes me proud to be an American.  When reading this book I had thoughts of how my dad probably felt during World War 2. When he was driving his tank into enemy fire to save 7 of his comrades. Makes me very proud.
B000LC55F2|5|I saw the first half of this at school twice, and that was enough to get me to buy it.  The end....well, that's an entirely different story!  What a way to wrap up such a fantastic film!  The Prestige does what a lot of two-hour films try to do: it keeps you entertained!  This one will be in my collection for a long time......I love it.<br /><br />Easily one of my top three for '06.
B00L9B7IKE|4|It is a very intriguing way or writing a book.  Rachel, the lead character has a very sad life driven by alcohol and despair.  I must say that I got thrown off by the character switches and the going back and fort in time.  But it was very hard to put down, I had to go on reading because I wanted to know what happened, why it happened.  The two couples that lived on that street, in those aligned houses that Rachel saw everyday seemed picture perfect.  Nothing bad could ever happen, they had it good.  Things aren't always as they appear...A very good read.
B00881VLCE|4|hard to see and move around. Nice for what it is, I like brains breaker on computer so hard to beat that program for me.
B00JFBCDD2|5|Love REM.  However, when will this site wake up and realize that a crazy right wing nut is mocking almost every artist he/she reviews and throws in anti Obama garbage with almost all of them and has for years; wake up folks, this is not Fox News here
0307887898|5|Thanks to Eric Ries and The Lean Startup, I gained the applicable knowledge to prove the viability of our new product in an economically handleable way.
B00BATG18K|5|This book will forever change the way I value relationships and the power of forgiveness. A truly strong and moving novel. A must read for anyone who has ever questioned love, forgiveness, and the deep rooted relationship between mother and daughter.
0062502182|3|The Alchemist is a wonderful fable (if I may call it that) on following your dreams without fear or hesitance. When you come to think of it, life really is that simple if you just believe and persevere. Coehlo's imagery is vivid and magical.
B005SZADQS|5|This show is a frightening, wonderful, horrifying, heart-warming, nail-biting emotional roller-coaster ride that grips you by the teeth until the last episode.<br /><br />Summaries have been stated in earlier reviews; the premise is simple. Man cheats on wife, man wants to make it up to wife, man, wife, and child move to L.A. And the place they start a new life is a property dubbed &#34;Murder House.&#34;<br /><br />Don't expect &#34;Murder House&#34; to model Paranormal Activities, A Haunting in Connecticut, or any typical ghostly horror: it follows nothing of that kind. It is a show that acts against any expectation you have of it.<br /><br />The most gripping aspect of American Horror Story, however, isn't the bizarre, terrifying horror; what shines are the characters. The actors in the show all bring a level of humanity to their roles that create a reality within this impossible world. Through this, AHS becomes far beyond typical horror--the human themes woven throughout make this a story that everyone (to various degrees) can relate to. With their diverse range of characters they tackle difficult topics such as woman in society, adolescence, homosexuality, mental illness, affairs, and depression. However, most notably, there are no black and white characters. No character was purely evil--each had a complexity to them, a psyche which could be pulled apart and understood. Most notably, throughout the progression of the show I learned to hate characters I once loved and love characters I once hated; it is that sort of show.<br /><br />The writing is fantastic; I never anticipated the twists in the plot. It was a story so addictive that although I was terrified to watch it at night, I could not manage to stop.<br /><br />So please, do yourself a favor and watch American Horror Story. You will not be disappointed.
B009NQZVKG|5|This was my first reading of a Rollins adventure, but it won't be my last. Fast paced, well written and interesting with over-the-top heroics to boot. Who could ask for more?
1476715904|5|This was one of the first books that I read that wasn't erotica or biker or dark romance and I loved it! It got me on a Colleen Hoover kick and made me appreciate how well this woman could write a story that was beautiful and sexy without being sexually graphic or too violent.<br />I'm also not a big fan of YA books considering my age and taste in books but this one made it worth reading.<br />Beautiful and gripping coming of age story for romance readers of all ages!<br /><br />***** 5 ***** &#34;poetry is music for the soul&#34; stars
0439023491|4|If you liked the Hunger Games you will love Catching Fire. Just when you thought it was safe... lots of suspense and a few great plot twists. A quick and fun read with a solid message. Enjoy!
B00003CXRP|2|&quot;Castaway&quot; is what I consider a flawed film.  Sure,the moments on the island are wonderful, but it doesn't hide the factthat the plot and motivation of the movie is weak.  Tom Hanks is goodin his role (but has he ever been bad in a movie in the last decade)but the other actors in the film are delegated to underdeveloped minorcharacters.  They serve no more purpose than for them to just bethere.  It surprises me that this film is so hailed as a cinematicexperience.  The script is non-existent, the directing by RobertZemeckis, who has shown his extrodinary talent in other films, ismerely adequate, and an ending which strains credibility.  Perhaps thefilm's main problem is that it glosses over the relationships that TomHanks's character has with the other characters with short,unsatisfactory bookends.  For me, the film left me thinking there wasa greater film somewhere, but instead, I just saw a film that showedthe highlights.
B00881VLCE|3|The app itself is good with several levels of difficulty.  My 3 year old and I both have a great time with this app.  Don't use Amazon coins to buy anything. The app won't recognize anything bought with Amazon coins as a restorable purchase if you ever have to reinstall the app. Don't buy the VIP pack - you won't be able to download anything at all, and you won't get a refund (about $89). Customer service from the developer is practically nonexistent if you have troubles.
B000OZ0NXA|4|Interesting characters, many plot twists, suspenseful at times, and a smattering of action. Plot premise a bit on the weak side but still a good read. Lee Child's writing style in this series keeps you constantly engaged. I would definitely recommend it. I am starting on the second book of the series.
B00KA87GCW|4|Good fun.  Have not gotten very far, yet, but it's fun. The npc dialogue is cute. Four stars. Cute storyline.
B0063IH60K|5|I haven't played this old fashion solitaire in years Brought back my childhood memories.  Great and challenging game. Il's harder than it looks, but a great deal of fun.

B001TODCII|5|pleasant surprise, edge-of-your-seat action. 90min seems short(especially with long beginning), but the movie was nicely paced throughout. Definite rent.
B000056K04|3|In light of the greatness of their last studio album, the masterpiece &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; and the great songs they had starting playing on last year's tour, this cd is a great disappointment. However, it deserves 3 stars simply because an average DMB cd is still better than just about anything these days in the mainstream. There are some very good songs like &quot;Everyday&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Fool To Think&quot; &amp; &quot;Space Between&quot;, but then you have the worst song they have done on cd &quot;When The World Ends&quot;. This song isn't bad, it is just boring.<br />This cd sounds like Dave singing with some band I have never heard of playing the music. There are almost no instrumental parts and practically every songs has Dave singing right off the bat, giving the song no chance to even begin. Many are blaming Glen Ballard for this cd, but the band deserves most of the blame. They didn't have to release this cd, but they did, so let's lay the blame where it is warranted. I have a feeling that in 5 years, the band will look back and regret doing these songs.
0765338149|3|Okay, I REALLY didn't get what all the fuss is about! My hairdresser told me this is her all time fav science fiction book. I kept plodding through only to end up disappointed. The &#34;surprise&#34; ending wasn't really that much of a surprise. It did make me wonder, though, if our government could pull of a similar scenario given all the (warranted) distrust swirling around.
B000066I6N|5|Robert Plant continues to climb by building his own stairway upon Monsalvat! The air's very thin and the climb strewn with failed expeditions. Few endevors outside of the very best classical music can bring about such an emotional upheaval. Pure grace glides from the speakers and takes you on a journey to distant realms.<br />I agree the disc centers on death, but it is the celebration of a life well lived, not the regrets of unfulfilled potential. I caught the Austin City Limits repeat several months ago and was so engaged, it never occurred to me to make a copy until after the credits had roled. So be it, a sacred event is only intensified by it's passing. <br />They say that genius fades with time, but there's always exceptions. Here's one of them.

B003UBTX7C|5|A fabulous , exciting beautifully written book of imystery and intrigue!
078513915X|5|I absolutely love this book!  As a dedicated reader of all things Austen, I purchased this book as part of my collection.  Not sure what to expect, I waited...and was thrilled what I saw!  This is beautifully illustrated and the writing...ah, I can't say enough.  Thank you for the offering, I've even purchased on for a friend that also shares my love for Austen and reading.
B005CX53RU|5|Great for those long 14 hour flights where all there is to do is watch one movie after another.  I keep two extra batteries fully charged in the zipper pocket that came in the headphone case.  That way, not only do I have enough power to fly long distances, but also to move through airports etc.  One thing about changing the battery is that changing the battery can be a challenge at times.  The rubberized tab which is a cover for the charging port is convenient to pull the battery out. That is, until the tab becomes pulled off after trying to change the battery this way.  Otherwise, it is a definite challenge to get the dead battery out of the unit in order to push in a freshly charged battery.  Given this battery is the only choice for this purpose, it is a &#34;must have.&#34;
B00M4ADWTK|5|Great movie
B00TN8ZPBO|1|This is not an ap! It just sends your browser to the youtube websit. Why even bother with this?
B006GWO5NE|1|This item did not fix my problem, although if my kindle worked right it might have been nice to have
1582701709|1|The basic premises of the book can be summed up in several sentences instead of 100+ pages:  1. Think positively (thoughts become things)  2. There is a \\"law of attraction\\" between like and like  3. Visualize and you will receive  4. Everyone can be abundant    The rest of the book is filled with quotes, platitudes, and anecdotes.    Of course this book runs into numerous complications:    Wishful Thinking  Just because X ought to be true does not me X is true.    Cherrypicking  This book often uses anecdotes, but anecdotes do not represent the human population as a whole.  There may be two examples of people who have survived cancer through positive thinking (suggesting that positive thinking cures cancer), but that does not represent all cancer patients.    Economic Fallacies  Everyone can't be abundant.  Everyone cannot own a mansion.  With a large population, many people will be poor or lower class, unfortunately.  Theres a finite amount of resources so for all to be abundant is impossible.    Dogma  By eliminating all negative thoughts, any possible criticism of this book is eliminated as well.  You can't criticize this book at all, because if you do, you are thinking negatively.    Conspiracy  Bryne tries to convince the reader that numerous historical figures such as Einstein and Socrates knew \\"the secret\\".  And that the secret was well hidden from us for centuries and she is the person who is revealing it to us.  It's no \\"secret\\"; shes introducing nothing new.    Developed World Bias  In a developed world, we have opportunity of success (education, human services, etc), but in poor developing countries, no such opportunity exists.  Unfortunately, we cannot expect a family born in the poorest part of Sudan to succeed if they visualize.    Fault  Is it the fault of hurricane victims and the starving for not thinking positively enough?  Can such tragedies be avoided simply by thinking positively?  No and no.    Realisticness  Risk needs to be calculated whenever performing an important action.  Calculating risk cannot be just pushed aside because it is negative thinking.  Focusing on both the pros and cons helps to make an important decision, but when focusing on one, that is not being realistic.  Optimism is one thing, but blind optimism is another.    Constancy  Bryne asserts that \\"the secret\\" always works.  She never wrote a disclaimer saying that sometimes when you think positively, you may not get exactly what you want.  She said it ALWAYS works 100% of the time, which is not correct.    Lack of the Scientific Method  She uses no substantial evidence (other than cherrypicking anecdotes) of any kind to support her grandiose claims.  We should just take her word for it     Self improvement and positive psychology is very important.  There are numerous scientists, doctors, health experts, and psychologists that wrote numerous books which actually make use the scientific method and provide evidence to support their claims.  Unfortunately, this self-help movement has resulted in some people who know little and have achieved little to profit by producing works of little meaningful substance.  Byrne's The Secret, a prime example.

B00005JPY0|5|I saw The Dark Knight in theaters when it came out in July.  I loved it!  What I want to know is given that the street release date of December 9th was announced over a week ago, why is this film still not available for pre-order?
0446528056|2|As a Nicholas Sparks fan, I know that I am about to read the story of a diamond in the rough guy falling for the sweet Southern girl and how that love changed him into either a better man or a broken one.  They will eventually break up but the brought together again either to say goodbye or to reunite.  But the characters and the love story make each story unique.  There was something about the characters and how they fell in love that make me want to root for them and feel for their heartache.  Dear John did not do that for me.  Part of my problem is Savannah who I found overbearingly naive.  Jaime Sullivan from A Walk to Remember who was also sweet and naive had more personality than Savannah.  I wanted to care for John because I was interested to read how being a soldier affected him, but now I find his life as a soldier as a hinderance to his character's growth.  I was expecting him to soften his edges a little bit but he never did even when he found a way to relate to his father.  As for their love story, it was poorly developed even for a whirlwind romance.  I could not get past the fact that by the second or third day of meeting each other they were declaring their love for each other.  True Believer also had a whirlwind romance but it was more developed through more interactions between Lexie and Jeremy and the development of their characters. <br /> <br />I am giving Dear John two stars because I did not hate the story, I was simply bored with it.
B000NA1OXY|5|I consider myself as someone who has a very fine taste in music. I play guitar, have played electric bass, my favorite bands are definitely not your pop collection: Sonata Arctica, Deicide, DragonForce, Rhapsody of Fire, Europe, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, Kamelot.<br /><br />As such, I feel this album deserves way more than 3 stars. Yes, the lyrics are cocky. Yes, this is NOT real punk. And yes, the music could have been a little more complex than a few power chords with an occasional arpeggio here and there.<br /><br />But you forgot one thing: this is not Dream Theater, and nobody said it was. This music is meant for radio. You can't afford to have 7 minute songs in radio, although that would be nice. I mean, what's wrong with structured verses, or the simplicity of this music? As long as it sounds good(and it surely does), I don't have any problem with it whatsoever.<br /><br />I feel here that what people have problem getting through are the obviously cocky lyrics. She thinks of herself as the most beautiful, intelligent and precious girl in the universe. I mean, so what? What the hell is wrong with being cocky? Is your self-esteem so low that a little blond girl talking she's \\"damn precious\\" annoys you?<br /><br />If so, don't purchase this album. You'll want to throw it out of the window. If you, however, can release the judgment of the lyrics(which, by the way, are quite good) and enjoy the music, you definitely won't regret.

0345535529|5|This is a great bang-for-your-buck purchase. New books in a store are around $10 each, and even on here expect to pay around $5-7 each for something used. So this is perfect for what I wanted. Which was EVERYTHING. I just finished the fifth book about a week ago, and I can’t wait to continue with this series. Maybe I came a little late to the party, but at least I showed up, poisoned a bastard king, jousted on a pretty pig, and went on an adventure by ship.<br /><br />I probably couldn’t say anything that hasn’t been said about this series before. It’s dense like a brownie baked with too much butter and eggs. But not the densest out there, I might add.  I had my trepidations on starting this series after I was told—by countless people—that it was dense, hard to read, hard to get into, difficult to understand, filled with extraneous details of unimportance, etc. But when I actually read it, I found that to be a gross exaggeration. The series hasn’t been hard for me to read at all. All of the books held and captivated by interest, from book one to book five. So if you can get pas that dense cloud that hands over it, just like a dense and fudgy brownie, you will find it delicious.<br /><br />This series is what renewed my enjoyment of the fantasy novel. I was really big into that genre when I was younger, then sort of got more into contemporary writers who had the subject matter to match. If you can get passed the density of it, but if you’re already an actual reader and not a first timer, this shouldn’t be an issue. It’s richly filtered with people both fascinating and horrible, beautiful and ugly. No one is black and white, and no one is safe from death (sobbing ensues at the thought of Ned). Your favorite character will go through some s***, let me tell you. I will say the degree of rape is weird to me. I can’t help but think there’s got to be some sort of… interest or fascination Martin has with it. You can’t be a woman in this series without being (almost) raped, stupid, or crazy. By the completion of the fifth book, Arya remains the only one that I can think of. HOWEVER. This series is great. Full of everything you could hope for in an epic, and then much more.stupid, or crazy. By the completion of the fifth book, Arya remains the only one that I can think of. HOWEVER.

B0067R0APK|2|I heard somewhere that AccuWeather will start forecasting weather up to 45 days in advance.  I think they need to figure out how to forecast 4 hours in advance before going all out.<br /><br />I was not really impressed with the forecasting nor the radar map.  As soon as the Weatherbug app became available for my device, I jumped ship.
B003VB5E2E|2|I am a very big Clapton fan and I pre-ordered this DVD. I enjoyed watching Cross Roads 2009. The quality of the DVD is well done and the music is overall good. My main complaint(s) are that many of the same musicians were invited back from CrossRoads 2009 - so much so, that it almost seems like a repeat of the year before. Also, some of the choices made for the DVD are not comprehensible to me.  Jimmy Vaughn gets more air time on stage than Joe Bonamassa? Almost 30 minutes of the DVD devoted to Derrick Trucks band? Why is Vince Gil back again?  I almost thought  Eric was too lazy to change his invitation list from last year and just clicked the send button on his laptop to last year's invite list.  I noticed that many of the positive reviews on this site for the DVD were from people who went to the live concert and are actually reviewing their experience from the live show. Their reviews I would imagine are colored by their good memories of the concert. Bill Murray is back again as MC as well. I like Bill Murray but his act here is the same as it was in 2009. So if the thought of seeing Bill dress up like Elvis for a few cheap laughs makes you cringe a little, then save your money and rent this DVD on NetFlex.
B00009NDAF|4|I'm going to be an intern in IBM starting June and I was told to read this book as an introduction to what Gerstner did with IBM.  Quite honestly, all I knew of Gerstner was the simple fact that he turned around an ailing IBM and made it into the company it is today. This book certainly gave me more insight into the workings of the company and the man who changed the way it worked. <br /> <br />What struck me most is that I felt like I was learning to hold on to the reigns of IBM as Gerstner described he did.  He not only mentioned that he was unfamiliar with the technology coming in as the CEO, but also the large diaspora of products and services it touched.  It felt like both he and I were learning about IBM in that regard, which is something I liked.  As a first time reader, I appreciated the fact that I wasn't lost in the daily business jargon and it made me want to read more.   <br /> <br />Now like a lot of reviewers have mentioned, it's a self congratulatory work, and he makes no qualms about it.  But why should he be modest? He doesn't discredit others when the names need to be mentioned, then why should he leave his name out? After saving a nearly dying 'national treasure' from a never returning point, I think he deserves it all.  He also mentions how he had to fire over 130 thousand people and lay down the law when it came to enforcing his way.  He didn't hide the fact that he was stern, ruthless, and straightforward with his methods, because they were ultimately methods that worked in a big big manner. <br /> <br />Obviously, this is a one sided account of the IBM story of the 90s.  But it is a good one-sided story.  At the end of the day, the story ends happily, and that's what counts.
B005XQLBU4|4|Lots of fun like the old one with new tech.

B002LC8HF0|2|Last book is, as the other two, well written. However, it is incredible long and a lot of the story just feels redundant. Caught myself skipping pages just to get to the interesting parts.<br /><br />Ending was good though. Won't say more.
B0007Y08IS|5|I don't know what it is about this movie.  If you like South Park then you probably will like this too.  It is from the same guys that brought you Kenny and his friends.  The puppets on strings make it cheesy but I think that is part of the charm.  One of my co-workers and I rattle off quotes from this movie all the time.  And, like the idiots we are, we are laughing hysterically every time!
B00KLUMR28|5|Sia never ceases to amaze me.  I was wowed by her ten years ago when I discovered her on IMF (now defunct music channel), and I continue to be blown away by her amazing vocals.  This album takes her sound to a new level with a full, well produced, combination of strings, drum machines, and other crazy computerized weirdness.  Yet, such production does not take away from her incredible voice and the emotion brought out in it, instead, it only enhances her natural given talent.  She is a talented song writer and gifted vocalist.  I recommended this to anyone interested in hearing an artist who can write &#34;pop&#34; with real talent behind it.
B00EOGZ42U|4|This game is an amazing strategy game to play when you're bored.It's addition and progression of mechanics is completely intriguing. Great job Omni Systems, you did good.
B00FKF0F3C|5|I loved this series. This final book means the end of an enjoyable journey
0609610570|4|As the book says &quot;putting an execution culture in place is hard, but losing it is easy&quot; - Bossidy put one in place at Honeywell and then retired in 1999. In 2001 they invited him back, because they'd lost it. I'd have liked to have understood more about what went wrong, and how to prevent a repetition.<br />There's great emphasis on facing reality, setting clear goals, and dealing with underperformers - a good message. <br />Under 'know your business' &amp; Strategy Reviews, I didn't see any emphasis on another aspect of reality - 'marketing hype'. I was once presented with a Business Plan for a Canadian subsidiary that projected to achieve 35% market penetration in 3-5 years. Turns out the Marketing team hadn't studied the demographic realities of Canada, and had simply re-used some US Statistics, and arbitrarily adapted them. That was a strong lesson they learned from me, and I'd have been well pleased to see something similar in here.
B003VXRD4E|5|Great show - everyone should watch this adaptation - the British do the period programming so incredibly well.
B00NX6WZIS|5|Another great Denzel Washington film.  It reminded me a lot of &#34;Man on Fire&#34;, which is a good thing as I love that movie.
B002MQYOFW|4|I read this book because of the strong recommendation of my daughter and my son, both of raved about \\"Hunger Games,\\" despite their being too old for young-adult fiction.  A combination of Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\", \\"1984\\", \\"Lord of the Flies\\", and the CBS television show \\"Survivor\\"--with some Harry Potter-like creatures thrown in for good measure--\\"Hunger Games\\" is the story of a futuristic dystopia in which two dozen young teens are selected by a lottery each year to fight one another to death over a period of several weeks on a nationally broadcast television show.  It's not great literature, but it is a surprisingly gripping read.
B000N6TX1I|1|All I can say is \\"Waste of time.\\" I didn't get it. The movie just ended and nothing was explained. A dud!
B009GX7IRA|4|NCIS  is one of my favorite shows.  Please find a way to  bring  Ziva  back.
B000000H64|5|What more can be said about this album? It was so ahead of its time and so influential. A paradigm of musical genius. Dino, Burton and company are consummate craftsman to say the least. Bought this album nearly 20 years ago and is still one of my favorites. Highly Recommended!
B000W8OM5Y|5|This is one of Mel Gibson's best all-around (acting, directing). His performance was powerful and passionate. His facial expressions left nothing to the imagination. I love movies of this genre, and this one deserves every award it received! I never tire of it!

B0000060NF|5|On What's Going On, Marvin Gaye makes an intensely personal statement on three levels, as a black man living in America, as a Christian, and as an anti-war activist. The result is an incredibly beautiful and melancholy  album, full of love and hope and a touch of sadness. One of the all time  greatest soul albums.
B00018D44U|1|Now here's an artist that has been praised and given the whole song-and-dance treatment by the media, but regardless of who you are, you are bound to be disappointed by the finished product.<br />Norah Jones's follow-up to her inexplicably huge-selling debut Come Away With Me is filled with more of the same - smooth jazz-pop with tepid arrangements and lyrics with little effort put into them, almost as if they were an afterthought - basically it's good for background music at a formal dinner or as treatment for insomnia but that's it.<br />The difference between this album and the last are hints of country music, which come off as totally contrived and as an attempt to appeal to a different audience, rather than the authentic article.  This is what happens when the critics give an undeserving artist too much praise - they believe their own hype and are lazy about their own craft.<br />Norah Jones is a competent pianist, but lacking as a vocalist and songwriter - the better material is written by someone other than her.  Maybe she will live up to the hype if she puts some serious effort into her next recording, becomes a better writer and singer, and starts performing songs that are more unique and original - not songs that sound like Diana Krall leftovers.
B00BUCXVPI|3|If you can get past Tom Cruise as Reacher, the movie is ok.  As a Reacher fan of Lee Child's books the character would have been more true if played by someone like Russel Crowe or someone fitting the description.  Reacher is 6'5 and 250 pounds.  If you haven't read the books and don't know the character, then I guess Tom Cruise would be acceptable.
B00BAXFAJC|1|That was a painful read. I put it down five times and read other books straight through, which is my usual pattern. But then I would come back, and hope it would get better -- it did win the Booker Prize. What were they thinking? The book was tedious and never seemed to go anywhere. How many descriptions of rain-soaked, sodden wool over coats, dripping on the furniture after slogging along the quay, does one book need, after all? From a little past the halfway point, it picked up slightly, but none of the characters ever really interested me, and the plot, if you want to call it that, just jumps around with no purpose, ending right where it began with a feeling of having been lead in pointless circles for a month, which is how long it took me to finally make it to the end. The predictable, uninspired ending that felt like a slap on my face when I reached the last page. Really? That's it? Tremendous waste of time, unless you are obsessed with descriptions of rain, and rain-soaked people, and walking in the rain, drying off after walking in the rain, sleeping in the rain, and anything rain, or weather related. Good luck..
1401302378|5|Chris Anderson's book length treatment of the concept of the Long Tail is well worth reading, even if one's only role in the world of business is that of \\"consumer.\\"  Like Thomas Friedman's THE WORLD IS FLAT, this book details a major shift in \\"the way things work\\" as we already are experiencing them in the opening decade of the new millennium.  Those busy figuring out how best to reach their potential market will, of course, find much valuable information in Anderson's analysis; but so, too, will those of us trying to adjust to the abundant riches the new economy already is providing.   <br /> <br />The Long Tail promises us we won't any longer need to \\"make do\\" with what retailers chose to make available on their limited shelf space; it means we can find music to listen to not limited to the CDs supposedly attractive to a particular much-sought-after demographic.  However, it also means we have to take our consumption roles more seriously as well, making choices and following recommendations and imputing our likes and dislikes into computer data bases and delving below the seemingly familiar surface of \\"hits\\" shown us by mainstream media. <br /> <br />Anderson's book jacket touts his book as an exploration of \\"The New Economics of Culture and Commerce.\\"  For those of us loath to follow the crowd or to be limited by its choices and preferences, THE LONG TAIL promises a liberating set of changes already affecting our everyday lives in profound ways, in the cultural sphere as well as the economic arena.  I buy books on Amazon, download tracks from iTunes, search the 'Net with Google, consult Wikipedia for basic information, watch Netflick DVDs and thereby already profit \\"culturally\\" from much of what the Long Tail offers. Now I know why!   <br /> <br />Anderson's insights and analysis highlight and make sense out of a major cultural shift well worth taking note of, even if one is far removed from the world of the hungry entrepreneur or the savvy businessman.   Highlyrecommended!
6305364613|5|stylistically superior, this movie is a feast for the eyes.    one might not enjoy the creative anachronisms, but can't deny the visual pleasure of watching this movie, and the aural as well!  the soundtrack is great.    i'm no shakespeare fan, and if you aren't either might i also suggest and recommend the movie \\"titus\\" with anthony hopkins.

B00005B6C9|5|I know what you're thinking, \\"Oh God! Another Bee Gees album??! How much more do I have to take?\\" That's the typical mindset of many people who only know the Bee Gees as the hairy-chested, medallion and tight pants wearing, big toothed, falsetto singing \\"disco kings\\".  Heck, I wasn't even alive when the Bee Gees were at their peak and I recognize the stigma. This image, however, is an extremely unfair one. What most people don't or refuse to realize is that the Brothers Gibb have had a successful career almost 20 years before and after Saturday Night Fever! Even though it's INCREDIBLY unfair that the opinions of all Bee Gees music are based on just a terribly small fraction of their tremendous body of work (the music from Saturday Night Fever), it is still good music and should not be forgotten or ridiculed. This is not a review about their work from the 70's, however, it is one about the Gibb's latest masterpiece, \\"This Is Where I Came In\\".<br />The sounds of high voices and disco beats have been abandoned. In a very smart move, the Bee Gees have returned to their 60's roots.<br />This is Where I Came in: This track is BRILLIANT! The best song on the album, and possibly one of the greatest the Bee Gees have ever written. (And that's saying a lot considering the huge catalogue of music that the Bee Gees have produced over their 40-year career.) The song has an unexplainable ability to captivate. It begins with a bluesy, acoustic guitar riff played by Maurice Gibb, which opens up to the haunting vibrato of Robin. Barry Gibb takes his turn in a verse with a very sexy, breathy vocal that leads into the bass-electrified chorus. The impeccable brotherly harmonies kick in, reminding you of what good music is supposed to sound like. The only recognition of Bee Gees from the 70's is the pulsing beat that penetrates the song after the chorus. This track is worth the price of the album alone.<br />Wedding Day: This song is one of the strongest on the album, proving that the Bee Gees major strength is in writing ballads. The mood presented from the song is very sentimental and heartwarming. Robin's voice on the chorus is wonderful and Barry's vocal during the bridge is very emotional. Great track.<br />Man in the Middle: Maurice's first appearance with a lead vocal on the album. I love this song because it reflects how Maurice feels about himself in the group, leaving the listener with a more personal view of the Bee Gees. The music itself is also excellent with a very catchy chorus. Don't be surprised if you find yourself singing, \\"I'm just a man in the middle of a complicated plan...\\" after listening to it a couple of times.  <br />Déjà Vu: WHY WASN'T THIS RELEASED AS A SINGLE? This song has all the elements of a smash hit. Very upbeat and energetic with a nice lead by Robin, it would easily fit in with any top 40 record of today. Sadly, this gem was overlooked at single picking time.<br />Embrace: Exceptional effort on Robin's part. Beautifully written and performed, \\"Embrace\\" is easily one of the more enjoyable tracks on the album. <br />Voice in the Wilderness: Not an instant favorite, but it grows on you. I admire the Bee Gees for this adventurous new sound. A very fast paced track with an extremely energetic beat and a fantastic chorus. Very different, but very Bee Gees.<br />All in all, \\"This Is Where I Came In\\" is a wonderful effort from the Bee Gees. Compared to any recent releases from other established artists, (Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, etc...) this album is outstanding. I highly recommend that you at least give this album a listen and truly experience the magic of the Brothers Gibb.
B009GEEMLY|5|This movie was surprisingly good. Great photography and action, a good story, yet good comic relief from Ironman and the Hulk. Love Scarlett Johansson too.
B005AKFXZW|4|A really thoughtfully written book - achieves a balance between fantasy and reality, with just the right amount of romance
B008AK8FHM|3|Compelling , but there can be no solid proof of heaven. While his story is somewhat convincing, and while I am confident there is life beyond earth, I wasn't impressed by Alexander's book. I was much more impressed by his on line interviews. He is a better narrator in person than he is a writer.
B00CW7KK9K|5|I use the Withings Pulse with Withings scale and MyFitnessPal partner app for my phone. These three functions work very well together. The phone app allows me to easily track calorie intake. This, and the data from the Pulse, feed into the Withings HealthMate website, where at a glance I can see sleep, activity, heart rate, calories in and out, and my weight in one day, one week, or one month view. I struggled for some time to find the set of devices and apps that would give me the data I need and would be completely integrated. Now I have it!<br /><br />The battery life of the Pulse is quite good: it last for more than a week. The UI is also good: simple and intuitive. The sleep bracelet is quite comfortable. I'm not a huge fan of the clip, but only because it is made of some suede-like material that does not slide easily. I sometimes struggle to clip it onto clothes. But this is minor compared to the overall benefit.<br /><br />(Note my review will show I am not a verified purchaser of the Pulse from Amazon. I bought it direct from Withings.)

B000AXSN5G|4|Neil Young has gone through all kinds of phases over the years.  He's had some misses and duds and gotten off track now and again, but when he's good, as he is, with a couple of exceptions here, he's really, really good. <br /> <br />The reason he continues to be one of the most influential musicians on the planet is that there's a consistency and intensity in spite of some of the misses.  <br /> <br />A couple of days after 9/11, he chose to cover John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\".  It couldn't have been a more appropriate choice.  His protest spirit continues on \\"When God made me\\", which he chose to play for the Katrina benefit recently.  The artists had been told specifically not to say anything political in the wake of Kanye West's \\"Bush doesn't like black people\\" comment. <br /> <br />Well, for those who listened to \\"When God made me\\", Neil managed to stick it to the crusading war mongers anyway. <br /> <br />Jonathan Demme filmed Neil doing this album in its entirety at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville just after it was finished.  Something to look forward to. <br /> <br />
0553579908|5|Just a quick note to add my voice to the chorus.  So far this entire series is wonderful.  It is well written and action packed with many surprises along the way.  Enjoy.
B005S9EJ14|5|Can not beat the acting power in this film. Amazing British and Indian cast, just OUTSTANDING. A fun and at the same time moving plot. Many of my most long standing favorite actors, and of course, Dev Patel an up and coming GENIUS! Although Dev is different looking, I am REALLY attracted to him in so many ways!<br /><br />This is a MUST SEE movie in my book, I own it. It is one you will LOVE to share with others and watch every few years.
B0027BOL4G|5|\\"Food Inc.\\"- released in 2008 - is a excellent report on the American Food Industry, how it evolved from small farms to big mass production slaughter houses and genetically engineered feed and animals.  Everything is bigger, faster, cheaper, and causing unintended consequences.  Because of all the salt, fat and sugar in the fast food industry, America's children are in a Type 2 Diabetes epidemic.  Diabetes is hitting children and younger ages.  The food system is skewed toward obesity.  The treatment of animals in big corporate farms is disgusting.  I applaud Robert Kenner's docuentary that exposes the detrimental effects on our population, environment and health.  I never realized how corn is used in so many products and that cows are herbivores by nature.  We feed them and other animals corn to make them fatter faster.  Genetically developed chickens are top heavy and rased in squalid crowded conditions.  This film will definitely affect the way I eat.  And of course there are people in power with special interests that feel no gain in protecting the average American against e-coli and bad food production.  Food is getting more and more expensive, due to drought, floods, higher oil prices to transport and overpopulation.  There may be no motivation to end this industry rife with monopolies and lax interpretation of laws.  Scary stuff, but strangely fascinating to watch what is really going on.

B0001XAPZ6|5|after announcing the release dates for studio ghibli films dvds \\"NAUSICAA\\", \\"TOTORO\\" and \\"PORCO ROSSO\\" as 31st august, disney has postponed the release indefinitely for reasons best known to them. maybe disney is too busy with films like \\"lion king3\\", pocahontas4 or aladdin5 and their special edition dvd releases. films like \\"lilo and stitch\\" and \\"pocahontas\\" are available on dvd everywhere in the market. still disney is re-releasing their \\"masterpiece\\" editions early next year. disney is one company which surely knows how to make money out of its own crap!! one thing which everyone would like to know is why disney and buena vista is afraid to release these \\"hayao miyazaki- studio ghibli\\" gems to the west inspite of aquiring their rights years ago?? they have all of studio ghibli films in their possession for years and they have just been sitting on it!! how disgusting!  <br /> <br />according to the website nausicaa.net the release has been postponed purposely till january 2004 to coincide with the u.s. release of miyazaki's latest film \\"howl's moving castle\\", which is already making waves. how shameless.. just to sell few more copies, why do they have to act so cheap?? or is it just the fear that after watching these gems, everyone will get to know how bankrupt disney and its fims have become?? disney never does such things to their own films. even their cheapest \\"direct to video\\" releases, which is mostly crap, is never postponed. so why do such things with studio ghibli classics which everyone is dying to see and own?? or have they got the \\"idea\\" of making their own \\"totoro\\" and \\"nausicaa\\" first?? remember \\"atlantis\\"....???? disney's blatant rehash of miyazaki\\"s classic \\"laputa:castle in the sky\\". unfortunately the dvd of laputa was released in u.s. by buena vista long after atlantis was released (and bombed, of course!!). nonetheless everyone now knows from where disney got such a brilliant concept for \\"atlantis\\". <br /> <br />and that's just not all. beuna vista and disney have not been faithful to the english world when it comes to the relase of hayao miyazaki-studio ghibli dvds. just check out the same title which have been released in japan, BY NONE OTHER THAN BUENA VISTA ITSELF...  <br />here are few of the major differences i found in their releases in japan and us: <br /> <br />1. now we all know what disney did to the english track of\\"laputa:castle in the sky\\"  by getting the score recomposed even for those silent moments. ok...padonable..at least they included the original japanese track but on the extra disc, unlike in japanese release, you cant view the film in storyboard mode using angle feature. so you just cant switch between the real film and the storyboards. also in japanese release, there's one very interesting alternate opening and closing for the film that has been included, which unfortunately is missing from the us release. <br /> <br />2. \\"kiki's delivery service\\" dvd release by buena vista japan includes a special documentary on the art of urusura, which was used in the film. sadly the people at buena vista u.s. found it lesser interesting than even john lasseter's introduction (which they never forget to add in any of ghibli's release and the worst part is you cant even skip it!!). <br /> <br />3. the lesser said would be better for \\"princess mononoke\\". this stunning piece of art enjoys a well deserved 3disc deluxe edition dvd release in japan which features a long in depth documentary on the \\"making of\\" the film besides other features like complete storyboards with angle feature and multi language track option. they even have a separate dvd release named \\"how mononoke hime was born\\"...sigh!!!! any chances of it seeing a region1 release...??? forget about it..but be prepared for special editions of lion king5, aladdin6....and so on...!!  <br /> <br />i just dont understand why disney is being so indifferent to the english audience.  i only wish \\"NAUSICAA\\" and all other upcoming dvds (including \\"TOTORO\\") are worth the wait....and i hope they include the \\"special documentary on the recently opened miyazaki meuseum in japan\\" as in japanese release of \\"totoro\\". <br /> <br />everyone in the west and around the world loves and adore miyazaki and studio ghibli as much as their own people. disney has absolutely no right to deprive us of such great stuff.its about time disney released studio ghibli masterpieces in a timely manner with all the respect and honour they deserve.

B00WP9HSJU|1|Emma Sheridan is foolish beyond words, has an awful self-image, and generally is just a disappointment as a female lead.  She does irrational things. Ignores doing what even a very unaware person would do. She proclaims at the end to have found her inner Claire while finding her Fraser. What a crock of ya know what. She is so un-Claire like. Her personality seems to degrade throughout the book. You can pretend it is naivety but don't call me flower. Totally lacking character. Frankly, I can't believe I continued to read this. I'm an Outlander fan from the publishing of the first book. I don't recommend reading this book. I would also steer clear of anything this so called writer manages to get published.

0393340244|5|Cordelia Fine has done science a great service with \\"Delusions of Gender.\\"  Fine, a neurophilosopher of note, seeks to attack the now-prodigious belief that neuroscience has established the existence of \\"hard-wired\\" differences between the cognition of men and women.  In modern journalism and educational theory, it has become increasingly trendy to claim that neurological sex differences can explain anything from differing color preferences, to career choice, and even the gender gap in mathematics.  Some modern education theorists even claim that modern neurology supports the idea that education should be strictly sexually segregated in order to account for the supposed innate qualitative differences in learning ability between sexes(girls are supposedly inherently emphatic, while boys are supposedly inherently systemic).  These ideas are so casually cited as facts in the media that many people, in my experience at least, tend to have the impression that they represent the consensus of neuroscience.  Fine has three main objections to this popular trend:<br />1.  Neuroscientists have not, in fact, discovered real evidence of innately \\"hardwired\\" differences in the \\"knowledges\\" of males and females.<br />2. These pop writers misinterpret neuroscience in general.  The media has crafted a picture of neuroscience which portrays it as the search for innate human nature, which goes against the essence of the field, and creates the false impression that we should ignore data from the social sciences which points to the flexibility of gender roles.<br />3. Pop neuro-sexism has potentially negative effects, and already plays a role in discouraging women from attainment in mathematical fields, the corporate world, and other areas of life.  Unfortunately, pop neuro-sexism has begun to play the same social role as past biologically-based explanations of gender divides, in that it unthinkingly treats the fleeting present of society as the permanent state of nature.<br />As Fine stresses to the reader though, \\"Delusions of Gender\\" is not meant to refute the possibility that there may be some differences between the general neurological dispositions of men and women.  Rather, her goal is to demonstrate that there is overwhelming evidence that most of the gender gap is socially constructed, and that the notion that there are \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" brains is patently absurd.<br /><br />The book is broken up into three main sections.  The first collects the massive amount of sociological and psychological data which suggests that the much-discussed \\"math\\" gap and the gap in high-level economic attainment is socially constructed.  There have been multiple and oft-repeated studies which prove that women internalize the negative effects of sexism, which have nothing to do with their innate abilities.  When women are reminded of society's opinion on female analytic ability or business acumen, they tend to do very poorly on tests which measure these abilities.  However, when women are encouraged to believe that their gender shouldn't matter, or that women are actually good at traditionally \\"masculine\\" fields of knowledge, they far outperform the average female test-taker, even to the point where they nearly close the gender gap.  This poses a serious challenge to people who carelessly speculate that gender gaps can be explained by neurological difference: Even if there were different innate tendencies between men and women, what makes them so sure that our society has fully unleashed the analytical potential of the female half of the human race?  It's an assumption that I myself find frustrating, and it is somewhat confusing as to why neuro-sexists aren't called out on it more often in the media.<br /><br />Fine also points out that the real world itself flies in the face of our patriarchal assumptions.  If our gender gaps are so innate, then why have some countries entirely closed gaps in political representation and mathematical attainment?  In fact,there are some countries where girls outperform boys on math tests.  Even more interesting, high-ranking teams in the international math Olympics have an upward trend in female representation, to the point where many of the most successful teams are now gender egalitarian.  Today, half of all new Bachelor's degrees in mathematical fields are held by women.  Recently, Master's degree representation passed the 1/3 mark, and PhD representation continues to grow at a rapid rate.  Despite this, some male mathematicians still have the gall to claim that the Bachelors-Masters-PhD discrepancies represent an innate inferiority in mathematics, thereby arbitrarily throwing down yet another so-called \\"natural\\" barrier to women's attainment.<br /><br />The second section delves into neurological evidence, and a critique of the way in which neuroscience is used by neuro-sexists.  Fine explains the history of pop neuro-sexism, and describes the research claims of the handful of neurologists it has arbitrarily selected as its stars.  Fine respectfully disagrees with the actual neuroscientists in question, but blatantly takes glee in eviscerating the claims made in pop non-fiction books such as \\"Men are From Mars, Women are From Venus.\\"  She goes through a wide variety of commonly-cited pieces of evidence for neuro-sexism.  These include the in-utero testosterone spike in males, the emphatic tendencies of women, the supposed spatial superiority of \\"male\\" brains, and other such examples.  She presents many pieces of contrary evidence to the notion that these differences have the effects that the neuro-sexists claim they do, and explains why the ultimate effects of these phenomena on developing brains are still highly ambiguous.  Perhaps most importantly, she accuses pop neuro-sexists of having an entirely incorrect understanding of the brain.  Pop authors claim that brains have \\"emphatic\\" capacities and \\"systemic\\" capacities, and that the male-ness or female-ness of your brain determines which you have.  However, in doing this, they ignore the intricate interconnectivity of these capacities, and the ways in which they strengthen one another.  Furthermore, evidence suggests that just because a person tends to use one or the other does not even suggest a weakness in the other.  The human brain can be called upon to deploy both empathy and analytic ability.  It rarely ever shelves either of them, and can quickly shift in emphasis based on the situation at hand.  Also worthy of mentioning is that new evidence points to the possibility that having an emphatic emphasis may not cripple your scientific or mathematical ability at all, and even plays an essential role in genius-level systemic thought.<br /><br />Fine admits that there is some convincing evidence that there are some types of developmental differences which affect brain structure, such as the huge gap in rates of autism which exist between the sexes.  However, when looked at from a broad perspective, neurology suggests nothing resembling a gendered division of labor.  If anything, neurology suggests that the individual is the most important unit.  Traits which are present and variant within the individual cross the gender line.  Our socialization powerfully impacts our very neurological structure, and an individual is capable of rapidly shifting their neurological activity.  Pretending that sex discrimination is somehow respectful of the supposedly unique ways that \\"female brains think\\" is absurd, not to mention socially useless.<br /><br />The final section focuses on child development, and serves mainly as an objection to the common belief that childhood behavior represents raw, unmolded human nature.  Gendered socialization begins as soon as a baby is out of the womb, and as one study indicates, possibly even in-utero.  Even the most progressive parents treat their children differently in ways that they do not consciously recognize.  Sexism makes its way into parenting by the unconscious, yet pernicious use of different word choices and tones of voice, depending on the sex of the baby.  On top of this, childhood development research has proven that although it's nearly impossible to shake adherence to gender roles once they've been adopted, that there is a surprising degree of plasticity which can change depending on the attitudes of nearby adults and even the local culture of other children.  The point being, that socialization runs agonizingly deep, and the tendency of girls to wear pink (which is a very recent phenomenon) and for boys to associate child-rearing with being \\"sissy\\" (also more historical in nature than people tend to think) are by no means self-evidently natural.<br /><br />\\"Delusions of Gender\\" is a fresh and welcome rejoinder to the nonsense on stilts which presents itself as scientific objectivity.  The evidence I relayed here is barely a fraction of what Fine provides for the reader.  This book not only refutes specific points, but also provides an exciting picture of the complexities of modern neuroscience.  Fine's conversational tone makes for an excellent guide through the nitty-gritty of this burgeoning field, while also raising a strong objection to the pseudoscience which feeds off of it.  As Fine reminds the reader, despite cries of \\"political correctness\\" from pop neuro-sexists when faced with criticism, this issue has profound moral dimensions.  When people are told that they possess a biological trait that inhibits their mental abilities, it devastates their sense of ambition and confidence.  If neuro-sexists want to avoid moral criticism, then they should refrain from trying to reform our entire education system based on faulty science, or by actively trying to stem the tide of female attainment in the same exact manner as sexists have always done.  The author also suggests that neuro-sexism hurts males too, mainly through attempts by neuro-sexist education theorists to chalk up all \\"boys' problems\\" to their neurology, thus crowding out any discussion of the effects of cultural messages we as a society send boys during their development.ines which you have.

B00Y6QF0PE|3|I picked three out of five because her writing is better, it's still the story we love, but I wish we could of known more about what he was about when not with Ana. Also, this made me bring him down off his pedestal a little. A few times throughout the book I thought, how did he become so rich? I spoke how much she tAlked about his child hood. She has developed such a good storyline with the abuse as a toddler trailing through to adulthood.

0060528737|5|Abhorsen smashed it for me, I just loved it. Garth Nix does a wonderful job building tension, and plot rather than getting side tracked by the somewhat wooden romance that we saw between Sabriel and Touchstone in the first novel.  In Abhorsen Garth Nix’s writing flows effortlessly, its lyrical quality drawing the reader into a story that begins slowly but builds momentum to a fast paced, fantasy adventure and stunning conclusion. Sabriel introduces us to the Old Kingdom, Lirael fills us in on the details, and Abhorsen magnificently wraps up this wonderful trilogy in a near perfect parcel!<br /><br />Abhorsen is the concluding novel in Garth Nix’s Old Kingdom trilogy. Nix has already introduced us to the fantasy world of the Old Kingdom with Sabriel, and Lirael. Abhorsen is followed by Nix’s recent prequel Clariel.  Currently I believe it is intended to be a five book long series.  I would recommend that you read all three books, in the Old Kingdom series (Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen), consecutively one after another, or without a large break in between, otherwise you might struggle to remember certain details from Lirael that are important to your understanding of Abhorsen.<br /><br />In Abhorsen, Hedge, a Necromancer  intends to awaken Orannis the Destroyer,  with the help of Chlorr–a Greater Dead creature–and Sam’s poor, best friend Nick, who is unaware that he is the host avatar of the Destroyer. The Destroyer is the Ninth Bright Shiner, the most evil magical force or being. Lirael does not know how, but she has to find a way to stop Orannis. Everything Lirael has learned up until this point will be put to the supreme test as she must find a way to bind the Destroyer.<br /><br />There is a heck load of tension, as Lirael and her band of friends race to defeat Hedge and Orannis. They must join together and conjure up all the magic they can find to stand up to and defeat an enemy that seems undefeatable, and threatens not only the Charter but all living things, and the fabric of life itself. The final part of the novel is the best and most moving part of the book, with the beautiful descriptions of  Lirael’s journey through Death to use the Dark Mirror, to the final conflict with Orannis when all the heroes stand together as one to defeat Orannis.<br /><br />I loved Lirael. Without doubt Lirael almost seems unrecognisable as we knew her before, she embraces everything she has learnt and though she may be quivering inside, she acts, sounds, and behaves like an Abhorsen-in-waiting. Wow, I just loved this about her. I think that I have said this before but it is well worth repeating, Garth Nix really knows how to create strong female characters,  and Lirael is almost unrecognisable in this novel from the insecure girl we knew as the  ex-assistant librarian in the second novel, Lirael. Lirael,  and Prince Sameth develop in this novel and in a good way, both of them are up against it and instead of backing down, they measure up to the task in hand. Lirael has accepted her role as Abhorsen-in-Waiting, with all the responsibilities that title entails.  Sam also benefits from character development, although I would say that more time and effort is spent on Lirael and rightly so.<br /><br />In Lirael Prince Sameth expects to be the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, heir to the powers of ‘The Book of the Dead’ and the seven bells, but instead he discovers that this role is meant for Lirael, and not just that but he discovers that Lirael is his aunt. In Abhorsen we discover that Sam destiny’s  is to be a Wallmaker.<br /><br />I adored Disreputable Dog and Mogget. But, the relationship between Disreputable dog and Lirael became a focal point in Abhorsen and it really pulled at my heartstrings, whereas Mogget, in typical cat fashion appeared a bit aloof, until the bitter end! Cats, love them but you know what they’re like, independent souls! Loyalty tends to be a quality associated with a dog rather than a cat. No more about Moggetas I don’t want to spoil the novel’s conclusion for you.<br /><br />So highly recommended, a favourite of mine, so anything less than 5 stars would be an insult.<br />Full review available at http://kyrosmagica.wordpress.com/2014/12/15/my-kyrosmagica-review-of-abhorsen-by-garth-nix/

B005R32L66|5|Very goth working and goth connection Skype<br />  Goth softener , easy for uses , and clearly voes. I am very happy.<br /><br />  Thank,s
B00ISJT5IS|1|hardly compares to the original in true humor
B009439HEY|5|phenomenal musicianship with a new imagining of some great songs.  Steve Hackett is a master musician and I think this volume eclipsed the first.
6305075468|5|This movie is so dark and so terrifying, you will think about Nosferatu for months afterwards.  The organ music in the background gets annoying after awhile, but it dosen't diminish the movie.  Max Schreck is brilliant.   The emotion he portrays is mesmerizing.  The plot is sick and twisted and  leaves tons to the imagination. Get it, you won't be disappointed.
B00IINPXLW|5|This game is a great follower for Cut The Rope. They added a lot more mechanics in the game and added new friends for Om Nom. Really fun and challenging.
B00FVVR2ZO|5|Cool game<br />I really enjoy playing the game and solving the puzzle s. I really really really really really really like the game
B005K17RU0|5|Excellent, works good and FREE. Very minuscule and non-intrusive ads, mostly to upgrade to their Pro version. Not sure what is included in the paid version, FREE is very featured packed. I'd recommend this app to anyone.
B00A6CCF0K|4|I found this a very good sequel. Not quite as scary as The Shining, but I first read it as a pretty sheltered teen. I'm glad to see Danny ended up well adjusted and able to work through his scumbag era and end up with redemption on many levels.
B00AIUUXHC|5|This game is awsom I love it not all sharks you have to get with diamonds. It's great
B00BVYNSLC|5|Incredible performance by the lead actress in multiple roles.  Engaging sci fi storyline.
B00N1JQ2UO|5|We bought this for my son for Christmas. I just asked what he thought & he said, &#34;I loved it.&#34;
B00DRPVE3M|4|It took me a bit to remember how to play but the game helped out. I like this game alot and suggest playing it.
B0015T7Q98|4|This is probably my favorite all around album from Panic!at the Disco. I like their other's as well, but I think this is the only one that I love all the songs' in.<br /><br />If your looking for a truly alternative rock, with some folk mixed in for good measure, definitely give this album a try.
0606320873|2|The war against the dead is practically over with only some mopping up to do. The author takes it upon himself to travel all over the world to interview various survivors and record their stories. The problem here for me is everyone ends up just basically sounding like the same person. Here's how the flow of the book generally went:<br /><br />Interesting.<br /><br />Interesting.<br /><br />Deadly dull.<br /><br />Interesting.<br /><br />Deadly dull.<br /><br />Skip.<br /><br />Deadly dull.<br /><br />Interesting.
B00CLT31D6|4|Great book except for the last chapters. The author seemed to lost the point by centralizing conclusions on limited data. Overall is a great read
B000FCKIFU|5|I liked it but I like the way Baldacci writes.  Good story line you need to read it.
0714843377|4|This book great. I realized when I started reading this book that I couldn't put it down so I ended up reading the entire book in an hour. The condition was perfect, it looked like a brand new book. Also, it ended up shipping to me within a few short days.
0780622650|3|Lost in Space fans who loved the original show may not have been quite happy with this movie, (and some hated it) but this is a FUN movie with eye poping effects and a nice sense of humanity. That said, I wish the script  went through one or two more re-writes, to develop more 3 dimensonal  personality for the actors, and to clear up the story. However, I found  myself enjoying this movie alot. Visually stunning  and with a superb  surround sound mix. This is a MUST for anyone showing off a home theater  system. The actors all do a fine job, with kudos to mimi rogers and Gary  Oldman. The fans of the original show (I am one) should enjoy this movie.  Doing a film in the same tone as the campy TV series would have been a TRUE  disaster. This film, While by no means great, is great fun, and after  all...thats a fine accomplishment in itself.
B00I8H78J8|5|I liked the director, and am intrigued by anything with time travel, so I gave this a shot.  Starts out pretty much as you would expect, but finds its way into a very wonderfully done story about fathers and sons, and what it means to grow up and pass the torch.  Can’t recommend this enough.  If you are a dude, you will like it.  If you watch it with a lady, she will like it.  I rented it, then immediately went online to ship my dad a copy.
B00F91RYL8|5|I thought the roll Brad Pitt was a little out of his element, but he played it well and the movie was very exciting to watch. We never found out in the movie, how that virus got started though.
B003YVLC18|3|A likeable retelling of the Cinderella story.
B002VT6C0K|5|Each story seems like a normal mundane setting and then either a sinister third party comes in or just something unexpected and upsetting happens.  Stories punch a big impact and stay with you.  Beautifully written but each and every one ends on a down note.  Especially story with the girl trying to avoid the other girl who is slow and in special classes.  The ending was disturbing and couldn't imagine something like that would happen but within the story believable.  The stories are so well written and completely engrossing.
B004SIP7TE|5|first of all, this isn't modern downtown NY. it's from back in the day, when this country was getting out of it's diapers. great action, great scipting,.great acting....... come on,.. ya just have to have to have this.
B00003CXCT|5|great
B006M4RN3U|5|Love this CD.  Worth the money! I carry it in my car and play it all the time.  If you are considering - just buy it you wont be sorry.
B00LP1MVSW|5|This is probably the most fun game I have ever played. The graphics are amazing.
B00AEFY0F2|5|Purchased this movie to replace the VHS edition that my parents have. Quality and special features allow them to continue to enjoy this movie long even now.
B00VFTCGES|5|Great movie that will make you think beyond basic concepts!
B00EMJBVAI|5|My husband loved it. Well thought out plot, exciting throughout the movie, best zombie movie ever. Would recommend it to anyone liking the genre.
B00B2V66VS|5|I think this is the best game ever because it challenges  you and you can learn how to challenge yourself with different game players I think this is the best game ever it is the best game out of the app store.
B000654YRY|5|Excellent DVD for Dire Staits fans. High quality images and nice scanning by camera operators.
1451666179|5|What Allie does is surprising. She somehow combines being naive and deeply rational, taking anything we take for granted, and tearing it apart to see what's inside. She's always like a child looking at something for the first time. The results are hilarious and heartbreaking. Like an acrobat, pulling dangerous tricks with her mind, she goes to places we would be afraid to go, all for the sake of our entertainment. There is brutal sincerity, brutal analysis, and a very accurate description of what it's like to be pseudo-intelligent and supposedly self-aware animals crawling planet Earth. (SPOILER!!!!!: Are we really any different from Simple Dog? And isn't she much happier?)
B009XIXVU6|5|Each chapter was a separate story that eventually intertwined with the others. Hosseini writes so well. Wish he could have gone into more detail with each of the characters.
B000FBJFSC|5|I don’t think anyone would describe Frank McCourt’s Angela’s Ashes, his account of growing up poor and starving in Ireland, as funny. Nevertheless, the many tragedies in his story are leavened by glimpses of humor. Near the beginning of his memoir, McCourt sets the scene in the following way:<br /><br />Out in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of Circumcision to New Year’s Eve. It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges…<br /><br />The rain drove us into the church–our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flower and candles.<br /><br />Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the rain. (1-2)<br /><br />We learn that it rains in LimerickLimerick, but Limerick is not just wet, it stays wet for eternity. The great sheets of rain drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick (emphasis added). We learned that the rain dampened the city from the Feast of Circumcision to New Year’s Eve. Not only does the detail of the ‘Feast of Circumcision’ sound humorous, but that sentence actually means that it stayed wet from January 1 to December 31. In the next sentence, McCourt takes things up a notch by providing us with a marvelous list of alliteration and onomatopoeia. Again, the details are compelling. We don’t just have a cacophony of coughs, which sounds clich&eacute;d, but a cacophony of hacking coughs. Just when you think this can’t possibly get any worse, McCourt tops that sentence with the next one: “It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges.” After a few more sentences (omitted for brevity), we learn that the rain drove everyone into church, it was “our refuge, our strength, our only dry place.” In this sentence, McCourt gives us a list which acts like a garden path sentence. It implies that it’s talking about one thing (the piety of the people of Limerick), when it’s actually talking about something else (their wish to get out of the rain). The next sentence gives us a marvelous image of all those people crowded into church in “great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone,” and this sets us up for the punch line at the end, that Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but “we knew it was only the rain.”<br /><br />And so the story begins with some humor, to ease the way for the tragedies that follow. I highly recommend this memoir. Five Stars.for brevity), we learn that the rain drove everyone into church, it was “our refuge, our strength, our only dry place.” In this sentence, McCourt gives us a list which acts like a garden path sentence.

B006LSZECO|5|I read this sometime ago and then my book club read it later, so I had to re-read.  I enjoyed it each time.  It definitely kept me engaged and gave our group a lot to think about and to discuss.
B00D2K40WY|4|It is fun but it sucks that you need to write a review to continue to receive free updates really?
1616615362|5|I love this game - I love the pieces - going to try to get my nieces and nephews playing since they love star wars too - this game reminds me of chess/checks with no standard moves
B001NLKT60|5|I found the first book very difficult to get started. It took me 4 attempts to get through the first 75 pages and get hooked. This book I couldn't wait to read after I finished the first one. I simply couldn't put it down. I am very happy I didn't read it when the third book wasn't out yet. The ending wasn't a &#34;book&#34; ending. It completely left you hanging as if you need to page turn for the next chapter. I couldn't believe that's how they ended it. Well, it sure did make me pay my next $9.99 for the next book in the trilogy! I guess for the publisher that ending works! If you enjoyed the first book, you will enjoy this one too.
B00004XPPK|5|This is by far one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. Rita Hayworth is delightful as Gilda. I was glad when it came out on DVD. It is a great movie for any collector of classic movies.
B003MC5N28|3|Meh. Maybe because I have read a lot of dystopia now? I just found this boring. And the ending stinks! But I didn't care even then what it meant. I am not the slightest interested in reading the next book. If it came to be for free I might try. I am again sad that I can't dance to everyone else's idea of fabulous, classic clucking. But guess I must sway to my own waltzes.
B00007FOMP|5|A must have
B004SIP98S|5|I had this in my collection previously, and it &#34;walked away&#34;  However, when you view this, it will be obvious why Helen Mirren won the Oscar for the best performance.  She is astounding,; even her appearance makes you believe you are seeing the actual queen.  The  supporting cast also does a yeoman job.
B009KS4XRO|5|Love this game
B0031YJFCQ|3|I enjoyed the two previous books a bit more. I believe the reason is that there were SO many characters in this book. It was a little hard to keep track of who was who at times. Especially since quite a few of the names were very very similar. Overall, the story was good, it just wasn't as much of a page turner as I expected.
B0053YGYO4|3|It is a CD that I have the pleasure of recommending to their fans but not for alguin who has never heard. Only two issues are that I like, others are not at the level of the old Coldplay.

B00F4386PY|4|This, to me, is Pearl Jam's weakest album.  It still has some great songs, but doesn't quite match up to their others.  Certainly, it's worth owning and don't skip out on it.  Just for fun:<br /><br />Pearl Jam's most under-rated albums:<br />Binaural (simply an awesome, atmospheric album) and Riot Act (don't know this is overlooked, but one of my favorites of theirs)<br /><br />Pearl Jam's most over-rated albums:<br />Backspacer (again, good but not great) and Ten (yes, Ten.  A very excellent album and starting point to a career, but these guys were just learning to play together and right songs at this time.)<br /><br />Album rankings:<br />Vitalogy (10)<br />Vs (9.9)<br />Yield (9.8)<br />Binaural (9.5)<br />Riot Act (9)<br />No Code (8.5)<br />Ten (8)<br />Lightning Bolt (might end up higher in retrospect) (8)<br />Avocado (8)<br />Backspacer (7.5)

B00005UOXL|5|New Wave may have been on the way in and punk may have been receding (for a bit) when Billy Idol released this, his solo debut album, but both gained new ground because of this album's release.<br />Those may sound like strong words for a solo album from someone that many either revile or revere.  But that is exactly the case.<br />Billy Idol announced his presence with a snarl.  He was no longer a pretty boy stuck in a punk band (Generation X), nor was he a pretty boy playing synthesizers ala Duran Duran (who would come later).  Billy Idol carved a niche for himself.<br />Today, many people consider his music to be hard rock rather than either punk or new wave.  And while that is probably a fair assessment, Billy Idol never rested on his laurels and gave us the same type of music for too long.<br />On this album, as I said before, his solo debut, Billy gives us the chart topper - White Wedding  - and a song from his former group (Generation X): Dancing with Myself.  These are only two of the great songs on this album, but they are the most easily recognizable by those not familiar with his music.<br />This album no doubt gained even more popular play and attention due to Billy's snarling good looks and the fact that it was released just as MTV was debuting, allowing the world to experience the visual experience of White Wedding.<br />Not all of this albums songs are &quot;hits&quot;, but none of them is bad.  Often gritty, and frequently obnoxious, &quot;Billy Idol&quot; is a music &quot;must have&quot; for anyone serious about ground breaking music.
B00DA6YEKS|5|Take care, this book will consume you. From page 300 on, you will find it nearly impossible to put down.
B00JDB4PEY|5|I'm a huge fan of Michael. For those that are also fans you won't be disappointed. I like every single track on the CD. I have every thing he has ever released and this is a bittersweet addition to my collection.
0156034026|5|Instead of dwelling on the plot points of this book, since there seems to be disagreement about what the author was conveying, please read this book because it is beautifully written.  The first person narrative is the best I've seen in a long time.  Not many authors would choose to write in this style.  If you enjoy a well-written book and have an open mind regarding the transformation of Changez, this is one you should not miss.
B00005N7Z1|5|In the near future dystopia of Detroit, in the wake of a crumbling society and an economic collapse, crime runs rampant and police officers are more disrespected than the cabbage patch in a STEP UP movie. A mega-corporation takes over law enforcement and ushers in the era of the mechanical constabulary. And, look, there's righteous cop Alex Murphy who, after getting shot up to bits by a cackling gang of goons, becomes the leading candidate in a groundbreaking experiment to build a peacekeeping cyber-entity that operates with perfect logic. The new Murphy: part man, part machine, all cop - aww yeahh.<br /><br />I love the 1987 ROBOCOP movie so hard I'm probably doing a disservice to the 2014 remake by not having the disposition to see it. Who knows, maybe the 2014 ROBOCOP is good. But the original rocked so damn hard and is embedded in my brain - along with ALIENS, THE TERMINATOR, and PREDATOR - as one of the most kickass sci-fi films in the 1980's. It's Peter Weller's best movie. It's director Paul Verhoeven's best movie - or at least tied with TOTAL RECALL. ROBOCOP is very much a movie of its own time - the 1980s - and yet it's relevant to this present day. The social satire still burns. The sheer corporate fukcery that unfolds onscreen is still topical today. The movie deserves its hard R rating with its exuberant show of profane language and gratuitous violence. And in this modern age of rampant CGI, it's just nice to hearken back to when the visual effects crew did their thing with practical effects. ROBOCOP packs in the squibs and the amazing stop-motion animation. Robocop's design is pure-ass genius, a blend of metallic sleek and bulk. There's a weight to him. There's iconic flair to the reverberating thuds of his footsteps and the 90º precision of his measured movements. And Robocop's martial theme song? Goosebumps, yo.<br /><br />Yes, Nancy Allen is resolute as Murphy's and, later, Robocop's partner and the only one to really have his back. Ronny Cox and Kurtwood Smith are at their most despicable (and that's a good thing). But Peter Weller anchors the hell out of this movie. It's astounding that he's able to convey emotional nuances despite that Robocop speaks in a monotone and that his mug is mostly obscured by a bulky head gear. But Weller makes Robocop readily sympathetic and his plight so arresting. The master stroke, of course, is that, come to find, vestiges of Murphy's humanity have survived his death. We note whiffs of it, manifested as random moments of intuition or spontaneity and, physically, as the occasional showing off with the cowboy pistol flourishes. And, last but not least, there's the film's dark, deranged sense of humor. ROBOCOP is a fount of awesome catch phrases. I bet there are folks out there who say &#34;I'd buy that for a dollar&#34; and have no inkling that they're quoting this movie. ROBOCOP as a movie is many things. It's a crime thriller and an over-the-top action blockbuster. It's a cautionary sci-fi dystopia. It's a superhero story for grown ups. It's a keen skewering of our society. It's a tragic and moving study of one man transcendence of death. Who would've thunk it that, when push comes to shove, Robocop turns out to be the most human of the lot? I'd buy that for a dollar.twood Smith are at their most despicable (and that's a good thing). But Peter Weller anchors the hell out of this movie.

B008NB0SQO|5|I love this movie!! Great deal and Fast shipping
B000HL2J0G|4|He does it all with a little bit of cheesy mixed in. Clean entertainment, with a bit of inventiveness for the whole family.  How can you not love MacGyver? Way back when, every kid wanted to be him.
B007PTJOV0|5|yeah its similar to Mario but still original in its own sense. one of the few games with touch screen controls that play surprisingly well
B005OCFHHK|5|If you're looking for a cost effective way to enjoy J.K. Rowling's famous tale of that lightning bolt scarred young wizard named Harry Potter in crystal clear Blu-Ray, then look no further!<br /><br />This Blu-Ray collection provides you with all 8 films conveniently located in 1 enclosure and is a MUST for any fan of Harry Potter that may not physically own the series yet. At the current price point of at the time of this review, each movie equates to approximately $8.00 which is an absolute steal for any fan of the series.<br /><br />Full disclosure, this is a no frills film collection. If you are interested in purchasing a &#34;collectors&#34; type of Harry Potter on Blu-Ray, you may want to look elsewhere. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with the presentation and packaging of this collection, it is not as elaborate and full of extras like some of the other Harry Potter film collections out there (though those are typically more expensive).<br /><br />However, if you are simply interested in adding the Harry Potter series to your Blu-Ray collection, this is a cost-effective way to do so.
B0091VU0FE|5|I love this movie. I also love Brendon Frasier. He seems to play a lot of goofy characters but he nails it in this movie. He does such a good job portraying how you would imagine someone would behave being separated from the world for 30 years and not have a clue with everything that has changed.
B005CRQ4GU|5|I thought it was a great idea to write this book.I love it,and it was the best book I ever read
B00FAPF5U0|1|This game is not worth my time to play. I got to the 30th level in no time and after that, I couldn't go any further without paying. There is no way to win unless you pay to go forward. When you get to this level, the game cheats. I had 3 cherries and 2 apples down and I hit one of the power balls and it erased what I had and ended the game.  I refuse to play it again.
B004T0E2S8|5|easy to use, has the songs that i want to learn how to play and they are easy to find
B00005JLIU|5|If you like silly movies, but don't really like visual humor, this is a better choice.  It's a great movie and you see more in it each time you watch.  I loved the way you get to see Julie Andrews' thoughts (as Millie) in little signs held up like the silent movie era.  Those of Chinese ancestry might not appreciate some of the humor, but you must remember this is a movie about the 1920's and the term politically correct had not been coined!  And it's so zany, there's really nothing  harmful in it.  Millie is a secretarial school graduate, determined to get a job and marry her boss.  The songs are outstanding and the casting was inspired.  Mary Tyler Moore plays a rich-girl-going-out-into-the-world to perfection and words can't describe Andrews as Millie (check out the opening song, where she buys a devise designed to make \\"full fronted\\" girls have the flat look that is in vogue.  As she buys a pack of cigarettes--we must be modern at all costs-- it comes undone and the vendor does a double take as her \\"front\\" expands quickly!)  Carol Channing is her usual crazy self as Muzzie, who has instructors teaching her everything from fighting to flying (with romance on the side!)and she does a great song about jazz.  This is a great movie!
B00005JPNZ|4|Harrison Ford is amazing in \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\".  His physical acting ability has always impressed me.  But now that he's much older than he was in the first film (difficult to believe the first film came out 27 years ago!), he astounds!  Sadly, I didn't detect the chemistry between Ford and Karen Allen that was present in \\"Raiders\\", but his scenes with Shia LaBoeuf were magical.  The story was fair, but true to the \\"Indy\\" franchise, the roller coaster began when the lights came up on the screen.  I absolutely LOVED how they incorporated the Paramount mountain into the opening sequence.  These are some very talented movie-makers.  I will own this DVD and watch it over and over, noticing something new each time, I'm sure.
B006AZZPCM|5|I have never written a review for an app before, but I felt compelled to do so for this app. I was able to start downloading videos right away, and now I don't need the internet for my son to watch his videos when we're on the road. The app is simple to use and the videos are easily accessable. The only issue that I have is that the resulting videos don't have any distinguishing file names that show up on my tablet. This could be an issue with the tablet that I haven't yet figured out (small price to pay for this awesome app). This app is definitely a must have for any parent with a tablet that doesn't have a data plan.
B00FB13Y74|5|did anyone have problems &quot;purchasing&quot; this game from amazon store?  we cant seem to get it on our kindle fire.
B00FEHXISA|5|Great!
B00LM9IBOU|2|Ace is definately not back. Loved his older stuff. Not one of his newer albums. Waste of money.....
B0047Y17P2|5|Excellent, as usual.  Connelly is always a good read--detailed without being repetitious, excellent story-line, just enough violent content to make it real but not gory or repelling.  He has very good character development.  Connelly also writes well grammatically and that helps it be a book which flows well.
1560100842|5|For anyone interested in animation this book is comprehensive and fun. Our grandson asked for it for his birthday after looking at it at our house.
B00004XONN|5|Wonderful, just wonderful.  Thom's voice is soaring and pummeling.  Subdued guitars, pianos and organs up front. Phil stepped up as drummer, Colin proves he is the best at bass.  This *is* the next level, by the time all of  the terrible guitar bands out there try to copy Radiohead (again), they'll already be on to something new.<br />I can't wait for the ep at Christmas and album 5 next spring...
B00127RAJY|5|This is a really great workout video. I like how they show modifications to some of the workouts on the dvd, which makes this dvd really great. It makes it easy for everyone to workout. I also like how there are three different levels of difficulty in it. All in all, this is a great workout video. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to lose weight.
B00DRPVE3M|1|So terrible they have taken a great card game and make you pay tokens which costs real money absolute garbage dont waste your time. Terrible job gameloft

B00COGY2P2|3|Nothing exceptional...being born in Pittsburgh it was nice to see my hometown on the big screen...but outside of that the movie was just average . It does move fast and is enjoyable but nothing really different . If you have read any of the Jack reacher novels you may feel that tom cruise was miscast...It is worth a watch

B00D7Z4GQY|5|THIS IS LITERALLY THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. This book is so crazy, so emotional and SO GOOD. I could NOT stop reading it. This author is a genius. The way she brings you through the different stories and different paths of these characters lives and yet twists and turns you with every twist and turn in the book is INCREDIBLE. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK! IT IS AMAZING!! IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!!!
B000RJO578|4|This is basically Shaun of the Dead for cop movies.  It nails all the tropes and pokes fun at them without ever being mean.  At the same time it is a good movie.
B003O86FMW|4|This was a good read but not as good as the first book The Hunger Games or the third book Mockingjay.
B002UZ5CHO|4|Very good, and while obviously it had a message, didn't have to distort any facts or make any logic leaps that seemed silly
B00AIQP9DE|5|It was great, as I've. come to expect from G5! Loved the mini game option when I got stuck in searches.
B000AJIF4E|5|Bought for my teenager as a holiday gift.  She wears them for hours a day and loves them.  She listens to a wide range of music including classical and jazz, and she praises these headphones above some of the other, more popular &#34;rap artist&#34; headphones because they are more balanced and accurate.  From my perspective, they seem fairly sturdy and they are priced quite reasonably when compared to the &#34;more popular&#34; headphones that seem to appeal to the eyes more than the ears.  Sony has made this model for a long time, and they stay in production for a reason.
1607747308|5|Excellent, practical, fresh perspective on taking charge of the things in your life so they don't take charge of you and your time. I am already putting it into practice.
B00JB3AOEY|5|Great Movie. Has a lot of depth.
0763644765|5|Our son loves this book. It's quick, simple and fun. Not saying this will work for everyone, but it did help us get our toddler to the next step with training.
B0017SWPXY|5|I enjoyed this book very much.  The story was very original and well written.  The fact that the dog was telling the story from his point of view was very brilliant and entertaining.  It had funny moments and sad moments but ended with a happy note.  Hard to put the book down.
B00J8CG6KE|3|Just thought was way over hyped.  Not that great.  If Wall Street is anything like this why would anyone invest.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I'm completely chocked!! What an amazing finale, I couldn't have thought in a better one! A bunch of people told me the final wasn't good, but I honestly thought it was awesome. The whole book is awesome, in fact. It's completely worth it!
B005ZOBNOI|5|iv`e never read a book that has affected me so much. Emotionally brutal, physically sick, completely in awe of Green, and how this book has a pulse. A lot of what i felt about my illness is ingrained in the pages. i cried until i couldn`t anymore. Every page is tear stained. Beautifully written and every character has resonated with me long after the last page.
B00RL9WRAE|5|Fun Movie
B005HEDI3K|5|Great television. Star Trek helped to set the standard for great sci-fi. Seeing these reminds me of why.
6301744136|5|This movie is a delight!  For years my husband has used the quote \\"Number 5 is alive.\\" What can be better than a good robot bringing together two kind humans.  My order arrived quickly and safely.  I would comfortably make purchases from this vendor.
B004I11VZA|5|I said it could be better because this Blu-ray only features 5.1 HD Surround Sound (NOT DTS-HD).    Original Language: Cantonese (Amazon list it as Mandarin Chinese).
B000093OUA|5|If you have only one Gary Moore CD, it should be this one.  It is all blues, but his rock/Hendrix influences explode all over the tracks.  The solo guitar work is phenomenal - soaring, lyrical, and moving.  I was especially impressed by the tightness of the rhythm section, a foundation without which the vocals and solo work might have much less effective and anchored.  I would have liked a little more solo Hammond organ, but what was there was incredible.  All in all, this is a CD you can listen to over and over and find something new to appreciate at each sitting.
055380457X|4|I have read the critics about the book and they seemed to praise the book so high or criticize badly. So here's my opinion...<br /><br />The book starts with the founders, Sergey and Larry, their personalities and how they came together in Stanford. It goes on explaining step by step how Google was established.  The working conditions, lunches, snacks, people, company culture is very well expressed in detail.<br /><br />For the ones who can read between the lines, there are also good management lessons. I will not say anything about them but rather leave those to the prospective readers to find out.<br /><br />If you want to try in your company what Larry & Sergey did in Google, think for yourself: Am I so smart as these guys? Personally I am not, and therefore \\"I will not try these at home\\".<br /><br />Some readers argue that Google is praised in the book, which I don't understand, because the book explains what has happened, not what someone had said. If quotes from the people are good, then can we conclude that the book praises Google, and serves as an advertisement?<br /><br />If you want to learn what two out-of-this-world-brains did, how they established a company like Google, I recommend this book. It is an easy, quick-to-read, enjoyable book.<br /><br />I deducted 1 star from the book because it's written as a series of newspaper articles rather than a book.
0393312836|5|Most people probaly only know about this book because of the Kubrick movie. This book is so my favorite book of all time. So involving, and I can't belive the original version didn't have the last chapter. Thank bog it does now.
0741470314|5|When there is so many negative things written and said about Michael Jackson, this book was a breath of fresh air.  If the world knew more about Michael, his charity work and natural goodness he may still be here today.  This is a very informative book about his great work and how the world is darker without him here.  Thank you Dr. Karen Moriarty for this positive book of the great Michael Jackson.
B001HN69B8|4|A good concept, Plus it got Heath Ledger. Definitely one of his better works. The story is quite far out, yet intriguing and logical.
B000AP04KQ|5|Its just a funny movie, everyday life gets boring and a crazy scam goes wrong and its epic must see!!!
B00ECU34ZM|3|Good movie
B00BHNQ5XK|4|There are so many films like 'Sinister' being churned out, it would be easy to dismiss it as one more by-the-numbers haunted house flick. It manages to succeed where 99% of them fail, however, creating a sense of menace that builds steadily, with genuinely frightening moments and a satisfyingly horrific conclusion. But it's got plenty of faults, too. You will have your intelligence insulted on several occasions, unless you're one of the microcephalic crowd any aspiring box-office conqueror is forced to pander to (since you're taking the time to read and research before viewing, I'll assume you aren't); there will be creepy children drawing creepy pictures and wearing creepy pancake makeup, and every scary moment will be artificially augmented with sudden explosions of noise and music. Whatever. Any horror fans out there, regardless how discriminating their tastes might be, will have made their peace with such compromises long ago. This is not a horror classic, by any means, but it has flashes of inspiration. If you start watching 'Sinister' looking to make fun of a horror flick, you won't have any problems finding material. But if you go into it with your critical voice on 'mute', it's solid entertainment. My suggestion for anyone who fears they will be way too smart to enjoy 'Sinister', but are still going to watch it for some weird, sinister reason, is to get really drunk. If that option seems too extreme, try Quaaludes, barbiturates, or some other rarely prescribed drug that rock stars of the 1960's liked to kill themselves with. {NOTE: I'm obviously joking about the Quaaludes and whatnot, I just like the fontifical beauty of the name 'Quaaludes'. Try something safe instead, like Heroin).<br /><br />True-crime writer Ellison Oswalt moves his unsuspecting family into a house that was the scene of a quadruple homicide, hoping to recharge his fading literary career. As they're moving in, he discovers a box in the attic that shouldn't be there. It contains a Super-8 film projector and several tins of reel-to-reel footage. Each film has a banal home movie title like 'Hanging Out', 'Family BBQ' or 'Pool Party', but contains footage of a family being murdered by the camera-man. Regardless what your feelings are about 'The Ring' (and the Japanese original, Ringu), the deadly videotape that was so central to the plot had to be deeply disturbing, and it was; similarly, there is an eerie, unnatural quality to every frame of Super-8 film in 'Sinister', and every time he turns on the projector, it inspires an anxious excitement. Like 'The Ring', a lot of the unease can be attributed to the soundtrack that accompanies the film; but while VHS tapes have sound, Super-8 does not.<br /><br />Oswalt makes the decision to keep this discovery to himself; considering the fact that this means with-holding apparently vital evidence relating to a series of multiple homicides, this seems like a really bad idea. Ethan Hawke does an excellent job of making Oswalt believable and sympathetic, despite the terrible choices he makes at every critical juncture... the first one being to move into the house where an entire family was killed, without telling his wife. I didn't really buy the notion of a wife who lets her husband choose when and where they move, even letting him pick out the house - especially when he has a history of selecting prior homes based on their proximity to the grisly crime he's investigating. If Stephen King has taught us anything -- and in most cases he probably hasn't -- it's that when you're dealing with a thoroughly fictitious demon/deity that eats children, you need to make the human drama believable. {Also, it's a small detail, but the attic doesn't match the house; it belongs to a house with a roof that has gable ends, instead of the cottage-ends the exterior shots depict. And while I don't know Pennsylvania well, I'm fairly certain it has cold winters, making the apparent absence of insulation ill-advised; there doesn't evenseem to be a thin layer in the ceiling, between the trusses and under the ancient-looking attic floor-boards. Whatever.}<br /><br />The protagonist doesn't believe in the supernatural, which is fine, neither do I; still, after the third or fourth inexplicable and terrifying event, I'd have to make a serious reappraisal of my beliefs or my sanity. But Oswalt's determination to redeem his literary reputation with something as powerful as his first celebrated work of non-fiction pushes him to extremes. His version of Truman Capote's `In Cold Blood' or Norman Mailer's `The Executioner's Song' -- `Kentucky Blood' -- established him as a minor star, dedicated to exposing injustice. His subsequent work, however, resulted in controversy and negative publicity after a killer went free (likely inspired by Mailer's own experiences; he was instrumental in convincing a parole board to release a talented inmate with a violent history, and was held accountable by many when this parolee killed again).<br /><br />Even though the reels were found together, the crime scenes contain the same cryptic symbols, and the films were all apparently made by the same person or people, a great deal of time has elapsed between each incident, with the first dating back to the sixties, and the last one in 2011. As the proof keeps piling up that a supernatural entity is behind the killings, and that his own family might be the next link in the chain, Ellison doesn't get worried enough, given the crazy crap he's witnessed. There are plenty of ominous clues that don't bode well for the Oswalt's: in all of the murders, one child escapes the carnage, but disappears; their son has a habit of doing extremely creepy s**t while sleeping, like crawling into a cardboard box and then moaning, his eyes glazed over like a corpse; their daughter likes to draw on the walls, and whenever a kid picks up a crayon in a horror movie, it's never good.<br /><br />`Sinister' is not unique or original... in any way, really. It's predictable at times, and unconvincing at others. But it's also one of the most genuinely unsettling horror films I've seen in the last couple years, alongside standouts in mainstream supernatural suspense like `The Ring' (you could call `Sinister' a cross between `The Ring' and `1408'), `The Grudge', and `Paranormal Activity 3' (I wasn't that big a fan of the original, the second was tedious, but `PA3' was great). In the hands of another director, with a different cast, `Sinister' could have been a completely mediocre and forgettable film. It's got the creepy kids, creepy Crayola drawings featuring creepy imaginary friends, ghostly photographs, and the obligatory `Google-search' scene (which has replaced the `Library-search' scene, with dusty, leather-bound tomes of occult lore and micro-fiche archives of decades-old newspaper articles about murders and suicides). But all the tricks and tropes that misfire in other films successfully ignite in `Sinister'. Even as I was shaking my head at the silliness or familiarity, I would suddenly forget my misgivings, thanks to the overwhelmingly disturbing atmosphere. And the booze, of course.

B00OAKTEIU|5|Great album, they stepped it up
B00BEZTMFY|5|I had initially given this movie a lower rating.  I have to say that when I saw this film in the theatre, I was underwhelmed as compared to the previous LotR trilogy.  I felt Peter Jackson was over reaching in an attempt to make The Hobbit too much like the earlier movies, and I still maintain that it was an error to deviate so much so from the book.  It was just unnecessary to add a large, ogreish gray orc, Lurtz wannabe.  Having said that, I gave the movie a fresh look, knowing how much I was originally disappointed, and I have to say that it allowed me to appreciate its finer points to a far greater extent.  From the arrival of the dwarves and their mournful ode to the Misty Mountains, to the cave trolls, to the interplay between Bilbo and Gollum and their exchange of riddles, that each of them were truly masterful, and I have been finally wooed.  I now wait with anticipation for part II, and the extended version of an Unexpected Journey coming soon.  Many kind regards Peter Jackson,
B00D6SBOWG|5|Can't stop playing it . It's addictive .cant get enough of it. I can play it 24/7.<br /> Love it lots.
B004YM6JLO|5|When the shows on TV are just not what I want them to be I pull out my DVD of the Vampire Diaries and watch them. Great entertainment.
B00L9B7IKE|5|At first, the detailed first-person writing style sucked me in. But then it wasn't picking up speed, just felt depressing reading how out of control Rachel's addictions were, but then I tried some more and it finally gained traction and before I knew it, I couldn't put it down. By the end, I was hiding from my family so I could finish it without interruption :). I haven't read a book this engrossing....and so incredibly spot-on with personality motivations and actions...in quite a while. Highly recommend it...to those who are struggling, those who are causing others to struggle, and those who need to recognize the dangers of both.
1476770387|5|Very intriguing how Mr. King delves into the human mystic.
B005GFPZYK|5|Great book and interesting insider knowledge to the Navy Sniper's life and training!<br /><br />I want to read more tom this author!
B008QZ1ZYQ|5|This is a straightforward but challenging game. All you have to do is save the bugs from the spiders by cutting the web in strategic places. It's kind of a cross between Cut the Rope and a maze puzzle. I particularly like the fact that this is purely a game of strategy and you're not under any time pressure. I'm not exactly sure how the stars are awarded though - maybe that's based on time - but I don't know. Sometimes you get a \\"better than three stars\\" rating and receive coins as an award. You can use the coins for hints - which are more than hints because they pretty much solve the puzzle for you so I don't use them unless I really get stuck.<br /><br />You also earn achievements. When you go to the achievement page, make sure you scroll down to see all of them. I didn't realize at first that there were more than the two \\"bookshelves\\".<br /><br />I downloaded this game this morning and have been totally addicted. If you like strategy puzzles with cute graphics, don't miss out on this FAOTD.
B008CP93S0|5|Only rented it. Should have bought it... So hilarious! I love paul rudd!
B00EQNYOYU|5|I'm not good with details when describing music. But the vocals are on point. I love the rock/electronica/ drum n bass aspect. Everything blends together so well. The music just sounds great. Rock is still dead, but this has to be the best rock album to come out in the past 7/ 8 years I would think. If you like hard music this is for you.  Nine inch nails is definitely back with this album. When you can listen to an album straight through you know it's dam good. And I haven't done that in ages. I'm always picking what singles to download because most music is terrible on most albums. This is not, it's worth the price. Buy it you won't be disappointed.
B00BAXFECK|4|Very entertaining journey of a young man stumbling through a colorful life, tethered to a piece of art and the terrible moment that united him with it.
B005LAJ17M|5|I haven't even opened it, so I don't know anything about any special features of the disc. I just love the show! It's no secret why it wins awards. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a thriller. I just can't wait for season 3 to start on TV!
B00A8ECU24|4|First it's a great game.  It's fun and is good if you need to waste time.  What's bad is that you can accidentally buy more land, which is annoying if it cost 50,000 bits like on mine.  You can also accidentally hit a parasite and lose a shard you were saving up.  Last(you only have to read if playing on a kindle fire, I don't blame Gameloft but I do blame Amazon)I was deleting items from my carousel which doesn't delete things from the device, and got to knowing where the butten was.  I got to mlp gameloft and the little bubble the bitten was in moved higher pushing remove from carousel up and also remove from device, before I new it my finger hit remove from device, it didn't even have anything to make sure you wanted to delete it! I had the whole main six , about a million bits, a lot of the shops, 4 of the things you use shards on and most of Ponyville.  I reinstalled hopeing it was like the annoying games where you mess up and try deleting and reinstalling to delete the progress but doesn't, unfortunately it wasn't.  I recommend this game but be careful about deleting by mistake.
B004QL7K6G|5|One of the funnest movies to watch.  Excellent actors and this sold at a great price.  Came in quickly.  Bought another one for my friend.  A perfect solution to a boring Friday night
B005LJETYI|4|If you had to live a couple of days over and over again, would you want it to be the some of the worst ones of your life? This is the story of a solider who is stuck in a loop that always starts over when he dies in the same battle. He keeps trying to change this outcome and training to become a better solider, but nothing is changing. He knows the key may lie with Rita, another solider who tried to save him during the first time through.<br /><br />This was a really unique take on something that is seen in movies and books occasionally. I read this because I was excited for the movie coming up. I hope the movie can do the book justice.
B001KP2J3U|5|I love Peter Ustinov in these series. I wish I could get all of them on videos.<br />They are so much fun to watch.
B00E8KLWB4|4|If you like games of strategy this is for you. There are lots of hidden picture puzzles. You can move ahead without spending money which I like. When you complete certain tasks it opens up new pictures and puzzles to solve. The amount of energy you receive increases as you progress. You have to be patient if you want to play without spending money.
B0054JZC6E|4|101-in-1 Games is a fun way to kill time and relax. With many games so you never get bored. It keeps you challenged enough to make you want to continue playing!
B00I8Q77Y0|4|This game is a good game it good because it is like the game flappy bird. I like this game.
076781326X|5|All the other version completely lack the absolute range of emotion and experience that this movie delivers. I still forget the it was a musical! The weight of the drama, the humor, the adventure perfectly engages you the entire time. Who cares about special effects, it's the expert story telling of the director combined with simply good character of all the actors.
B00GT67UUM|5|I've had this game from another market (several markets actually) and I really like this game, it's challenging and it has a steampunk look.
B009LMTDL0|4|Great personal stories that can be inspiring or that you can recognize yourself into. A few nice tips to negotiate without feeling its unfair you can't do it like men do
078681859X|5|This book is now one of favorites, and I look forward to the next two books.  The book mixes humorous and dark, and the fact that Nathaniel isn't a perfect character - his motive throughout the book is revenge, and as the djnni Batimaeus points out, guilt as well, makes the story stand out from other young adult novels.
B005RAO0GS|5|This is a great album. I especially like ONLY IF FOR A NIGHT. I think this is a great follow-up album to LUNGS, and I definitely recommend it.
B000PTYP84|4|The extra CD comes with lots of features which is good. I was a bit disappointed with the videos that come with the mvi disc because I felt they were too short and that they jus wasn't enough. But the downloadable content makes up for this I guess. Although if you have downloaded content onto the mvi disc note that you wont be able to play them on a TV if you use the mvi disc as a DVD.     Overall a good product though.
B00BATG18K|4|I did find the book interesting in exploring the courtesan life during periods of political upheaval.  In parts it was too detailed and I could rush through them as I desired.  Spanning over many years the stories of mother and daughter and their lives together and apart were woven throughout the book.
B00F30S0Y0|4|I really wanted not to like it. But &#34;Reflecktor&#34; is a great song. Far better than the off-putting performance by the band on SNL.  &#34;Normal Person&#34; harkens back to the glory days of Roxy Music.  &#34;Awful Sound&#34; is more in line with the what you'd expect from AF, while &#34;Porno&#34; sounds like Moby with purpose.  Good stuff.  I really wanted to hate it, but I can't.
B001TODOCM|5|Took it with me on a cruise and it started out really slow to feed you all the facts.  Then it got better and better enough so that I didn't even go on deck at night.  First to supper, then to bed to read and hope all the puzzles got solved.!  A really great book that made me want to read more about Alexander Dumas, himself.
B0086700CM|5|I absolutely love this game. The best continuous running game I have ever played. Would recommend this to everyone. Can't wait for a part two.
B00COLCTQ6|5|Legos are the perfect toy for grandsons.  They always work, aren't delicate, and provide opportunity for amazing creativity.  What the package says is inside is always correct and after the boxed item is built and the child becomes bored with it, they can take it apart to create something of their on design.  Four grandsons and 10 years later I've bought A LOT of Legos even some to keep at Grandma's house.
B007WPM7SO|3|The cinematography and score for this movie are beautiful.  They do a great job of capturing the beauty of pre-war France, as well as the horrible conditions of the war.  However, the story itself leaves much to be desired.  The character development that we would have received in the novel is missing completely.
B000089A07|4|Red Dragon should be remembered in the Hannibal Lector series for being the one of the three most accurately translated from novel to theaters. Aside from following the book well, it is still a decent movie! Whereas the novel is a very tedious read due to its overtechnical attempt at clocking the forensics of a crime scene, The movie manages to capture an amazing story. The way this movie was filmed gives it an increadibly nightmarish feel. It moves fast in all the right ways, touching briefly on the forensics and delving in depth into the mind games and plots of his horror genre majesty Hannibal Lector. For a blast from the past you may also want to examine &quot;Manhunter&quot; the origional version of this movie featuring a great actor: Brian Cox (Supertroopers, LIE...) in the role of Hannibal.
B00AMBLXP8|5|Its a very nice balance of clever and fart jokes. Super funny! However it is weird hearing Peter Griffin's voice coming out of something so cute.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|I thought that this movie was very entertaining.  Clever way of tieing the villain to the old Star Trek movie franchise.
B005RUUUAI|5|What more can be said? This is the best Living Dead Series ever!!! Well worth the money and time to watch this series.
B00F56AZK4|5|I love puzzles this is a great app. I fully recommend it. For hours and hours of fun. This is the app for you.
B00GH75V1S|3|It was ok
B0099114WO|5|This one is a great chick flick, husbands really need to watch this one! This is great for us wives that our husbands kind of ignore......
B006YGC7KK|5|Just fantastic. Easily Five Stars...... I just started watching this at a day I was tired after work and were bored to go out... at the end I got so hooked into it. Recently I purchased it from Amazon, even I have finished watching the whole First Season on Netfilx. I meant the season One... and now I just per-ordered the second season of it too. It is going to be in my Blu-ray Collection.
0380973464|5|This is an incredibly absorbing book in the tradition of Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum,&quot; only better plotted and less dry than Eco's work. Stephenson must have a deep background with computers; it's  hard to imagine how he could write an such a convincing insider's view of  information systems and cryptanalysis otherwise. Even at 900+ pages, it's a  gripping read. Half the fun is just trying to figure out how the different  storylines relate to each other.<br />I do fault the book for an insufficient  climax. The ending is fun, but feels fairly tacked-on. As a friend of mine  put it, &quot;this book keeps a high level of tension all the way to the  end--and then it just ends!&quot; The plot never drops, but neither does it  pick up.<br />Fans of Stephenson's earlier works may find Cryptonomicon's  world less imaginative than the futuristic mileus of &quot;The Diamond  Age&quot; or &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; but such is the danger of writing  historical fiction. To his credit, Stephenson makes the 1940s just as  interesting as the 2140s. This is a must read.
B004ZNB12O|5|REALLY THE ONLY PINK FLOYD A PERSON NEEDS IN YOUR COLLECTION
B00IDI8KLC|5|Everything is awesome
B00BJA2VFW|4|Good game to play.
158270208X|5|I purchased the Secret Gratitude Book for gifts and everyone that received the gift were very appreciated and anxious to start to use the book.
1451662440|5|The most influential book you're most likely to read. It's absolutely mind blowing how on man achieved so much on so many platforms. Inspirational. I've even included a picture of me reading this piece of history in Vegas. Vegas baby! I love you Arnold x
B001706I5I|5|Classic
B000JJS8TM|5|I have had this for a few weeks and I have not had time to give it a listen. I am a fifty something who, like all of us, grew up with The Beatles.  I wasn't impressed when I did listen on my computer speakers (a decent pair).  Today I listened to it with my Sennheiser PX 100's (35 bucks on Amazon ..... great headphones for 3 times the price) and this is a pretty good record,   It is no where near as choppy as I has heard that it was and pays great respect to the original music.   There is a beautiful acoustic version (with full orchestra of course) of \\" While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" that is worth the cost of the record.  This record is great.  Listen to it.
B000W7JWUA|5|The Settlers of Catan opened me and a number of my friends and family to a game that is easy to learn as monopoly or risk but ten times more enjoyable.   I had not been willing to play anything but card games for years.  This game incorporates strategy, chance, and negotiating skills (you must convince your opponents to trade resources with you even though it may mean that you will win the game).  The initial game only allows 3-4 players so most people will want to purchase the expansion pack which allows up to 6.  However, the 3-4 person games are usually shorter, allowing time for more than one game.  When teaching new players the game may take several hours to finish, especially as the number of players grows.  The game indicates that the age range is 10 and up.  I think this is about right.  We taught it to our 10 year old niece and she won the game.  Our 8 year old nephew needed to be teamed up with an adult (he loves playing the game though).  Once everyone gets the hang of the rules, a game can finish in an hour.  Definitely a great addition to low key, small group social gatherings.
B00G15MDI0|5|Our whole family enjoyed this movie. The acting is wonderful, the story is great, and the whole family can watch it. The story is very touching. A++++
B000I2JDEY|5|Wow!! This film has stood the test of time,and, even in this time, its still provocative!! E
B00P9TTSK0|5|The graphics are better than I expected and the game play is very smooth.  It plays like a disk based game. Very entertaining.
B005IQZB14|5|The book was very moving and I found it very hard to lay down.  Each of us can connect with her journey, both emotionally and physically, in our own ways, and all readers can find a little bit of her in us all.  Her writing style allows the reader to engage in her experiences, step by step.  I highly recommend this book to all young people who feel their challenges are defeating them...
B009JBWOU0|5|Quite good movie quality but only supports America and Canadian region dvd players. The book was quite cool to look in but was somewhat small. All in all it's a good product
B002MQYOFW|5|The book starts out with a good introduction to the main characters and paints a good picture of how they are living. Does not take before it is hard to put down. It gives the reader a view of what it is like to be at the bottom of society. shows that people still have the drive to endure and make the best of whatever life has handed them.
B00BUCXVPI|3|It takes more than one movie to understand the Jack Reacher character but at least they didn't lose sight.  The only issue I really have is that the Jack Reacher character is a much larger/taller individual than Tom Cruise and that takes a little away from the story.<br /><br />Overall I liked the movie and some of the other stories would also make good movies.
B0027BOL4G|4|Really informative and enjoyable.  Things that we all should know and be aware of.  This combined with a little research of your own should prove extremely important to the push you may need to make a lifestyle change.    Wasn't quite what I expected but certainly didn't disappoint.  Good movie that everyone needs to see at least one time.
B00FB13Y74|4|Fun game!!
B001XUIBNO|4|Great mystery! A good &#34;who done it&#34;.  Fun to see Dunaway and Nicholson in their younger days, in an original movie.
B00APUYWYA|4|The dialogue between the two competition hosts is the best part of the movie. The singing is good, but it is of course over the top as you would expect a movie directed mostly at teens would be. The cup song scene has already become a pop culture phenomenon, as it deserves to be. Not sure why they picked the lead actor- he seems way overshadowed by the female cast members.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Very simple and challenging.  Always looking to get to the next level.  Trying to figure best approach is always fun
B000NVIXFK|4|Far Cry & Armor & Sword are good introductions to the album.  I didn't think this was too much of a departure from their original sound.  I know the producer stated that it would be a return to their 70's efforts, but this album sounded like business as usual for the trio.  Counterparts was a huge departure for them when they leaned toward \\"Power Trio\\"-type music (doing away with keys/synth).  Bands like Judas Priest & Iron Maiden have retained their overall sound... more like feel for their roots in music with little shifts/changes over time, which is what is happening here.  They didn't take a left turn & do a Megadeth or Rod Stewart album.  They simply stayed their course with a detour here & there to do some musical \\"sight-seeing\\".  This album isn't 2112 or Moving Pictures, but it wasn't meant to be.  It's the same quality product that will work itself nicely into the band's set lists in concert.
B009LQKHIO|5|This was wonderful written book. It felt as if I was involved in the story from the first page right through the last.  A warm and loving story romance story.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|Seems pretty similar to flappy bird. It is pretty cool. I like to play it and my younger brothers love to play it and its an over all pretty good game.
B000003TAW|5|terrific songs like \\"buddy holly\\" and other hits define this album as a classic.  They are a really good band, and if you want one cd of theirs, get this one.  There is a great \\"vibe\\" (I hate that word) about it, making it a classic cd for anyone and everyone.  These guys know how to rock, thats all I have to say.  I am occasionally a little put off by the emo-type complaining on some songs (I hate emo music a LOT) but these guys make it work by making good arrangements that don't emphasize dumbness.  A very worthwhile cd.
B007OLYQ4E|5|good literature, real classic!!
B00PSLQGX6|5|great
B00EY8A6BC|4|It was a great movie, but not a  very high replay value once you know how the movie turns out.
0345529057|5|Great books from a great author. I read these bboks on break at work and they definetly make the time go by would definetly recommend these to fellow fantasy lovers.
B000G2YD3C|5|Pure Reason Revolution has created a work of progressive beauty.  The challenge of taking progressive music to another place succeeds so well here.  Many folks have this one very high on the best releases of the year so far and it is easy to see why.  Not as dark as Riverside's great \\"Second Life Syndrome\\", \\"The Dark Third\\" contains beautiful music for those who love gorgeous female vocals in a progressive context. The vocals and harmonies are thrilling and fit very well with each song's textures and layers. The counterplay of the vocalist also works so well. The playing is stellar. With each listen you hear some wonderfully placed slide guitar, violin and piano within the cleverly crafted musical themes.  No weak links here.  \\"The Dark Third\\" is thrilling.  PPR has made a major statement with this recording.  Outstanding.
B00AGE20ZI|5|Love the movie--- love the end.  I think it is one of Cary Grant's best, and that is saying a lot!  Right up there with A Christmas Carol for Christmas holiday favorites.
B006LSZECO|1|I don't know why I finished this book.  The F word turned me off at first (I never repeat books by authors who use it a lot) and then the filthy language only got worse.  I kept thinking the story would get better being it was on the Best Seller for so long.  Wrong! This was probably the worst book I ever read. I am embarassed to have finished it.
B000003CMB|5|Just how good is this ????????<br />Ranks with the best live albums because it is & deserves to .<br />Amen .
B0083Z614S|5|I purchased this free book for my 10 year old daughter's Kindle. She has read the book in school and loves this classic story. I am thrilled to be able to get classics like this for free for her to read.
1442419814|5|The Pretties is a great book and makes your view of the American Society change to something better.  I loved it.
B008WCP2PG|3|Not a full screen movie.  Movie was just a run of the mill ...nothing spectacular.  My neighbors enjoyed it. Thanks!
B000EMH94Y|5|Love her style and voice. Great CD with a message believe it or not. She's a brilliant and talented artist. I support her 100% would recommend to anyone.
B007N6NGYG|2|Too many permissions, unresponsive, but fun when it finally decides to work.  I have another app like this that is better without the permissions.
B007FEFLTO|4|Overall, I felt the book was good and I enjoyed seeing how my favorites from the last book (Fall of Giants) interacted with their next generation.<br /><br />I had thought to see more detail on The Jewish Holocaust and the Internment of Japanese citizens into \\"concentration camps\\", but I learned more about the Nazi program euthanize the \\"useless mouths\\" of handicapped and elderly through Aktion T4 and the details of the Spanish Civil War.  It seems he covered in more detail the issues that were not as \\"main stream\\" in history.<br /><br />The main theme of the book was human relations in the face of inescapable politics; be it the Nazi regime, the overall mind set of the British Parliament or the isolationist view of the United States, so the details are in the characters and their reactions to events in history, instead of a \\"play by play\\" of events that you get with some writers.  I agree with another reviewer that I thought some of the situations just seemed a little too convenient for story telling (Woody's brother Chuck joining the Navy and being stationed at Pearl Harbor, etc..).  But it is line with his other books.  Stranger things have happened in history.<br /><br />Overall it was entertaining and educational.<br /><br />I am looking forward to book III.  I read this one in about 10 days.  A real page turner!
B00A0NOF7G|3|it would have benefited greatly from a little proofreading. The rampant misuse of commas and apostrophes drove me nuts (yeah, I'm a little weird like that), and there were several occasions where the wrong word was used in place of one that sounded like it. Good thing the characters were interesting or I wouldn't have been able to force myself to finish it.
B00SH04286|5|I love Lucy, and you should too!  I particularly enjoyed the director's decision to cut scenes of wild predators into it. Made perfect sense to me, and I only had to use a quarter of my brain, if that.
B0034DGPEU|5|I couldn't put the Kitchen House down! It kept me engaged from the first page until the last; written similarly to The Help, it was brilliant.
B000WCDI5K|5|By all, I mean me and my two kids. I am 66 and first purchase was Be Bop A Lula by Gene Vincent and that is a good enough measure of me, my daughter is 35 and still enjoys the Doors, my son is 24 and Mark E. Smith's The Fall is the best band in the world - whatever its personnel consists of at any given time. I tell you this because if Sawdust is acceptable to the three of us it should go down well with the majority. Most of all, the band members are a tight team rather each performing a little bit apart from the rest. Distinctive enough to stand out from the here today, gone tonight rubbish ensembles - the CD is well worth my money.
B005VPRET4|5|LEGO Friends City Park Cafe 3061<br />We love so many of the Lego Friends sets and this one like others we have bought has not let us down.<br />It is so easy to put together the directions are clear and I really like how they keep the stages in different bags<br />unlike many years ago just seems like the kids do better with being able to put them together without as much frustration.<br />This set includes both  Andrea and Marie which is nice when getting two minifigs in a set.<br />It does have lots of little pieces/accessories that are not really bricks like the frying pan, mixer, baking items and more<br />which makes it even more fun for the kids when they are playing with it.
B0052UZIFA|5|I have this addicting game for every console I own. extremely hard to put down. love the achievements and crazies shop &hearts;
B004UXUX4Q|5|Combine this screenplay with this cast and you have an excellent piece. George Clooney, in one of his best roles, leads. He's excellent in the part.<br />Rather than an \\"In your face\\" plot, this is very subtle, quiet, and attention grabbing.<br />George is trying to survive one tribulation after another. He's joined by his 17 & 10 year old daughters. The plot is serious, yet touching. It's comical in spots in a tongue in cheek way.<br /><br />The movie shows us various parts of the human psyche. The ability to deal with the unexpected surprises life throws our way. It's not your typical tear jerker which has been done forever. This is fresh, different, and so well done. The story of a man & his family doing the right thing in the face of adversity, including a great deal of anger & anguish.<br /><br />The main, as well as the supporting cast, seem to stay completely focused making this a touching \\"Must see\\"
081298160X|5|GREAT insight into what drives each of us. The more I think about habits, the more I see how I can apply the power of controlling may habits to change my life. This can also better help me understand others.<br /><br />Recommend this book for anyone who wants to better understand themselves or other people.
B0090P98Z4|4|I've tried several dungeon crawlers for kindle and this is one of the best series I've tried
1455526959|5|Can't go wrong with Michael Connelly and his character (Harry Bosch).  I read as many as I can, never disappointed with his writing, These books never seem to be too &#34;gory&#34; and that is fine with me.  Usually difficult to put it down once you start reading.
0345522303|5|Lynn is a great writer she is one of my favorite writers her novels are always fresh and new and the characters are always interesting.  I like the way she is not afraid to kill some of her characters off.  She is amazing!!
B00BAXFECK|5|I am not a writer, so I can only review this with cliche phrases. &#34;Tour de force&#34; comes to mind, as well as &#34;deeply resonates&#34;, &#34;beautifully written&#34; &#34;gorgeous use of language&#34; 'surprising plot twists&#34; &#34;original charachters&#34;.<br />I never wanted to leave the world of this book, although I had to put it down twice because of the intensity.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good fun game that keeps you alert but bit slow sometimes on kindle no need to buy any items if you're prepared to wait
1401323820|5|If you are a fan of the TV series, the book is wonderful.  All the subtleties, the \\"glances\\", \\"hints\\", \\"meaningful looks\\", the \\"double meanings\\" come across perfectly.      If you like the series, you will like the book.  My only disappointment is that Castle's other books aren't available.  \\"Written by Castle\\", with credit mentions of his mother and daughter, is a fine touch.    About romance between his character Rook (the chess piece that looks like a Castle) and the detective Nikki Heat, well you must read the book to find out.    A fast, fun read.  I recommend it.
B00P9TTSK0|5|You should get this game it's so FUN!!!!! There's bunch of guns! And missions and bosses So FUN ;)&eth;&eth;&eth;&eth;&eth;
B0050SYS5A|5|Excelente producto
B008Z9YGEE|3|For anyone that read the book, this movie was enjoyable but not great.  I would have liked to have seen certain things not be changed. (SPOILER ALERT) removing the character of the Mayor and the Mayor's Daughter was in my opinion a mistake.  having the pin come from there and the underlying meaning of the pin were important to me when I read the book and they were overlooked completely in the movie.  Action scenes were quite good and we did enjoy the movie.
B004ZZS4CC|5|Excellent account, and heartbreaking.  It ends with such a sense of personal victory and empowerment.  Nice to see someone reclaiming her life after being made a victim for too long.
B007ZGO7EM|5|I think this is a great app, it's easy to use and most of all it's free!!!! :) I have this app and the fraction calculator app, and I love both!
0887307280|2|Great concepts, principles, approach for making your small business successful. Too bad it's all buried in a lengthy dialogue with a friend called Sarah, who nearly collapsed under the burden of building a pie baking business. Of course there's a happy ending where Sarah \\"gets it\\" and lives happily ever after.
B00FATEJYE|5|This game is very good but the update could be better because they changed the game. But it's still fun
B00I3ULVLQ|5|Perfect fit.  Slim and clear...barely know it it there.
0783231032|5|Well, not everyones taste, if you in for the real MAD and UNBOUND Humor, social not so correct, you will have the time of your life. Its a 2 Hour rollercoasterride, Way better than it rep. and a real good cure after been lobotomized by the movie formerly known as Pearl Harbor.  <br /> <br />If your in for the so called \\"Real Hero\\" Movie Stuff, well try something else. For me Spielbergs best Movie,his only with Belushi, Lee and Pickens.  <br /> <br />Hope they have the Making of, running time over 100 Min and nearly as funny as the movie, on the Disc.
B00AKO93JK|3|Purchased for my droid RAZR and there's only video for less than half the exercises?! I've been able to use individual workout apps, but this one doesn't even work! :l
0312243022|3|I found myself a little disappointed with this widely acclaimed piece of literature.  There is no doubt in my mind that the writing style and meticulous detailed writing of Mr. Cunningham is exquisite, but as far as  the plot was concerned, I was left wanting much more than what was given.   Having read virtually everything by Virginia Woolf, I was impressed by his  portrayal of her character, but the intertwining of the others that was so  strongly applauded by critics did not entirely put me in a state of awe.   The novel, as many of the reviewers pointed out, presented the flaws of  humankind, but it did not make me care one ounce about the outcome of any  of the people involved.  I was left with a lackluster feeling of something  that was unfinished, when I had anticipated some sort of epiphany, judging  by the acclaim the book has received.
B000002JR8|5|god dam* will they ever make a cd that doesnt kick as*
0385486804|4|This book was pretty good. I didn't like Chris/Alexander for a while but then you get to know him. He had some interesting experiences as he was hitchhiking through America. I realized he was a bad person when he lived in a city in South Dakota and he was crying as he was leaving the people who let him stay with them. Chris was just a person with a flaws. For example, as a kid he hated the idea of money but was amazing at making it. Also when he was in high school or college (don't remember) he would spend his free time talking to hookers and homeless people. It just shows that there are a lot different people out there.
B00ANQMZOK|5|Excellent, glad I got it over Live at Leeds
B00I8H6MGS|5|The actors were wonderful.  Matthew McConaughey was Amazing.  I definitely can see him winning lots of awards for this film.,  It brought a lot of insight into the illness.  This is an illness just like cancer or lupus.  People need to really research and get the facts about what you don't understand.
B0029LCJJS|4|Great show but don't watch it if you're looking for historical accuracy or if you are shy about the many, many sex scenes.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|I always wondered what Christian was thinking and now I know. And it is \\"More\\" than I could have imagined. A perfect companion to Fifty Shades of Grey in Ana's POV.  This story was not a disappointment at all for me, I loved it and want more. I hope E.L. James will write Christian's POV for Darker and Freed.
B007EDYN36|1|It is not all the trials and tribulations Peter went through that make this a pathetically sad tale, it is the fact that he seldom, if ever, accepts any responsibility for what he has gone through.  Constantly pointing a finger and assigning blame.  That is the saddest part of all.
B000GIWS7E|5|With each new live DVD from DT I have wondered how they can maintain the momentum, excitement and interest. This brief review outlines why I believe that 'Score' matches 'Live in Budokan' in excellence and excitement.<br /><br />Live in Budokan' is one of my top 5 live rock DVDs in a collection of over 40 concert DVDs. (See my review 'Brilliant concert and certainly a Mike Portnoy showcase') 'Score' is immediatley added to my top 5 DVD concerts. Not only is the sound and video quality the same but the players show new aspects to their vast range of musical skills. Portnoy adds fills in places that other mortal drummers just smile, whilst Petrucci shows a melodic side not as apparent in 'Live in Budokan' which tended towards being a shredfest. Some of the soloing over the orchestra and band in the second set was majestic progressive rock at its best - so beautiful that I found it an emotional experience.<br /><br />The 'Six degrees of inner turbulence' composition is covered in its entirety. This alone is worthy of an accolade. The controversial set list is great in that it covers material not already covered on previous DT DVD concerts. I find this thoughtful of the band rather than overplaying some classics to death. (I think of all the Deep Purple DVD concerts with 'Smoke on the water' played without fail.)<br /><br />Radio City Music Hall, NY, was the perfect venue and of course we have the addition of the 'Octavarium' orchestra. Before purchasing I wondered how this would work and hesitated thinking of some wishy-washy soft version with an orchestra. I was impressed how well this worked - in no way do DT play quietly - there is no compromise. DT rock as hard as ever. The orchestra complement and add to the power and beauty of the arrangements.<br /><br />Any weaknesses? If anything the orchestra by themselves in the overture did not seem as cohesive or as sure of the score. Certainly the playing worked better together with the band. I am sure this would have been stretching for both orchestra members and DT. A real achievement that this worked so well.<br /><br />Yes, there is a dead spot in the DVD - and my heart missed a beat. But really in the bigger scheme of things, so what. 3 hours plus of material and you have a 1 second pause.<br /><br />There is no hesitation in giving this DVD top score (pardon the pun!)<br /><br />DT fans will have bought this already. For newcomers - where have you been for the last 20 years? This will be an excellent addition to anyone's collection who loves progressive rock with a hard edge. Uncompromising musicianship that will enthrall for the entire concert and then again and again...members and DT. A real achievement that this worked so well.    Yes, there is a dead spot in the DVD - and my heart missed a beat. But really in the bigger scheme of things, so what. 3 hours plus of material and you have a 1 second pause.

0385344333|1|I have read every single one of Lee Child's novels and this is, without a doubt, the worst Reacher book I have read. The plot was so convoluted and it ultimately ended with a huge disappointment and a contrived ending that seriously lacked detail and specifics that may have somewhat salvaged it. I'm not sure where Lee Child will take us next because the formula of Reacher going to a different city with his toothbrush, disposable clothes and taking on the bad guys is getting rather tedious. How many times can you do the same story with a different variation in a different city? I may have to take a break from this author until he comes up with some new material because his latest book was a failure. I had to force myself to finish it. For now I will stick with Brad Thor, Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, David Baldacci, Jeffrey Deaver, et al and avoid Lee Child. And Tom Cruise cast as Reacher is a complete joke. Don't they have any big, manly men in Hollywood anymore? I guess not.
B005HEPIDS|5|For me, Voyager is the best of the Star Trek series.
B000PKX2KA|5|After purchasing MS Streets and Trips, my Pharos antenna would not work on my Vista laptop.  I purchased the Global Stat unit, installed the driver, plugged in the antenna, configured the com port, and it immediately found satelites from my living room, and I was up and running.  No fuss or muss, a great little antenna.
0307949508|5|I purchased this book and was thrilled with it. I believe it is actually better than the first book in the trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I literally devoured the book and was about 90%  through it when, as I moved on to another page the next page didn't make sense. I stopped short. Checked the page numbers and was shocked to find that 49 pages were missing. The last page I read was page 596. It then jumped to page 645. Talk about freaked out! This book really is a page turner and I was so into it that I immediately ran out of the house and down to my neighborhood bookstore. Thankfully, they had the book in stock. I think I would have driven an hour to find another copy. When I told the clerk my story she said that this sort of thing had happened to them too. It's a simple printing error. I never bothered trying to return the book. I'm sure I could get my money back but I'm not going to bother. However, if you purchase this book from this particular seller you might want to check to make sure those pages are there. The clerk said they sometime come in batches. Now as far as the actual story...if you liked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo you are really going to love The Girl Who Played with Fire. I couldn't put it down. Oh, and make sure you have the third book at your side because I can promise you, you are going to want to just pick that one up and keep reading. It picks up immediately where this book ends. It is such a shame that Stieg Larsson is no longer with us. He has created one of the most unusual heroines I have ever met. The writing itself is exceptional. The plot line is complex enough to keep you intrigued. But the best part is his character development. I love the characters. Blomkvist, Berger, and all the others are very real; very believable. The bad guys are really nasty; you will love to hate them. But the shining star of the story is Lisbeth. There will never be another heroine like Lisbeth Salander. He broke the mold with this one. Grab this book and you won't put it down. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. And remember to have The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest ready and waiting!this book and you won't put it down.

B001EN71CW|5|My roommate moved and took the DVDs with him. The series is one of the best out there, so I bought a new set for me.
B004GJDQT8|1|I downloaded the new Amazon Underground application off the app store.  Now, everytime that I try to install one of the new free apps, it keeps telling me that I need to install the new Amazon Underground app even though I already installed it! Please fix!
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Easy read. Great interplay between the contesting lawyers and how manipulation of witnesses occurs.
0375758992|5|An incredible story.  Actually a chronological series of vignettes, the way it's constructed.  Vivid descriptions captured in a narrative flow imbued with the sights, smells, and sounds of Africa.  Perhaps the most striking thing is how there is so much familiar in lives so different from most.  The girls still went to school, the family had their Christmas traditions, and their toilets weren't much more reliable than ours.  Am so glad I found this book.
B0000TG9E2|4|One of many treatments of the original Lewiss Carroll material that combines parts from Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass and leaves a lot out. If you know the books well, you can test yourself by seeing how much of them were quoted exactly.
0783240287|3|Unlike most of the reviewers below, I had never seen Joseph prior to viewing this DVD.  While I'm sure I'll watch it enough times to justify the purchase, it didn't quite live up to my expectations.  Andrew Lloyd Webber  fans buying this blind, as I did, may want to rent it first.  The music and  lyrics aren't in the same league as subsequent works by Webber and Tim  Rice.  <br />That said, I did enjoy this production.  Donny Osmond turns in a  great performance in the lead role.  The costumes and sets, while garish,  are in keeping with the tone set by Rice's tongue-in-cheek lyrics.  If you  like DTS, you'll be happy to know this DVD contains both DTS 5.1 and DD 5.1  soundtracks.  There is also a nice making-of documentary among the several  extras.
B005544TRQ|5|This show is different each time and that's what I love about it. It keeps you in an ongoing story but adds different excitement with new cases and twists in the relationships without getting dull or seeming like situations drag on. They have a beginning and end in each episode which leaves you with closure but still wanting to see the ongoing personal stories of each character.
B00CNQ7CRI|5|Love all the bridget jones books and this one is no exception.
B0094BB4TW|3|Being new to this venue I find it to be highly overrated, although some what mystifyingly addictive. As a Senior it does provide a certain connectivity, however its relevancy is questionable. It does provide a certain ease and affordable method to waste an inordinate amount of time during each day.
B0000640SA|5|This movie is a total mind trip from start to finish. All the performances are top-notch especially the one from Guy Pearce. The best thing about this DVD is the chronological version of the movie on disc 2. For those who haven't seen it yet, I recommend you watch the original movie on disc 1 then watch the chronological version.
B00H71PHS0|5|There are new characters and new locations this season. It's a great way to get an authentic look at 1920's London.  Very interesting and well done.
B00BN2NY48|5|A lot of action with a story. Incredible  athletic performance  with love. A film that the whole family can watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Addictive...just pure addictive.<br />There are lots of scrappy games in the app store but this ain't one of them. Candy crush rocks
B00314VYNE|5|I bought this one to my daughter and she really loves it. She is 3 now and loves toy story!!! I will have to complete the collection now. LOL
B00IG2DOKM|5|This game is a very good game and it gives you an idea of how you can build your own town, take orders from the helicopter, ships, and airport. You can deliver lots of goods!  This game is fanomanol and keeps you wanting to play it for hours and hours. This game is also great for kids and has no adds and is appropriate. This game is great!!!!!!!
B00BUCXVPI|4|I enjoyed this movie; it held my interest and kept me guessing.  Great acting by all.  I would have enjoyed more romance, of course.
B007SGM084|5|It's really more of a love story than a real domination-submissive story.  There is actually not that much in the way of sadism or masochism.
B00005JPNY|5|AWESOME I love this movie one of the best love stories ever told.  I would recommend this product to all that are looking to buy them.
B00C8S9W0G|3|I have loved all of this series. I felt that this book was like being at a family reunion where nothing of note really happens.  We know where all of the characters are and follow their journey but there are gaps I cannot digest. The feeling is that maybe the next book will give us back the adventure.  I love the series but this one just didn't grab me AND without being a spoiler alert I have questions.
B0089LOG02|4|This brought to life in real terms the emotions and traumas of a group of eastern orphans dumped in the US Midwest in an effort to alleviate the crowding of eastern orphanages. Well written. Tells about an event  we rarely hear about.
B00ISYLBHG|4|This has many great metal songs on it, all relating to different heroes from throughout history.  A lot of great power metal songs and worth getting.  All throughout this album there are great songs, and it has two solid extra songs added to the album as extras.  While the extra songs are not hero related, they are still solid songs that fit the recognizable sound of Sabaton.  I definitely recommend this album.
B004UFEJS0|5|Love this moves and so do my kids. one night we made ratatouille and then watched the movie before bed.
B004LROMWU|5|I don't normally review DVDs as a general rule (though I'm an avid tv/movie watcher); the few times I've tried, I've found trying to express my thoughts in words ackward at best, so bear with me.<br /><br />Falling Skies is your typical humans vs. aliens sci-fi / dystopian / end of the world drama. I happen to be a big fan of Noah Wyle from his er days (though it's so weird for me to see him as a father of teenaged boys, because I still see him as barely out of his own teen years). Falling Skies starts after the aliens have beaten us & destroyed most of the world, which is a nice twist on the genre.<br /><br />We're also badly losing the war, which is another nice twist, and one of the biggest heros (Wyle's characters) happens to be a history professor, an egg-head if you will. It's rather refreshing to see a hero being someone well-educated, who fights because he has to, not because he wants to or needs to in order to be a &#34;real&#34; man.<br /><br />There's some love and family drama, and all & all it makes for an enjoyable show.
B00HYI8A08|5|A wonderfully and well written story, a tale of love, a journey of enlightenment...<br />And the secret the male gender have, and the way it is used.
B00DUGCLY4|5|It is fun cool and a little hard
B00JB3MVCW|3|The movie was interesting to watch, and easy to follow.  We had the whole family watching, kids from ages 13 to 17, plus us adults.  We were all pretty happy with the movie.
B000059TEP|5|Ghost, is without a doubt, one of the finest films of all time. The music, the way evil people die and the way good people die is wonderfully crafted. The scene when Whoopi Goldberg's character hears Sam's voice for the first time is wildly funny. See this movie and you will not have a dry eye in the house at the end of the movie.
B008Y6UNT0|5|This is a different perspective of the Jewish Holocaust of WWII from the eyes of the innocent 8 year son of a Nazi concentration camp commandant.  The boy sees the world as any 8 year would as good and that all children are potential friends, even the &#34;enemies&#34; of the &#34;Fatherland&#34;.  It is a gripping drama with the young actor (Asa Butterfield) who portrays the main character (Bruno) giving a master performance.  I challenge anyone who watches this to closely examine their initial thoughts and feelings at the end.
B0063IH60K|5|love it
B000J103WK|5|Fantastic
0380789035|2|Yet another book that gets rave reviews that I thought sucked. It was boring and dragged on forever. by the time I got to the last 25% of the book (where s*** actually starts to happen), I just didn't care. At no point did I find anything likable about the main character or even any of the gods. I'm actually pretty disappointed as I'm generally a big fan of Gaiman's stuff.
B0094BB4TW|3|Would be much better if it didnt seem that Facebook and its administrators sensor certain views.
630469654X|3|This is truly one of my all time favorite movies, but I don't understand why the dvd is $56 That makes absolutely no sense. I can rent it for $2.99, buy it on Blu-Ray for $19.99, and the DVD is $56??? What gives?
B008IBPMZG|5|Absolutely brilliant!
B007J4T2G8|4|as expected book is much better than movie.
B000HCO83Q|4|A  computer-generated images festival?  Yeah, basically that's what this movie was.....and I'm not complaining!  It was great eye candy, just one great-looking scene after scene.     It featured wild-looking characters with comic-book action scenes and supernatural feats by a variety of characters, all of whom had special powers......but you know that. If you watched this film, you probably saw the ones that came before it.    Seeing the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco come apart and be transported to Alcatraz was very cool and a highlight of this special-effects.  As usual, the old men, played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, were the best characters..    Was the film entertaining? Yes, and I hear this Blu-Ray transfer is really good, so I'm looking forward to getting that.  Actually, the box set of all three \\"X\\" films looks like the best deal, since reviews indicate they're all outstanding in high-definition.
B00509OFE8|5|Just finished the series.  miss it tooooo much already..
B003Q6D2B4|4|RED is the action-comedy about a small group of retired CIA field operatives (Retired, Extremely Dangerous...R.E.D.) who are targeted for elimination by nefarious government groups and must team up to fight off the threat and reveal the culprit.<br /><br />RED is a silly but very fun movie.  It is the sort of movie that would not work, however, if we didn't already have pretty strong impressions and feelings about its stars.  If we didn't already think of Helen Mirren as the classy actress who won an Oscar for THE QUEEN...we wouldn't laugh simply at the sight of her wielding a machine gun.  If we didn't mostly think of Morgan Freeman for playing God or the President or the silky-toned narrator of MARCH OF THE PENGUINS...we wouldn't chuckle at his antics.  Quite frankly, if you enjoyed the trailers for RED, you'll enjoy the movie.  They give you an almost complete sense of the tone of this film.  If you thought the trailers looked merely silly and made you roll your eyes...then the movie will simply multiply that feeling.<br /><br />Personally, I thought it was a lot of fun.  The actors are clearly having a ball, and Bruce Willis (who doesn't really come across as old enough to be retired...especially when he can still win fistfights left and right) makes a good host.  He's coasting here, but as movie-goers, we're so comfortable with Willis and his shaved head that it feels a little like we're just visiting an old friend.  Mary Louise Parker (WEEDS) is his sort-of love interest, a call center worker he's been flirting with long distance but who now joins in on the escapades.  She does a nice job evolving from meek to really enjoying the dangerous antics.  Mirren and Freeman are fun.  Brian Cox shows up as a retired Soviet agent, and he sparkles in his over-the-top accent.  Richard Dreyfuss appears in a couple of scenes and chews scenery.  You have to almost feel sorry for Karl Urban as the assassin on Willis' trail...he doesn't get to have much fun...but he acquits himself well.  I can almost envision him doing well as the star of a straight-laced action series on CBS.<br /><br />Best of all is the hilarious John Malkovich.  He steals every scene he's in with amazing ease.  As the craziest of the REDs, he gets to let his tendencies to overact mightily just run wild...and it all works.  His facial expressions alone had the audience in stitches.<br /><br />RED is not a classic film by any means.  But I must say, the 110 minutes I spent with these guys was a complete, guilty-pleasure blast.  Maybe I'm just the right age (46) to enjoy this particular cast goofing around...but I sure noticed a lot of happy looking teens and 20-somethings all around me.  I think this film is set up to be a nice little hit (with room for sequels).imself well.

B00TYBD6VQ|5|Great
B0015RFCZ0|5|This is a very nice movie. Glad I bought it. Haven't seen it?  You should you really won't be disappointed!
0307719774|4|I have enjoyed the majority of the questions so far and it's only been a few months.  I don't feel like any of them have been something I wouldn't want others to read someday.  A few haven't applied to me, but most of them are thought provoking.  As a few other reviews mentioned...I wish that it had a ribbon to keep my place instead of a bookmark sticking out of it, and I wish that it would open to lay flat.
B00CP2Z5TC|5|I loved this album at first listen but there is so much to it I enjoy it more each time.  Thoughtful lyrics, great tunes.  Good to sing along & dance too - everything.  Love it.  Saw them live before I even heard this album - they're amazing.
B00LDNE3FG|5|I think u should have this app! All u do is tap the screen to throw a ball at all kinds of obstacles. Also, u throw balls at crystals and you  get 3 or 5 extra crystals.
B001R10BMS|2|A mediocre movie.  The production values are poor, the lighting looks like a TV soap opera, Sean Connery phones in a flat performance, Barbara Carrera is laughable, the story jumps around, barely hanging together.  I give Kim Basinger credit for delivering a fairly dignified performance in the midst of disaster; Edward Fox, who is capable of a good dramatic performance, and whom I typically like, plays M as a clown.<br /><br />I'm content to own a copy, because it was the only Bond I didn't already have, but I don't know whether I'll ever bother to watch it again.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Strong characters and great interaction between these characters make Ms. Moriarty's books stand out. While I think 28 years is WAY overboard for people to still be pointing their finger at Rachel's loss of her daughter, (Surely,realistically, people get on with current goings on!) I found the plot interesting and well thought out. My favorite Moriaty book is still her first, Three Wishes. I read this one because I like her writing style, which I liked with my first Moriarity read, Big Little Lies.
078322804X|1|I was desperately hoping to buy this DVD, thinking that the producers would do the obvious...include a 'family friendly' language option. My two young boys would love to see this movie again, but I can't let them due to verbal content. Every DVD I own has multiple languages, and this movie had to be `cleaned up' for broadcast. So why not here? Yes, it's an excellent movie. Too bad somebody wasn't thinking when it came to the 'options' department...
B00JB3MVCW|5|Good
B001N26GFM|5|This story is unforgettable,remarkable,very inspiring and as one reviewer mentioned\\"powerful and moving beyond words.\\" The message is that  in spite of being surrounded by an evil regime,being taught hatred by an  assigned Nazi private tutor and exposed to cruelty observed in his new home,the goodness in the heart of this 8yr.old innocent and naive German boy reigns supreme. His name is Bruno.He developed a friendship with another boy about his own age. This is the boy in striped pajamas and is actually a Jewish kid imprisoned with his father in a nearby Nazi concentration camp, a place where innocent Bruno thinks is just a farm with strange workers inside. The ending is stunning as well as inspiring when the power of the human spirit with its goodness and kindness residing in an innocent immature child is contemplated. This movie is highly recommended.
B000LTAY1U|5|Nice look. Perfect time. no battery. The box presentation is awesome, shuold get one to give to you or someone else
B0054JZC6E|3|the games are cool but it doesn't give you any instructions so you lose every time till you figure it out!!!
B008G8SFGO|5|We've been hearing the hype for months about the \\"bombastic drum sound\\", the \\"Destroyer mixed with  Revenge\\" comparison, the \\"paying tribute to our influences\\" and the \\"Thayer really out did himself on this one\\" comments.<br /><br />I LOVE IT.  It is a logical progression from Sonic Boom.  It has elements that draw from Carnival of Souls, Rock & Roll Over, Love Gun, Revenge, Destroyer, etc.  First thing noticed was that Hell or Hallelujah had some speed and intensity to it which reminds me of the exciting \\"I stole Your Love\\" album opening vibe.  Second thing noticed was the classic rock twinges: \\"Outta This World\\" has a Mississippi Queen riff twisted in, \\"Long Way Down\\" has Zeppelin influence throughout reminiscent of Out On The Tiles or something from Physical Graffiti,  \\"Hell Or Hallelujah\\" has guitar/vocal trade offs like the mighty Zep,  \\"The Devil Is Me\\" guitar solo is incredibly different for Tommy and reminds me of Whole Lotta Love Jimmy Page. \\"All For The Love Of Rock N Roll\\" sounds totally classic rock.  Even Though I see all these great influences & roots, when I step back and look at the big picture: MONSTER is uncharted territory and unlike almost any of their other albums......this is why I love it so much.<br /><br />Paul's songs are very solid and riffs give me random flashbacks to Mr. Speed, All American Man, Take It Off, King Of The Nightime World, Danger Us,  Etc.  While Paul's voice may be a little shaky live lately, this is not apparent on the album and he can still put down some great vocals in the studio.  \\"Last Chance\\" rocks!!<br /><br />Tommy's guitar solos are different from the Sonic Boom, Ace Frehley style safe & predictable sound.  They are definitely stepped up and all a little different.  This is THE BEST PART OF THE ALBUM.  More guitar and better guitar tastefully squeezed in keeps the songs intense.  Outta This World is great but Tommy needs to realize that not all his lyrics need to be about outer space or lightning.<br /><br />Gene's voice sounds incredible.  Gene does what he does best and his songs were written well enough to allow him to sing/scream at us like we all deserve.  Wall Of Sound, The Devil Is Me & Back To The Stone Age are classic Gene..... all rooting from his songs like I'm An Animal, Within, Not For The Innocent, And On The 8th Day, Etc.<br /><br />Eric's drumming is great.  The songs on this album allow him to deliver the goods.  More up-tempo and more changes/fills on this one.<br /><br /> - \\"Freak\\" may be a little weak compared to the other songs.<br /> - I've heard people complaining about \\"corny lyrics\\"......this is KISS !!!  Remember \\"Take Me\\", \\"X-Ray Eyes\\", \\"Rockin' In The USA\\", \\"Love EM & Leave EM\\", etc.  Elements of Schlock Rock have been around since day one!  \\"I TOLD HER THAT I HAD A SUBMARINE\\"...........Great Stuff !!!
6303168507|5|Along with Steven Spielberg's \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Schindler's List\\" is one of the most poignant and important films of the decade.  Filmed in glorious black and white and shades-of-gray, the format sets the tone for  this true story as color never could.  Superbly acted and directed,  \\"Schindler's List\\" will anger and sicken you, then tear at your heart, and  even uplift you.  After seeing this film, one realizes all too well that  this could happen again, did happen again (Cambodia), and indeed continues  to happen all around us today (although not in the horrifying magnitude of  the Jewish holocaust or the slaughter in Cambodia).  Brutally realistic,  this film should be required viewing throughout the world.<br />And bravo to  Steven Spielberg, the television network, and their sponsors for bringing  this magnificent film to the masses, uncut and unedited, and with only two  small commercial interruptions.  \\"Schindler's List\\" easily gets 10 out of  10 in my book.
B000MQC9H4|4|Like this movie, but if Cameron Diaz wouldn't be in it - I would love it. She is maybe cute, but not an actress at all.
B000XUBFE2|5|Started out a bit slowly, but picked up and proved to be an interesting, provocative, personal perspective of the German citizen point of view of WWII experiences.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is an awesome game!!!!!!! The kids love it and they can not get enough of it. Would not mind paying for it
B006YTTVHO|4|Good advice
B006XBSAP2|5|Great songs, energy.

B007J4T2G8|1|I decided to buy this book because so many people were talking about it so I felt like I should read it too.  I must admit that half of those who I talked to beforehand liked it, and half didn't. After a few chapters, I desperately wanted to put it down and that really never happens to me.  I usually get so engrossed in a book that I don't want to put it down.  I am pretty open to a lot of things, but I was disturbed by the extreme lack of confidence of the main character and the overall behavior of Grey.  It all made me very uncomfortable.  I hate not finishing a book, but this just may be the first one that I will not finish in my life.
B003C1AL94|5|Continuum has always been one of my favorite John Mayer albums, but hearing it on vinyl made me feel like I was listening to it for the first time. This vinyl release is of very high quality and I highly recommend fans of his to purchase this album on vinyl.
B0000009SG|5|Come on is a FZ! they are all good, why did i chose to review this? it was closer on the screen...<BR>Ok, a great record, if youre looking for any CD to start with the great universe of FZ i would recommend this or \\"Freak Out\\" to see how it all started... , but this has all FZ items, sex noises, sex abuse, comedy (laughs yeah, its good for your health ya know),irony, and punishment to that \\"UGLY RADIO\\"<BR>-Camerillo Brillo, Some weird girl is stocking you? play her this song, i garantee you won't score<BR>-I'm the Slime, heard it on the radio? don't so, this a punch in the face to that crapy \\"pop\\" songs you usually hear at the radio, yeah your mind is \\"TOTALLY CONTROLED\\", unless you buy this<BR>-Dirty Love, Sex noises, FZ could put you in a comma with his DIRTY LOVE<BR>-55, whats to say<BR>-Dinamo-Hum, another weird girl, a groupie? just check the DVD of \\"Does Humor Belong in Music\\", she like \\"Twisted Siters\\"<BR>Can i tell ya more? laugh, laugh, and hear FZ<BR>Buy it!
B00ULRVBGY|5|Great game.
B007J4T2G8|3|The storyline is, in my opinion, an attempt to show how any woman can be manipulated and seduced by any<br />smooth talking man.  Not for everyone.  The sex is vivid.
B005HWUCMC|5|Rihanna is not afraid of saying it like it is and i love it. This is not music for children because of her lyrics, but man is she amazing.
B006YC74E8|3|There are not many good editing apps for the kindle, but this is one of the best ones I found. Its alright for what I need, but I know there are better editing apps for the iPads and iPhones.
006224454X|5|This book did just what the reviews said -- it was a real page turner and caused the reader to be supicious of everyone.  It was quite good.  The subject matter, if you stop and think about it, is thought provoking and the reader of this book -- has to find out what is going on.  I enjoyed the book and look forward to more from this very capable author.  Thank you.
B003XF1XOQ|5|read it! buy it! love it! and wait for the movie to come out! :) i absolutely love this trilogy!
B00J8CGU64|5|Future classic !! Must see
B0067RQYNW|5|Best tablet spreadsheet I have found... Works like excell
159562015X|5|The book is a good short read but gives plenty of information about the Strength Finders Test.  You also get a code in the back of the book so that you can take the test on their web site.  The test takes a bit of time to accomplish and it is timed, so don't start it unless you can give it your undivided attention.<br /><br />You will discover your five greatest strengths that you have as an employee / leader.  After taking the test and reading the book I think that it hit me just perfect with where I know I am and have been.  I am 60, so I have been working a long time.  But this book confirmed my strengths and gave me hints on how to utilize them and nurture and grow them.<br /><br />This is a good team building product.  Our staff just did this.  Since I am new to this team they were able to learn quite a bit about me and that will be helpful as we learn how to work together.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00B1E6FF8|1|was a gift, however personally would never buy
B00HGJ18C2|5|Nothing special, but you only need the basics when it comes to solitaire.
B00005O3VC|5|Great stuff so much fun.
B00AKFG15S|2|After reading the entire saga I would not recommend it to a friend. There are better books by the same author
B00DMCV7K0|5|The book was very easy to read. I seemed to just flow through it. Sorry when it ended. I do like her style os writing.
0307346617|4|Another world war...only this time it is against ZOMBIES!    Max Brooks brings us a new approach to the zombie tales. This book contains the interviews of a reporter during this war. The interviews range from military personel, civilians, etc. The books do not delve into how the zombie plague started, just on how people were effected and the correct and incorrect solutions that people and governments tried.    WWZ was an enjoyable read. It looked at this zombie war through a nubmer of different individuals which made it interesting. While the book didn't go into the causes of the outbreak, it definitely went into the effects of the outbreak. The reporter takes us to several different countries.    It is a good summer read. Not too scary or graphic. Some of the interviews are great and bring the tension of the battles against the zombies and the struggles to sruvive. This book was far better than Brooks' 'Zombie Survival Guide' which I found too repetative.    I would recommend this book to all zombie fans.
B007EC27QM|5|This is an excellent calculator app.  If you are looking for a scientific calculator, look elsewhere because this is just a simple calc app.  Best FAOTD ever!
1101946342|5|Amazing can't wait for more
B005KDWUFA|5|This is the first Il Divo cd I have purchased but I will definitely be buying their previous cd's now that I have experienced their phenomenal music.  The arrangements are superb and the blending of their powerful voices is truly beautiful.

B002JVWRAY|5|This season beautifully wraps up a story that's been unfolding for 5 years. Almost every episode has something related to the apocalypse.
B001GZ6QDS|5|This is a really great movie, keeping on with the actual theme of the comics  not some ridiculous farce that had been made of it before.  Have watched it twice now and get more out of it eache time, there is so much going on.  Keep up with this form.
B00BAXFAOW|4|As always Malcolm Gladwell provides interesting content in a well written and well organized manner.  The book is thought provoking and the concepts that are derived from the central theme are not predictable.  This is the perfect book for any book club or just someone who wants to spark conversation.  You go from biblical stories to pre teen girls basketball strategies to treating cancer patients in the 60's.  Absolutely recommend this.
B0054TVW04|5|Together with Samuel Huntington's &#34;Clash of Civilizations&#34;, &#34;The West and the Rest&#34; clarifies much of the world around us and details why our world built upon Nation-States is under attach by non state actors as well as how the West came to dominate civilization as we know it today.
B00005K3O4|5|good funny movie
B00TYBD6VQ|4|An excellent movie. It pulls you along, start to finish. The acting is riveting. I loved it and would recommend it highly.
B00B5HQLMI|3|Not the usual James Bond movie.<br />There was a morale behind the storyline of leadership, command responsiibility and loyalty.<br />Good plotline on the next successor/leader of MI6
B00CA3C1N4|4|Beginner is a cake walk. Easy is fairly balanced until you get 12/12 for skills. Normal is where the AI starts to cheat. I don't know if they get a capture speed bonus or make ships faster, but if the AI gets the slightest advantage (and it starts with one), you're not going to win. In the time it takes you to capture 3 systems, the AI will have 4 or 5. Even using special abilities, I couldn't outpace the AI ship production.<br /><br />After you beat easy, it's too simple but normal is simply unfair.
630467578X|1|I might have been able to give this movie 2 stars given that there are a few good action scenes in this movie that made it mildly entertaining at times, in reality I would like to give it zero.  I cannot understand how this movie has been able to get some of the glowing reviews it has.  Perhaps this is just because I read the book before seeing the movie, and had heard it was actually a good adaptation of the book.  I notice even the editorial review for this movie mentions it is one of the better adaptations to film.  That is a laughable concept.  A blank screen for 2 hours would be just as faithful.  This movie too a book that had some social relevance, and parallels to our own society, and warped it into a simplistic, moronic action flick.  All real empathy for the main character is gone with the story being changed so greatly.  The only elements that remain the same appear to be a gameshow where people are hunted, the name of the host of the show, and the protagonist, Ben Richards.  Don't even bother watching it, I want the time I lost watching this back, don't waste your time as well.  Go read the book, people need to do that more often anyway, and see what this movie could be.<BR>I've been called a movie snob in the past, but in a case like this, being snobbish seems like a very acceptable way of being.
B007ZD17XO|5|This is challanging as well as fun.  You are able to succeed,  at least at the part I am playing now.  I need to keep my reactions fast and these types of games have saved me from at least two accidents recently.  The ability to react quickly without thinking about it really counts the older you get.  I do credit games like this for helping me keep that skill.
B00E8KLWB4|2|i don't have this on my kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Fantastic character development and a plot line that you can't turn away from.  Can't wait for the next season to find out what happens.
B00FLDG42Y|5|Been waiting for this since I saw the concert almost exactly 1 year ago in Phoenix where they recorded 3 of the songs.  Rush really has the live recording thing down, and this album demonstrates that.  There are no discernible overdubs on this, and according to the band there are none.  On the CWA songs the string section really adds something nice to the recording. Alex's solos really shine, particularly Analog Kid, Force 10 and Headlong Flight.  The 3 drum solos are awesome and Geddy's bass is typically Geddy - Clean, tight and intricate.  On a few songs Geddy sounds like he is straining when singing, but, well, that's Rush.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who likes Rush.

B008XX6J4C|5|This album, as with all if The Piano Guys' music, is absolutely fantastic! I have been following their music since some of their very first songs started coming out on YouTube and I cannot get enough! It really is just about the only music I listen to at this point. They have figured out a way to mix pop culture with classical music and there is something amazing about that. It's a new take on a beautiful part of our culture. It is a fantastic way to carry on the traditions of classical music while mixing it with something new to keep it interesting for a widely diverse population. I only hope they continue to put out music for a very long time.
B00DAABKQK|5|Watched it once and hated it.  The next day I watched it again and liked it a lot.  Later that same day I watched it again and was astonished at the story telling.  Two days later I watched it for the visual continuity and have watched it several times since.  Genius stuff.............the book fleshes out some of the story and there is a sub-text to the whole Somni story but the film makers wisely left it out.
B002QYUVY8|4|This was a lucky find for some great lines and great laughs!  That Kilmer and Downey have many good flix to their credit helped the choice along.  This was light slapstick funny in places and overall a great way to diddle away an evening!!
B000JJRIN4|3|This album is not horrible as I've seen many blast it as... but it isn't as \\"superb\\" as others have declared either. This is purely an average effort... with spikes in both good and bad directions. For one, the rap-talking style that seems to be becomming a popular pop staple is starting to wear out its welcome and listening to Gwen do it on nearly every other song doesn't do this \\"movement\\" any favors. That said, her lyrics are quite creative and even on songs that seem to mimic other songs out there... (Yummy sounds similar to Milkshake by Kelis) she seems to be a little ahead of the game verse wise. Paricularly cleaver is her break up song that is set up as if it is a cell-phone dropped call ad. What is different this time around from her last album is the fact that beatwise she is all over the place... and with an array of well known producers, it is easy to say why. She proves that she is an ecclectic performer and while that could be good in many cases it seems to also  weigh her down a bit. No one can deny that she is a good performer... but her waffer thin voice seems to not do much for some of the songs on this collection and to be perfectly honest, when she rap talks the songs seem a little flat. Toss in some songs that are just blah and this album is saddly peppered with mediocrity. Still, there are some gems amoung the average tid bits. \\"Early Winter\\" is a slight throw back to No Doubt and it shows that she still has a sensible approach to music in addition to her adventurous approach. \\"U Started It\\" is fresh and poppy... although it sounds a little like another song from her previous album as well. A glaring misstep falls onto the \\"Orange county Girl\\" which finds Gwen attempting to be like \\"everyone else\\" but not really comming off scincere about it. I am not disapointed that I bought this CD... as there are good songs... and even when at her most average she is much more entertaining than some of the other generic artists out there. If she does anotheralbum, I hope she sticks more to songs similar to \\"Early Winter\\" and interjects more vocal prowess as opposed to that talk thing which is not a very good way to display ones true talent.
B000WZAE1I|3|Saw previews of this and thought it would be good.  It looked like it fell in the category of movies I like.  It was just Ok, not worth buying, unless you can get it cheap.  I bought it at a good price, but would have rather just rented it.  I liked the main story line, but that was all.
B008602KQI|5|It grabbed me from the start! I was entertained all way through.  Furthermore, when I finished reading the Hunger Games, I could not wait to star reading the sequel book.
B003JTHXOK|4|Written without the depth and &#34;connection&#34; I've felt in most of his novels, Safe Haven is still a good read.  good enough that when I learned it was at the movie house locally, I did take and a friend and enjoyed it.  The actress, however, didn't convince me that she had been through any abuse.  So both the movie and the book were perhaps not the strongest of Sparks' works.
B008BU75IQ|4|Part of a series.  Should have read the other two first - but it's still well-written an humorous.
B0054JZC6E|5|always so fun ylot works perfectley on kindle fire but it erased all my games at the end it made me mad but great for my kids!!!!!
B00LXLM05I|5|GREAT game hours of play and very addictive can't wait for more levels are great and get to kill toads lol
B008HK3XKO|5|I'm more pleased with this case than I thought I would be. It's durable and has held up well to my almost-daily usage of the Kindle Fire as well as my 3 1/2 year old's less-than-gentle treatment. The stand works well. Overall, quote impressed.
B00U7VDC7A|5|I just got this game a few days ago. I love this game. There is always things to do.
B0040X46TE|5|Soothing music.  Have played again and again.  Amazed at Iz's voice and talent.  Also bought Facing Future and just as good.
0399157573|5|I love Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta series.  I never tire of the characters and how each story blossoms into another.  Dust is another murder mystery that gets technical enough to inform without getting me bogged down with too much tech.  The evolution of the characters is maximized in this book.
B000NQRE9Q|3|I was anxious to watch all for movies but the first 3 movies were of good quality, but you could tell they were digitally remastered.  Nevertheless, the first 3 movies are classics!
0380788624|5|Cryptonomicon was the first Neal Stephenson book I read, a gift from my younger brother.  From the beginning, I was hooked.  It was sometimes a little technical (math concepts that went over my head) but it REALLY kept me interested.  I liked the fact that it was two stories, with the descendants of the WWII characters coming together as their ancestors did.  This book opened the door for me to other works by Neal Stephenson which I have also loved!
B002ZG98UA|4|The Tvirus has killed everyone not hiding in below ground cities, but nobody stays dead anymore.  The Umbrella co. is still experimenting with the virus even underground.  Alice is still fighting them every chance she gets and may have found a place that is 100% safe and clean.  She ends up finding a group of survivors hold up in an L.A prison.  They all decide to find this place together but undead have found ways inside and Umbrella has tricks still.  Alice fights hard than ever.  If you liked any of the Resident Evil movies you'll like this one too.
B00DJFIMW6|4|The graphics are better than I thought they were going to be. It's just a fun and cute game! I would recommend this game for all ages.
B00FKF0F3C|4|Ken Follett has always delivered outstanding books with characters and themes that capture the imagination and keep the reader spellbound. His third book of the trilogy provided me with the same degree of reader enjoyment up to a certain portion of the book where the obviously liberal bent of the story line becomes overwhelming. I was also not satisfied with the loose ends left at the book's conclusion. Character development had been so well done and the reader so involved with each one that I felt hanging a bit as the book ended.
B005O64VH8|5|I've not heard of Secret Garden before and fortunately when I received an email from Amazon to buy it my intuition said 'yes.' Its one of the best albums I have heard, very calming to my soul and mind. When I've saved a little more money I will be very blessed to buy the next one I'd like to listen to which may be the greatest hits! :) God bless!
B008QTVNUI|5|Really good writing, fast paced, believable plot twists.  The cast is interesting also.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
B002NXSRX4|4|This is an elite group of secret government troops who are far more advanced (equipment wise )than any other government operation.. Oh except for the company that makes their equipment that has turned bad! which is always the case..isnt it? Never read comic or whatever.. but coming from just the mere premise of the movie .. had good action.. hot girls and a great action sequence for the at home theater experience...
0441172717|5|The economic/political/religious/science-fiction is amazing. I read it and it is electrifying. the rest of the series is a little worse, but is still great. This book makes a lasting impact and requires to be reread at least twice. I was watching the series before and I would cringe and get angry every time the actors got a term wrong or a piece of plot was missed. If you liked 1984 or Starwars this is the book for you.
B004WMKXWM|5|Very good
1401230067|5|These classic stories are very interesting and although John Constantine is the protagonist i wouldn't call him a good guy. A great read
B00DHKKN6Q|5|good game
B00VJ28G2C|5|Great Remastered sound !
B0000894RZ|5|VERY ENJOYABLE!!!
B001BANK32|5|King 's craft has never been in finer form.<br /><br />His capacity to drip character development, eke suspense, & drive visceral terror visions is unrivaled.
B000N2HBSO|5|To the avid reader, once in awhile you stumble upon an exceptional read and treasure the experience. Goodwin covers the whole journey of Lincoln from cradle to grave and lays a foundation for an understanding of &#34;Honest Abe&#34; in a way I've never experienced before. It's hard to write a historical novel that reads like a story but Goodwin achieves this feat with this book. Warning: If you read this book before you see the movie, you might be a little disappointed in the limitations of the movie. This book is that good.
B00H8XF9I0|5|While the set is getting rave reviews from most, and justifiably so, the purists, like myself are not as thrilled as we could have been.<br />Allow me to qualify myself; I am a musician and mastering engineer by profession, a life-long audiophile and a Beatle fan from the beginning (actually a little before they were really known in the US).<br /> The set overall sounds great. No worries there, many of the unique mixes are present, and several 'firsts' on CD. It is a worthy compilation for the true fan.<br />But, it becomes obvious that these are not the actual 'final' Capitol mixes, especially on the earliest albums for the most part, as they are lacking the hard compression and reverb that the Capitol engineers added to make the records sound 'more American'. I have the original LP's and the Vol. 1 Capitol box, which is from those tapes.<br /> From what I am hearing, it is perhaps fear on EMI's part of offending the sonic sensibilities of fans that fall in the category of millennials and Gen X'ers that are accustomed to more refined audio reproduction, when in fact, many in this demographic have been responsible for driving the revival of the vinyl LP, and who also revere these early Capitol efforts. Or it may be that they decided to give us a sonically superior version of those unique Capitol versions, which is a great idea, I just would have liked to have known before hand. I would still be on board to buy.<br />We are missing the few fake stereo mixes, being replaced with mono mixes, or actual stereo mixes. Audibly superior, but missing the point of a reissue like this. We want those crunchy, loud, reverberated chaotic environs Capitol created, as that is our first experience. This is less about audio quality and more about nostalgia.<br /> Now, having said this, some tracks have the correct mixes, but lack the post production processes.<br />If you want to really hear what we heard back in 1964, I, like many others, would recommend either buying the original Capitol Box Sets, or start cruising eBay for good used copies of the original LP's.<br />I have a bit of an advantage because of my background as an engineer in dismantling 'mixes', and I have both a great stereo system, and a reference workstation with the ability to quickly do A-B analysis. Most of this box set doesn't sound much different than the 2009 remastered box sets at first listen.<br />But that's OK too.<br />On the plus side, we finally get A Hard Day's Night, the United Artists version, on CD, although some of the logic eludes me as to having I'll Cry Instead in both versions as mono, since the shorter version has a stereo mix. The original U/A release had only the musical score in stereo, and all of the Beatles' music were 'fake' stereo mixes from mono masters, with even more reverb. They are true stereo mixes here, with the exception of I'll Cry Instead. Love the score on this one!<br />The Beatles' Story for the first time ever on CD. This isn't for everybody, but is a fun piece for those of us that remember it.<br /><br /> Allow me to address 'fake stereo' issue, or as it has been mis-titled by the fan base for decades now, 'Duo-Phonic', (Duo-Phonic and Duo-Sonic were the names of the process for any stereo release by Capitol, in much the same way RCA had Living Stereo as a process brand, not as an indicator of fake stereo).<br /> Most fans insist that The Beatles Second Album is entirely fake stereo. It isn't. It's mostly real stereo, but what the Capitol engineers did, with the heavy reverb and compression, and also panning the left channel slightly right, with all of it's channel bleed, it is very nearly like the (forgive the contradiction in terms) 'real' fake stereo mixes when listened to casually due to it's poor separation as a result.<br />Creating a stereo track from a mono source involves splitting the signal to two channels, and alter the EQ of each channel (roll off high end on one lower the bass on the other for example), add stereo reverb to give the illusion of two discrete channels. The stereo reverb gives a slight channel delay and channel bleed to enhance the effect. Love Me Do is mixed like this, for example, as is She Loves You, but not on this box set version. They are mono.<br /> The later albums had less affectation from the Capitol guys, but were still very tightly compressed up until Sgt. Pepper's.<br /><br /> This is where I differ from most fans; I only bought singles until 1967 when I got my first stereo open reel deck, with the primary goal of getting all of The Beatle albums on pre-recorded reel. There was good reasoning for this, as the open reel tapes did not receive a lot of the heavy post production compression, and were just better sounding overall. Those of us that grew up with the Beatles in this medium are the smallest fan niche out there, but we also had the best representation, at the time, of The Beatles' recorded works.<br />My first tape was Revolver, and it was about 3 times the price of the LP, but well worth it. I only lately heard the Capitol LP of Revolver for the first time, and it was incredibly stressful to listen to (and I have a high end archivist turntable and signal chain)! While the tape had a certain amount of compression added, it was over the top on the LP! The 2009 remaster out performs either, as pure audio, but when nostalgia calls, I pull up that 47 year old reel.<br /> My point is, the Capitol mixes are what they are, (or were) and are best experienced via the medium they were intended for; LP.  The original Capitol Box sets capture this sound and vibe beautifully, but may not be for everyone, and may be stressful listening for most.<br /><br /> In the 60's I wanted the best quality possible in recordings by The Beatles. These are here now, in this set and the 2009 remasters.<br />And for those of us that really want those original mixes; do you think EMI will set us adrift when there is money to be made?<br />If you have the first two Capitol Box sets, just buy the titles you need to fill the gaps. But if you are a 'completist' as I am, you will want this Capitol set as well. It has more going for it than against it. Think of it as an audiophile version of the Capitol albums.<br />I love the packaging, the while the sound isn't exact to our first experience, the rest of it gives a tangible link to those early days via the artwork, play order and vibe.<br />If you have doubts, go to iTunes, and sample the tracks there before you invest, but do have a good audio system connected to your computer, particularly of you want to conduct your own A-B comparisons. For me there is enough difference to go for it.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/17/14<br /> I need to upgrade this to 5 stars. Capitol tapes were definitely used on at least a good portion of this collection, based on a discovery i made over the weekend.<br /> I can only speak to Rubber Soul and Revolver at this point. True, they do lack the really heated and compressed sound of the LP, but are a dead match to my pre-recorded reels which are period to the original releases.<br /> I bought the open reel versions as opposed to LP because they sound better and lack a lot of the post processing used for the lacquer master tapes. The tracks on Rubber Soul are from the 1965 original mix, for one, Capitol enhanced and a totally match to my later Ampex reel, warts and all! When I did critical A-B on Revolver, between the original Captiol tape and the new CD, the wave forms, compression levels, harmonic distortion (a small matter) were an absolute match sonically and in the software. Amazing! I need to do further analysis on the other albums, and it appears that while the sound is better than the original LP, these masters at least are from Capitol. I never thought i would hear this particular sound outside of my 47 year old tape, and the digital remaster i had done on it some years ago.<br /> But meanwhile, I am just enjoying this set! I suggest you do the same!<br />A Hard Day's Night, was, at least on the orchestral score, the same as the LP. I was hoping for a bit of an improvement on these ate least, but sound about the same as the LP. I have the LP, so I already have the fake stereo mixes of The Beatles for that one (I remastered that particular LP to hi res digital sometime ago).<br /> I have no absolute conclusion on the overall set in regards to whose tapes were used for which album or track, but I'll do more forensics as my mood and time permits, and if i find any other amazing aspects, I'll update here.  I'm having a blast otherwise!sets, just buy the titles you need to fill the gaps. But if you are a 'completist' as I am, you will want this Capitol set as well.

B0000B1OFL|5|This is a great popcorn movie. It's clever, fast-paced, good dialog, fun characters, and a slew of great actors. Yeah, no one's going to mistake Mark Wahlberg's performance for Oscar-worthy but it's still fun. The only downside is that the usually remarkable Edward Norton feels like he's just going through the motions.
0679805273|5|My wife (Teacher) buys at least 6 of these per year to give as gifts to graduating seniors in High School.  Always well received, especially with the special note that she writes inside the cover.  Hands down, the perfect (can't miss) grad gift.

B00000J7SO|5|...and that's saying a lot. It's true that the backup band sounds a little under rehearsed, but like all of dylan's albums, the imperfections only add to the overall genius. The writing on this album is perhaps his greatest, and my god...the rhyming (Check out &quot;No Time to Think&quot;). The melodies on Street Legal are contagious and dylan's voice is remarkable. He's starting to get a little nasal, but those vocal chords are powerful.  In a way, this album seems to be both about dylan's failed marriage, and his ongoing life after it. &quot;New Pony&quot; and &quot;We Better Talk this Over&quot; seem the most blatantly reltated to the marriage. Despite what some may say, &quot;Is Your Love in Vain&quot; is a fantastic song. &quot;Where are You Tonight&quot; is maybe his most confessional ever, and &quot;Changing of the Guards&quot; tells a story with every line.  Unbelievable. Never believe the critics. Get this album.
B002N5N5LG|2|Weak, very weak. I'm surprised the Chevy is promoting this show. The characters aren't believable and they don't click. Lots of material &#34;borrowed&#34; from other comedy shows. They really try to make it work but it just doesn't. Let's see what happens in Season 2
B0074MZSWW|5|So in love with the Alabama Shakes they are truly amazing and the CD is awesome from start to finish! Just saw them live and they are even better! Can't wait for the next CD!!
0618477942|5|I've read graphic novels for, oh, about forever now.  I especially love the works of Neil Gaiman and Terry Moore.  Things that really make you think, and yet also grab your viscera and tug hard.<br /><br />This consuming work is all about family.  The kind we all really have, but rarely examine too closely.  Bechdel dissects the artifice necessary in order to maintain the facade of the traditional nuclear family using her relationship with her father.<br /><br />Truthfully, when we are \\"mother\\" or \\"father\\" or even \\"daughter,\\" we are all slipping somewhat into the realm of fantasy.  Our authentic selves are rarely able to be confined within the expectations society has of each of those iconic roles.<br /><br />I am struggling not to become \\"mother\\" to the exclusion of all else I can be.  I could empathize with Bechdel's mother's situation.  So much given up.  Yes, I love my children.  But after reading Bechdel's account of how her mother's anger at her loss of self played out for her daughter, I wonder how much my children already understand of my resentment that marriage and motherhood demand so much of women.<br /><br />And yet the author conveys her understanding and compassion toward her parents.  She can see how each was shaped or warped by unrealistic and anti-human societal expectations, as she fights so vigorously against being constrained by the same.<br /><br />A beautiful and haunting book.  Highly recommended.
B0001ARCFA|5|Awesome frequency and dynamic range for someone looking for a good quality bargain!  They are also extremely sleek and stylish.

0802130208|5|sat on a shelf for several years until a friend began reading it and describing what he read. I couldn't stop laughing out loud even though i think i have met several people just like ignatius. have been recommending  it to anyone who isn't sick of hearing me rave about it. the characters are  first rate! the plot is insane and worthy of wodehouse for twists and how  it all comes together at the end. i especially loved miss trixie and wish  her well... hope they let her retire finally! Lots of fun to read.
B007ZXK08C|5|Fantastic book- great plot, beautifully drawn characters which engaged from the beginning and despite some bizarre behaviour were believable. I really enjoyed the structure of the novel (shifting narrators) leading to the big reveal- but still there was more delicious story to come. I even loved the dark and sinister ending...
B00W6IW9B2|5|I love this band live in concert! The album sounds a little too over produced but I still love them...I guess I'm just used to seeing them live...
B007SGM084|1|i to need to agree with the price gouging of kindle books! why should it cost more for a download than paperbacks? it makes me made that cause the books were suposed to be a better deal: no mold,save on space,storage and cost. but a don't see that at all! so thank goodness for free books on other sites! but i'd rather do all my buying through amazon,not finding other books then it directs me back to amazon for the deals! why should a book cost $14.99? when paperback at walmart is $5.49 or less for the NEW BOOK!!! i got the kindle thinking all that, but what a ripoff 98% of the time.
B00EAH3EQG|5|She's a very disjointed artist, but this is a very good album nonetheless. I love her and she poured her heart out on here! Bravo!

0345525558|4|\\"The Language of Flowers\\" is a book of contrasts. The protagonist, Victoria Jones, is a waif who was abandoned by her parents. I like the fact that the author, Vanessa Diffenbaugh, thought of such a name. Will she be victorious? And Jones is a common name.  Victoria is hardened by life at its earliest age while most people are hardened by the calamities of life as they age. She learns that flowers are the friends that she can rely on and that flowers offer a beautiful softer side to her life. She studies the meanings of flowers which have a language of their own. (Victoria's dictionary in back of book.) Will she overcome this hard shell she lives in? At the end of the novel, the author Diffenbaugh wraps up her first novel with a bouquet of emotions tied with a ribbon and hopefully Victoria is victorious over her future.

0553582038|2|Oh, I'm sure he has an editor, but he or she was clearly not on the job for this one. I enjoyed the first three books, though the third book showed signs of declining quality. This one was tedious. And, I hear it gets worse in the fifth book.<br /><br />I fear that Martin either doesn't know the \\"big\\" stories he should be telling, or he just doesn't know how to get there. A few loose threads or unresolved stories can be interesting and give the reader something to ponder later. However, this has become the norm in this series, and it's clear that it's simply poor writing and apparent lack of imagination.<br /><br />Even in the first three books, Martin's work seems to be written with a television adaptation in mind. With a background in television and film, that's not really a surprise. Ironically, it could be that the trimming required for a screen adaptation is what eventually saves the stories in this book and onwards. While I was somewhat disappointed in the first season of the HBO series, it could be that it will at least improve the telling of this book.<br /><br />At any rate, I think I'm giving up on this series. It showed promise in the early books -- even if it was more soap-opera than powerful epic, but it's grown tiresome.
B000NA1OXY|3|As an adult music lover, I became a fan of Avril Lavigne with her last CD \\"Under My Skin\\" - probably because of it's mature sound (and excellent songwriting assistance from the brilliant Chantal Kreviazuk). Honestly, the one track on that album that sounded like a step back to teeny bop was the upbeat \\"He Wasn't\\" which wasn't a bad song - but one that I wouldn't turn up in the car if I wanted to listen to it. I actually went backwards and bought \\"Let Go\\" after, as I thought \\"I'm With You\\", \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Losing Grip\\" were pretty good songs. With this CD, I have to give Avril a little credit for putting together an update CD, however it is not something I play loudly - as it is extremely teeny bopping (a step backwards from \\"Under My Skin\\"), and it is immature with it's frequent cursing. I'm not a prude to hearing cursing in music - it has been affective with some songs - but not here. There are a few songs worthy of greatness here: \\"Innocence\\" - which is a beautiful song, \\"Keep Holding On\\" - great message song, and the tracks \\"Runaway\\",\\"Contagious\\" and \\"When You're Gone\\" prove to me stand-outs. The rest are embarrassing with their mainly juvenille lyrics. I will admit that the video for \\"Girlfriend\\" and the song itself is catchy. This CD overall is a major step behind for her, and a disappointment.
0062080237|3|It's always difficult tackling a living legend, possibly more difficult than tackling the age-old legends. If I said I didn't like reading James Joyce, people will shrug it off and say, \\"You love him or you hate him.\\" But if I'm going to be critical of a genre hero like Neil Gaiman, I'm also going to batten down the hatches and prepare to fend off a mob with pitchforks and torches. Even so, I'm just going to say it: I wasn't impressed.<br /><br />Go read the rest of the review, where I dig myself into a deeper hole with Neil \\"the living legend\\" Gaiman: [...]
B00F35BV64|5|I never watched much Star Trek growing up. But this movie was pretty awesome. Great for an exciting thrill ride movie.
B004T0E2S8|4|Nicely laid out for a beginner!!
B00T4837W2|5|Good Movie. Hope the make a second.
B002OSXDAU|1|An awful lot of anti-socialism text - of course it probably made more sense when this was published. I read it 20 years ago and reread it in hopes of trying to understand the Republican enchantment with it. Still don't. Very think plot used to support a political agenda.
6305090564|3|I am a massive fan of monster/creature movies, therefore, I really looked forward to seeing this movie.  However, when the end credits finally scrolled, I can only describe myself as being dissapointed.  Sure the  effects were okay (but did still seem a bit computer generated) and the  movie does offer its fair share of gore; I even liked the idea behind the  story 'prehistoric sea creature attacks ocean liner'.  But I really didn't  like the script, it was just too corny, the acting is unconvincing and the  movie didn't build enough suspense.  It would have been much better had the  film concentrated more on the creature attacking the ship rather than the  annoying rag tag bunch of crims that make up the film's cast. Still the  movie is fairly enjoyable for a one off viewing but I definately reccommend  renting before you buy.
B00FATEJYE|5|Great fighting game for the kindle fire. Way better on tablet so you can execute combos etc. Best kid game as graphics go I have played yet also can be played offline so a big plus
B00BXDOSXS|1|This is a great video player but a bad app. Once installed on my kindle it will not update it's play list. Have to delete and reinstall to go it to find the video s I had just downloaded.
B000I9TY4G|5|If you liked Firefly, then Serenity will be a familiar and pleasant experience for you. The characters maintain their same quirky personalities, right down to the silly cursing.
B00BC254I8|5|Looking for an interesting read?  Found it... Mike definitely opens up in his tell all.  Drugs, Sex, Lawsuits, Fights.  My only wish was that he provided a little more insight into the fights (behind the scenes, the lead up, the mood). I feel like he glazed over the fights which from a historic standpoint i would rather hear more about.... Overall a fun read.
B00ARHAAZ6|5|It was an extremely fun book that got you sucked into it's world very quickly. I recommend it to anyone
B000SINT52|5|I love this!
B00C74SHRK|5|A powerful book - imaginative, riveting plot, fully realised characters.  I couldn't put it down. The writer also had great insight into characters' motivations, the writing had psychological truth and drew on interesting philosophical insights.
B003SI05PG|5|Hits just the right notes for the Holiday Season!  Easily eclipses How the Grinch Stole Christmas.
B002LC8HF0|5|I had a little trouble with the pacing of the second book, but I couldn't put this one down! I completely agree with Orson Scott Card's assessment of Sanderson as a writer, he brings so much wisdom to his books and his characters! This book boldly addresses challenging ideas:  What makes a good leader? What is the purpose of loss and destruction? What does it mean to truly love someone? At the same time it's an engaging story with lots of action. It also addresses the burning questions you undoubtedly had from books one and two. All I can say is read this book!!! Heck, read the whole series!
B000I3PERS|5|I love this movie!  The story, the acting, even the soundtrack never fail to inspire me and give me courage to stand up for what is right.
1936041111|4|English teacher.  Couldn't wait to get this book. Planning unit on Frankenstein. Students are excited.  Services great. Book awesome.
B003K16P3M|5|This is one of the most original plots and worlds I have read. I just love it all around. There is more then one strong female character which is always a plus.
B00127RAJY|5|This was a better than expected workout. Very challenging! Don't be surprised if you are a bit sore the next day :) If you can keep up, you will lose weight.
B000HA4WT8|4|well, this movie was typical. over the passed few years the fast and the furious films have seemed to do a decent job giving an insider look to the current & up to date car enthusiast scene. however, sometimes it is very unrealistic. i'm assuming for the sake of action.  people seem to forget that it's just a movie. the action scenes are indeed far fetched, but they make the movie watchable. i don't know a TON about cars, so i can't really say if the movie was accuaretly displayed there or not. the plot was dry, like the other 2 of the series, but how exciting of a plot can you have with the amount of action and skilled driving packed into the movie. <br /> <br />acting wise i was slightly over impressed. i could have done with another main character, though he did put me in the mind of a young paul walker. i could have done without zachary ty bryan in the beginning. maybe that's just because the only other place i've seen him is home improvement.  <br /> <br />besides it being unrealstic, yet action packed. i have came to the conclusion that if you are into cars, it's worth a watch. i wouldn't recommend BUYING it, but renting it would be worth it. 4 stars.
B008JFUTT0|5|I cannot describe how this Documentary touched me. I've watched it over and over. I even went to see him in person after watching this.
0385342020|5|I've enjoyed all of Sophie Kinsella's books but the author really outdid herself with Twenties Girl. It succeeds on every count -it is great chick-lit but SO much more. The plot and characters were terrific and the story wraps up several loose ends in a very satisfying manner. The book was funny, suspenseful, interesting, and really touching - I was surprised to find myself choking up more than once.  Fantastic book!!!!!  Definitely movie material.
B000062XFG|5|This a great purchase for the TNG fan. My wife and I are both 'Trekkies' and have watched all seven seasons several times.
B00HCMG6LG|5|This game is very fun and it feels like it's been 5 minutes but it's only been 20
B00C7JG0KG|3|This is a good film, but the 3D graphics aren't all that great, I'm not sure if it's my glasses or just the technology.  I have the best tv on the market right now with 4K and smart tv but sections are quite blurry.
B00FAPF5U0|5|If don't play many of these games but I do enjoy this one. The only negative is waiting for lives to refill unless you want to pay to play.
B00EVW0SA0|1|Nothing more than a politically motivated attempt to prop up our Dear Leader. Oh, I almost forgot to mention; the acting was really, really bad.
B009AYVNEY|5|Excellent adaptation of the book; sits with you for days...
B0099Y2MYK|5|Thoroughly enjoyable series!
B00594XOZU|5|This is a really good app and it works great with the Kindle Fire HD
B00DJFIMW6|4|My 6-year old son loves the minions, and we have a blast trying to beat each other's score...<br />Very easy to use.
B00C1BTWV4|4|Great movie back in the day and still one of my favorites!
B000MXFPH8|3|OK BUT GETS REAL HOT ! I understand  this comes from Japan but it should include an insert in other languages
B00EMXBDMA|5|amazing attention to the details. Highly engrossing storyline
1451626096|5|Always pleased with every item I order.
B002QVZ71I|5|so great...It's beyond words...but then again so are many of Hanks' movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|Enjoyed every second of reading this incredible love story! Never in my life have i felt such a deep connection with this incredible novel. Highly recommended!!!!!!!!
B00K3B6NWU|5|I was late to the story s herd a lot about the books and the Movie.  Didn't strike me as something l would like to read or see the movie  WAS I EVER WRONG!<br />Started the first book didn't stop even for one day consumed all THREE!!  Wow and double wow!
B00CLD65X0|5|So good : )
B009UX2YAC|5|Subway serfers is the best free game in my iPad  it is the best free game in the world and  his cheats of the game
B0028MBKVG|5|ran a half marathon 2 yrs ago.  now i want to run an ultra.  thats what this book will do.  the bad part is that it doesnt give specific directions oh how to run.
B00COMLLX2|5|Great!
0679746048|5|Reading this book was the most pleasurable experience for me - I could NOT put it down and it was easily the best piece of work i have ever read.  Susanna Kaysen's direct approach to writing is undeniably fascinating and i  was glued to each page.  It was laugh-out-loud funny and it romances the  craziness in all of us.
B00OTD72PA|3|I guess I'm just not smart enough?  Was fun for a bit, but the ranking aspect is a depressant.
B00008WT5E|5|No problems.
B00127RAJY|5|I saw a review for this DVD somewhere else and decided I would try it. This is the best workout I've ever done in my life. I immediately felt the difference. What I love most is all she needs in 20 minutes of your day..Just 20..and it motivated me to want to do it more. You think about how little time of your day that is, and it makes you not mind doing it. My girlfriends and I get together 5 times a week and do it together. Jillian motivates you to want to push harder and harder and I love it. I would recommend this workout DVD to anyone. In shape or not, you will not regret it!!
B0091REZMW|5|Nice and fun<br />Very good search and find game so far for me. I hope to see more like this one.
B0025UHKNS|1|This watch failed me many times during my runs either it was too wet or malfunction.  On it's three year anniversary, it died on me.  I tried everything from resetting (holding both start/reset button) and leaving it on charger all day hoping it will charge....but no use.  Sad to say, it was not a good watch for me.
B001V7YWTQ|5|Wish I was there!!! .... Very good cd by two great rock/blues musicians....
B0061P2L5U|5|....for all Americans. I had vaguely heard of parts of what is in this book. But this lays it all out in detail and it is stunning. A bit tedious occasionally, but highly, highly readable for the most part. Read it.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I am hooked on this program. I hope it continues for years to come. Looking forward to the next season.
B000ID37RM|5|I loved that I got to watch it from the very beginning so many times I have come in on it while it already started
B004GHNIRK|5|I consulted this work periodically when plowing through the French version to confirm that I understood it correctly.  More extensive comments on the work are in my review of the French version, but to make it short and sweet, this was a fantastically-woven tale, a Dickensian journal through the brutal underworld of France in the 19th century, in which a man's life could be ruined by an illicit fruit-picking expedition and a poor woman treated as a sexual plaything by a wealthy college student who dumps her after impregnating her is forced to part with everything she holds dear, from her child to her teeth to her body, all of which she sells.  The idiocy of laws and customs mandating that a woman who has a child out of wedlock, who arguably needs employment more than a childless woman or a married one, losing her position once that child is discovered parallel the contemporary idiocy of the British debtor's prisons, in which those too poor to pay their debts were put in prison for not paying them, thereby guaranteeing they could never pay them off, leading to a cycle of absurd cruelty.  I think of Hugo as a French version of Charles Dickens which only goes so far, since Dickens could be knee-slappingly funny and created far more convincing middle class families, whereas Victor Hugo cannot resist going for the almost unrelentingly dreary.  His characters are more statues, All Good or All Bad, and when you think about them too much, they are frankly unbelievable.  The reason you don't think about them too much is that the story is so good and compelling.  You want to believe in a convict who is so strong his strength alone can betray his identity, who can be captured and escape at least twice from the galleys, who is at once so selfless and so damn good at business that he is able to amass and dispense a fortune.  You want to believe in a priest who - when confronted with a theft - not only saves the thieve but gives him the rest of what he didn't steal, and that this random act of kindness and redemption would work its Christian magic on the otherwise forsaken soul of Jean Valjean.<br />But I found the outright Christian proselytizing way too heavy.  Again, I forgive Hugo because the plot is so good and the social justice themes so important and - well, he is Victor Hugo! - but the idea that prostitution would have ended in France had France been a bit more Christian or that Christianity has some sort of monopoly on justice and compassion, even if at its best it might help inspire those things, was a bit much.  Modern novels tend to go out of their way to be universal, to appeal to readers of all religions and nationalities, to try to emphasize those aspects of the human struggle that transcend the particulars of one particular culture (can we imagine the Kite Runner as the same book had the author attempted to convince us that only through embracing Islam could pedophilia, poverty, and war be eliminated?).  Nineteenth century novels showed no such restraint.  Hugo has a Christian axe to grind and does it throughout the book but does it so well that I let him get away with it.  But I wish he had resisted the impulse and instead wrote a separate pamphlet or essay on his religious views.  Or on the sewer system of Paris or the battle of Waterloo or any of a dozen other topics on which he digresses for 30 pages or more in the middle of this otherwise gripping story.random act of kindness and redemption would work its Christian magic on the otherwise forsaken soul of Jean Valjean.<br />But I found the outright Christian proselytizing way too heavy.

0446677450|4|I think the book could have been written better. The way the book was written was to sell more books! Mr. Kiyoski has a new line of books called \\"Rich man advisors\\". In his book \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" he is hinting towards making it rich in real estate by buying foreclosures and going to banks and mortgage companies looking for inventoried houses. In Houston Texas this is hard to do since there are investors that already lined up with bankers and mortgage people.  <br /> <br />I am thinking like how a rich person would think however as a result from what I learned in the book. You do not have to have a lot of money to start making your money work for you. How I am getting my money working for me is I am leasing an Internet server for $100 per month, so far I am hosting 20 accounts and making $200 per month in income, it is not much and I could make as much as $5,000 per month if I could get 500 accounts which is the limit of the server, the biggest problem I am running into is marketing my hosting service and getting more people to lease space on the server. It is proof that changing you mindset will work for you and to get others doing the work.  <br /> <br />The biggest problem in implementing my plan is marketing. Mr. Kiyoski endorsed a book called \\"Sales Dogs\\" which is part of his Rich dad advisors series. I have 3 chapters left in reading the book, I will also have my girlfriend read it so she can also help me implement some of the ideas in that book as well.  <br /> <br />Overall it gets you to thinking and you have to be creative to find your niche, if you invest in making money instead of spending it you will have that much more. In the $100 profit I am making off my leased server I am able to buy 5 new DVD's a month, instead of  spending my initial $100 on DVD's now I have an income stream to buy more. Be creative when you read the book and you to will start thinking like the rich.  <br />
B00D6SBOWG|5|This is a good game that allows luck and skill. Keeps you playing over and over again. I am a fan of most Big Fish games.
B0096CDG0O|5|I downloaded the free app and within 20 minutes I went back and bought the ad free game for only $1.99. The game itself is fun and fast paced. The bonus is all the different ways you can play. Randomly, with a long distant friend or even with a friend sitting right beside you. They also give you the option to chat while playing or to leave the game and come back to it when you can. You can't go wrong with this app/game.
B00HHC33YY|5|My granddaughter is a huge Dolly fan and this just made her day.
B008Q00BOQ|5|Fun, high impact entertainment.
B00F1BFRA6|5|Everybody already knows how addictive this series is, unless they live under a rock. And just by accident, you learn a lot of history while enjoying yourself.
B00FATEJYE|5|This game is very cool. I very so love cat woman and Raven. I recommend this game for super hero lovers and battle people. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B00004Z400|5|first off, buy this 'added track' version instead of the normal one. this one's got the song, 'Back to School' on it which is my favorite song on here. 'tis very good and along with tracks such as 'Digital Bath' and 'Change' makes buying this CD very woth it. this one of those discs you can easily liusten to all the way through without getting bored.
B005UG542S|5|Just amazing
B000IU3Y3W|3|The music is excellent as is most all his music.  But beware that the DVD is only included to provide better sound.  There are no videos, just higher res music (evidently CD's compress the music).  Anyway, I can't hear the difference between CD and DVD but that doesn't mean you can't.
B00TU9UO1W|1|A &#34;blight&#34; that has the power to wipe out every edible plant, worldwide, simultaneously...but only one species at a time...<br />What about all of the food in the ocean?  Did everyone forget how to build a greenhouse?  Crop rotation?  Micro-farming?<br />No one had an alternative?  When the first billion died, NO ONE thought about doing anything differently?<br />EVERY person on the planet was willing to give up science and brainwash their children into denying history?<br />They ALL then chose to plod along together to their death without ANYONE looking for a solution?<br />Oh wait, there is the handful of secret scientists who focus all of their energy and meager resources on the massive effort of getting off the planet.<br />That's the easiest solution for sure, what a relief.....illogical, inconsistent, unbelievable (even with suspension), sappy, tedious, insulting.....<br />TARS is the best character.
B004EFYZ1C|5|My son was learning about moon phases in school so when I saw this app I had to download for him. He is 10 years old and loves this app.
B00005JKL8|3|This would be a boring movie if it weren't for the direction.  Owen Wilson is on the run most of the time and never really fights back.  I guess that's understandable because he is surrounded by people trying to kill him.  The movie was marketed as being patriotic but really just shows how stupid it is to allow foreign military officers to be in command of another country's soldiers.<br />What makes this movie entertaining is the slick direction of the action scenes.  What stood out to me was the scenes where there was no music, just the sound of Wilson running or being chases.  Kind of reminded me of the old James Bond movies where you didn't need the music to tell you how to feel.  A good rental.
B00PTB7B34|4|This game is a combo of my two favourite games Clash Of Clans and the Call Of Duty series
0618680004|4|Atheism is something created to comfort those incapable of understanding how boring reason can be. <br /> <br />The dumb are believers.  The intelligent are non believers.  The very intelligent are believers because then they don't have to argue with dummies. <br /> <br />Religion and science both deal with belief and knowledge. Science starts with the assumption that any belief is subject to revision and sets out to seek knowledge.  Religion starts with the assumption that it has all knowledge and sets out to make sure everybody believes it.
B00A1AF4DM|3|This book begins with nano robots and suddenly we are focussed on little people adventures.  Very dangerous and deadly adventures forced upon them by the villain of the story.  The robots do come back into the picture at a later time.  If you are grossed out easily this is probably not for you - at least if preparing bug dinner, being bug dinner gross you out.  It was a good story - not great.  The little people dropped like flies as they travelled until only two were left.  I did not expect them to start getting done in so soon.  My biggest complaint is the ending was not really satisfying to me and I don't think it was really satisfying to any of the characters.  That's the main reason I gave it a 3 instead of a 4.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Great game has lots of levels and lots of weapons. Hunt in different Countries and climates, with difficulty levels to suit those players abilities.
B004OC07F8|5|A very important book to whom want to seek a different path of everybody, who wants to go further, deep down in the core of the concept of inovation that an enterprise has to have to make its own market, or, as the book calls, blue oceans.
0345803485|1|There are thousands of 5 star reviews and thousands of 1 star reviews, not much in between. I've known many women (and their mothers) who were captivated by this trilogy, so when my own mother scoffed at my mention of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", I thought she was being a literary snob.  Apparently her book club read it as a joke and she recommended I read it too, just so I could see for myself what a horribly written book it is.  When my coworker lent me the first two books, I was so intrigued to learn what the mass hype was about and/or how awful this would be.  3 MONTHS LATER.... I have never ever had to force myself to read something for either school assignment or leisure, like I did this book.  Why did most people finish this book within a week, but it took me months?  It's been a boring, painful experience.  Not only do I thoroughly dislike every character and the repetitious, unrealistic story line, there is nothing intelligent about E.L. James' writing abilities.  I won't bother with the next two books. There is something disturbing and awkward about the subject matter being written at a young reading level. I'd rather find my old Judy Blume books if I wanted a simple read...at least it would be enjoyable.  If I hate something, it doesn't deserve a single star.
B00FN5Z8UY|5|Well, the only thing I can say is that the is without question the BEST show that has ever been on television, Absolutely obsessed.
B0006OBPTA|5|I got this for the reason its cheap and all in one so to speak. I didnt like the 2.0 DD and wanting it in 5.1 DTS !<br />for the price okay i can deal with it.
B0063M22QO|4|I'm a long time fan of solitaire Mahjong.  This portable App makes a nice travel game.  I must admit that I find the choice of tile patterns limited, but otherwise this is a satisfying experience.
B0031KC8OC|5|My friend recommended this show.  I didn't watch it while it was on, but I'm glad I watched it now.  It really keeps your interest, and it will keep you guessing who did it.
B007I2BZIE|5|Clockwork Angels is the sort of album that is both retro/reflective and forward looking. Retro/Reflective in that it is a concept album, one that had its roots in the band's 2112 days with aggressive instruments and long tracks that tell complex stories. One can see in this work the philosophical tendencies and pronouncements (credit to Peart) that this band is known for--if not always understood. These tendencies are articulated in a meaningful way here. It takes a few listen-throughs to get this.<br /><br />Forward looking, in that this is a culmination of decades of being Rush. The trio has applied its newest tricks here, in ways that are both artistic and unapologetic (\\"let's do a track that's guaranteed to get us air play\\" isn't a phrase you'd hear in the drawing room). One has to go a step further and realize that the group is pushing 60 now, and after a lifetime one cannot expect them to be the same arrogant, cocky bunch that mimicked Ayn Rand. At the apex of their career, it seems that they have learned to incorporate experience into this fantasy concept album. Their alter ego from Clockwork Angels has seen the best and worst of life, and relies on himself. It is his life, his approach to it, and his fate that he submits to, for better or worse. It is not a cheery album, but one that confronts and lives by its own code.
B007SGLZP8|4|Really didn't know where this was going! Held my interest and was a great trip read!  Recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to know the ending until the end.
0385528752|4|This book our team read together and it was fundamental in helping us understand change and get us on the same page. We began using the terminology from the book like the elephant and rider. It helped us gel as a new team and also focus on the right things as we began making changes to our organization.
B001P06GX4|5|I recently made a questionable review on this product (maria d). The quality of the game pieces are good. Small pieces may be loose. Item arrived in reasonable time.
B00BFUUMO8|5|It is cool, you can feed,fight, and evolve your dinosaurs. and you can build your park how you want it!!!😎🙌
B00J2PEZAU|3|Liked the plot and the characters. I think it was a little drawn out though. Movie was over 2 hours.
B00CEF014E|5|I've recently come to enjoy Mr.Stevenson work, and I must honestly say I am never dissapointed. Solstice is a page turner that will keep your heart racing.  Another job well done.
B00GAVJ77K|5|Don't quite understand what I'm doing on the app but I like it. It's doing good stuff.
B0000028UK|5|Owning this album is more than a gesture in supurb musical taste. Adding Vs. to your collection elevates you to rock guru status. Keep it right next to your copy of Closer and anyone eyeing your cd library will know you're for real...
B004G600A4|5|I normally don't like watching children's movies, but I loved this one.  My sister had a copy but I wanted one for myself too.
B00BD99JMW|5|Love the series!  Sorry to see it end
B00I8Q77Y0|5|It's AWESOME!! Has great graphics and the bird poops and actually makes little tweets! (ADORBS!) It's as addicting as Flappy Bird! Can't stop playing it!!!!!!
B00N0YJVGW|5|This is the best of the two he just released, although I do like Art Official Age. Do yourself a favor and check out the recent Saturday Night Live episode on HULU that has Chris Rock and musical guest Prince. Not only is it funny (and SNL is not always very funny), the skits are awesome, but so is Prince (and they gave him extra time), and you get to hear some of this live. In fact, this show is why I bought the albums.
B005ZB91KY|5|It is a good movie , lots of action . It would be  wonderful for a family time. or just hanging around with the big boys.
B008JFUN6E|3|I can't write a movie just because I like it,,,, you might hate it or you might not like it I haven't a clue ????  now they want me to add more words so the review will be passed,,, I think movies should not be reviewed,,,, every movie is different,,,, every person is different,,,, one man's paradise is another man's hell,,,,, so how dare I rated movie,,,,
141970642X|4|This was purchased for my 9 yr old, who really likes the series and has read all the books. He is happy with the book, and overall I'm pleased with the purchase.
067101756X|5|An incredible read - it is hard to put the book down for bedtime! The massive amount of cover ups the Government has used is mind boggling. It also provides an interesting correlation with modern, as we know it, wartime machinery.
B00900NAFI|5|Exhaustive catalog of the English language.  Has come in handy as a resource on multiple occasions.
031603441X|4|Good book that is worth the read. Keith was/is a very interesting person and the Stones history is cool as well.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Challenging but fun. Each level else offers something different so you never get bored playing this game. You won't regret getting it.
B00000DGUY|4|This remastered very best of replaces the 1988 Money For Nothing. On first glance one quickly notices how similar this compilation is to its predecessor. <br />It features the same single edits of Private  Investigations, Money For Nothing, and Brothers In Arms. Both also seem to  reflect the UK in terms of hits singles represented (the above mentioned  Private Investigations, Tunnel of Love).<br />However, one would have wished  it reflected the domestic market as well. Though Tunnel of Love is a  strongly written track off of Making Movies, I would have much preferred  Skateaway which was a hit single. This also neglects Industrial Disease  from Love Over Gold as did its predecessor.<br />Though this does hit all the  albums up to the live album, On The Night, Your Latest Trick (live) and  Local Hero/Wild Theme (live) are less interesting and could have been  dropped in favor of older material such as Down To The Waterline (which was  on Money For Nothing).<br />However, HDCD mastering, the inclusions of hit  songs from On Every Street, make this a slightly better retrospective than  the one replaced. And since Warner Brothers was supposed to remaster the  Dire Straits catalog several years ago as was done in the UK, and hasn't  (no surprise there), this is the only way to get remastered Dire Straits.  <br />However, I strongly recommend you track down these remastered imports.  Brothers In Arms, Making Movies, and Love Over Gold are worth the effort  and sound superb!
B00DPM7TIG|3|Too much skipping  between time frames and events of war.  Difficult to follow.  Rambled, could have been 100 pages shorter.  .<br /><br />Belong to a 16 person book club.  All but two people were of the same opinion.
B00HXYKYIE|5|What a wonderful and artful weave of a story...a mother and daughter's love, elephant life, mystery and intrigue. Well worth staying up too late!
B001VTTRC6|5|This is perhaps one of the best films of all time. It messes with your head, gets you thinking, and you come out a better person on the other side. Themes like family, trust, believing and supporting the people you love, being honest, and learning to grown past yourself are definitely centric. Incredibly well done.
B005LAIHZY|5|Super Cyber Monday Deal that I know my granddaugher will love over and over!  Disney Movies are Awesome and a true collectible.
B00AFEY354|5|What a remarkable movie.  I don't usually go in for the young adult / coming of age genre.  But I saw a clip of Ezra Miller promoting the movie.  He was cute and charming, so I wanted to see something he had been in.  I was expecting to be bored b the story within 5 minutes.  I was not.  This movie caught my attention and never let go.  Very powerful messages.  Terrific writing (can't wait to read the book, next).  Superb acting.  Why can't all movies achieve this caliber of awesome?
B00881VLCE|4|Great app, I just wish there was more puzzles to download. Other than that very relaxing, and would recommend thus to others.
B000N4SHOE|5|I loved this movie. I have watched it several times. If you like period moves this is good. Women had a hard time getting recognition for much of anything back them. I liked the story and the reviews afterword.
B00BVYNSLC|5|This was a find since I really connected to BBc by accident. It is a grest thriller. I highly recomend it too all.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|This one is so well done.  The puzzles are fluent and are set in a 3d dimension. The atmosphere indicate a deep yet unknown background.  The amount of words is just fine.  Actually I think the letters in submachine series are sometimes a little overwhelming. (But it's still the best)<br />Looking forward to the next game. Definite buy.
B0018J2QB8|5|The love affair with Lila was intense...I almost believed he was going to run off with her to save his hide...but his true colors came through!
B00KNWYDU8|5|I<br />t is a very nice game
B0039HR5QS|3|3 Days of the Condor is part of the 1970's paranoia limned in such films as The President's Analyst (1967), The Godfather Parts I and 2, The Conversation, The Parallax View, All The President's Men, Klute, and of Apocalypse Now.  All of these films contain the idea that an evil government agency is out to get you and you better run.  And you better run with a hot chick whom you tie up and abuse until she decides you're okay and has sex with you because you understand her.  Robert Redford plays a nerd (yeah, right) working for a CIA book reading section.  When his section is slaughtered by a dead-eyed postman and a stolid foreign guy while Turner is out getting lunch, the fun begins.  Something's wrong at the CIA.  Turner is being tailed.  Cliff Robertson can't eat a sandwich without being disturbed.  John Houseman makes judgements at a table.  Faye Dunaway takes pictures of empty benches.  This all should be great fun, but somehow, this film drags to it's inevitable conclusion.  So the CIA wants oil.  Big news, there chum.  This sort of film today would involve over-the-top CGI, including helicopter stunts, massive explosions, and surgically enhanced anatomies.  We must be thankful for small favors.
B000H5V8DG|3|Ok the box is great, beautiful, etc.... BUT ALL the dvds were scratched when they arrived, due to the bad packaging of the box. The discs are in cardboard sleeves which scratch the discs. I had to make paper sleeves for all of the dvds.... But fortunately, I can read them all, which is a good thing since I bought the box from France and I didn't know how to return it. <br />And one more bad surprise... I had to pay 30 more euros because of the customs.... So if you buy this box from France as I did, prepare yourselves for a little more expensive set... <br /> <br />Apart from that, the box is really really great and the show fantastic! Enjoy!
B004HO6I4W|4|My kids loved the movie so much I bought the BD for them to play it all day... my surprise? Spanish language on the movie is \\"Mexican\\" version and no \\"neutral\\" version, I am not Mexican, I don't live in Mexico and even though I have nothing against Mexico I don't like their slang and I think Fox messed up releasing this movie without spanish neutral version.
B007VUA7VO|4|The app does a good job--I can even have a voice tell me when the power drops to different levels (good if that happens while tablet is in standby).
B0089LOG02|5|Very interesting, I like the historical references also.  Keeps you involved through the whole story. Top notch.<br />Try it. You won't regret it.
0756405890|5|I read the Song of Ice and Fire quartet recently and, having been sucked into the fantasy world, looked for another book to quench my thirst.    Amazon recommended \\"The Name of the Wind,\\" and it was at my local library so I took the leap.    And I am quite pleased I did. It was nice to not have hundreds of ancillary characters introduced. It was nice not have 75% of your main characters die and have to switch your focus to secondary plot lines. And above all else, it was nice to have people actually LOVE each other for once. Not one time the thousands of pages of Martin's epic did I ever, EVER, get the feel that two characters really loved one another (well, not true. Daenerys seems to love for a brief moment - and then her husband dies and we have a burning birth of dragons. Great.) All of the main characters in 'Song' are rich and privileged when everything starts. And, of course, they get knocked down throughout the story, but you always know in the back of your mind that they will probably reassert their bloodline someday. Merit? Hell, no. The fact that your dad was so-and-so? Plenty. Stories of common folk? Please.    I read a few of the bad reviews of this book and I have to lend them some credence. While Kvothe does seem to be uber-man, he's not Jaime Lannister. He's not Eddard Stark. He's not Jon Snow. In fact, the only person as interesting as Kvothe in 'Song' is Tyrion, and he was completely ignored in the 4th book. Does Kvothe have great combat skills? Does he wield a \\"magic\\" sword? No and no.     I will say this though, many of the ideas are derivative. There was a review that claimed Rothfuss stuck Kvothe in University for so long due to the success of the Harry Potter phenomenon. I can't argue that - but it didn't bother me. In fact, I'd go farther than that. The Chandrian are very reminiscent of both the Nazgul AND the Sith...Star Wars' evil side. Far from being a bad thing, I think that's fantastic! I want bad guys! I want good guys! In 'Song' you would be hard pressed to find who the \\"good\\" people are and, as a few have said before me, it seems any and all \\"good\\" people get rewarded with their own head handed to them.    But on top of all this, and what shines through for me, is the writing. Moments, thoughts, and feelings come through clear as day. And you begin to sympathize, empathize with the main character. Sure, he's smart as a whip. But he gets thrashed repeatedly and saves his hide just barely. Why people find some guy surviving a medieval battlefield swinging a magic sword while sheathed in armor and living more believable than Kvothe, I don't know. But those novels exist, and they're welcome to them.    Sure Kvothe is an archetype. So? He's Luke Skywalker with out the lightsaber; Ben Kenobi without the age. He's Harry Potter without the lineage. I love these stories and I do not mind having them told with a new hero. But I think the heart of it all is love story. NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE, in 'Song' would sacrifice \\"honor\\" for love. I relate to characters like myself - flawed, aspiring for perfection, and always susceptible to the maiden. Well done, Mr. Rothfuss, well done.
B009NY43NY|4|It was a quick read full of the touches that I enjoyed from Mrs. Harris's other Sookie books. I wish there had been more depth to the end of her relationships with the vampire world and more closure on other beloved characters, but for the most part, I felt it was a good closure to the series.
1439165653|5|Much better read than the movie, although watching Helen Mirren is always a treat!  :)
B00C1BUYX4|4|I enjoyed this movie.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Game is fun and interesting.
B00KX44P22|5|This is a brilliant series taking us back to a way of life that served England well for many generations. It gives equal time to the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants, and every character is of interest. It is beautifully written by Julian Fellows, and the actors are all excellent. I am disappointed that the series will end with the Sixth Season.
B007J4T2G8|5|At first, I liked it, then when he introduced his idea of a playroom, I was a little turned off, but if you can get past the sex parts, it turns out to be a good love story, and you find out why he is \\"fifty Shades\\" messed up. All in all it is a great story.
B006MW3UZW|1|My wife loves this show so I'm jumping in here to tell you it stinks hahahaha
B00E9A656K|5|It is the most awesomeness game that I played on my kindle ever  it might be as awesome as minecraft pocket ed.
B000777J2S|5|My first review and I must say, this CD is better than everyone said it was. Antony has so much emotion in his voice, that it frequently brings a tear to my eye. Listen to this alone in a quiet room for optimal effect.
B0084AZXKK|5|I can't believe that I went all of my life without reading this wonderful classic. Well written with vibrant characters and great adventures. I really enjoyed it.
B006N9KFPC|5|Great vocals and energy in a cohesive album- the bonus tracks are great - get the deluxe version. Most of the songs are co-written by Adam and there are not enough accolades for the vocals and production, great for exercising, dancing, and chilling out.  Run, do not walk and get yours now!
B007VUCAVO|5|I've been using this on several devises and have found nothing to complain of.
B00881VLCE|5|There are several options for the number of pieces  for each puzzle.  There is also the option of rotating the each piece or have the pieces in the correct orientation.  There are several choices of free jigsaw puzzles or you can buy packages of themed jigsaw puzzles.  I am enjoying myself.
B00GH2SOM6|5|Very good story and well written
B000SGSU58|5|A classic. Wonderful writing, had me turning the pages as fast as I could. Great characterizations, but the character that stands out most is the city of Los Angeles. The rythms in the story match the rythms of city traffic, the sighs of the highway.
B0010YPTGU|5|Two of the greatest voices on planet earth Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman perform on this exquisitely produced dvd/cd combination. I   enjoyed the dvd tremendously and must say that the other supporting artitses were all flawless in their performances. Particular mention must be made of Heather Headley she was magnificent. To borrow a line from \\"tcm\\" this dvd is one of the essentials. highly recommended. .
B002ZG976U|5|Fun movie, wonderful music
B007FEFLTO|5|This book brings History to life and helps you understand the people of World War II.  If you wondered how wars start and why then read this book.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|This game is fun and easy on the battery of my Kindle. A good way to pass time and sharpen your hand eye coordination
B008JFUQ16|5|I really liked this movie, it was very funny, kept your attention. weather your an adult or child both can watch this movie and are happy that you did.
B007SGLZP8|3|This one didn't grab and hold my interest.  Usually I am anxious to get to the end and find out what happens but this one moved slower to the final conclusion.
B006GHA9VQ|4|I gave 4 stars instead of three because it's not just ok, but I don't love it.  It was good, had some pretty amazing moments.  Nothing will ever be as good as the original so don't expect it to be but expect an enjoyable show with a very dramatic ending.  It was good and the quality of recording was great.
B00D6SBOWG|5|Great fun  can't seam to leave it alone.
B000669GAI|5|All of Pearl Jam&#34;s great hits and then some. I am a recent fan of the group and am enjoying getting to know their work.
B00G6HW8II|5|To know english is so important. I am learning with this app so much
B0052UZIFA|4|THIS VERSION IS A NEWER AND BETTER IMPROVMENT OF THE ORIGINAL. THE GAME PLAY IS THE SAME BUT WITH MORE WAYS TO PLAY AND CONTENT THAT CAN BE BOUGHT.
B00EB6ENXO|5|I love it! What can I say? I am so pleased that they are bringing Ironman back from the dead for more movies. And as for Robert Downey, he had me at Less Than Zero.
B001AQO3QA|5|This is definitely one for the collectors out there.  I loved every minute of the director cut and all of the extras.  I cannot believe how crystal clear the images are compared to when I saw it as a kid.  I literally saw things that I never noticed in the theater and I do believe it is because of the blu-ray technology.  The storage is display worth and resembles a mini coffee table book.  I highly recommend this collector's edition.
B00FB13Y74|4|Definitely a very good game! The rest period is a downer, however it could be disguised as an eye saver and that is a good thing.
B009MEEZXI|5|A transforming movie.  Everyone should see it.
B00AE9UYJ4|4|Never having played a Slender Man game I did not know what to expect. Simple concept, easy to learn, fun to play what more can you ask for. Just make sure you are ready to get a chill down your spine... :)
0800141849|5|Both stars shine and are likable and funny. Streisand is funny and endearing as the ugly duckling. After her transformation she loses all of her lovability and becomes &#34;Just Barbra&#34;  Bridges is solid throughout .Nice story.
B000JRYOPG|1|The movie was tired i dont know wether it was the sound or picture quality but nothing kept me wanting to watch
B000TGZPOQ|1|Dont buy this if you are a Megadeth fan.  It sounds like crap compared to original recording.  Buy the original album.
0375707972|1|I was extremely disappointed in this book. The writing is of such poor caliber, it could have been authored by a grade school child.  It is  totally devoid of emotion and character development.  The writer lacks the ability to portray the emotions of a child experiencing his first sexual  encounter with a woman more than twice his age, from lust to excitement  through satisfaction and guilt.  There is no sense of outrage felt by the  reader as to the actions of Hanna and how she must have psychologically  affected him. He also manages to completely trivialize the horror of the  Holocaust and glosses over the effect of this terror on an entire country  and the shame that still burdens it. The reader almost feels empathy for  Hanna, as if the lack of education could ever possibly be an excuse for her  undescribable crime against humanity. The sole surviving Holocaust victim  is almost portrayed as hardened, unforgiving and uncharitable, and that was  described in about two paragraphs in total. The book was so shallow I had a  difficult time reading it, but I forced myself as this was the first book I  have ever read that was recommended by Oprah Winfrey.  I agree with the  customer who likened this book to &quot;The Bridges of Madison  County&quot;.  If you liked that book, you'll like this one.  If you loved  Pat Conroy's &quot;Prince of Tides&quot; or Alice Water's &quot;The Color  Purple&quot;, you will be sorely disappointed in this novel.
B007H7XJD4|5|This is just very cool to watch. Don't let poor reviews disuade you from watching this movie if you're a sci-fi or fantasy fan.
B000003CMB|5|Classic!
B001M2CBRK|2|I suspect everyone hired in this production was shown a dozen other military movies, which is the worst thing they could have possibly done.  If the theme is boredom, why punch it up with relentless music?  If the theme is discomfort or loneliness, why move the camera so often?  There is no inventive cinematography besides the oil wells and little character development.  I would have given 3 stars if not for the embarrassingly redundant voice over narration.
B006ID6NDQ|4|This is a novel of great courage and  of the determination to survive the formidable terror of the Nazi war machine. Beautifully written, it draws one in and is difficult to put down.
0553277472|1|A good friend raved to me about the book. I read it. Sorry everyone, but I don't think the king has any clothes on.<br />-BB
B000J10KTQ|5|great
B0053TMP24|5|This is an amazing book. I LOVE it. When will the next installment be out? WHEN? I LOVED it and the last one to. Rick Riordan is the best author ever!!!!!!!!!!! Kudos to you
B007ZGO7EM|5|great application. love that it saves the last calculation you have made while you do other things so it is there when you return. do far I wouldn't change a thing!!!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I think that flappy wings is an awesome game, I don't care if  people don't like it because it is a &quot;knock-off&quot;. It is Awesome.
B005CRQ2IU|4|This comic is absolutely amazing !! I wish I could have it in real<br />Life that would be amazing, a dream come true !!!
B005OCFHHK|5|This was a great price for all 8 movies! They come together packaged in a smaller package than I thought they would be in. So they are easy to store and easy to find because of the unique packaging.
B00AIUUXHC|5|best app evurrr!! yes u speller &quot;ever&quot; incorrectly on purpose! lol. anyways, I love this app and highly reccomend it.. to all of you who gave less than 5 stars, THAT IS INCORRECT!! LOL. jk. Some of those thoughts might have been true. c: but not for me.. this game is AWESOME!! Well bye little dinosaurs!!!<br /><br />----I&lt;3mustachezc:
B007J4T2G8|5|Loved this book and couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read next two books. fastest i have ever read a book.
B00164GDD2|3|ok.. i bought this just to compare to the hd one i recorded off HBO HD from Dish..<br />thoughts:<br />-alot of the scenes look amazing for the year that this movie was made.<br />+i had said MOST because there are alot of scenes that are just beyond grainy and get on my nerves. Im running a ps3 blu ray with a nice 50'' samsung plasma and proper hdmi cables..  its the transfer, not my equipment.<br />-audio is great for the most part as well.<br />-bonus features are nice to have..<br />-packaging is attractive to the eye<br /><br />final decision:<br />i like the one i recorded from hbo.. honestly - id rather have a 1080i that is pretty good 100% of the time, than a picture thats incredible for the movie but only 60% of the time, and 40% is grainy.. (those %'s are just estimates)
1423146735|3|My opinion of this book was that it was a let down. I mean, I have been looking forward to it for about a year now and I was expecting an amazing battle at the end that took up at least three chapters and was more descript than it was. Also, I was thrilled that Nico survived but I was definitely ready to say goodbye to at least two main characters that I like. I think that the end was very disappointing and still left me wanting to know more about the battle. I would recommend getting the book from the library to see if you think it is worth buying so that you don't waste money on a book that is just going to collect dust on a bookshelf in your house.
B00992CF6W|5|This is the best game ever and I can't wait for the 0.9.0 update in two days. You might want to get the game before 9.0 because it only gets harder. It is worth the money
B0082PR9H2|5|Dan Brown always entices with the depth of research and his engaging language.<br />His research uncovers so many true facts, that the amazingly few fictional connections make it read like an exciting history rather than a novel.<br />His short chapters entice you into the plot, until one is driven to stay up half the night so that one can find out how it all comes together at the final denouement.
B008HT4FUW|5|I can't believe when people are skeptical to give this show a chance. It's a true drama, but not boring at all, which is I think the misconception. The characters are wonderful and the story is captivating. The quality on blu ray is superb. Season 2 is shaking up to be better than Season 1! Wonderful.
B007ZGO7EM|5|I am 70+ and I did not like facebook because there was to much information out there with Groupme you only talk to who is in your group.
B008Y6U5AM|4|Funny movie. Worth watching once
B000UR9T8W|5|It was on time and I was able to give it to my son for Christmas and He has loved it.
B00003BDXG|5|I love this contraversial film, it was a real headline runner when it came out. The mixed message from Stone of dream, soap opera, media cirkus is probably more valid today then when it first came out.
1250038820|5|Some of my family are unable to understand the draw of NYC. When I saw this book I thought it represented what I love about NYC. I live in the burbs and go about 4x a year. It is the vast array of people and their works that I love. This book is beautiful and the stories make the subjects and the city come to life. Great read to go back to again and again.
B00DUGCLY4|4|I don't usually play games but this one is actually fun. Can't seem to stop! Definitely recommend for people new to apps.
B000002LRX|5|Personally, my favorite album from my favorite band. Unfortunately, I'm too young to have had the plessure of experiencing Faith No More when they were together. This was the first Faith No More album I purchased, and after listening to it and the other Faith No More CD's I've come to have more appreciation for the genius and complexity of albums and songs. This CD and Faith No More in general is the perfect example of just how, for lack of better words, \\"awesome\\" and \\"entertaing\\" music can be. <br /> <br />Land Of Sunshine - 5/5 <br />   One of the first songs I've heard on this album prior to purchasing it and one of the best ones on it. Good fast-paced beat with a great range of vocals throughout. The fortune cookie and self-help lyrics are a joy to listen to <br />Caffeine - 5/5 <br />   One of the more aggressive songs on the CD. Heavy rhythm that you can really get into. <br />Midlife Crisis - 5/5 <br />   Probably the most popular and and most mainstream song on the album, but for good reason. This song has FNM's press-titled \\"rap-metal\\" beat and lyrics in the beginning, which perfectly changes into a more alt-pop chorus. <br />RV - 5/5 <br />   This is hilarious, but just a good all around song at the same time. Crazy lyrics and a rhythm that transitions from a slow narrative to a faster, louder chorus. <br />Smaller And Smaller - 4/5 <br />   Another good heavy song with Mike's \\"Pattonted\\" growling scream. <br />Everything's Ruined - 5/5 <br />   Tied with From Out Of Nowhere as my favorite Faith No More song. Everything's Ruined simple has everything. It starts off with Patton's slow, moody voice, which       transitions into a heavy metal chorus, which again transitions into melodic singing with incredible background instrumentals. This song is truly an epic that must be heard. <br />Malpractice - 4/5 <br />   A straight up aggressive song with some crazy guitar riffs and a nice surprise in the middle. <br />Kindergarten - 4/5 <br />   A semi-slow, semi-heavy song with some enjoyable aution lyrics in the background. <br />Be Aggressive - 3/5 <br />   Not a bad song, but one of the few Faith No More songs that never really grew on me. Some interesting lyrics however. Oh, Roddy, and your crazy lyrics, :) <br />A Small Victory - 5/5 <br />   Another incredible and epic song that really adds to the variety of the CD. Great melodic guitar throughout and incredible vocals. <br />Crack Hitler - 3/5 <br />   Another good song, but one that I never really gave enough attention. The more I listen to it the more I like it though.  <br />Jizzlobber - 5/5 <br />   A pure heavy, aggressive, and loud song. Quite a treat for the metal fans. It's another good song that adds to the variety of the CD. After listening to this song and backing up only two tracks, you can understand the complexity and variety of this album. <br />Midnight Cowboy - 4/5 <br />   A perfect ending for the perfect CD. This slow instrumental song just fits as the conclusion to this CD perfectly.
B005PK57IK|5|This story is very well written and acted
B00CAUH7UE|3|Very interesting exposure to several forms of giving which always pays out as opposed to taking. A big long winded sometimes with too many repetitions
B004Y1USV2|1|No one can replace Jon Anderson. They need to &#34;hang it up&#34;. Will not buy another CD without Jon.
B00BAXFECK|5|This book was an amazing emotional journey! I absolutely loved it. The characters were so real and kept off the page.
B00CU8OVIM|4|His style isn't what I'm use too but I really like the ablum.  He's metaphorical artist with clear points.  No need to think too hard or be like &#34;wtf&#34; that got to do with anything like some other artist.  J Cole gets 4 stars and I will recommend his album to others
B001J66RG0|5|Very interesting watch. Overall I was glad I saw it and I think many people could enjoy this movie. A bit weird but awesome.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Great game
B0026NWBY2|5|\\"Let It Roll\\"....George, the shy Beatle...the quiet Beatle...the songwriter Beatle...That's right! George was the songwriter Beatle every bit as much as Moe & Larry or whatever the other two were called. Seriously, once George stepped up to the mic to sing one of his own...\\"Listen Do You Want To Know a Secret\\".....Listen, the real secret, maybe the greatest secret ever in pop music history was just how talented George HarriSong was... Once upon a time.....Far away....In a Cracker Box Palace filled with Old Brown Shoes, Weeping Guitars and Taxmen....So the important thing is to Beware of Darkness, resist The Devil's Radio and remember \\"If You Don't Know Where You're Going, Any Road Will Take You There\\". But most of all, MOST OF ALL, know that \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\". Shri Hare Krishna
0345440900|5|I read this book along with Brian Symon's book 'Silent Nights' and they both work. They did for me anyway. Both books are easy reads although have different strengths - I think they both compliment one another and make mothering an easier thing - well it did for an older mother like myself without a plethora of support around.<br />I really like Tracy's 'Easy' system, not just for the baby but also for my partner who was having difficulty figuring out what to do next. It was easy to explain and he didnt' have to read the book (which he flatly refuses to do). <br />Tracy has a whole section of analysing babies crys which is kind of useful - apparently all cries are the same world over no matter how individual we think our babies are. But in the end once you have a happy baby in a sort of routine then the cries don't usually matter as you seem to be able to predict what a baby needs pretty easily. She also helps to analyse what sort of baby you have and the best way of treating them to give them the best in life.<br />I like the confidence she gives to mothers in dealing with the babies needs and I also like the fact that this is a short relatively straightforward book.<br />If thereis one thing I dislike in all self help books it is the 'real life problem solved' stories. No matter how good Tracy is I got a bit sick of hearing how she solved everyone's problems - I know the book would be no good if she didn't and so that isn't really fair comment, its just a dislike I have for those sort of stories I guess.<br />Even though Hogg is the 'author of the moment it is a worthwhile read. If you are having problems with your baby, not having proper sleep, your baby is crying alot and you don't know why, or you know someone about to have a baby I would reccommend this book. I would also recommend you read the book by Symon as well though.

B0071BGOJC|5|The writer does good research, couldn't put it down, exellent use of the English language. Can't wait for the follow up.  The many characters turns some of the leisure into hard work to stay abreast of who is who in the story. Overall this makes for very enjoyable and informative reading.
B007J4T2G8|5|loved it read all three books they were talking about it on the radio station i listen to and my peers would talk about it.
0812993845|1|Although I continue to love the Shopaholic series, I think I'm aging out of the stand-alone Kinsella books.  Too madap and over-the-top, which I understand is what to expect in a Kinsella book (which leads me back to it no longer being for me).  I gave up about halfway through - I think I was more frustrated than Lottie and Ben.
B00B2JSRAS|5|I loved this book, I've reread this book a couple of times, it gets you thinking out of the box, I hope that everyone that reads this book may find what they were searching for.
B004UB9SKS|4|Since I don't know any French, I bought this to learn enough to get around before spending 5 days in Paris.  I needed an app that would work off-line, and this fit the bill.  I like how it was organized, with categories for basics, hotels, transport, etc.  The search feature also works well.  I didn't give it 5 stars because some of the phrases are a bit long, and you can't play them one word at a time to learn them.  For example &#34;Does someone here speak English&#34; is &#34;Y a-t-il quelqu'un ici qui parale anglais?&#34;  And the person speaking the phrase in French says it so quickly that it is hard to follow.  If it had the capability to touch one word at a time and hear just that word, it would be much easier to learn.  I don't regret the purchase, but for the money, it could be better.
B000MIVCX4|5|I use this receiver in my car with a Sammy UMPC.  There's lots of nav software to choose from and this piece of hardware works great with the few that I tried.  iNav is my current choice.  This unit holds up great in the high temperatures that my dashboard reaches.  On the way to lake Powell I had 11 satellites locked.  Driving east through Glenwood Canyon on I-70, I lost signal only a couple times and it was quickly regained seconds later.  If you are reading this review, just commit and buy this unit now.  You will not be sorry.  Also, this was my first experience with hardware and software of this type [GPS].  I don't think it could have been easier.  Let me save you some time though by letting you know that M$ Streets and Trips is absolutely worthless and is a total waste of  time, effort and money.  I don't hate M$.  It's just that their gps software really lacks.     EDIT:  This unit is still working EXCELLENT.  I now send it's incoming data to iNAV and Google Earth in realtime using a software GPS Gate.
B00PEXZZOO|5|In the first pages, this book doesn't claim to be a miracle worker. They don't promise a magical elixir that will cure your gout forever. What they do promise are a bunch of healthy recipes based on the logic that poor diet is the cause of many physical ailments, including gout.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm surprised that they picked gout as a focus since these recipes would be good for anyone simply looking to live better. I also liked that they don't waste a bunch of time explaining the benefits of each recipe, it just dives in with easy to comprehend step-by-step instructions. My suspicion is that results may be skewed by corrupting a healthy diet with the convenient unhealthy food we have thrown at us every day. If you can stick to the diet, there's a high chance of improvement.
6304712936|2|The film, Amadeus, is 5 STARS!  This version is only 2 stars.  I first had Amadeus on VCR tape, then decided to upgrade to the director's cut.  Bad idea.  Although the 2-disc director's cut comes with lots of extras on the second disc, the flow and intensity of the original film is lost in a muddle of extra scenes, which are in no way critical to the story.  In fact, not only do the extra scenes interrupt the pacing of the film, but they change it entirely.  So I decided to get the original version on DVD.  This is the best version, however, halfway through the film, you have to flip the disc over!  I can't understand the reasoning behind this when the director's cut, with the extra footage, was on one side only.  I have Gone With The Wind on DVD, which is also a \\"flipper\\", and I never watch it because of this.  What gives?  THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.  This is a major disruption to the flow of the story.  And if you want to switch to a different scene at the other end of the film, you have to flip it again.  Added to that, this version is AWFUL QUALITY! It is fuzzy, with fine lines and blips running through it.  This is why I gave 2 stars.  Is there a one-disc version which is all on one side??  Does anyone know?
B008Y5Q7SW|1|I rated it one star because we couldn't watch it through with our Roku.  It froze so many times during the broadcast that we went back to Netflix and watched something else.

B00011F5DK|5|This game is fresh every time you play it-- no two rounds are ever alike.  This is a really fun strategy game.  I love that the rules are simple (I HATE reading endless convoluted rules), but the strategy and thinking that go into it can be complex. This is a game that both kids and adults can enjoy.<br /><br />I noticed an explanation among the reviews of a way to play with fewer players-- that explanation was kinda complex.  Here's a simple way for 2 players to enjoy the board:  just use one color to create a design in the middle of the board or around the edges before you get started (a phantom 3rd player, in effect).  This is actually a really fun way to play-- it adds an interesting twist of difficulty, depending upon how you lay out your design.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|The scenery of the setting.  The wonderful engaging story line. The suspense of what's going to happen next.  The changing world as it always has been and always will.
B009QW7HMC|5|I have to say, with the combo of the books & comics...this is the best series ever!!  If anyone is worried it's all zombie gore, it's not! It's really about the characters & their struggles with who they have to become & how they change in the face of such adversities.  It really makes you wonder what you would do if you were in this type of situation.  Would you crack?  Still be the leader you are now?  To what lengths would you go to survive??

B00NM7IR26|2|I love Godzilla, but this movie was not great.  The trailer makes it seem like Bryan Cranston is the star of the movie.  He dies almost immediately and his &#34;son&#34;, portrayed by a no name actor is the lead.  Sorry, he has a name.  Aaron Taylor-Johnson.  I have never heard of him either...  Hollywood is going down hill.  That is all.  Thank you.
B00005JPNZ|4|A lot hasn't changed in 20 years.<br /><br />Indiana (Dr. Henry) Jones is still a professor in his day job, a swashbuckling, whip-toting, fist-flying finder of thingies on his side job as Archeologist Extraordinaire. Of course, this isn't really how archeology is pursued; but who cares?<br /><br />We find Indy at the start of this rendition in the trunk of a car, being made off with by the Evil Commie Russians during the Cold War of 1957 (come on, those of you of Russian descent; it's only a very, very hokey movie, operating from the mindset of the 50s). He has expertise their Fearless Leader wants to utilize(Fearless Leader: Commander Spalko - Cate Blanchett, in a throwaway role). She is after artifacts that exhibit mind control (jeez, where have we heard this plot before?). In the dry expanses of the Nevada desert, she has located the warehouse where all artifacts with intrinsic occult properties are taken to languish by the United States government, and she thinks Indy can help her decipher one of the most powerful ones.<br /><br />Plot gets in the way, however, and Indy escapes. Further along, still pursued by the bad guys, he meets up with Mutt, a young man who also is pursuing him for his own ends; Mutt's mother has been kidnapped in South America, and she has noted Indy as being her most likely savior, without explanation to her equally swashbuckling - but lacking in experience - son. He has tracked down our intrepid aging hero to aid in the freeing of said Mom.<br /><br />What follows is an almost nonending series of fights, flights, encounters, escapes, and pursuits, in true Indy fashion, over desert terrain, narrow mountain passes, and thundering, high waterfalls and rapids. There is nothing you might not expect; some pretty good special effects; and some crystal skulls that Mr Spielberg would have us believe point directly to the early intervention of beings from another world, who came here long ago for unexplained purposes, and who seem to want to impart some of their wisdom to us - but in a way that probably is not recommended for anybody.<br /><br />This was a movie primarily for those of us who have fond memories of Indy and his exploits (I must admit to being a fan of #1 and #3, but really, really grossed out at #2). It may seem a bit tired for a new generation, but darn, it's good to see Indy looking so fit at, what? 60? 65? Good to see Karen Allen too; she doesn't really seem all that much older. Cate Blanchett must have been free from filming for an uncomfortably long stretch; this movie seems out of her league. References to Rocky and Bullwinkle have been noted, and they are not too far off. I'm sure she'll rebound with a movie better suited to her talents next time.<br /><br />Also present, very briefly, was Jim Broadbent, a great British actor, and John Hurt, in another one of his quirky character roles, basically walking through his part virtually voiceless until the end. I miss that voice. His part was fairly limited but he did all right with what he had. Shia Labouef, as Mutt, was an interesting addition, and a bit at the end hints that he might pick up the torch and carry on as Indy's successor. I really can't see Indy doing another one. I'm there too, and at some point the bones put an embargo on further derring-do, but who knows? Anything is possible.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good couple of hours, and those of us who count Indy as part of our collective journey through life will want to include it in our libraries. Somewhat dated, but eminently watchable.- but in a way that probably is not recommended for anybody.

B0000844M8|5|Ok, I'm not a parent. But if I was one I would present this question to parents (and even adults for that matter) with young kids:  If you were to watch a family film at home and only had 2 choices with your kids would you pick:<br /><br />A. Transformers 27 or...<br /><br />B. Born Free 1965, no CGI, no robots, real life stuff ?<br /><br />Please reply.  I'm interested in responses...<br /><br />By the way, make sure you choose the WIDESCREEN option to watch the movie, as the full screen version does not do the film justice, but rather chops the movie up.
1594484775|4|I consider myself about the average American Nick Hornby reader.  Discovered him with \\"High Fidelity,\\" loved \\"How to Be Good,\\" never read \\"Fever Pitch,\\" saw the movie of \\"About a Boy\\" and promised myself I'd read the book, didn't like \\"The Long Way Down,\\" heard weird things about \\"Slam\\" and read it then heard great things about \\"Juliet, Naked\\" and after reading it, probably over-praised it to all my friends.  It's just really great, though.  Quirky, funny, unexpected, great characters, really interestingly told and a very fun read.  Hornby is obviously a great writer of males, but here he really nails a female perspective like few male or female authors can and I found myself relating quite a bit to the lead character and her predicaments.  Yes, you do play a little, \\"wow, yeah, that's mainly Dylan, but I think I heard that story in relation to another singer-songwriter,\\" but it just adds to the fun as it's hardly overdone.    Thank goodness for this Nick Hornby.  May long he reign.
038551123X|4|Another excellently written story.  Draws you in and doesn't let you go until the last page......and leaves you begging for more!

B00000IMYA|5|I heard the whole thing last night on WKCR (NY), spun by producer Phil Schapp, as the finale for the 2 week long Ellington 24/7 special.  It easily lives up to the impossible moniker as one of the best jazz concerts  ever.  You have to hear it to beleive it - it will blow your socks off.  It  is truly a miraculous concert with an amazing history.  This record will  become as standard as a no. 2 pencil.

B004JN1CW4|5|I loved this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action and adventure. There are some sad parts, but that's what brings it all together. Great book!
B000Y7U98W|4|I completely understand why people would hate this film. The final act is such a violent swerve in pace and story, a bad misdirection, that it detracts from the whole.    However, the subduing soundtrack, mixed with some vibrant, beautiful, directing techniques had me transfixed.    The story is of the dysfunctional crew of the Pegasus. A deepspace craft whose sole purpose is to reignite our dying star. Much like Pacino's 'Insomnia' there is a strong sense of days, weeks and months bluring into one long day. The editing and direction conveys the lulling, tired and taught crew's emotions with vivid perfection.    I found a wonderful beat to the action, which is slow, akin to 2001 Space Oyssey. But the majesty of the voyage, the Pegasus, and the relationships of the fraught crew is very gripping.    It's a shame Boyle didn't have a great ending, as what he came up with feels a little like he had a great concept but couldn't fulfil the final act. That's probably a little unfair as it does fit well with the theme of finding and becoming God, the giver of life. Still, the Zombie-esque finale doesn't quite fit.      It's not a film for most, perobably a sunday afternoon film to snooze to in most cases, but I liked it.    Space is Man's final conquest. The nature of our species is to explore and discover. It's what drives us to evolve. Our Solar system is so close, yet so far from our grasp, and anything that brings me closer to it excites my senses.
B00H9KKGTO|4|It was ok, but has a lot of sex, nudity and language.

B006GKHE6G|5|it is very cool game. and its almost. as cool as what ever you think.is cool it works great for kindle fire
B00004XMV6|5|This is the film started it all. The story line is simple.  A cool, distant man, Mickey Rourke, a beautiful charming woman, Kim Bassinger, who was pushed by the man that she loved into doing some things that she would not normally do. The movie was all about the man, the woman and his games. The whip scene made the &quot;Un-Rated&quot; version but not the theatrical version. This scene gave the theatrical version a x-rating. The film was well written, well acted and directed and the themes worked so well that Mr. King used simular themes in the films &quot;Two Moon Junction&quot; and &quot;Wild Orchid&quot;.

B006WXW098|2|Yuja Wang played beautifully as usual. My gripe is the recording, which failed to accommodate the wide dynamic range of her playing. I'm tired of changing the volume, turning up before and turning down after some songs. Also, while the sound is not exactly echoey, there's a ring to it. Again, that's a deficiency in the recording.
B00AHGSVKS|5|I first read this as a adolescent in the 1970 - still as good as I remember.  One of the first stories (along with The City and the Stars) that first turned me on to Clarke.

B007GCY8FS|5|Lee Child never let me down
B00006AW2P|5|The value of this album, as a memento of the enormous impact the Stones had when they first burst upon the scene, has been amply confirmed by all and sundry here, by reviewers since 2002. I might add that, for me personally, the advent of the Stones blew the Beatles onto the backburner for ever. Lovely harmonies and weepy love sentiments were nice, but this was something else. Man, this was raw, this was adult stuff, and for a reason: most of it was written by lusty old musicians who spoke in a code about things forbidden by the \\"polite society\\" of their time. It would be a while before the white kids who first heard this figured out what \\"king bee\\" and the honey he was seeking were all about, and that \\"making love to you\\" didn't actually mean wooing a schoolgirl under the moonlight. What strikes me today is how well the album came out. There was so much snickering at the time, about none of these newfangled bands knowing how to play an instrument decently, and although the kids didn't care about that, they pretty much assumed it might be true. Well, not at all. For beginners, the boys had incredible chops. Although keith had only about three licks to his name, he did them with such abandon that they came out stellar - and don't forget that in the studio, where the screaming of girls doesn't cover your fumbling, it takes extra courage and several takes to get it right. In fact, listening to the albums that came after this one, you get the impression that he had already been made somewhat self-conscious and his solos were less adventurous in speed and just sheer reliance on luck. And no, in spite of the fact that the media had crowned Brian the geniuis of the band, he did not play those searing solos, Keith did. And while Bill's bass was yet to be given the prominence it deserved, here he already contributes to the incredibly percussive, bottom-smooth Stones sound, along with Charly. Ironically, Mick is perhaps the least Mick he would ever be. His passionate and affectless singing is on fire, but on \\"Can I Get a Witness\\" he's practically unrecognizable.<br />As for the virtues of the SACD version, well, there definitely are many, but they are subtle. Frankly, if you have the first version of the CD (1986, I think), you're fine too, save your dollars for a rainy day. As is very often the case with material from that era, you simply cannot create miracles out of crappy old tapes, remaster as you may: you raise the volume until your ears bleed, and inevitably, you can only do that because you have digital means of shaving off extreme top and bottom dynamics that would otherwise translate into distortion. But basically, it's the same product it always was - clearer and louder, but that is hardly the point with a primitive rocker from the sixties anyway, is it? Pandemonium is half the charm. I am thankful to the engineers for not attempting to polish this beyond recognition - the tape hiss on a few songs is worse than ever (on one song, you can hear tape deterioration), which is part of the remastering price, and they left it that way rather than massacre everything to obtain a pristine copy it was never meant to be.ctless singing is on fire, but on \\"Can I Get a Witness\\" he's practically unrecognizable.

B00I6JOBTI|3|Bought this for my grandsons to watch.  They got bored after about 10 minutes and started doing something else.  I didn't watch it more than about a minute because it was just too immature for me.  Might be ok for some kids, and my grown daughter seemed to like some of the humor, but if I could do it over, I'd get a Bob the Builder DVD or Thomas the Train.

Then the author traces the rise and eventual decline in knowledge workers and the implications.<br /><br />As we enter the Conceptual Age, we will be more concerned with feelings and experience than with material things. This gives more importance to the right brain directed activities.<br /><br />He then discusses what he calls the \\"six essential right brain directed aptitudes: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play and Meaning.<br /><br />Pink makes a very compelling case that we are moving away from the focus on accumulating more material things to a focus on more meaning in life.  If you expect to succeed in this new world, you will need to become more in tune with the High Concept - High Touch way.  \\"Meaning is the new money\\".<br /><br />A very important work that looks ahead rather than toward the past and gives us a good sense of where to focus our efforts.<br /><br />A very thought provoking work.

B00BSBR9N6|4|Found myself laughing out loud from the very beginning.  Don Tillman is such a funny, unique character. However, it helped me to understand some oddities about my own personality.  It's even possible that many of us fall somewhere on the Asperger's spectrum if there is such a thing as an &#34;Asperger's spectrum&#34;.

B00KNWYDU8|5|Nice job, good dragons, awesome fighting, and nice ELEMENTS!
B0031RAOVY|5|Our family loves our dogs.  So maybe that is why we all loved the movie so much.  It was so great to see a G rated movie that adults and children enjoyed from beginning to end.
B002MQYOFW|5|I love this book this time I read it in one day but I've red it twenty eight times woo hoo
B00FAPF5U0|3|Addicting. Spending too much time on it!
B00B7Y0206|1|Cant search for anything i need an account for this app
B00005LC1H|5|I'm not someone who would watch anything twice, but somehow I've watched this three times (and counting) and also bought it for friends because everybody should own this great classic.  It's just wrong to go on living without seeing this.
B003G4W49C|3|It was an interesting perspective, but totally geared toward Gamers.  The fact that the main character was so young and gifted hints at genetic tampering.  I also saw his training as a form of conditioning or brainwashing. Rather Scary from my perspective.  I unfortunately found the ending to be Anti-climactic.  Perhaps the movie will prove to be visually stimulating.

B00IX9UTLU|5|Great , loved the story line.

B000JML90Y|4|I have heard this book referenced many times. I finally decided to get myself a copy. Totally worth the read and really got me thinking.
1608872750|5|I admit it. I had no clue what this book was going to be. I ordered it because I've loved the \\"Art of\\" books from Marvel and thought this would at least be fun. I wasn't wrong.  So what is it? Something of an art book crossed with a technical manual with a dash of scrapbook thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The book is split into seven sections: 1) Understanding Tony Stark, 2) Stark Industries: A History of Innovation, 3) The Forging of Iron Man, 4) The Mansion and the Workshop, 5) Weaponization: the Iron Man Armors, 6) Global Threats and 7) Mr. Stark's Allies.  Like the \\"Art of\\" books, this manual has a lot of color photographs of locations, people and the armor.  Where this book differs is that it's all presented as real. The photos are of Tony Stark, his home and workshop, etc.  The book reads like a corporate dossier, as prepared by JARVIS. \\"Stark Industries\\" is printed on the cover (not Marvel!).<br /><br />Like a technical manual, there is a lot of detail on the armors - ALL OF THEM. There is at least a small pic and a blurb for each of the Iron Legion and larger exposes of Tony's main armors. It even goes into details regarding weaponization, gauntlet design, inside the helmet, etc. All referenced as real artifacts - not as concept for a film.  There are fold-out pages, schematics, etc. But what really makes this book special is the scrapbook aspect.  There are Post-It notes, memos, pamphlets, etc. \\"glued\\" in throughout the book. There is even a blue folder inserted (it is bound in) at the beginning which includes Christine Everhart's article on Tony, his notecards from the press conference, his business card, and pics!  One Post-It is a reminder that he needs to come up with a \\"real name\\" for the element he discovered for the Nobel Committee to use.  There are memos from SHIELD, including Black Widow's assessment, as well as a visitor badge to Stark Industries, and so much more. These are like little Easter eggs scattered throughout that make the book a lot of fun to go through.  As a Loki fan, I was delighted to find the God of Mischief has a couple of pages under \\"Global Threats,\\" right alongside Whiplash and Mandarin.<br /><br />The production values are excellent. Not only does the book have a red leather cover, with cloth spine, but it is smyth-sewn (not glued). This means the book lies open flat without damaging the spine. Very helpful for a \\"manual\\".  There's no dust jacket, as befitting a technical manual, and the paper is thick and high quality.  Full color glossy pages throughout - a truly beautiful book.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this enough to Marvel fans in general, but especially to fans of Iron Man. A truly unique book that is actually worth the retail price. Highly recommended!lot of fun to go through.

B007SYWFRM|5|I'm having loads of fun with this game!!!  It gets a bit challenging at times, but keeps me occupied.  This is not just a children's game.
B006IGZWB2|5|A great movie. Moving drama. Funny at the right parts.  I recommend this movie to people who appreciate a plot rather than a movie with mere special effects to get an audience.  Plenty of swearing but seems to work for the type of people in the story.  No sex scenes.  The characters are good.  You will want to hate the baddies and feel tremendous empathy for the Help.
B00P77ZAN8|2|I was very excited to learn that hearthstone would be ported to Android. While I enjoy it on my PC, it would be nice to play through a few games during my lunch while at the office, or during my long morning commute. I was excited to see a large, green check next to my device on the Amazon page. I assumed that a green check saying my device is compatible actually means that my device is compatible. Shame on me for forgetting how Amazon works. After I downloaded the application, and started it for the first time, I received a message saying that my device was not actually compatible, and that the game would run slowly. Slowly is when you saunter back to your desk after lunch, or break; dreading the rest of the workday. Slowly is watching your children clean up before going to sleep at night. Slowly is watching the minutes tick by as your wife hamsters on and on about why she doesn't have time to visit the gym you pay for, or clean the house she sits in all day, because she is SO busy. Yes, those gossip magazines and reality TV are a real chore to endure.<br /><br />No. This game doesn't run \\"slowly\\" at all. It barely runs. It's like being behind a fat woman at a buffet who just discovered the mashed potatoes.<br /><br />No fault to Blizzard on this, because they can't be expected to support all flavors of Android devices. Kudos to them for even pushing it to that OS in the first place. My ire is directed solely at Amazon. If my device isn't fully compatible, throw me a warning before I take the time to fully download the application.<br /><br />**EDIT: I currently have a second generation Kindle Fire. The model from 2012.
B004ZJZQH4|4|Alright, this film is a classic. Some of my best childhood memories involved me watching this with my dad, it sparked a life-long interest in space and me to become a science major. Whenever I go to the air and space museum, I can't help buy smile like a little kid when I see Gene Kranz's vest in a display case. The special effects have aged well. The educational and entertainment value of this movie are marvelous and I will probably end up buying another release in a few years to show my kids should I ever have them.<br /><br />Now the blu-ray release:<br />All I cared about was picture quality, and in that sense, the release delivers flawlessly. It is not a lousy blu-ray port unlike some I've had to deal with. I had not bothered upgrading from the VHS release because the picture was so crisp for a tape (and was better than some early DVD releases). I held out for a release that had something that made it worth the double dip.<br /><br />Problems with the BD release:<br />Ok, so in order to make the blu-ray look \\"fancy\\", universal has added a bunch of silly junk. You can't really pause the film: it only stays paused for about a minute and then turns to a Universal logo screen saver. You can return to the film eventually.<br />There is also a bunch of superfluous functionality that I haven't bothered messing with because I don't care. I just want the movie in higher quality and that's what I got, so I'm ok.<br />The trailers are a non-issue if your player is not connected to the internet.
0763644765|5|My toddler is very amused with this book and laughs every time I read it. I just got this book yesterday and read it more than ten times! Very good choice when starting to potty train.
B006LSZECO|3|Very slow beginning, exciting middle, disappointing end. Needed more closure. Possibly a sequel in the work s?  Three star s.
B003WUYRGI|3|I would recommend the internet instead of the dictionary definition from this book. Next time l need the definition of a word I would use the internet.
B00AOVXOQW|5|Loved by our pediatric patients during their wait.<br />The cement mixer drum rotates as the car moves forward.
1250007305|5|Do you like techno-thrillers where the author gives a bit of assembler code to illustrate a point, and let's you watch someone at work while they dump the strings in a binary? If you've ever had the slightest bit of experience in analyzing malware you will appreciate that in this book.<br /><br />What makes Zero Day stand out is the author's background and credibility, its focus on cyber terrorism and how realistic it is. It's fiction, but not beyond possibility. There is a lot of reality in Zero Day. When the central character, Jeff Aiken, remarks that a piece of malware \\"seems Russian\\" at first glance, there are actually real reasons for that.<br /><br />We see failures and attacks of all kinds all the time, but for Jeff Aiken, a former government analyst who lost his love in the attack of 9/11, he sees a pattern, and given his background, he pushes the issue. Jeff teams up with a beautiful US-CERT expert Daryl, and as they unravel the mystery the action spills out into the real world towards the end of the book.<br /><br />Even if you don't consider yourself to have much computer expertise, you should not be put off by this book. The explanations are very good and don't get in the way of the story.<br /><br />As well as technical aspects being realistic, the book is well written. The chapters are short and sharp, with memorandums and news stories interspersed throughout the book, which was a nice touch. I read it within one and a half days. It was well paced and highly enjoyable.
B00RNRD7Y4|5|It's been a long time that a movie made me laugh out loud multiple times. Yes, it's silly but it's SUPPOSED to be! I don't get all the 1 star ratings. This movie is hilarious and is a perfect example of political satire. It's poking fun at a ridiculous dictator. This is a good thing people so just enjoy and have a laugh.
B001RONJYC|5|Excellent
B00FN811SY|5|Best app ever! Thanks so much for an easy to use UI. The effort put in to this is greatly appreciated!
098478280X|2|EDIT Nov 6, 2012: To those who felt my original review is an overreaction, I went back to the book to try a few algorithms AGAIN to hopefully be inspired and benefitted by the book.<br /><br />All I want is the truth about what does/doesn't benefit the software community collectively.<br /><br />To review my stance: this book is AWESOME, but it's worshipped like crazy by famished and job-hungry programmers. But also, it teaches bad habits, which is what triggers my need-to-troll a bit. Just enough to balance these perspectives out. One example of a bad habit is, the book uses Java but doesn't use Java naming conventions, i.e. most variables have meaningless names that aren't obvious at a glance. Doctors get to scribble on a pad, but applying the same attitude to code will make the next person in charge of your work, well, become the next incredibly frustrated hulk. Pads end up in the trash. Your code is expected to survive the apocalypse.<br /><br />On page 97, there's a solution to the problem of \\"Erase all recurring characters in a string without creating a second string.\\"<br />Copied the code there into my IDE, made sure it was verbatim, and it DOES NOT do what it says at all.<br />Reading through the code, even to my mind, the approach made little sense. So I started coding my own--it worked and was simple (and I'm pretty slow at algorithms in general). So what is the point of finding that flaw?<br /><br />Simple. Algorithms are an internal art of the logical mind tempered by a reasonable drive. The BEST don't challenge people at a whiteboard. We have computers now, didn't you know? The BEST aren't putting their faces in a Q and A book, filling their brain RAM with trivia.<br /><br />When Einstein was asked to recite his home phone number, he looked it up in a phonebook, because memorization is a vain way to go long-term. If you believe in keeping all your data in the front of your brain (RAM) instead of storing it to disk for later, you'll have a rough time figuring out why your server crashes every time someone uploads a 20mb file. Jackie Chan in Forbidden Kingdom: \\"your cup is already full.\\"<br /><br />It teaches non-holistic ways. Which is fine for a regular job. But applying to the top companies by memorizing 'X out of 150' algorithms...I guess that style is fine for the Microsoft side of things. But it's the reason why companies HAVE to be so strict now. Too many zombies/duds applying.<br /><br />It took 20 years and a team to create a viable formulation for Quicksort. Experts who try to optimize it almost always make it worse. As a Java developer I lay my trust in true subject matter experts who work together to create solid tools we can all reuse. What a waste of life time to reinvent low level code for any reason other than research and practice. I never thought I'd see a cult following in the software industry but here it is. Want to see a book with GREAT interview questions? Java/J2EE Job Interview Companion by Arulkumaran K. Thank me later.<br /><br />Algorithms are opinions. It's 'how I see the problem and the solutions that happen to come to mind'. They are snowflakes. So be a snowflake, like algorithms. Then you'll understand more and faster. Don't be another sweatshop coder if you're aiming for a fulfilling lifestyle.<br /><br />Visit careercup.com and you'll see the primary audience there. :/<br /><br />============== ===Original=======================<br /><br />I've had this book for awhile, and was first enamored with its promises. But the entire book and Gayle's career has a pompous side to it, that shows 'need of approval' and staying 'in' with the boys at the top. That's fine for those who've cruised the Ivy League wagon all the way but not helpful for people who need to meet real market needs, like building enterprises and leading best practices.<br /><br />Books like this only help you memorize, keep your head filled with answers, and no mental energy left to ponder the evolution of technology itself. I personally spend day and night, minus sleep, investigating \\"the best and greatest\\" in software land (because there's enough people in the world who naturally enjoy learning data algorithms already); but what I find here is an author who has a short-lived career in practical product development, and more of a theoretical counselor helping you to jump hoops. This life coach helps you give in to a dying legacy system instead of finding your own way, unique strengths, and opinions that challenge the guys at the top. If we all sat around and studied the same 100 algorithms, we'd be a society that knows 100 algorithms collectively. Let people specialize and shine so we can have more progress. This stale fashion of revering tradition is labeled \\"groupthink\\", something a serious HR should know about. You want to be another sweatshop coder? Or someone who can't be replaced, easily?<br /><br />Notice that the author mentions this 5 star book and that she is \\"founder and CEO of CareerCup.com\\" everywhere, but at the end of the day, it's just a book and a website. And a whole lot of theory about the social workings of big companies in their 15 years of fame. If data algorithms be your passion, read something written by a true artist and practitioner of code, not an honorary HR/whiteboard scribbler. Here's a sample of a gem you'll get from this book:<br /><br />\\"Proofreading: Some companies will throw out your resume just because of a typo Please<br />get at least one native English speaker to proofread your resume.\\" ... how intuitive.<br /><br />The saying \\"There are those who can do and those who can teach\\" comes to mind here. Gayle honestly reminds me of myself when I'm in a desperate mode, being apologetic to employers, and basically having to act less than human to get a shot. I went another way--found out what companies REALLY want and can't find much of, then became that. As much as they'd like to tell you, you can't pick up api knowledge overnight and start winning,after 6 years of just toying with sorting char arrays. By the time you become \\"the perfect student\\" you'll find in front of yourself a world that demands more realistic skills, the kind that has only come into existence recently. And guess what? Everyone's grandmother will know how to bubble sort by the time you finish this book. But only a fraction of developers in the world will know how to throw a cloud in the air and make it stretch and dance like big businesses want and need.<br /><br />Life skills: they don't teach you that in school.

0446693804|5|Nicholas Sparks is an author whose works epitomizes love, devotion, and loyalty.  Most of his books such as his classic, \\"The Notebook\\", flows smoothly and translates well into a drama movie.  His book, \\"A Walk To Remember\\", is my favorite of all his books.  It too translates well into a movie.<br /><br />There are differences between the movie and the book.  The theme is familiar and maybe even common.  The big difference is how he executes and allow the story to be told and flow.  Reading \\"A Walk To Remember\\" is like taking a long pleasant walk.  You tend to feel more refreshed and energized after the walk.<br /><br />There are many books that have differing characters but have a common thread of love.  This book will stand out.  It is Sparks best book.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"

B00J1IQUYM|3|I follow a young celeb on IG and shed posted she was reading this which peaked my interest. Personally, I love post-apocalyptic stories. And I love parallel plots. This one to me seemed desperate to be a story. The Symphony in this book seems like a reference to validate the \\"need\\" for celebrities. How arrogant to think in time of post-plague, something as insignificant as thespians should be the occupation to choose for survival. They travel btwn settlements \\"performing\\" , I guess I'm more in the survivalists camp when the world ends. Farmers, inventors, medical professionals.. Those are valued occupations when the world ends, I don't care if you can read Shakespeare.. Sorry it was a lame story line

B000003S5H|4|This is one of the first CDs I pop in my stereo when I'm just chilling in my room and I'm in a mellow mood. It's very pleasant and enjoyable. I'd say &quot;Moon Safari&quot; is a very aptly titled album. My only problem is track 3, &quot;All I Need&quot;. I just think it's a bad song (one of the few tracks on the album that can be called a song) and goes against the general &quot;spacey&quot; theme of the album as a whole. &quot;Sexy Boy&quot; is an obvious standout. &quot;La Femme d'Argent&quot; and &quot;Talisman&quot; are excellent as well. If you're like me and enjoy a wide spectrum of tempos and atmospheres in your music collection, then pick up &quot;Moon Safari&quot; and add it to the lighter side of that spectrum. You will like it.
B005CRQ2IU|5|Much has been said about the graphic novel, Watchmen, a collection of the 12 issue 1985 comic book series written by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. I have little to add but my admiration. It's a beautifully structured story and could not have been told in any other medium. The movie directed by Zack Snyder did its best to turn its words and pictures into shots and cuts, but nothing substitutes for the original. This Kindle version does the graphic novel one better by showcasing the art in crystal-clear digital goodness, so I highly recommend it for reading on a tablet or computer.
B00BHHIWQO|5|Fun game, I enjoy playing it.
B006LSZECO|5|This book had me from the start! Super engaging and great plots twists throughout. Though I was hoping more from the ending, this was one of the best books I've read in a long time!! Great read!!
0440133688|5|Great book. Keeps you coming back.  I have rec. it to several young doctors. A must read book if you're in the medical field.
0767803434|4|That line itself is the most classic line of all from this smash hit! Harrison Ford plays the president who after making it clear to the world he will never negotiate with terrorists falls victim to a terrorists hijack of Air Force One! The president is pressed to the ultimate limit when his wife and daughter are held hostage by a Russian goon (Played so deliciously by Gary Oldman)! With the fates of the world & his family both hanging in balance, it up to the president to kick some ... Although the dialog & action is 100% macho, some of the CGI effects for Air Force One leave much to be desired. When you see the end of the movie, you'll know what I mean! Still it has heart and attitude which makes it out to be a true action classic!
B00003CWL6|3|American Beauty certainly isn't a bad movie, in fact parts of it are hilarious.  It just isn't as profound as it would like to be.  The &quot;message&quot; is that sometimes things are not what they appear.   Yeah, I think we all know that, big deal.  If American Beauty had just been  a comedy, it could have been great, but it has an awkward tone that ruins  everything.  Another flaw is that it isn't nearly as shocking as the  filmmakers would like to think it is.  It is like if Todd Solondz's  Happiness was sanitized and watered down for mass consumption, removing  anything interesting or thought provoking.  American Beauty seems like it  is a sitcom with profanity in it, and ironically, it was written by a  former sitcom writer.  The acting is very good but not Oscar worthy  (Russell Crowe deserved to win, without a doubt).  All in all, you might as  well watch it, just to see what all the fuss is about, but I don't think it  is worth buying.
B00GK65HWE|4|The movie was well done albeit they did stray from the book at times. The special effects were well done and the story flowed smoothly.
B000000OUW|5|As an incarnated Manowar fan I was very exited about how this album would be before it was released. I have all the Manowar albums and I wasn't sure if they could manage to create another masterpiece as the previous releases. But they did! The Louder Than Hell album fits right in to the fine collection. It is an outstanding CD full of adventures and excellent performed metal music. The music style on this album is very alike the style the play on the Kings of Metal album and the Fighting the World album. Well, if you like Manowar or adventure metal in general this album is album will suit your CD drawer perfect...

I can record multiple things in less time especially when I'm just messing around to get a feel for a song<br />4) comes with a memory card and batteries so it was ready to go out of the box.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) battery life is weak<br />2) built in mics have to be placed very well so not to pick up other noises and only what you want.
B0063IH60K|5|its great to find the simple and fast version. that way when I have a couple of minutes of free time, I can set back and enjoy my favorite game.
B0091WNK8M|5|great movie made for my generation but timeless even my 3 year old loves it and was quoting it the next day.
B00992CF6W|5|Minecraft is the best/greatest game ever!!! I have a giant imagination and love to build new things everyday! Most people are complaining about the 0.9.0 update and how it's not coming as the release date tells, but the makers need time to add all to cool things. Like the infinite worlds and newer mobs (such as wolves, villagers, enderman and slimes). This game is SO Worth 7$!
B008NW67E0|5|The music on this CD is pretty good but this high rating is more for the fact that it was delivered ahead of time by almost a week and also the CD and case is in excellent condition
B0054JZC6E|4|I love this game it is full of action and fun. This is a great game for kids 15and under
B0091W7K6K|5|Bullitt remains as a classic police drama with one of the best car chase sequences of all time. Steve McQueen's understated performance stands in stark contrast more contemporary police portrayals that are often over the top. Good acting throughout, good storyline and a great chase scene with what are today some truly classic cars from the 60's.
B00VFTD43A|5|Great acting, great script, and it's all based on a real person
B004UJAOLM|1|This book sucked when I read it in high school and nothing has changed.  It's tedious and boring and doesn't really do anything but go on and on.  I know it's been deconstructed, examined, explicated and referenced thousands of times....but it just sucks.<br /><br />I don't like the author or anything she writes.  If you like picking petals off of flowers while blankly staring at a white wall for 9 hours straight, you will like this book.  If you like not being bored, then avoid this, even if it's free.

B009TGODOK|4|Barcelona, with its gloriously rich architecture and European sensibility, is the star of this movie. Woody Allen filmed in only the most beautiful sections of this Spanish city, and in so doing, makes us fall in love with it as well. The story line is a familiar one -- how many of us have been in a beautiful vacation spot and longed to stay there and build a life? While on vacation, a couple of friends, played by  Rebecca Hall (Vicky) and Scarlet Johanssen (Christina) meet the painter Juan Antonio, played by the very sexy Javier Badem. He invites them to join him on a short plane ride to another city. He's very forthright in his invitation: he wants to sleep with them both. Christina agrees, but Vicky, who is engaged, is horrified by the boldness of his request as well as her friend's willingness to run off with a stranger. These characters are two sides of the same person. But it's when Penelope Cruz arrives on the scene that the movie's plot comes alive. Penelope's Oscar is well-deserved. She plays Maria Elena, Juan Antonio's unstable, emotional ex-wife, also an artist. I enjoyed this film, but it's not for everyone. The movie has a narrator, which can be irritating, but seems necessary to explain the settings and to move the plot along. Woody Allen is a romantic whose focus on the beautiful cities of Europe gives us a glimpse into the culture and loveliness of this part of the world. I'm glad I saw this movie. Now I need to go to Barcelona.
