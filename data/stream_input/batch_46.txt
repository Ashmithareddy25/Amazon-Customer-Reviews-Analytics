B00EXGRRJE|5|Works great
B00GMRM3KA|5|Great headlight! Big improvement over the standard headlight.
B000CGK0AC|1|Unit fit as described and was an easy install, however as soon as I started my vehicle regulator began squealing and hammering. Never did quit. After 30 minutes I removed and installed my old unit. No more noise. Haven't returned because I'm so disgusted.
B008XSU9NO|1|One of the two worked when I received them. One came in two pieces(that was surprisingly the one that worked) these are extremely cheaply made.
B000BZI2HC|5|Perfect fit for 2002 Pathfinder. SES light is out and I passed emissions.
B000F15R5C|5|fits like a dream, makes my dash look great and will now protect from the hot sun.

B001DRGB8E|5|Great heavy duty rotor.
B00J1VW47G|1|It does not fit right<br />Had to put in a lot of spacers to make it work<br />Description was terrible
B00JEUI0MW|2|Great, but yellow color not happy with.
B001AXCSJC|4|Order a size smaller than you normally wear! I ordered a women's size 7, and I thought they must actually be a men's/boy's size 7 and were mislabeled. Thankfully these reviews clarified that issue. I will be exchanging these boots for a size 6.
B0108MF9TG|5|good deal and quality construction
B00852684M|1|Horrible quality. Looks like a product you can buy from the dollar store.
B0026T75BA|5|works good
B00VSH3OCK|1|Awful, does not fit properly on 2 stroke engine what so ever. Also does not come with the pin to hold in the camshaft so make sure you save your pin from your old clutch. If your clutch blew up as mine did and your pin is gone, good luck.
B002HUJVC4|5|Perfect for my 85&#34; K5 blazer
B00IKSK5JK|1|It's not chrome at all, it's plastic with chrome paint, doesn't fit , piece of s***, i'd rather smash it than return it, so nobody can be seen in public with this on their bike.
B000BZI13C|5|Worked like a charm, great price, & great service!!!
B00ATE00KW|3|Not a good deal..cheap<br />Sent them back ..
B00VHOE3RE|2|Clearly isn't new, works otherwise. Haven't used it much. It just may stop. Never mis-advertise.
B010PDH1O4|5|The light I ordered is exactly what I needed for my RV and exactly as presented in the description. The product came quickly and on time. It is far higher quality than the one installed by the manufacturer.
B000MYE398|5|I was very satisfied
B003C24F8Q|5|Fits perfectly on my large chest and it's not too long (stopping right at my blue jeans and belt). I am 5'8&#34; 180 athletic build.
B00ELHNM3K|5|Great product. I switched over to synthetic oil and wish I would have made the switch 10 years sooner!
B001CF1A6U|5|Bought these to use with engine lift sling, works great
B00538TU8C|5|worked well
B002P8DBQA|5|Was a perfect fit for my Dodge neon 2002
B003QVISZO|5|Fits my 2008 dodge intrepid subframe perfect.
B0096DW4C4|4|I had to cut the screws that attach the support bars to the bike its self, almost in half. They were way to long. The screws that connect the outer bars to the center bar were way to short and could not attach the bolt. Good thing I work in a fabrication garage and have everything on hand. I would have had to go buy all new screws and bolts. The bolts they give you have a locking strip in them and make it difficult to tighten. Washers were not included in this either. my recomendation is to add lock washers to these to prevent the bolts from coming loose on long trips. Once all the screws and bolt were properly fitted. The devise is petty sturdy. If you are impatient, easily frustrated and expect the manufaturer to give you all the parts nessisary to install easily on your bike, &#34;do not buy these.&#34; If you don't mind putting in the extra work and enjoy a challenge. These are defiantly worth putting in the extra effort for the price.
B00TJ2CG70|5|Just what I was looking for,
B0002SR47M|5|Bought this for pinion bearing for my mustang rear end, worked great.
B000HEBR3I|5|Very good work perfect
B001JT5JVQ|5|Great easy to use product.
B004ZH9WOY|5|Good lisense plate
B000BRJSVE|5|Replacement for the damaged one on our 1998 Winnebago Brave.  Just remember to use the new closer switch when replacing steps on older units.
B00BSEK9HQ|5|Someone gave me a little Razor Pocket bike because it no longer worked.  I figured it was just the batteries as they don't last too long and they also told me that the bike was a couple years old. I ordered these popped them in and next thing you know my so was cruising up and down the street.  After the test run I put the bike on the charger so the batteries could be fully charged and the bike has been going for the past couple months without issue.  Couldn't beat the price.  I am considering getting another pair of these an upgrading my youngest son's Jeep Powerwheels to 24V.
B00J4HBNTC|4|The tail lights were not the right set for the f150 2002
B0031GWMD8|4|Fits nice.<br />Easy to install.  Works well.  Comes with one upper screw and the three nuts on handle crank wheel.<br /><br />Previous Dorman replacement lasted 4 years before failing like the factory unit.  The cables snagged and broke.
B009X3TL8M|1|I mean, I wanted to like it, I bought the air freshener they fit into, tried multiple scents, BMW needs to stick to cars because their air scents are just not any good. smell is so minimal its pointless.
B0081IURV0|5|Easy install. Good quality. Much less $$ than purchasing from the dealer.
B002P8EMRW|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B009BNG2HW|5|As described. You will probably want to glue or job weld the screw under the Union Jack.
B00K551F18|1|unlawful to use this product. I didn't knonow
B000GZIF9W|5|Good product
B007NN8YX2|4|Decent kit, could use some documentation, but then anyone doing this level of repair/rework should know how to do it.  being able to rebuild a $250+ wiring harness for ~$50 and 30 min of time was worth doing.. especially for a 12 year old van that I do not intend to keep for 10+ more years !
B00J8NKGSG|5|I live in Florida so the exterior and interior really take a beating. Its quite common to see cracked & highly faded dash boards in older and even some not as old vehicles. I want to avoid that in my car and decided to purchase this product. I've tried similar products such as Armor All, but disliked the greasy wet appearance it left. 303 thankfully goes on with a minimal sheen upon application and then gradually fades to become almost invisible. The smell is good as well - not overpowering, not chemically or citrus smelling; it reminds me of the very faint smell of a new car.<br /><br />It works great at capturing the dust from the dash while protecting it - an all in one, I like that.<br />Overall its a great and versatile product that wont hurt the wallet.
B00024JK8W|4|The design is great -- keeps your beverage face-up at all times, and even expands to accommodate tall containers -- but the neck broke on mine after only a year or two of use (right where it screws in and attaches to the bike/pole/whatever).  Too much torque for the relatively small diameter plastic neck.
B00UVUTP2S|5|Great machine very time efficient.
B001NYYSLY|5|Easy to install.  Works well.
B001EPU3V6|1|Front lenses will not stick and peel off.  Very poor fit.  Returned to seller and 3 months later have not received a refund.
B000C9WJQM|5|fits
B00GHSKG94|5|Snapped right in. Great replacement mirror.
B00WOY33EA|5|best repair for fords dumb design
B0013CXCYK|5|Good deal and fast shipping
B00TUHX8HQ|5|Very pretty in my Mom's Trailblazer.  In my opinion, these are excellent for the price.  Be careful taking the staples out when you get them and they're perfect.
B0010GG7YG|5|👍
B00LDQGRUW|5|Exact fit and it makes my remote look like NEW again!
B00PUY6FOQ|5|Awesome product completely out of the way
B000E7SY16|3|good product.
B00T1Q6KQC|5|Great. Easy fit. Easy to install with some assistance.
B00N8IA0SS|3|dissappointing...thought that this would be easier to use and would give me the same results as the turtle wax products and I was wrong. This one did pretty much nothing that I could detect..plus it left a stick, hard to remove gunk on the paint if you rubbed the slightest bit too hard. Useless for the money. I will say this, the company is first rate and offered to either refund the item price or replace it.
B00D3O5LUO|5|Perfect
B008OYAIKQ|5|This fits both the inner and outer front CV joints on my 2000 Kawasake Prairie 300  ATV.  The boots look to be of very good quality.  I saw a statement that some CV greases are incompatible with each other, so cleaning out the old grease seemed to be pretty important to do.   One end or the other of the axle had to be disassembled in order to slip on the new boots.  I found that the inner joints were far easier to disassemble.  The inner CV joint has a retaining ring that has to be pulled out before it can be disassembled.  Then once the CV cup is pulled off, there is another retaining ring on the end of the axle - remove that one and the parts come right off the axle.    I tried but finally gave up on getting the outer CV joint apart, so I wound up leaving that one assembled.  To clean it, I used brake cleaner spray (aka, degreaser) to soak the joint and clean out the old grease.  Once the spray drained pretty clear, I powered up my air compressor and blew out the joint.  Then I put the parts in the sun for a bit to further dry out any remaining degreaser.  Once I was satisfied that the degreaser was all evaporated out, I repacked the joint with the supplied grease, then put the rest of the grease in the boot.    One note on re-installing the bearings...If your bearings seem to make the axle too big to stick back into the CV cup, use your hands to press the bearings into their assigned slot.  It took me a bit to realize that the bearings are a very snug fit to place, so merely placing them there was not enough.  Mine kind of popped in and then were held securely.  To install the metal bands, I used the &#34;OTC 4623 CV Joint Banding Tool And Cutter&#34;, found here on Amazon.  It worked great for this!  Hope this helps!
B00JF5LRN0|5|**** UPDATE August 2016 ****<br /><br />We took this rack on a 4500+ mile road trip across all types of conditions and terrain - dirt road, uneven pavement, over and through the Rocky Mountains, through Yellowstone, through the Badlands, and everything in between - with an 300+ pound uneven load consisting of our 12 person tent, fully packed 120 quart cooler, and whatever else we could strap down.  This was the longest trip we have used this hitch carrier on, but we've used it dozens of times before this.  Not a single problem and it looks no worse for wear.  This carrier is built to take abuse and last.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />I bought this earlier in the year and have now used it on 3 long distance trips. It has survived driving through traffic with sudden starts and stops, bumpy dirt roads, and everything in between. On our last trip it easily held our fully packed 120 quart cooler, 8 person tent, and 6 cots and wrapped sleeping pads for over 4 hours - probably close to 250 pounds.  I strap things down with bungees and 2 ratcheting tie downs and nothing even thinks about moving.  I drive a 2013 Dodge Durango and even fully loaded the carrier sits far enough back to access the hatch and low enough not to block my license plate or tail lights.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />It's heavy and awkward and hard to put on and get positioned with only one person.  Not really a bad thing, just something to consider.<br /><br />Even when it's well weighted when loaded it wobbles a lot more than expected in the hitch.  While this doesn't affect performance it's a little unnerving to have your gear teetering back and forth behind you as you drive as it did on our first trip.  I ordered a hitch tightener [[ASIN:B0001CMUV4 StowAway Hitch Tightener]] separately and that completely eliminated the wobble.  The manual doesn't address wobble or how to correct it but I would consider the tightener to be an almost mandatory secondary purchase to this based on my experience.After doing some research while troubleshooting the wobble post purchase this is a common problem and not unique to this carrier.
B001VIT9IO|3|Looks good
B002IVCSIG|5|Worked well for sealing around the fuel line to motor
B00HS14D8E|4|Not bad so far, seems like a solid strut. Lets see what happens. Delivery was speedy
B00TEG3G3E|5|Great value, however they are smaller than expected
B001VBVL9G|5|The products was outstanding
B00AW0BFX4|4|Good product, but it would have be nice that the cables for both right and left tail light come little longer.
B00UEC87QS|5|Nice, cheap, and easy to install.
B00FHJZIIS|4|Great helmet for the price, fits a little snug but I suppose a large would be a little to loose.  My head size is right at the cusp between a medium and a large.
B00880D8YY|5|This is great.  I wanted something to hang my canteen from while hiking; something that was easy for removal of the canteen.  Got two others, but this is by far the best - others had springs that were just too strong.
B00MAG6RMM|5|I bought these bulbs to replace the interior/door/trunk bulbs in my 2014 Lexus IS350.  These bulbs came recommended from another Lexus Forum.<br /><br />The fit, brightness and color were great.  I would recommend this to anybody looking for a 194 bulb replacement!
B00PU1PVH6|1|Horrible product.  I wish I could get my money back.  My wife bought them for me for my birthday, to go on my 40 ft motorhome and tow vehicle.  After only an hour or so, I began losing the signal between the sensors and monitor.  The only way to re initiate the signal is to loosen or remove each monitor until it re establishes communication.  Again, after only an hour, the signals begin to fall off, and the monitor starts beeping.  After calling the manufacturer, they told me I would have to purchase a repeater to boost the signal. I am not spending any more money on this system.  Just for the record; I am not a chronic complainer, and have only reviewed a hand full of products, ever.
B004OJL75A|1|These started off great with a significant impact on gas mileage. However, in less than 4 weeks one of the plugs came apart dropping the electrode into the cylinder. Replacing them now. Hoping I can send them back, I do not recommend for a 5.4L Triton.
B009F7UE0K|4|You may have some problems getting the bag on if you wear a jacket that has extra protective armor but all in all a good bag. Only wish the chest strap was slightly lower
B00N5F514M|4|This item has a silver and a black side. The black side apparently leaves some trace material inside the car in the hot desert sun. However, it is holding up fairly well in our hot hot weather, so it probably will be fine for those customers in cooler climates. Hence the 4 star rating. We will eventually source something thicker and more protective, but for now, we're using it with satisfactory results. so it probably will be fine for those customers in cooler climates  Update: After a couple of months in the extreme heat of Palm Springs, my Wife reports that it is fading. I won't knock off a star because it is much hotter here than in most places, and it isn't shedding. We really hate the ones which disintegrate and shed all over the car. This will get you by for a season or two, depending on your climate.
B00HY35GA0|5|Perfect
B00412UKBW|5|Installed per instructions from youtube video. Used large suction cups to hold window because no helper was available. It works fine in 1999.V6 Mustang.
B00CPN2U8U|4|It's ok, got it faster than expected, over all a good purchase.<br />Thank you
B00GJKB5E0|3|Started out looking amazing, but now is starting to peel on the edges. Has only been up for a month. :(
B000SXCLIS|4|This cover serves it purpose and once secured, it will not blow away it high winds. Great cover and great price--universal fir for mostly all cruisers.
B0018YEKTY|5|Amazing Difference from RS5000. Adjustable to type of driving. Love them...
B000C9DV8C|5|fits well on 2005 hummer sut2
B000CNBBIK|2|The clips that hold the ends in place depend on little clear stickers to keep them in place. This was fine for a little while but the sticker came off one one end and now it will not stay where it's supposed to be. I do not see any info on the seller so I can't even contact them to request a new sticker.
B00FCC4YJO|5|Great product.
B00D10JXY0|3|Half of them worked.
B00CDR77HC|1|Save your money, these are made in China !!
B00NUSAS4M|5|Excellent product
B0083824I2|5|WORKS GREAT!
B00UVTULCM|5|Awesome.
B00HVHVIUG|5|Excellent
B00AGKWDIG|5|it fits perfectly and it follows the shape of the dash board not wavy at all.
B00HSZQ5RC|5|Perfect fit and looks & feels like OEM.
B00ODF1KRU|5|I bought this for a small tv in a security guard house. The one before would get only a few channels. We set the tv to scan for channels and we get about 20.  Which is great. It was extremely easy to attach and get started. I am very pleased with it. Right now I'm keeping it on the desk. Might hand it up later.<br /><br />But the buyer must keep in mind hour far away the &#34;satellite&#34; before deciding on which one to purchase.
B000CMH4BY|5|Good product, I like the fact the it comes with the code sticker in case you lose the lock.
B00ZQ15TF4|5|Great product...not too low like my &#34;dearly departed&#34; original.....Johnny knows his stuff and turns out quality
B00E8CZAWY|5|AWESOME!!!!!
B00PJ21ZX0|4|Great system!!!!! Wish the handlebar clamps came with it, OR at least at discounted price. I could only mount the left speaker to the mirror, the right speaker wouldn't fit because of the brake fluid reservoir was in the way. I have a 2011 Yamaha v star 950 tourer. I had to order 2 sets of shark metalclamps, one set for the handlebars and another set for attaching the speakers to the back seat. Again, GREAT SOUND
B00NUJ2WXQ|5|Love this vest, fits great and great quality!! But is did have 4 buttons not 3 like in the description!
B00GJKXW8M|5|brighter than expected using it on a stinger bumper as fog light
B005F1YJ3I|5|thank you
B00VAVPECM|4|So far they work good and fairly easy to install
B00EYV2PJU|4|So far, so good.  Bought for upcoming trip to Burning Man.  Two AA batts & each light was good to go.  Yes, the battery pack makes that tell-tale humm.  Lights worked at home as they were supposed to do.  We'll see how they last on the Playa.  Ideal uses are limitless!!!  I'll be mounting some in/on clothing and others on my bike.  Feature steady on, blink & fast flash modes.
B009PJJI8M|5|Good quality product
B00LLJDWV8|5|love it
B000CFQEU8|3|Needed minor work for mount to fit. Also mount is taller and cannot use throws blower inlet out of alignment.
B00S1EGHEK|5|Fits perfectly 2014 VW Passat
B00GE9Y5IE|4|Look awesome fit great
B003B32V5U|5|Awesome product. This part worked perfectly in my son's 2000 Monte Carlo SS. This is a great alternative to replacing the entire fuel pump assembly when there's nothing wrong with the pump. If your fuel gauge isn't reading right this can save you hundreds of dollars. Shipping was great, part install was easy, and part works perfectly. Extremely satisfied customer.
B000IYNTTM|1|Did not even last a year
B00NUDDU6A|4|worked as advertised
B003IHPR4G|5|good value
B000C809M4|5|all good
B00X9E0HRK|5|My husband has a motorcycle and no way to charge his phone while hes coming home from work. He uses his phone as a map and other things as well while hes driving. So when I saw this at a discount for my honest review, I snapped it up.  Unless its pouring down the rain he can use it as a cigarette lighter and a phone charger at the same time.
B008E7SZ5I|5|Great part at a good price!!
B0025YU860|4|These covers worked very well in my 2016 Honda Fit. Took a good half hour to get them in but they look good and seem to be functioning well with some adjustments.
B00S8KQ83C|4|Will do until I can buy new seats
B005WXDQ1A|5|UPDATE - 7/23/2017  Moving my car back into the garage has been significantly delayed, and fortunately, this cover has survived a total of 3 years. It has been continuously exposed to outdoor weather (plus sunlight and storms) since Aug 2014. It is definitely now showing signs of age and wear. Top shows sun damage and some holes have developed at points where winds have caused the cover to rub against metal edges. I think strapping the cover down with bungees and clamps helped this cover last as long as it did with windy conditions. I feel the material has clearly demonstrated it is tear resistant. Upgraded from 4 to 5 stars. ORIGINAL REVIEW - Aug 23, 2015 I purchased the 229&#34; size to cover my (as-yet) unrestored 1950 Chevy, so we could park it in our driveway. It is bigger than I needed, but custom fit was not my primary concern. I needed the width.  The car has been out there, covered for about a year now. The cover is still doing fine.  When shopping for car covers, I was concerned by some reviews that said this one lacked durability. Some said it tore fairly easily and severe weather was a problem for other reviewers. Some of these reviews said the cover did not last 6 months. Reviewers seemed to disagree on the meaning of the term &#34;weatherproof&#34;. Some reviewers said they were satisfied.  I am happy to report this car cover has met my expectations and in some ways exceeded them. It has weathered a year of direct sunlight and survived. There is only one small tear in the cover right at the bumper. (I discovered this was because the bumper is rusting and at that spot the chrome plating is flaking off and is quite sharp. It created a 3&#34; tear, but the cover has not continued to rip apart.)  Because of the negative reviews, I expended considerable effort anchoring the car cover. I used the grommet holes and ran bungee cords under the car to assure the car cover would stay in place in a severe storm. I also used tarp clamps with bungee cords in spots where there were no grommets. When I used tarp clamps, I used scrap cloth to protect the cover from the clamps. (In retrospect, all this may not have been necessary, but at the time I felt -- better to invest that time preparing for the worst... than not to, and wish I had.)  We have had several severe storms in the past 12 months, and a recent one knocked down several trees on our property. I have never had to tend to the car, the cover, or its anchoring during this time.  As far as how well this cover has protected the car, I cannot yet say. I have not taken the cover off to look at the car. However, that day is coming and I hope to update my review with those results.  Bottom line... I feel this car cover provides good value for the money. I would buy it again.
B008M1WK7A|5|great fit for my 2014 xv crosstrek.
B003BG9XDK|4|Fits just right, does keep the interior noticeably cooler when used.  Wish it was easier to put up, as the edges tend to roll and so don't fit in snugly, but it stays up well enough with support from the visors.  You have to roll it pretty tightly for the Velcro strap to keep it closed, but that's not too hard.
B000CGP18I|5|These are great!
B000FPY5CY|1|This fit on 86 grand marquis. ?
B00O8XRAOO|1|not what I expected, it was supposed to be a plug in only, but requires more work than I expected

B00GEV9M1M|5|Amazing, looks rally good on my laptop
B003BZKCMC|5|Awesome and great price and fast shiping
B0048J03RO|4|These stupid things fail ALL the time. I'm not sure if the Texas heat we have causes the plastic wire guides to get brittle and crack quicker than in other parts of the country or what but I have replaced these multiple times. The AC Delco seem to be better than the Dorman ones I have gotten in the past. Sure wish someone would make these with a metal guide instead of plastic. My advice is spend a little more to get the Delco.
B002P8T45W|5|Fits perfectly for 2006 Nissan altima, just take old shell off factory one to match the color.

B000JFHNQA|5|I had a 600 Peak Amp jumper that wouldn't crank my Cadillac engine.  My neighbor's jumper didn't work either.  But this one worked just fine.
B004ZF4RXC|5|I bought the H13 bi xenon headlights for my F150.  Before these I had some 35 watt 6000k hid headlights off eBay that went out after about 6 months of use and weren't very bright either.  These kensun lights are day and night compared to my first ones.  They are very bright and are spread out so they cover alot of area.  I do alot of offroading and these lights name be think twice about getting a light bar.. I haven't had them long so I just hope the lifespan is as good as the brightness

B001LHXTO0|1|It doesn't read all OBD2 protocols, It does't clear faults as written, It also does't remove the check engine.
B00CR9WWN0|5|Very good
B002MQ1OS2|4|Very nice helmet only wished it came with a both a clear and tinted visor<br />Visor very easy to replace. Well ventilated. Great padding on the inside, if you have big ears you might struggle a little bit
B000IYY7PW|5|Fast delivery. Good price.
B000MDZLR2|5|Covers the spare and keeps it out of the sun.  The return on investment should be a few more years of usable life from my trailer tires, which normally dry rot before running out of tread.
B00IXUOJJM|5|Came faster than expected and was what I was expecting.
B000GU7DGS|5|Works well and very loud.

B00A40O0R0|4|Cute, 3 weeks and hasn't faded.
B0009IBJE4|4|Pro: Light weight for a 10A charger. Monitors battery voltage as well as % charge; automatically switches mode to maintain battery without overcharging.<br /><br />Con: Lots of radio interference generated by internal switching circuitry & not attenuated by plastic case. Blots out AM radio stations for blocks.
B000UKIMQ4|3|Well they were really fine side panels. But they tried to reinvent the wheel here. The mounting hardware is sooooo cheap. And they do not mount the same as the oem panels. Why not just  mount the same as oem? I'm now on the hunt for extra mounting hardware and have no side panels.
B0019I0AU2|5|I changed the stock Toyota pads to these because they were very dusty. They were more than 1/2 worn after 51,000 km. I'd also read the Ceramic pads stopped better. Its hard to quantify the stopping performance but they definitely don't make as much dust as the stock Toyota pads. Perfect fit, no squealing and minimal dust.
B007G2IN04|5|worked great with my grill!
B000AM8BLI|4|Installed on 1997 Ford F150.  They work great.<br /><br />Although I should mention, a mere 13 miles after installing these tail lights, I had an issue with my starter and had to get towed home.  I doubt these are related, but I'm just giving you the facts.  You can do with them what you will.
B00YOC99HU|5|These are a must have for any parent -especially who take their kids for drives a lot! My son turns into a screaming banshee whenever the sun hits his face and he refuses to wear hats or sunglasses. This was the perfect solution to our issue! It's easy to apply to the window. First, you clean your car window. Second, you pull out one sun shade and stretch it open. Third, position it against the window SHINY PLASTIC side against the window and rub your hands across the whole sunshade. And there you go! All ready for a ride around town! This pack of sun shades also come with four suction cups intended for winter usage or to give you peace of mind. So far I haven't found a need for them at all but it is nice to have them incase I do! I received these sun shades at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B003VAPEHA|5|Worked as described.
B005GYDBNS|5|Got what I wanted at a great price.
B00L6UW1PA|5|Easy to install very bright can see much farther.
B005PZMLDY|4|Said perfect fit for vehicle but back seat was for a bench not split bench
B00PAIMXLQ|1|Side of motorhome is flat and these loose suction and also leave black marks on white side of rv. Will probably have to mount the brackets it comes with and call it good. Bummer since I bought 2 sets of these.
B004IA5C92|3|These items are &#34;okay&#34;. I have a large Maglite and it sits loosely in the straps - not enough to fall out, but plenty enough to sag and get in the way of the passenger (where I mounted it). The fire extinguisher fits well as the straps are adjustable. The sunglasses holder is great and I use it often (although could be a little less bulky). The cup holders are a joke and a waste.
B00065L2D8|5|I use this on my home battery bank to use cigarette plug in items like cell phone chargers.
B000IOJKYU|5|Looks great.  Fits great.
B001C6L5U0|5|Good price - good fit!

B003S5YRK8|5|Worked perfect, was really easy to install, this saved us hundreds doing it ourselves. Very intuitive didn't even need the instructions! very happy with the product.
B000F19X0W|5|It fit my suburban perfect. Protects the dash from this 100 plus degree weather.
B003ZOH63W|5|Works better than the original RV antenna
B004804NWE|3|The first time I used it the hose had two holes about a foot from the connection, so I had to cut that section out and reconnect the fitting losing over a foot of the length. I purposely bought this hose as I figured that with the name EXTREME that is what it would be. My mistake it doesn't appear to be that tough even if it hadn't had the two holes in it.

B004GCGV2E|5|As described.
B00MOQVWB4|5|Outstanding rachets. These wrenches are fantastic in tight places. You barely need to have any space at all. These are far better than my other six well known ratchets.
B00FUT7IP6|4|product worked fine excellent value for price paid
B002GTKAHQ|5|I had a very difficult time finding a decent bar-end mirror for my mountain bike.  EVERYTHING available in the bicycle world is horribly expensive, cheaply made plastic junk!  This mirror is all aluminium, steel and glass with a great view and a very solid attachment system.  For $10 (includes 2) you can't get a better deal. While the Mirrycle ($18) is very popular and gets good reviews, it can't even hold a candle to these.  They're plastic and break if you even look at them funny.  I know, I broke two of them in less than two weeks. Save yourself some frustration and go with these!
B00062YYSG|5|excellent
B00G4AB4MS|4|great bike rack for the price. it may not look sleek as the other big name brands but it does it function. now i just need to find a way to lock my bikes.
B0002ILK04|5|GOOD PRICE
B00OI8GJFK|5|Simply the best rack available for the LR3. LOOK NO FURTHER
B000NW6VUS|5|Exact replacement OEM
B000EQR7XS|5|Fits perfect on 2007 Saturn ion
B004S3IRVO|2|The supplied clips are very flimsy and don't hold the rods well. I suggest you reuse the old oem ones.
B00AWXZ7TE|4|Smaller than I expected, but that's not the fault of the seller...
B00M9NJ1VK|4|Install went well. Hoping it actually fixes the problem and lasts awhile.. Thanks
B00E0S8NF2|5|Fits perfectly as a replacement.
B009LIGE0M|1|This strut broke on me.....Chicago potholes had to replace it in 6months after purchase<br />Don't buy it I swear you'll be disappointed.
B002J854UC|5|Holy cow, that's slickery. This work awesome on new paint. Clay, apply, watch the rain and dirt fall away.
B001UHQXQ2|4|Works well, smells good kind of like Bubble Gum. I prefer Meguair's Quik Detail because it seams to leave a cleaner surface behind. Don't let this stuff dry on the paint. Will probably always use this because the price for 1 gal can't be ignored.
B001UG8S8O|5|love this decal!!
B00CWMQKMQ|4|Item works great. 4 starts only due to being overpriced. Light quality and intensity is good for a direct 12v wire.
B000OCH4YO|4|Would of given 5 stars but only 1 problem head comes off about 3 times when washing van other than that it is perfect.
B001FM1H40|5|My 2004 XC90 was getting a check engine light and indicating that the engine was taking too long to come up to temperature. Upon removing the old unit I found that the small button on the blocking disc was missing. I'm not certain that was causing the issue but I guess that part is there for a reason. It will remain to be seen if this will eliminate my error message.
B001FRE1E8|1|They ship and inferior 15A switch after a long wait. The listing is for a 20A and shows a better quality switch.
B0006IX7UQ|5|ok
B00JREPRJE|5|Good price..nice look .
B000BQWJFW|5|Outstanding Product.
B002W0ZU4C|5|Amazing product, I finally found something to remove all (and I mean ALL) of the scale and haze from my 2014 Pathfinder's glass.
B008VK5Q46|1|The item I received is ABSOLUTELY NOT what is pictured or described. It is too wide for the mounts and can only be attached with one bolt. It tests okay with a multi-meter, but since it won't mount on the bike correctly it was a GREAT BIG WASTE OF MONEY!
B00EF3VOSU|4|Good price, works perfect with our hitch and just the right size to haul all the stuff that doesn't fit in our SUV now that we downsized from a minivan.
B00PW30TTC|5|thanks
B005JU5U3S|3|cleans the windshield fairly well. However, it squeeks. My previous wiper blades did not squeek.

B00TP90Y1C|5|Love this tool going to purchase more great to have
B00ZRDHWWE|5|I purchased these mirrors for my 2009 GMC Sierra, they replaced my stock mirrors, they look awesome and are very sturdy!  I lost the turn signal feature but it wasn't a big deal to me.  I would recommend to anyone, they don't shake or do anything weird like some of the reviews had said.  For $150 I would buy again
B00I8277CG|5|My daughter loves it..I'm happy with my purchase
B009IF1TCG|5|With the help of a youtube video, I had it installed in about 20 minutes.  Works great and doing it myself I saved about $125.
B0082365AQ|5|We love these! Got 2 of them. Yes they stink when box opened & for a few days after, but we put them in garage, turned box fan on & let them air out through the open (closed at night) garage door for 2-3 days. But well worth dealing with for the ease it makes in moving our kayaks from vehicle to water here in the Tampa Bay area where one goes through woods &/or sand to get to the water with all the 'stuff' one takes kayaking.  Just pile all your gear into your kayaks, put the kayak on the cart & walk it to the water.  Great!
B00DJ5KEF4|4|Works just as advertised. Nice to have just in case I need a charge on the go.
B0099MVX60|1|Terrible! Do not buy.  Does not keep a connection inside the ignition.
B00B03MGLM|5|Quality product, fast delivery.
B006K8G3RU|5|Using on jewelry pegboard. Great size when a regular peg won't do.
B000C55MQK|5|Purchased to replace shocks on mini van, rides better, no more hippo rear in turns and smoother towing my pop up camper.
B0000AZ8JB|4|Works great as a rear view mirror on my Jeep!
B002ZTGY1I|5|Its a perfect fit in our 2013 Subaru Outback.
B00WYBZE04|3|My son loves it
B007489OJ4|5|Works great!
B00K72C1T4|4|We bought this for my moped to charge the battery as my battery is, we think bad.  It states that it will turn itself off after the  battery is charged. I am not sure that is true as we could not get the lights to stay one color as the instructions state.  The instructions state that if the lights blink then the battery is charged.  I know this is not true as checking the voltage.  But somehow the battery does charge.  It will not charge to a full battery but it will get me started so I can go.  So for this I would say it does it's job.
B0007OWD0Y|5|Great product.
B00N2HENWE|5|The right part and received it earlier than expected
B005GSFUWE|5|Easy installation.
B004IV8NBU|1|This things a piece of junk and a waste of money  mine broke within the first couple weeks it fell apart and started rattling in my exhaust made it sound like I had an exhaust problem don't waste your money wish I could get my money back

B003TPUL2K|5|awesome cooler
B00L7XBHDI|3|I like the style, the look and the cost , but no instructions in the box. I have been a mechanic and do it yourselfer for many years but this is first time installing led lights on a vehicle . What does the little black box for and where does it install at and how does it plug into the wire harness for the existing lights ?

B001CEG90I|5|works great
B000E4NKEK|4|It works but seems fragile.
B003UT5VKW|4|Good to get the grime out of carpets and is effective, even without a commercial extractor.  I have used this when I have had to treat vehicles that have been neglected or have odors from kids, sporting events, and anything less than bodily fluids.
B00S555V42|5|Outstanding Product.
B003XCD5NG|5|I proudly display my love for my pitbull on the back of my car.  It's been on for months now and it hasn't worn or peeled at all.  Not to mention it was really easy to put on.  The instructions are simple: clean the area you're putting the decal on. I washed mine with soap and water and then made sure to dry it with a papertowel.  Then gently peel the decal off the paper and carefully place it on the care. And I mean CAREFULLY put it on the car because if you don't put it straight (where you want it) the first time it's stuck there and then you have to scrape it off.  And trust me it's not reusable so you'll have to buy another one and do it again, so don't place it on like it's a reusable sticker because it's not.
B00B8T1150|3|It's ok. It gets hot to the touch. And the size didn't for across my sedan windshield entirely. More of a &#34;cute&#34; product. The part that does fit blocks the sun but not that great.
B000GZLQVQ|5|Tool works as described, I bought and used it to install a sprocket shaft seal (engine main shaft) on my 1980 H.D. FLH 1340 engine. An added plus was I was able to use this tool as well to install a sprocket seal on my 1980 FLH's 4 speed transmission, worked like a charm! Double duty tool!
B00VIUAC90|3|Looks fine. Lack of quality. I don't think it can be washed.<br />The shipping is quick tho. The seller also included a return label.
B0031HOJTM|5|Good
B000F1Y4EC|5|These auto carpets are really nice quality for the price. They fit perfect and look great.
B000630380|5|Amazing! is work perfectly on the Ford Focus 2.0 Duratec 2006 From Venezuela!
B005FL6K1W|5|Fits perfectly a 2003 Honda Accord EX (4 cyl). Smoother breaking, improved performance both at low and high speeds (as compared to the cheap rotors and break pads installed by the dealer).
B00H34F2BI|5|Made our leather couches look new again!
B0119ZICTA|1|Awful! I had both lights grounded properly and hooked up to the correct terminals on a toggle switch. Also had a 12 volt steady power source and after 30 seconds of being on one of the lights flashed and the positive cable on that one sparked and completely melted. On top of that the wires for these are nothing like the pictures. They are thin as can be no wonder it couldn't handle the current very cheap materials.
B002UUYOPU|2|Poor mounts.  Windshield scratches too easily.
B002M3KSK0|5|easy install, arrived on time, great!
B00KSXVCTW|1|Got some bulbs that didn't work at all

B008VM0TLO|5|Received in 3 days. Took 15 minutes to afix to my car's back deck.  Looks great and high quality!<br />Would highly recommend it!
B00UJ8W9XE|5|If you're a pocket bike racer and enthusiast, I can tell you that The GOOFIT Big Bore 53cc 54cc Top Kit of 44mm Piston 49cc 2-stroke Engine will come in handy when your miniature motorcycle begins to make those strange roaring sounds. 2 stroke engines are extremely sensitive in their tuning, and can easily overwhelm and give up. But you can take care of that problem with this kit. It has all the right dimensions (6.8 x 5.4 x 4.8 inches) for your minimoto / pocket bike. Not only does it have a great appearance, but it is also fashioned with fine quality metal. It fits on your pocket bike effortlessly and adds plenty of speed. So whether you're assembling your mini bike or discover that you have other problems; like engine not functioning appropriately, or need to change your bore, look no further than the high performance GOOFIT Big Bore 53cc 54cc Top Kit of 44mm Piston 49cc 2-stroke Engine. It has all you require to do maintenance, or repair of your pocket bike to have it running as it should!

B00F33R1QA|4|For the money it's fine, however had I known it was coming from China I would have NEVER bought !
B000WJIZ42|5|Great fit on 2002 CBR600F4i. Very bright, especially at night. Better visibilty from the front than other flushmounts as they stick out just a little bit. A+<br /><br />As bright as halogen in the day, crazy bright at night.
B000IYPSV4|5|Great fit and function
B007JG1W1E|5|Wow, put 4 oz's in and now no smell. I usually use tablets that I place in the sink and run water over them till they completely disolve and generally they work fine. They are a combination of cleaner and odor control and I will continue to use them except in warm to hot weather. Generally that is when the smell becomes a problem and this product did what the tablets could not and that was get rid of the smell.<br /><br />I am considering purchasing the cleaner only for when I want to clean the tank.
B001PVSKTG|1|Followed instructions to a tee and they fell off going down the road!!!!!....truck looks like hell with only 2 on it! Not pleased at all.
B000CRBRVC|5|Always  great product.
B00HRY1LY6|4|YES THE STRUTS WERE JUST GREAT THE CAR IS 13 YRS OLD CAR REALLY RUN SMOOTH THANK YOU
B001ABMY3Y|5|Pretty easy install and it sounds terrific. Definitely can feel an increase in power too.
B00FC22K6S|5|Great perfect
B003GC74NK|5|These filters are exactly as advertised.  If you filter the water, you should also filter out the trash before the filter.  After all, if you take care of your filter, it will take care of you.<br /><br />Yes, I do recommend the filters for everyone who wants to protect whatever their hose is going into.
B00BVB5C1O|5|Installed with no issues. Continues to work great.
B000CF6I1I|5|Easy to install and jazzes up my truck.
B00RM49OXG|1|I'm disappointed, IT DOESNT FIT MY HONDA CBR 600RR I really was excited for the product to come and it doesn't fit. And it's a fake carbon fiber.
B00PA2LMVY|5|good car wash
B007NNGZQ0|5|WORKS GREAT. THANKS, FRANK
B000C7VYUG|5|Fit 2004 Tundra
B003SZ3COU|5|worked perfect
B00KLZ65GM|4|Slips a lot.
B00DDV2NL2|1|I got this from the local auto store, it does not offer much value compared to the other free apps like Torque with an OBD2 adapter. However, if you need to access OEM codes for transmission and other such modules that are not supported by Torque then you may need this, but then you'll also have to pay extra for those features on top of the initial price.<br /><br />This biggest problem with this product and the company is that their product can get stuck on most BMW OBD2 connectors and there is no easy way to remove it! I contacted their support and they told me to use a screw drive and ample force. I tried this but no luck, I grabbed this adapter with gloves with good grip but no luck, I pulled with enough force that the plastic dash panel started to bend but this thing won't come out. A screw driver was no help, also tried some trim removal tools and such, no luck! So, as of now this think is stuck in my car and I'll probably have to take it to a shop so they can remove some under dash pieces in order to remove this thing - no idea how much it will cost or what possible damage could happen. The support also told me that they know about this problem but it is due to BMW's fault that they use non-standard plugs and not Actron's fault. If you search the internet you'll find that I'm not the only one, this problem is quite old but Actron continues to sell claiming support for BMW even when they very well know about this issue.<br /><br />I have purchased quite a few other Actron products in the past, including the pocket scan and such but I will never buy another product from this company based on this experience and the poor customer support response continuing to blame BMW after all these years.
B000CSD4A8|4|FILTER OK. GASKET A PAIN.
B00MC1B9PK|5|Fast service! Good quality!!!!
B00MTY7B0W|1|Pedals can't be adjust they slant outward and feet slide off
B00CF5J49Q|5|Perfect fit and surely a fraction of the cost from the dealer
B00684TGWA|5|Excellent buy, easily programmed, price is right.
B000CF6RX2|3|Auto function on window fails 50% of time now.  I've read all the &#34;tips&#34; - and it doesn't matter.  Sometimes the window will take 4 times to close all the way.  The resistance of stuffing the visor in the channel and the glass hitting it is just too much sometimes.  I'm hoping the plastic will wear down eventually and loosen up.  Really not any other choices out there.  2015 Ford F350.
B0006IX87S|2|first off the flex connector leaks. Had to use without it. second i have a TDS water particle meter.  I tested a bottle of national store brand water which read 24 on the meter. While camping I tested water at the site and it read 343.  I then ran the water with this filter and it read 323.  Pure filtered water should be a low number.  Perhaps this filter does something for taste, but as for cleaning the minerals or impurities it appears to do very little
B005NXMFW0|1|good luck getting it to stay on
B00HU6N3LK|5|this is a great product.  I have a leather sofa and when i received it i used it immediately.  I loved the results and I would recommend it to everyone.  Definitely works.
B003L35936|5|very good
B00UJ8S3B6|2|SHARP EDGES...The hook itself comes to a sharp point. the roller ball moves the hook when you try to remove your bags and the thing constantly tries to come with you, making you have you have to fool with it . The hook is too small for purse straps. it is maybe for one wal-mart bag at a time.
B000V2W0GE|5|Great quality, Great service.
B002OIFB7S|4|I was hesistiant to spend this much money but it works really well.  Used it to wax my 27ft RV.  Had some oxidation so I tired Meguiar's M4916 Marine/RV Heavy Duty Oxidation Remover.  Completely removed the oxidation, the finish looks like new. Takes the work out of the process so I will do it more often. I highly recommend watching the prodcut video's.
B00CT25NIQ|5|My eyes are sensitive to wind & I wear glasses, so goggles are out. Google helmet with visor and one comes up with 100 helmets with sun blocking brims and maybe 3 with real wind blocking visors. Unfortunately those later items run hundreds of dollars. This cool little velcro shade attaches in minutes and can be worn with my glasses. It really helps a lot.
B000CSEZ2O|5|did what they were suppose to.  Jetski fired up and ran like a champ once we changed the plugs.
B0054EHCQW|5|Good quality!
B000M8Q02M|5|Great stuff, I primary use it to spray my Honda aquatrax engine compartment and all exterior moving parts and definetely big way better than WD40 mi jet ski engine is like new all the time no rust and keep it running better
B000TYOQVQ|4|It wasn't a perfect fit meaning it went on great but it sticks out a bit and doesn't lay flush with the console. However it was a great price! It was good enough for me. However if you are looking for the perfect fit you might have to get one made just for your make and model. I found mine online but it was a bit higher then this. So I just decide to go with Amazon.
B00QMI3CZ4|5|Great price
B007Y87B2G|5|Fit great!! Works great!!
B00KGIBKDC|5|Worked perfectly...much cheaper than a kawasaki OEM.
B0018JSJ8C|5|It work out perfect for are jet ski
B000C92ZSE|3|All was good until I got to the springs and nails all are long I have a 1964 Impala 4 door<br />My springs and nails are different on my car so I ended using the old ones<br />The site said this kit fit my 64 impala so something went wrong<br />But its OK I made do
B0021W4QRI|1|This item is way too short.  It only works if you put blocks under each let to lift it up.  Even parking on level ground, it is too short.  To raise it up, you have to narrow up the stance a lot which does not give you the width or the stability.  Poor design.
B00K3SPSMY|5|WE USED THESE FOR THE FORTH AND THEY WERE GREAT.
B000CIKC1C|5|Well pleased,Fast service.
B003CJHPHW|5|Like it

B000C9MME6|5|Good product.
B000E3EXH4|3|Didn't fit real well
B000CG9058|5|This belt fit my '04 XC90 T6 without any issues. Time will tell how long it will last but it appears to be well made.<br /><br />If it fails prematurely I will update this review.
B00VO035ZW|2|The plastic screws stripped out when I went to tighten them, no biggie, redrilled the holes in a different spot and then it worked fine. There's no way to tighten the &#34;tilt&#34; of the mirror, so when I drove fast it tipped and I'd have to reposition.  While I was trailering it, the wind ripped the two screws out of the plastic and so I do not plan to redrill new holes. This is a very cheap mirror. It works great, that much vision behind you is awesome. But it won't last long. Mine made it two months and two traukr rides.
B0042KJV9U|5|Works as advertised.
B00HXC6M00|4|the best bike communication gadget, however after few weeks, definitely one of the speakers will stop working .. not sure why this is happening but this was noticed with over a dozen of units purchased from different sources, Cardo must work on improving the quality of their products.
B00FZG7BS8|5|Based on the amazon model search, this part was not supposed to work for our model but this was the part number given by the dealer. Fortunately it worked. So easy to install. Dealer was going to charge us $100 including labor!
B0031HN0L0|5|Perfect!
B000CMKG6E|5|Super easy to install and I am happy with the product.
B007SUV1ZI|1|I bought this product because if was low cost compared to the Ford price and the HD stands for heavy duty. However, heavy duty it is not! The outside layer became completely cracked up within 7 months and by 1 year of use, it developed a leak that was so bad I couldn't drive the vehicle until it was replaced. It only had about 35k miles of use put on it...just plain sad from any perspective. I went back to the Ford/Goodyear part which will last many times longer.
B00XRXSWGG|5|Perfect march, just make sure to verify your year for the correct color.
B00OZXXTS8|5|I was very surprised that the quality of the backrest was so high. I have told other bikers how to get one.
B00J5QJZX8|4|Works as expected, no issues!
B005HJLKNA|5|A+
B002ZBY9HW|5|Works better than advertised.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Delivered quickly (regular shipping) and works as expected.
B000C9G5W6|4|Right part this time.
B00EFBYSLM|1|These covers fit my 2008 KIA Sorento snug and they look goood. Problem is they are already blowing out at seams and material is wearing out after just two months. Again they look and fit good but are about as durable as kleenex.
B0007LL0CO|5|Excellent cable.
B000WG6R3Q|5|Received my HeatShield and LOVE IT!  I've read all the reviews.  I guess people don't realize things do age?  It is bulky but if you want your car cooler and have more protection........THIS IS THE ONE!  From looking at it I can tell if you bend it a lot it's going to age faster.  I put the bottom in first over the back of the dash.....the top lays right down and I shut the visors over it.  It doesn't bother my rearview mirror as some reviews said.  I've had those floppy folding silver windshield covers.  I will never go back.  I will post updates.  Thank you
B00AHQIPPY|5|just what we needed
B000XECJES|5|Great clothes ... you will love them!
B0078U8DD6|5|These shim packs work great, replace your bearings, install the carrier with the old factory shims check with your dial indicator, setup the new shim packs as required (remember the 0.7 multiplier for 45 degrees)  (remember total shim thickness should equal the original set thickness). Install and you lash will be set as expected. Multiple shims that stack neatly between a paiir of mated sleeved outer shims that provides infinite adjusment that installs as a single shim.
B004QJXX00|5|I installed these on a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee in just over an hour.  They look nice, and work great.
B0002SR4Q8|5|i had one of these but it was stolen. I couldnt find one at the local stores, they all carry those junky plastic ones that only fit one filter or the bulky bands that wrap around the outside of the filter. This one is great and made of metal.
B002QUJ92C|5|great glasses for the price. Alot cheaper then buying them in the store.
B001G7HFCC|5|Installed works perfectly
B000BRF7QE|5|Worked perfect.. we shall see how it holds up over the winter.<br />pay attention to the horizontal vs vertical versions.
B00KLIWMCU|3|The medium is supposed to fit mid-sized cars, but it's actually kinda small.  I'm going to have to find a way to attach it, because it's too small to be held in place by the window frame and visors.  If in doubt, get the large.
B000C9829A|1|Wrong PART !!!! Ordered together with 131-163 to replace both Duramax thermostats and I received 2X 131-163. If you are ordering, this is the one that goes closest to the firewall and has a pair of bypass holes, at least it should have them.
B00O7YCQ9S|5|These really help people have patience. My son is a new driver and it helps people to back off and be kinder.
B00QMWQK2M|5|Functional with style!
B0006IX87S|2|Doesnt remove particles. I have a pen tester that tests PPM. I tested the water before and it was roughly 200ppm, after the filter is 200ppm. There is still calcium deposits on everything. Useless.
B00EOX2QJC|2|Cheep design.
B00G4T6816|2|Its very soft, I am not happy with product.<br />Very poor,<br />Every morning i have back or neck problem,<br />I am very disappointed.
B0002MABGE|5|This is not exactly flimsy, I have a Subaru Outback wagon and it fit perfectly. My lab did try to breach it but he couldn't and what more do you want for this price range? It's adjustable, and if you have headrests they provide even more stability for this thing. Very easy to assemble, you'll need a screwdriver and maybe a wrench to get it nice and secure.
B000QER3I2|4|I used this to support a 5-cylinder Volvo engine (front wheel drive) while I pulled a transmission out of a donor car, then pulled a transmission out of a recipient car, then put the donor car's transmission into the recipient.  So I used it quite a bit.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Very strong, overbuilt.  could easily support a V8.  total overkill for my 2.3 liter volvo (but that's what I wanted)<br />- Crossbar was essential - provides extra support if the car isn't pretty close to level<br />- Pretty quick to use once you get it set up for your car<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The triangles on the end cannot be rotated.  The crossbar has to be basically straight across your engine.  It can't be used diagonally at all.  This tool would have been much easier to use if that was an option.<br />- It took me about an hour to get this into a workable configuration the first time, since I have to keep flipping around the metal collars (removing the black plastic end caps) and moving the crossbar around until I found a position that worked.  The nice thing is, once you do that, well, then you're set up for that vehicle.<br />- Paint gets scraped up pretty easily by the sliding collars that hold up the engine.  But, it's a tool, it's meant to be used, so whatever.<br />- It's heavy, but also long and unwieldy.  You may need two people to lift this up over the engine, just so you don't accidentally bang up your car.<br /><br />Buy this if:<br />- You have examined your needs and want something super strong and overbuilt, but don't need the end triangles to swivel at all.<br /><br />Don't buy this if:<br />- You're not sure what kind of car's you'll be pulling engines out of, or where the attachment points are.<br />- You are pulling very small, lightweight motors (2.0L 4-cyl motors, for example).  It's overkill.  But then, if you're safety-conscious and have money to burn, you might want overkill.  That's why I bought this one.
B001C99SYW|5|This idler fit my 2004 XC90 T6 perfectly. It looks nearly identical to the OEM. Time will tell if it will last 100,000 miles like the original Volvo part. For now though it is installed and working perfectly.
B000C9G82I|5|Worked great on my Tahoe. OEM replacment
B000F15IE2|5|Covers my dash nicely, comes with enough velcro to hold it down tightly around the contours. Very satisfied for the price.
B008S9CHW4|4|worked great
B004BQ87YK|5|Looks great!!! All the prep work was well worth it.
B00AMEK45K|5|Using it for a backup light, works great
B000GD5FMY|4|I've had these glasses for about a week and they work great! My only issue is that the foam on the smoke glasses came a little crooked in one small part as if it came apart and was reattached in the wrong spot. It's hardly noticeable and doesn't affect the protection from the wind at all. Other than that they shipped on time, they're comfortable, they feel sturdy, and i'd order them again if I were to lose a pair.
B00U2Y1Z7Q|5|extremely good product, exellent service, fast delivery..Thank you
B001EAQTRI|5|Can tell when it is plugged in or not.
B00DJDYORU|5|The product did work.as advertised.  My AC got very cold very fast.  The nozzle  on the hose--the screw into the can thing handle did twist off and so I used a pair of vice grips to turn it in (puncture) then turn out the valve (open).  On a 91 ford Probe it took the sealer can comprised  of RED TEK and Sealer and then about one can of regular RED TEK before the AC got real cold.  It appears to be colder than the orginal.  R 12 --I would say about 40 degrees coming out the vents.  The can gets very cold as the RED TEK is being added, then suddenly the can actually got hot.  That is when I stopped.  It has been four weeks now and my wife loves that she has her ac back. She has been without ac for ten years.  As I said earlier the handle on the little valve might just strip itself off as you are tightening it in, so just garb a pair of vice grips.  Later I JB welded the handle and it works okay for the next application in the future.  We live in the deep south where the temps are always in the 90's with high humidity and this is a life saver.  .
B000KZ0Q7W|5|Worked perfect for my 99 silverado
B008GNG5LG|5|Thank's for best supply!!!!
B001UC72UI|3|The screw was missing.
B00CBG30BW|5|Great hitch quality craftsmanship. Easy install.
B001DHEBLI|5|Prompt delivery.  Perfect fit.
B00V30J86I|1|It was the wrong one
B005R4KXUG|5|It was a perfect fit for my 2005 chevy silverado. Once you get your LED lights it's all label in the back.So pay attention to the labels, what it says on the back and insert your sockets as you read the label  !
B00GE9Y5CK|3|Front flaps went on very easy - rear flaps had to drill and then product did not come with second set of bolts/nuts for rear flaps.<br /><br />Front tires do rub on front flaps when turning sharp corners.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|“Well, I have never been excited about a tire pressure gauge before, until I tried my JACO pressure gauge!  It felt solid, it's nicely engineered and innovative.  I have a half a dozen gauges kicking around my garage, and they are all terrible, I can't trust the readings.  But with my JACO it's different now.  Thank you!”
B005HAYDR4|4|Didn't realize these were shipping from China. The 2 week wait was frustrating. Otherwise, excellent!!!
B00X7HS5LY|5|Great product!
B00KTLZPS2|3|It's ok. Easy to assemble and runs good so far. Takes a few pulls to start up each time. Just be aware this thing has zero suspension and is a very rough ride. I guess it is meant more for flat roads? I thought my son could do a little offroading with it but the ride is just too rough. My next purchase will probably be an actual dirtbike.
B00KF5HP30|1|I only wore them about one time and they are falling apart
B006RKEY1I|5|this is a great product nice and professional looking and durable
B0045K2Q9Y|4|good
B000VL3S98|1|muffler is incomplete and the original pipe from old muffler needs to be cut in order to attach this one to it.
B00QL6D3LK|5|Pretty Good!!!
B00C7S9K8Q|5|I like this light. vary bright off road. can not beat the price. worked great behind my stinger front bumper on my off road k5
B000VSCDWO|5|Work great, and are more than bright enough.  I understand these are NOT DOT approved, however in my state signal lights aren't even required, so they were fine for my needs.  I would buy again.
B00NWGZ3A6|5|It is what I expected, and it does everything I want it to do.
B006924FN6|1|It was the wrong one it feet the fork but it going down in the dram so that's the wrong one
B00OJZ3Y1O|5|Item was delivered very promptly and was neatly packaged. I am very satisfied with the product, everything was in perfect working condition. Thank a bunch!
B007BSQTIQ|5|Quick delivery fit great
B003EOZIP6|5|I have a 2011 JK Unlimited and it fits like a glove! If you're lazy like me and don't want to take off your soft top with some finagaling (sp?) it can be done but don't push it cause I did rip one of the squares.
B002E323DS|5|Replaces Mercedes-Benz turbo resonator which is poorly designed and commonly ruptures from heat & pressure. Dorman unit is far more robust.
B000FGI6VE|5|Drop in replacement, no hitches. Better performance and mpg!
B001DAGEG0|4|Still works .
B007LIB94K|5|The cover is very bold and the colors are accurate as described and in the stock photo. It fits snuggly around my Mazda 6 and provides better grip . It is sweat resistant and has no crazy scent or slip to it. I would recommend this to any one that wants to accent the interior with this custom design. It is a reasonable price but looks very fancy. I would buy it again for my next vehicle.
B000GKAZVI|1|It doesn't stay on the wall... the glue is of very poor quality....
B003T2XWBK|5|Great, stuck immediately to the car! Looks great, great witness tool.
B000C34L78|1|item picture is misrepresented. it is not metal, it is plastic. the tension is off and caused damage to my engine. it does fit that's the only good thing about it
B0083W17K4|4|carburator worked fine communicatin with catec sucked
B000DZBHLI|5|Haven't use yet.  It is a big tube.
B007TYXXL8|5|Looks Great !!! Looks just as good on my vest !!!
B00PLDR400|5|Great freaking product, fit perfect over rugged ridge 3.5 bulbs for 10 times the price
B0012TYXKG|5|Received quickly, have not uesd at this time. Seems to be a well built tool.
B009JTRTUM|5|You can't beat these for the money! I put these on my 94 Mustang GT not only do they perform better than the stock suspension, they make the look of a car a whole heck of a lot better as well. I'm sure there are better springs and better shocks but for the money these can't be beat.
B000TYU0FM|5|Fit just like they said
B006VU36WC|1|applied 4 times and wore my arms out and the spots are still there .... dont waste your money
B002B54WLU|1|Did not fit over OEM rotar for Honda vtx1300c . Felt beefy tho
B00JHWIE50|4|OK product
B004PC0BD0|1|Cheap make don't  buy it
B00X2TUW1I|5|Excellent product and seller! Would highly recommend!
B000NCS7GE|5|just what i needed
B00JR1H2EK|5|Well built. Installed perfectly on the rear of my truck. Quality item.
B010GW3S0A|1|I received the wrong stickers.
B0038AXE7K|5|Awesome looking installed!
B0023XIKLS|3|Bought if from Rock Auto before I knew about Amazon. The pump fit perfectly, no leaks, fuel sender worked fine and needed no additional parts to install.. It lasted 110,000 miles before it degraded from about 49-50 psi to 34-36 psi and lower if the outside temp. was over 104 (I live in Arizona!). If you are not going to drive another 100,000 or so, this pump is cost effective, especially if you install it yourself.
B000LDIJ72|5|Great
B00J0FSSE6|5|I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived at my door! Not only did it come with the Bad Wolf decal as expected, but I also received a small DW decal as well! I got the Bad Wolf one for my laptop and now I can put the other one on my car!
B003NU0EM8|1|Don't waste your money
B006EGAIII|5|Light weight and strong.  Very happy with them.  Good value....
B00TKMM2VE|5|Very satisfied and order a extra one for a friend.
B00XFOK5QC|5|great product
B00OH0S5Y2|4|Super bright LEDs. Plug-n-Play replacements for my 168 incandescent bulbs. Replaced four marker/running lights. Sometimes they don't light and have to be flipped around and reinserted to work. (Unidirectional). Unfortunately, 2 bulbs are DOA, totally non-operable. I tried flipping them around, and even bending out the contact wires, to make sure there is good electrical contact. We'll see if the remaining four bulbs work. Also, I just installed them (Aug 22, 2015) on my 1990 Toyota FJ62 Land Cruiser, so we'll see how long they last.
B00480J4KA|1|I ordered two of these HID bulbs for my car and i had to replace them within months they did not last long at all!
B00J262R9A|5|Work perfectly on my Ford Focus 2.0 Duratec from Venezuela, Never update the firmware of the device if you want use with an old car
B00M0TLQ66|5|I cleaned several rusty tools with this solution. I filled an empty peanut-butter container with as many rusty tools as I could fit, then poured the Evapo-rust into the container. The tools soaked for closer to 24 hours (recommended time is 1-12 hours) but most came out looking fantastic. I used a brass brush on some spots to scrape away scale, but for the most part the Evapo-rust did all the work. See the before-and-after photos of the Craftsman Handi-cut edge cutter (37300) after 24 hours. It looks like the surface treatment (blueing?) was removed in the process.
B000E81VN8|5|Perfect fit for my wife's 2013 G550.  Completely cleaned up the ongoing mess from hauling kids around.  Hasn't moved once even when we took the truck to the beach and had to be towed out of the sand!  Very happy with this product.
B0017HB3X8|5|Fit perfectly and was exactly what my husband wanted
B0001EW4DG|5|Delivery was quick. The install was easy .
B000CRKOKW|5|Perfect fit on my 2014 Sonata Hybrid Limited!
B000CPIMVW|4|Really nothing much to say other then good durable stuff!
B0012P2CO4|3|It was not the correct part my brother needed so I returned it.
B00KA00X4S|5|Easy to use I wish I had this sooner
B009CYB1NU|5|They arrived in perfect order and where easy to install.
B004L41SRK|4|I'm sure this product is great. However, just beware that it's the small rubes so it won't work in larger grease guns.
B007VR6YP0|5|Quality lines with good fittings and well dont flares. No leakes whatsoever.
B00L2NF1XA|5|I got this to matched the seat covers I bought. I was glad that I can actually customized and cut some parts of it to fit my car perfectly. I have a Mazda CX-7. The color is the same as it shows on the pictures. No rubbery smell, very durable and looks great!<br />I got this product on a discount price in exchange of an honest review.
B000M8SY0I|4|It's good compact and it works, but no one ever mentions that it doesn't have a pressure gauge built into the compressor. I basically have to guess how long it'll take to inflate to the desired point, remove the compressor, measure tire pressure, adjust, repeat, etc. Probably would've thought this purchase through a little bit more had I known this ahead of time....now I just have to struggle with it :/
B000JFJLP6|5|WorkS Great Got It fast
B000GTY2AO|5|Excellent.
B00P1JFWVM|2|wiring diagram is on product very general description works but not for someone who does not understand vehicle wiring
B0002Z9NQU|5|Excellent.  When you initially &#34;start&#34; the vehicle, in my case, a Jeep GC 4.7L v8, you get a nice nice nice grumble. Super throaty and really nice.  After 30 seconds, at idle, it's very quiet.  You hit the gas and it's noticeable but nothing like a 40.  This 50 Delta Flow is for the person that's probably a little bit older (not in my 20's anymore), and I do like the grumble, but i don't want to be too much of a grumble.  At 55-60 MPH, there is zero drone inside the cabin.  It sounds practically stock at highway speeds.  The only noticeable noise levels are at below 15 MPH or around there.  It's &#34;tame&#34;, but that's precisely what I was after.  The days of the super super loud exhaust are long gone for me.  At 45 yrs old.
B00K23V0QS|5|Works as advertised!
B000765E08|5|This was easy to install and took a matter of minutes. The bolts that came with the set weren't the right size so I had to use the old existing ones on my vehicle. All around great product.
B0096TRDZG|1|Product glue is very weak, it falls off the windshield when left in the sun,  I Ordered two,  Put the first one three month ago, and It fell off last month, I replaced it with the second one, which also fell off a week ago.
B0031HL09E|5|Better than buying a new starter!
B0009NUG66|4|The velcro has already started coming apart from the body of the topper.
B005FNKSMW|5|Awesome item !!!! Works great !!!! Thanks Again !!!!!
B000W41K3K|5|Love this product. I have one under the hood and in the trunk. Huge improvement.
B003SOJV3C|4|Work perfect
B003ULYNLS|5|Perfect fit and function for my 2005 MK4 Jetta GLI. The controls are different on the new stick (on top in the picture) but everything works exactly how it should including the cruise control.
B00H5DOIZS|5|Excellent pads to use with the Meguiar's DA microfiber program.
B002LOP5IA|5|Love this brush for my wheels.  Does a great job of cleaning between and behind, so your wheels look clean not just in front, but all the way through and from any angle.  Been using it about a year now and it holds up well, creates plenty of foam, rinses easily and is perfect to use.
B0031GHKVC|5|Used this to replace a seriously leaking and rusted return line for my 1997 Dodge Dakota 3.9 v6.  It fit perfectly and no more leaks. I did notice the old one had a small print on the tip which the new one didn't have. I removed it and put it on the new one is it wasn't torn. Not sure if this is needed but something to look for. Price can't be beat!
B00JKJEWAQ|4|This was of good quality but did not fit my jeep at all even tho I specified year & model. It had to be returned.
B00TQ0UQ18|5|Fast shipping!! And its dope.
B00FJODJGE|5|Product is high quality and arrived in good condition. Easy to install and gives a great finished upscale look to the vehicle.
B002YKIM6S|5|great product I can at last see my weld

B00IOBSYB4|5|works just as good if not better than Mother's wheel cleaner.
B0079MKKZC|5|No complaint's.  Nice solid piece of chrome.
B00AJW7RKU|5|Just as promised! Fits great and provides excellent sun protection!  Nice investment!
B009M0S4Z2|5|Works great, wish it was a little wider though
B00JCKT8D4|5|did over the weekend simple hand tools went write in sounds great.
B000E35UV2|5|At first I thought it might be too small for my Motor Home, but it is doig the job just fine.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Great item, great price. Will purchase again!
B00BAYQOA0|5|Fit perfectly, easy to install, no drilling required, a faction of the price of dealer installation.
B002UC8LXE|5|Great

B008NMWQ6I|3|these installed quickly. Found they reduce the amount of travel you have in your suspension do not like this part but in all I got what I paid for
B000FPXUEI|5|all was good
B00BZSE20U|5|Great service and quick delivery.  Item received just as described.  It was perfect fit and good quality.  Great for containing grass and dirt from golf clubs and shoes in our daughter's Patriot.  Also appreciated reviewer advice to unroll and place heavy items on it to flatten it out...worked perfectly.
B00K6BGS36|5|Worked create
B00803PN92|5|Honda's breakes
B00D9C2CDO|3|Mine got wet inside on a 17hr drive where the first couple hours were in n out of rain. Not happy. Everything looked like it should have but still got wet. Also bugs hitting it tear the fabric. Not happy for how expensive this thing was.
B001IWL1O8|5|Works great.
B00COE3ZCK|5|Took all of two minutes to fit to a Prius Gen II/2009. Fits perfectly, excellent in rain.

B00G620ZVU|1|water in housing tried to contact but heard nothing had to buy others wasted money
B000FA8W1Y|5|Excelente seller
B000W0RQ8C|4|I bought this to prevent my US Army receiver cover from growing feet and walking.  This is a well made lock, and easy to use.  The waterproof cover seems to fall off a lot when unlocking, but I never lost it.
B0051SUM9U|4|Looks great.  Waiting for the mounting hardware to arrive to install them.  Shipper must hate boxes as the box was destroyed.
B006QH55YM|5|So far so good..great battery..
B00MHK963I|5|This is a beautiful steering wheel cover. It looks very classy. It is comfortable and well made. The only complaint I have is that the stitching has a few spots that are sticking up. Looking to buy this in different colors for other vehicles.
B000KKPFFA|5|I'm using this with some J&B Water Weld to save a solar pool heater.  So far, so good.
B001N2O3PM|4|Classic and sleek. Bought a set of two, after having to replace a &#34;blingy&#34; one that was a waste. Heavy duty and good quality.
B000COBLJI|4|Great bulbs. It's nice to have something extra when on a dark unlit road at night.
B0044B30TO|5|Its Toyota genuine product. What you've to say about this.
B000HBGGQ4|5|Great stuff. Removes the grease from my son's legs when he falls on his bike. Cleans my hands when I get greasy stuff on them. Works fast and doesn't require water.
B000M8IEEE|5|This stuff will melt any grime away like it's how butter sliding off a piece of whole wheat toast.<br /><br />Be careful though, with the straw (to aim) it comes out at VERY high pressure and will splash back and get you in the eye. Wear safety goggles and you'll be good.
B00KMPGYSK|5|Fit Great! After some minor adjusting. Look awesome and would definately recommend to any ok ne looking to buy projector headlights!
B009DK5Z62|5|fit like a glove, great price

B00BFDJ72S|5|Perfect fit, easy replacement!
B007ECFURK|5|So far so good.  I've read some other reviews, and I haven't had it fall apart yet, and it's been over a month.  Let's hope it holds up, because I love how it looks!
B000B8JUNY|5|Fit like a glove. I particularly liked the feature to make sure the item fit my car first. Saved any hassles... and the price was more than 10 or more dollars cheaper than the stores & it comes to your house in a quite timely manner.
B000NOO798|5|Very good!
B00ZI7RCV0|5|Works just fine for my pocket bike<br />thanks a lot
B00FSC3A84|5|Working GREAT, so for. Could have paid atleast 8 or 9 times more.
B002XE00ZQ|5|I needed some safety lights on the back of my skid steer when I get out near the road. I didn't really want a beacon type light as that may be bothersome for the neighbors and sometimes they get broken off. (although my unit DOES shake the ground.. like that can't be bothersome, Right? )<br />I flush mounted these in the rear engine cover. Tail lights are Bright, the addition of Stop Lights are Brain Damage!  (Don't look at the light) Ha!<br />Very Nice, Very Bright, Very Pleased !
B00EVPM0LC|1|I looked high and low to find a better alternative to the cheap Harbor Freight hand pump. This one certainly looked the part, with its metal body and seemingly solid design. The piece itself seems well made, but this is where the positives end. This thing is downright hard to use, leaks, and is just plain terrible. The hoses are such a large diameter that they weigh more than the oil bottle from which you are trying to remove liquid - which has caused spills in both times I have tried to use this pump. On top of this, the pump leaks with each pump, from the union of the upper and lower rubber ends. junk!
B00WMR1I64|5|I am using this wiring harness to run a 20 inch LED light bar, and it works good. The only thing I had to adjust was add a couple feet of wire to get from the relay to the light bar because it only comes with seven feet, then the switch gets the other seven feet to equal the fourteen stated.
B000P6UO2I|4|Nice tool
B000Z0HVHA|5|Very well made of heavy duty materials.  I bought this along with a Waypoint Spotlight for my boat. The 12' chord lets me use the light anywhere on the boat or around it.  The long length is perfect because it allows me to use the spotlight as a work light in the garage or making roadside repairs.
B004O2QXGK|5|great item, very easy installation
B004VKXAU2|3|Filter gasket fell off once installed. I had to drop the trans pan and remove filter to glue gasket back on. The filter would not stay in place while you try to install the trans pan. Make sure the gasket is secure before you install.
B00II7DXSS|1|Cheap. SMALL and charged me shipping cost when  mirrors would rattle loose when  you ride.
B00L4TF32G|4|If applied on a regular basis, if keeps boat seats looking like new and you can easily wipe off mildew and bugs.  It is only a four star because it is kind of costly.
B005C5E72A|5|Fits perfectly, all lines match up, and the color is dead on. EXTREMELY fast shipping. Ordered at 4pm and it was there by 9am the very next morning. Great product, would definitely recommend.
B00PVWHOBA|3|Cute mat, quality is fine, okay price, but shipping took a million years.
B00117D72Y|4|The globe is very pretty in aqua but the piece surrounding the globe came apart within two weeks. Fortunately I was able to get the screw into the globe, so it is still useable. The piece to hold keys will not hold a key with a small hole, and would not accommodate my Mini Cooper me, so I'm using it for my house keys.
B00MJSQ99W|5|These are a perfect upgrade for my front tractor tires!
B00FH8P1DG|5|So far so good. This light is well worth the money. Easy to mount and very bright. Giving it a 5 star but I've only had it on my Jeep for a week.
B004GCA93G|5|GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING PERFECT TRANSACTION A+++++++
B000UKJ67S|5|Works as expected
B006N9648Y|5|Perfect fit. Quality part.
B000CAYAGS|5|Got a pair of these as my original one started to show wears. It took me a while to pick a brand versus another however I decided on this one for a few reasons.<br /><br />1) The price was right<br />2) They are coated with anti-rust paint<br />3) They look and feel sturdy<br /><br />Installing these were really easy, adjusting the brakes was a bit time consuming though as you would like the pads just to be as close as possible from the drum without blocking the drum to spin.<br /><br />These drums really enhanced my braking power on my car so I'm glad I changed them after 180,000 miles!
B00COYZCKS|3|Price was good and shipment quick. The product finish is cloudy, not a bright finish. Some swirl marks in the finish. Installed easily and will wait to see how the finish holds up.
B0017OGA70|5|very nice
B00CLUYFNA|4|Tough to install with a bed liner.  I haven't tested these too much yet, but they seem to be rugged.
B00K0B4AIC|5|We'ry good product👍👍👍
B00JJZ2JII|5|Great product!
B003CX5VEM|5|Good quality.  Came quickly and fit perfectly for the car it was ordered for.
B00DSVMCQI|4|Love the new vest. Kind of sad to have to get rid of the old one after 25 years.
B00MJLHWXG|5|As described
B000L9AD2K|5|A must have in car! This little boy does a really good job and so handy!
B000EDOSMO|5|Looks great! Fit my 2008 aerolite cub prefect.
B00KL3ALGO|5|I love that it's easy to put on and take off. I don't love that my toddler always takes it off.
B006WQSQH0|5|Great
B010PIMWT8|5|Exactly what I needed and delivered on time.
B001B7A2L8|3|still brand new in the box.  have not used it yet.
B001KO4OMU|5|Perfect fit for our 2010 VW Routan.  Have used Centric's rotors on quite a few of my cars with no issues.  GREAT BUY!
B00Z515O5K|5|Exactly as described and right on time.
B007RW3KJM|5|Good Value!
B00IY2CR3E|4|The grandchildren lost the original remote and headphones on a recent trip. This remote and headphones replaced the original supplied equipment on my wife's 2015 Enclave perfectly.
B000T2W336|5|Excellent product!! Perfect fit for my bike rack!!
B005LASPB0|2|Had to morph my old one's mounting bracket to make it work. Ok quality not the best, but once in couldn't tell it from OEM
B00E6A9SMQ|5|Ilove it.
B00B32DISA|4|Great quality,  not to hard to install
B0002STSC6|4|Tester works as it is supposed to.  However the male connector on the visual indicator is smaller diameter than standard spark plug boots; thus fits loosely and you must be sure it is making contact.  Otherwise it works fine.
B00QMF1HCW|5|The reviews were right! The hardest part was getting the mufflers dropped. Make sure to use Vaseline to help get the rubber hangers back on. Very heavy duty. If your cargo rack is low (because the SUV is low -nothing to do with the hitch), you can buy an adapter double receiver that will raise your rack about 12&#34;.<br />FYI, the spare tire will drop easily even though the back of hitch touches the tire.<br />Perfect fit on 2015 Journey Crossroad
B0012S9A5U|5|i love it  it worth the price! remove any exhaust hangner super fast. you will save time !
B00NTQEZ44|5|The new grill cover looks beautiful on my husband's new Silverado!! It really enhanced the look of an already great truck!!

B004500M8G|1|DID NOT WORK FOR A SMALL LEAK, WASTE OF MONEY...
B000FPY59W|1|First package was missing fasteners, corner rails, tailgate rails and connection tubes. A second package is being shipped. I'll update my review upon arrival.

B00E9I97QC|5|Good fit
B002YMSML6|5|same as factory, price was much better than local parts store!
B003UT3S6Q|3|Product works ok... did not get the grit in the corners of wheels or in lug nut cavities. The mini brush was too big to fit in my BMW wheel, M wheels, style 135. I will try this product on my other cars when needed.
B00HZSNV4C|5|Works Great!!! Take almost everything that marks up the outside of the RV. Very impressive.
B00GI9IFUO|5|A+
B000CACMMM|1|We purchased this for our trip to bring our son to college.  The first (and only) time we used it, the zippers both broke.  We were unable to reattach the zippers and only had the velcro to hold everything together.  When we got back from our trip, I tried to return this item, but found out the 30 day return period had expired.
B00G4RYBZI|5|Good color match. Amount of paint provided was more than ample for my needs. Quick shipment.
B000NE7TJ8|4|Good Job!
B00NX8EYFI|5|So cute and easy to apply
B00KTHY85C|2|Was excited to receive these. One worked just fine, the other one does not work at all. Dissapointed.
B004A69U5G|5|Good price.
B004YTWFTW|4|The bell was great although we needed to get a new ring because the original one cent out of shape after putting it on. Otherwise perfect.
B00CULELG6|5|Thanks
B00PJPHEBO|5|Works great with 2002 Buick Century and galaxy note 4. Replaced factory radio with a Eonon g2110zv android dvd,BT,gps,wifi head unit and it also works great with that. My gas hand doesn't work but now remaining fuel can be read on screen via torque pro app straight from the ecu. Will be ordering another for my wife's car. Great product. In the words of Payless,&#34;You could pay more but why.&#34;
B00B9H3WDK|5|Same quality as the original, works great. easy to install.
B00CP95SOM|5|Awesome reaonable and so easy to install.

B002CJJQX4|5|As stated
B0094A6UUQ|5|Great accent piece
B00D3TB6RG|5|I had to tap mine in to the exhaust with a hammer, but that's fine because it's snug.  Muffled the sound of the care quite nicely.
B00DJSRSSM|1|Bought this for my mark 7 GTI, did not FIT... dont buy for this model.
B00QUHE8L4|5|These boots are sooooo nice boyfriend loved them!!!
B00FRM8TZO|5|Stock C6 Corvette filter. Does filter stuff.
B00D3YEGO6|5|Love this license plate frame, it looks wonderful on my car! It came fast and in a beautiful box. I even received an email from the seller the day it arrived making sure I liked it. I found this to be very professional.
B007MAQFFA|5|Love the the decal for my car....
B003L7T57S|5|I drive a 4 cylinder chevy 60-80k miles per year for my work and after about 100,000 i noticed a slight decrease in power and &#34;get up and go&#34;. My throttle position sensor was not working properly either (check engine light). I bought this in hopes of cleaning my throttle body and getting some power back because as much as I drive my car I want to keep it in great running shape. I followed the instructions on the can exactly and almost instantly after the smoke was gone I could notice a difference. It wasn't a huge difference but then again my car only has 103hp. Either way it is running more smoothly, wants to go more than it did before the treatment, and I don't need to buy a new throttle body and sensor. I love this stuff.  No evidence on gas mileage yet but I'm confident it will be better or the same than before.
B000NWA8HU|5|Just installed, replacing a semi-malfunctioning unit. The new unit is working as if the truck has just been received.
B00IABO53E|5|Served it's purpose well.<br />No scratches on my wheels.
B00FX26EU0|4|Not bad, you have to cut the fairing and metal pieces off. Alot of do it yourself work. Is this worth $60? No, more like $40.
B001V6MGZO|5|Husband wears the hat all the tme
B00280EII0|1|I lanyard comes keys. On haetneundeyo Buy photos need to switch. I guess the switch is wrong Bo nengeo
B003RQBKLC|4|Much better quality than I was expecting. Great tool to add extra outlets for all rhe electronics
B005HMOSSG|2|it was a 9 piece and not 11 pieces as advertized
B00PP7T0Q8|5|great connectors
B006VYYNCA|2|didn't fit on m,y car even thought it said it would.
B0007N5758|4|This is a great nail brush.  It really cleans under your nails quickly.  Even garden dirt and some asphalt sealer came off quickly. The color is garish so I keep it in the laundry room.
B00BNX8A1O|5|nice filter.  walmart does not carry this filter yet for the newer Kia Optima turbos.
B002VHA3EI|5|love it and even got a smaller version and put on front windshield and other on back.
B00SBHUA5O|4|Just installed it, so far so good....delivery was speedy to my location, got it sooner that i expected.
B009GIXPF4|5|Delivery was on-time and as expected.  I was able to put the shelter together without help very easily.  The size is good for my bike:  2015 Harley Road Glide.  It's important to secure the shelter using either tie downs (not included) or bolts to some sort of flooring (bolts included).  The instructions are clear on this so no surprises.  Easy to pull the bike in and then pull the cover over the bike, even with hot pipes.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
B00429NKWK|5|involves more time than i thought but the results were amazing!! definitely works
B00DSD6AP0|5|Excellent!!
B000K50NC0|5|Solid pre-out that is quick and easy to install in your GM vehicle.  The nice thing about this is that it includes the amp power signal wire to make it easy to tie back.  Highly recommended if you are looking at adding subs or an amp for the primary speakers in your automobile.  I do wish that the gain pots were easier to access but this isn't enough of a concern to warrant any less of a score.
B00DBLUJEC|5|God is Great!!
B000CSPFXM|5|Great plugs
B00K889FCI|5|easy to use woks ok
B00194F0CE|5|Perfect for camping ! Couldn't have asked for a better product for those personal times!
B000NCOKQK|5|Great product with a great price.  Delivery in less than 48 hours!!!  WONDERFUL all the way around!!!
B00DANQSKA|5|Love them :)
B0002JM9NU|5|goes with the brush...
B001PYNZYS|5|Fitted perfect - Thanks
B00IV7PT2S|3|This horn is amazing, it sounds good is nice and loud but what true don't tell you is that it's a pain to install. It took about 8 hours to mount and wire it.
B001EP0GSG|5|This is a perfect fit for my Mazda CX-9.  Very sturdy construction, it's a really well made piece of equipment. The hitch was painted well and it had a good finish - no scratches to report (not that it matters, it's under the car).<br /><br />I installed this in 30-40 minutes with the help of a friend. You definitely need two people for this job : One to hold it up while the other puts the bolts into place. In addition to the socket wrench, you will also need a rubber mallet to  bang this gently thing into place. I did not remove anything  (Heat shields, etc.)  or loosen the spare tire either, you just have to angle it up and knock it into place. Yes - this will nudge up against the heat shields when you install it, not a big deal at all.<br /><br />The hitch is tucked up right below the bottom of the bumper and it does not hang down at all. This class III hitch will definitely handle my bike rack and a trailer if I need to. Great investment for my ride - Highly recommend for anyone who is considering adding this.
B00JSJMTE4|5|This cover really fits the steering wheel on my Sonoma like a glove.  As other reviewers have noted it does have a strong chemical odor for a while.  It took mine a solid 3 months before there was no scent at all. It seems to be holding up okay in the hot summer sun but only time will tell.  So far I really like this thing.
B003XWEO7C|5|Delivered fast. Installed yesterday but had to modify for my throttle. Love the look and feel and will order again if my mods don't work right. I figure it's my fault not the grips if they fail.
B000BZJDK2|5|Works well. OEM replacement for a wrangler tj fuel pump. Even comes with a gasket!
B00GM4WKJM|4|I bought this for my 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited (JK). Overall it is good. The side velcro does not stay up, but the headrest straps are excellent. My one complaint is that it's about 8 inches to long and has to be folded over to fit in the trunk.
B00VGL6TWA|5|Excellent ball hitch. It came to me bright and shiny.  I like the two ball hitch design because it gives you more selection without taking up too much space like the three ball hitches do.  Good job Connor!
B00UBIMAUO|5|Great product. Immediate difference.
B00T8HPP24|4|The quality of this product is excellent. I did run into one issue that wasn't made clear by the documentation that shipped with the product. I bought this kit for a Nissan Juke. It turns out that the kit that I received was wired as a 9004 base, while my Nissan's wiring harness is wired for 9007 bulbs. Both 9004 and 9007 use the same base/connectors, so correction was simple. I used the following wiring diagram to correct my plugs. Would have given 5 stars if Kensun would have shipped something saying that this kit was universal for 9004 and 9007 bulbs, and what to do for each use case.<br /><br />https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CAcQjRxqFQoTCInBoN_UwscCFYKsPgods9MJaA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fgds%2FH4-H13-9004-9007-HID-Kit-Common-Problems-Hi-Low-Beam-Reverse-%2F10000000177263476%2Fg.html&ei=dIzbVYm3DILZ-gGzp6fABg&psig=AFQjCNGRnii0uuOeQPM5-t-ndfwVs5j6_g&ust=1440538099417143
B0058IEEEC|5|Worked perfectly.  Making sure I don't lose this one in case I ever come across another WRX that needs a clutch job
B007MFZG96|5|No more jackass drivers with this on the back window of my Hummer H3. My GSD is worse then a Loaded GUN he sees things I'm not even pointing My gun at.  he is ready for blood So be aware.
B007OSL3DY|5|Easy to Use, Best Inexpensive Insurance Policy you can buy to prevent my Tailgate isn't Stolen...
B00SA8I05G|5|just what was ordered
B000X242K4|5|Incredible cargo liner for any kind of weather.
B00VBJ9DM0|4|Very easy to install took less than 15 minutes. A little disappointed that the unit does not provide assist in the opening process. Hatch is still heavy BUT IT HOLDS IT OPEN!
B00XZ9OFUO|1|it is not working
B00BVPTF90|2|easy to install. lasted 2 years and a seam broke under top hose barb only has 12 month warranty. bought one from auto parts store and it has 10 year warranty for only $20 more. guess i'll see how long this one last
B0016KG72I|5|Perfect fit, easily  installed
B00BR92XJ4|5|fits as i one thanks amazon
B009TAUE76|5|Just received :My first look impression - really nice , I am hoping it performs well too ..
B00ASEELTY|5|just what i was looking for
B00JOPGQUK|4|only issue is the brake master cylinder get in the way of the throttle cable, no other complaints
B003FWVBHG|5|i love the way looks
B001P0ZA86|5|The only brake controller I'll ever purchase.
B00SVE26YA|5|baba booey
B000BQW5LK|5|it does the job, very helpful for hard to reach areas
B003RQBKLC|5|Works great.  I enjoy the added connections that all work simultaneously.
B00W2XECRU|1|Not made correctly
B00AWYD7RC|5|Very Nice. Easy install. Compliments my bike very nicely.
B00ONACJO8|5|Great sticker. Clearly visible for the potential client looking to identify you (the Uber driver) in a crowded area.
B00WA4ALIU|5|Fits perfect I couldn't be happier.
B013QPHDUK|5|These have worked great so far.  I put them in my tag lights, turn signals, and back up lights and they have worked really nice.  They are very bright little lights.  Much, much brighter than I had expected.  Each one worked fine.  Had no issues using them in any 194 socket at all.  Very easy install.  They can only work one way, so if you install one and it doesn't light up, flip it the other way.  Easy to mistake them for not working if you install them incorrectly.  If you can change a household light bulb, you can install these very easily.  These are nicely made and feel to be of decent quality.  Overall, these lights are nice and bright.  Work really well.  Very happy with them.  One thing to note - These are not covered in any sort of housing.  The LED's are exposed.  So make sure to use them where they will be enclosed in a bulb housing or cover.  I am quite sure that they will get damaged if left out in the elements and moisture gets to them.  I do not think they will last long if this happens.  I received this item at a discounted price to review.
B002008NWA|5|as needed for my old car
B000GTXT0S|5|love it!!
B003WWNWV2|4|It fit my 2004 Suzuki boulevard, i hope it last.
B0066SHNH8|5|Perfect fit, pops right in!
B000C2UKD8|5|Great seller. Prompt and merchandise as advertised.
B00JLVWDO0|1|Couple of problems.<br />1st I came to realize it's not for the civic dSeries, though I inputed all the spec's amazon asks for fitment and said it would fit, but it doesn't. Hose size different.<br />2. The overflow outlet connector had a small jab of weld and poorly held it. The moment I put the over flow hose to it....it just came off.. So I couldn't use the overflow tank.<br />3. Yea, no automaticTransmission connection.. But I am not worrying about that at all, but letting those who have than in question.<br />4. Idk about asking for an a replacement or refund... Replacement could be another bad radiator...idk
B0046I3I8I|5|Fit my trailer perfectly.
B007HQ6JV4|5|Part arrived promptly and was exactly what it was supposed to be.
B004H5BVEI|5|looks great. Good quality
B0022ZR3O2|5|Works exactly as advertised. The disk plates on my bike's front wheel make it difficult to use a regular gauge. This one makes it easy.
B001G7THGY|5|just what I wanted
B00JSCK650|2|great looking, very bright,  but????Where is the moisture inside coming from? used once.
B000C59WGG|5|all good
B000CFOJ96|5|Andersons are ALWAYS good products,,,,
B0044AVLF0|4|got this for the avalon, I've heard you should use toyota filters with toyotas. well, there you go...
B00PV6T586|5|They work perfectly and look really  bright
B00KB4NK34|5|Looks good on my car. My son got the black one, and it looks great on his black car.  I may order a black and move the chrome to the front. But for now I'm happy
B003UZ05CA|1|Gas and fumes leaked from container by 2nd week of having the product.
B004X5QNYA|3|This is not a drop-in replacement for a 2006 TJ Unlimited.  The fittings did not match for the transmission lines.  I had to do an extensive search to locate an adapter fitting that would work with this radiator.  The screws to mount the fan shroud also did not work and I had to get a larger size.  Hole locations were good.  Not bad, but you will have to do some modification to get it to work in an '06 LJ.
B005LDBU0U|5|Once we got the air level corrected (less than you think you need), it made the ride so much more comfortable.  Thank you.
B000FPZYGA|1|It is not what's pictured it's not the u bolt style straps and the u joint was bigger than my stock one
B000760FWU|5|Great product, another family member bought them also, thanks
B0009YDQEE|5|Great color.
B01092ICIA|5|I bought the blue ones and they look great in my blue 2015 Toyota Prius V.  They fit really well, and were a snap to install.  Even getting the straps under the seats to clip together was simple and painless.  The covers for the headrest were a little tricky to figure out, and aren't as form fitting as the seat covers, but it's like 99% of the way there - so great deal.  Good value for the money when you look at custom made covers going for nearly 175 bucks - these are a steal and great bargain!
B005JVSH9G|5|Very good product
B000O097WS|5|Part fit perfectly.
B00EL0UG86|5|very good lights
B00K6197VG|4|Enjoying this product thus far!  The led's Illuminate the streets well especially in area with low visibility.  I would recommend other to give it a try.
B00V901JQ4|5|Works great!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Bought this for my son's new Mustang. My daughter &#34;tested&#34; it for him<br />in her Mazda and compared it to her &#34;silver foil&#34; windshield protector.<br />She said it was very easy to use and fold up and now wants one for<br />herself. Really looks nice up against the windshield in both cars.
B001HMJUD8|5|Fit well on my '05 Equinox. Kept the nice gurgle I thought I'd lose.
B00Y5EFXJ0|5|very good like the picture
B006CV6FX2|5|Was exactly what I wanted .  Looks great on my 2015 Nitro Blue Wrangler ! Fast delivery and packaged great ! Love it !!
B00D7QHLN8|5|Fast delivery. easy to install
B00OXZC1CS|5|Easy installation
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Does exactly what its supposed to do, reduces heat. I have bought two actually and was satisfied with both. Its definitely big enough for a sedan, I have an Infiniti G35 sedan and its slightly bigger than the windshield.
B00JN6L3PI|5|Good price and it works purfect
B00FZ7O9JG|5|Great product, vehicle looks better and upgraded without expensive investment. Thank you
B00AO6I31S|3|Size was still small for me; caused a great deal of pressure on my forehead.  Like the helmet, great features, just did not fit me very well.  I ended up returning it and purchased another brand.  This was the second one I purchased, the first was a XL and it was very tight, gave me a headache on my first hour long ride.  Bought the XXL hoping to solve the problem, but no luck.  May be the geometry of the helmet, or it just runs small.  XXL in another brand fits well.
B00KLKE1OK|1|Didn't glow like it said that would also broke last then a month!
B00TLQRGD8|5|A+
B00BC3727S|5|excellent
B00521T8UU|5|Easy installation instructions are very detailed. The product it's self works amazingly well
B006LJ80C4|3|Panel still comes off. I had to put screws in the panel, which GMC(Envoy) should have done at the factory.
B0099S559U|5|Wife loves it
B007TY2HQK|5|Installed easily and works great.
B0001E65UE|5|Great for our car and truck
B00T74VX24|1|I have tried to use the Jump starter twice. First time I used it on a 4 Wheeler right after a fresh charge and the and the booster pack died immediately. 2nd time I used it on my truck and it just clicked. A friend had another one made by Matco and it jumped the truck off right away. DO NOT purchase this one.
B00DHGPVKI|5|Even if this charger had a lot wrong with it (which it does not), it does one thing which everyone can benefit from:  It will put an intelligent charge to a battery that many other chargers will not charge (or not charge correctly), and save you batteries as a result.<br /><br />I have a friend who runs a garage and has a $500 tester that diagnoses battery health, charge, actual cca ability etc.  After I got the tester I brought him 3 non-functioning batteries, all were then charged under &#34;recharge/maintenance mode&#34; until complete on his $300 wheel around the shop battery charger.  All were then tested on his tester and all read 0-10% health.  He said if a battery reads that, it goes to the scrap pile, nothing else you can do.<br /><br />I took all the batteries back home and charged each one on the correct mode on this optima charger until complete (roughly 12-24 hrs each).  I let them sit on a concrete floor for 3 weeks to see if they had a problem where they would self discharge.<br /><br />After 3 weeks I brought them back to this shop: one tested like new, one tested 72% health (still very useable but maybe not your best winter machine battery) and the third was really dead and still read 0-10% health.  So, in the first week, this charger saved $180 in batteries.<br /><br />I also tried these on a battery tender and it would not put a charge to them.<br /><br />The display shows the current amperage the charger is sending to the battery, describes what it thinks it is doing &#34;analyzing, charging, maintaining&#34; state of charge in 0/25/50/75/100 bulbs (not as handy as an actual number) and also shows a voltage reading.  I don't know if the voltage reading is telling us that it is sending the battery x amps at y volts, or if it is telling us the current voltage reading of the battery.<br /><br />Takes a full two minutes to analyze a battery before charging, wish that was shorter but not a big deal.  Cord quality is good and clips/connections are wellmade.  Uses the standard 12v connectors not some proprietary thing.
B00DRYPL5K|5|Great product. I could definitely tell the difference once I installed it. Took about and hour to install with air tools. 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 5.9L QDCB SLT 4x4
B00M2ZKEWA|2|key didn't work after it was cut. might have been the fault of the guy at the hardware store.
B008ROAZH4|3|Still trying to figure out how these work
B00LBAC5S8|5|Bought this product for my 2 DR 2014 Wrangler.  The shade is probably one of the top 5 accessories I bought for the rig.  I also have a SPOD which mounts to the center footman's loop and it posed no obstacle with installation of the shade.  Driving top down in a Jeep is a fun thing but I am not much of a sun person so I wanted something that blocked most of the intense sun rays from heating the cabin and lessened the wind rushing in which can be unpleasant at highway speeds.  The Spiderweb delivers.  The cabin was kept cool in the direct sunlight (in fact, my center console did not burn my arm when I got in the Jeep after it was out in the sun).  There is no annoying flapping or unusual noise from the shade.  I drove the Jeep in excess of 70 MPH on the interstate, and various speeds on country roads and it performed beautifully.  The shade will allow me to take the top down more regularly now that I do not have to bake in the sun while driving.  It allows a nice amount of cooling wind to come in the cabin even with the windows closed.  Installation was a snap and the videos on line were an excellent resource.  Buy one.  You won't regret it.
B0052KY9BY|5|If you are looking for a higher zinc content oil (especially during engine break in) for your pre 1989 engine this is a great value. No need to mess with additives when this oil is produced to specs.
B00412YT8W|5|Went in real easy, took longer to get interior door panel out than to put the part in. Came with instructions as well.
B000C30J60|5|Great fit and function
B00X9GS2MA|3|If there was a way to give this thing 2.5 stars I would. The problem with this product is it's not useful for anyone taller than 5'. The design is good. The concept is good. The sizing sucks. I am 5'11&#34; and this is only good as arm protection for me. There is no way this product fits on the leg of a tall person. It's ridiculously short, almost comically so.  If you are taller than 5' DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT and expect it to work as knee or leg protection. If you're tall and have good arm musculature, you may find it useful as arm protection.
B0028OPVLO|5|works great
B000B90M0I|4|It was exactly as described.  Fit perfectly!
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Works just as advertised. Nice, simple monitor.

B000FPXUDE|3|Works, but vent is on the opposite side as compared to my factory hose.  Worked though...
B00CEMDUEU|1|Delivery was on time, but i had to do some modification (grinned it a bit) for it to fit my 2003 Nissan Murano. I didn't have a micro meter to sa how far off it was.
B000H7DXBO|5|Works great!!
B0077K8TXG|5|performs very well great at high speeds I got a 110,000 miles on my truck cannot remember when I had to add any oil. dont want to change it I already ran it over 15,000 miles and  still looks  like it did when I frist put it in.

B00390VEH6|5|Bit bulky, hated them at first but when you realize how strong they are you love them they actually cover my nasty hinges with a new look
B00VA5N26S|1|The concept is great, however, the adapter blew open upon the first try to charge a vehicle.
B002XL2HVO|5|Small but great for apt
B00496XHGK|1|bought this trying to save money got it and installed it and It didn't work -1 star because of the labor to install and uninstall then paid double for Delphi and It worked great still saved 100$ since auto zone charges 240$ for a Delphi fuel pump

B00NXRXAS6|5|Works great
B006CRT72W|5|Works great and further than my old one
B001UGJPXQ|5|These are great!  Probably one of our best purchases for our 1998 Itasca motorhome.  We put one under the front bumper and one under the back bumper and now the motorhome is as stable as can be.  Very simple to set up and take down.  They each have their own carrying bag for storage.  Lightweight.  I was skeptical when I saw them because they actually look cheesy but they really are worth the money to buy and use.  We're very happy and highly recommend them.
B00S20958S|4|Definitely a cute gift, but I was expecting a shinier/polished penny
B00MNRA828|4|I have received this awesome vinyl Don't tread on me....<br />I have put it nicely on my truck but when I have carefully tried to remove the final peace some of the sticker came off and wouldn't stay printed on or glued on the window....<br />I have taken a picture of it and please let me know if you can refund me my money or send me one that is in color RED instead of WHITE....<br /><br />ThankYou!!<br /><br />Sanel

B003ZGKKD8|5|Update, this has been on my auto for close to 2 years now.  It still looks as good as the day I put it on.  The rest of the review applies   A very nice alternative to bumper stickers.  Elegant looking and wont peel or fade.  Installation was easy and straight forward.  I bought a chrome USMC at the same time and placed it under this on the back of my auto, they look great together.  Showing my Marine pride couldn't be easier.
B0057T45SM|5|Perfect, exactly what I was looking for. Extremely fast shipping as well, 5 stars
B001C4SL4U|5|It fit my 2011 Mini (L4 1.6L N18B16A) perfectly.

B000COCUF2|5|Just as described!
B003DUJAH8|5|We love it!! Its easy to get on and off and makes traveling much easier when we've got the dog in the back. One of the best investments we could have made!
B00I35L4QI|5|This car stops traffic and others just want to know what kind of car is it. I don't want to drive any other car now. When I get in other cars I immediately start to compare the drive, rise, features and comfort. Nothing has measured up to this car yet.
B00H91SB4U|5|Look great fit prefect.
B00LTHWV64|5|It's black
B000CB3ZY0|5|my husband and I, now we can breath fresh air
B00BQP97NE|5|Great Buy! No disappointment with this purchase since installing it.
B0016KFVV6|5|Installed as advertised.  Had to tap out the holes on the Traverse (rust) but once that was done the receiver bolted in with no problems.
B0030GF2NQ|5|this one I got to use primarily and its helpful when my kid is driving
B00E1QLRG0|5|Life saver😄 I had to replace my OEM because the privious owner damaged them beyond repair.  These look great and perform better than stock. I did loose the cornering tech portion ...but at this price I didn't care. Just make sure your model year is correct(rear connections are different) and your golden. Normal OEM lights from Mercedes are at least $1,200.00 each!  This saved me from burning a hole in my pocket and after installation I still came out on top. Now my baby has a updated look and best of all... I can see at night..lol.
B001M6VAHS|3|As the headline shows the bolts are too short but the clips are fine. I ended up buying longer bolts to get back up and running.  Since this may be the only way to get the clip nuts, the bolts are just there to give you another reason to go to town to get parts after you figure out they are too short.  Looks like the other reviews are pretty much in agreement that if you have the large 34 gallon fuel tank (most all of the long bed trucks), the bolts will be too short.  They ship with M10-1.5 x 50mm bolts and the OEM bolts are M10-1.5 x 75mm.  You can order some of the correct from Amazon when you order these but when I checked they came in a 4pk and cost as much as this kit. They will not have the dog point but will work.  I ended up using a 70mm long bolt I got at the hardware store and it worked great.
B00NFSNAS8|5|Very pleased with this product. Works well and great customer service department.
B00L7XKE8C|5|Uses h1 bulb nice fit look great.
B007QB59DO|5|Perfect fit for my 2010 Mini Cooper Hardtop! Better price than what the dealership was trying to sell me.
B00Q3COZD2|5|Pretty self explanatory to put on, the back seat was a little tricky. But it went on and looks great!
B00WAORBDI|3|These do the job. However, the sticky tape wasn't strong enough to really keep them on.
B000FOUWNQ|5|Class A motorhomes have always had bad reception on fm and even am is poor to say the least,installed this jensen antenna and it pulls stations in as good as my personal car does,very satisfied
B005DEPWMY|5|Great deal
B00O0MX18W|5|The pod fit great right out of the box. I used this and the adapter for an H&S minimaxx tuner. There was no trimming needed for it to lay flat on the dash but to run the wires for the tuner down the door seal I had to trim a tiny bit out.<br /><br />I am also not using any kind of adhesive, it pretty much stays in place unless I hit a really hard bump.<br /><br />No complaints here!
B00LNOK4E4|5|Fits perfectly and incredibly bright intense 6000K light that matches the HID lighting on the car perfectly.  Excellent product!
B00OV7AIZ0|4|Love the roof rack looks nice on my jeep . The box was damage when it got to the house but rack was all good the way it was packed . The plastic nobs are junk lock nuts inside are to loos and spin inside so don't use them or you wk) have to cut them off . I wish they would come up with something better and send me replacement one that work.but do like the Rack.
B002DPHDF0|5|Bolted right up. Just like the oem part.
B000P6UNFQ|3|Eh...did the job, but the U shaped part of the tool loosened after the first use. Still works...cheap construction. One of the rivets is the issue. Not sure if it's worth the price.
B006RKG8ZS|5|Is really cool I just got the firefighter plate and it look awesome
B00CNEQYF6|5|These things are amazing! My hood isn't falling on my head anymore and I love it.
B003WHBVDI|4|Haven't used it yet to make sure it is vaporless in my saddlebag.  Fit in saddlebag as described and will be useful on my upcoming touring rides for backup fuel in remote areas.
B00NVWEQUE|5|These look and feel great on my Honda hornett
B007Y0M480|5|These are perfect for my needs and very well built.  I use it to mount a Pro camera gear bag on a small hand truck for transporting a dozen lenses  several flashes and a couple of camera bodies.  Feels secure and safe.
B011M66G5I|4|Item arrived in time, I expected them to be like mats but they aren't. It is made of some type of flimsy vinyl. Still, it serves it's purpose. I didn't have any trouble putting them onto my seats, the coverage was good. I travel with two toddlers, and they do a whole lot of foot work behind my seats, this product has helped to keep my seats protected from any dirt on they're shoes. Would be great if this product was made of something a little more firm.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A GREAT PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Received it fast and it works great.
B00GM4WKJM|1|Horrible quality.  One of the headrest straps pulled apart from the cover the first time it was used with the dogs, the hook & loop attachments are not put on symmetrically, so it's almost like someone forgot to sew one on.<br /><br />It is slightly padded and I do like the extension that goes out the back of the SUV so the dogs don't scratch the bumper when they're getting in.  There are also pockets on the sides of the cover so you can store dog toys, leashes, etc.
B000YGKJ7E|5|Perfect-just what we needed
B0012INT98|4|This did exactly what I needed it to do. We drove 70+ mph for a total of 14 hours with no issue.  We also drove through a torrential downpour for at least an hour, and none of the inside belongings got wet.<br /><br />My only complaint I have is that I did not realize that although I have a roof rack on my GMC Terrain, the stock rack does not have the crossrails that this requires to secure it to the actual roof rack. So if you plan to secure it to your car's roof rack, be sure that you have crossrails.  I didn't have enough time by the time I realized this to either 1) order GMC cross rails or 2) order the clips available on Amazon, so I had to resort to securing it through the vehicle itself.  Aside from adding time on the front and back ends of the trip to ensure that the carrier was totally secure, it did end up being securely tied down.<br /><br />If I had to do it again, I would've ordered the clips, however with the purchase of some caribiners and some ingenuity, we managed to secure it and it was fine for our trip to the beach and back.  I would recommend filling it as much as possible, otherwise there would be a lot of flapping and a lot of extra play in it which may or may not cause it to shift.
B003E1IQBM|5|Took a trip to South Dakota with a trailer on the back and it worked great.
B00SIS05EM|5|Arrived a week sooner sooner than advertised. Two weeks sooner than Amazon promised. I used these to modify a small trailer to be pulled by my motorcycle.  They are perfect for that and very bright.  Wiring diagram is in the product specs on amazon. They are common sense coded anyway, nothing to figure out. Black- ground.  Yellow- turn signal. White- reverse. Blue- tail running light. Red- brake.  I would buy this again and I would recommend this to anyone who has a need for bright lights and a need to conserve power.
B000ABCHMS|5|Had a squeaking sound coming from a new drive belt I installed on my golf cart,<br />used this product and sound was eliminated! IT WORKS.....
B00LBAC5S8|5|It fit perfect in a Jeep Jk 2007.

B0084L0YR6|5|as advertised
B0066RMUIG|5|This part solved my 944 lack of fuel supply, this is the most economical part to replace and very often is the reason for fuel delivery failure
B00SBZAG5U|3|It works but will have to destroy the screw covers when it comes off. Rough edges
B00JVIIMGG|5|This is such a cute sticker! It went on my van back window with ease! It has weathered nicely, although I've only had it for about a month. The perfect size to get the message across that love and cats RULE THE EARTH!!
B005JFLSAW|5|Excellent product, very satisfied with it, cost and expedite shipping.
B00068OQ3S|4|Would like to see if there's a plug that would connect to it an maybe have it as an additional part to order. Would make for a nice clean sure install
B00435RU5Q|5|This oil dye made it easy to turn a worn​, stained ottoman into a beautiful piece of furniture.
B00I02SVOC|3|Well to start with, the main feature of the product works fine(i.e the jump starter). My Car battery went flat after not moving it for a month. Connected my Bestek with the product guide and boom, my car started up with ease in one try.<br /><br />The Power bank on the other is not very impressive. Considering it is over 13000mAh, i expect my sony xperia z1 to be charged at least 4 times before it discharges, but in reality, it may not make up to 3 cycle before discharging.<br />Its so bad that the Bestek would completely discharge if you left the switch on accidentally. Also another blunder, as one would have expected an auto off when not on load.
B00BUHMFT6|5|Fits perfectly to replace my old one. Easy DIY job
B000EQB6H6|3|doing the job
B0073L7TNU|5|Perfect fitting!!!
B00QV50JUO|3|Really don't know. My Tundra does not have the wiring for the lights. Maybe someday I will run a wire. For now they sit in the closet not being used.
B00GURJZZI|5|ran great right out of the box....gained about 4 miles an hour...starts better idles better and was better than described.
B0113PU1RW|5|Awesome. Working as described
B0002JM8P4|5|patched over the hole in my rear deck to stop leaking into the trunk... easy to use--just be quick about it!
B00B9FEBSW|3|It works and the programming instructions were easy to follow. Not convinced it is a General Motors OEM part as it states...since the rubber buttons didn't feel quite the same...a little more squishy...and the part numbers were not inscribed in the back of the FOB as they are in the original.
B000C3ZDWK|5|Shock is a bit spongier than I would of hoped in the application I used them in.  I think it is an example of a general shock being designed to work with a range of vehicles and while on some it would be over dampened on others it is under.  For the price they are a nice alternative to stock but if you are going to spend the time to do this yourself you might want to look into spending a few dollars more for something that has some adjustment so you can really dial in what you want your vehicle to ride like.  I wish I had.
B000CCMLD0|5|Tank you for you order.
B007QBJ9J4|5|Fit perfectly. Delivered as promised and on time. Definitely my first choice for parts on my Eclipse!
B00B0DGRF8|5|My woman asked for these specific glasses. She like S.O.A. and loves her new glasses.
B007KPWYN4|2|stabilzer works good but company said it would not hit fender on stock forks.(2004 road king)....well mine does put a large dent in fender. damage already done and need for stabilization but beware you need lots of clearance
B00809WQX2|1|This was not an OEM filter.  Do not purchase if you have a 2004 Sprinter 2500.  It has a large plastic frame and did not fit.  Plus, you can't return the item according to Amazon.
B006YU7G8E|5|Got what I wanted at a great price.
B009S95N4W|5|These are great! They are exactly the same design as the stock hubcaps, but in a classy chromed finish. My stock hubcaps were 7 years old, and the paint was peeling... ugly! These solved the problem.
B00332GPS8|3|As other customers stated, the driver door window will not go all the way up and stay up. It senses there's something in the way, so it goes back down. The 'remedy' is to learn when to push the up button a 2nd time and hold it til it is forced to stay closed. My biggest concern with this is that in time, it may wear the window motor out.
B0002MAE5C|5|I have these lights on the led lights for sale on here, fit like a glove not even kc lights. Many uses not just one. KC light cost too much, led on amazon right price and they fit
B000C9QJLI|5|Perfect fit and operates flawlessly.  It is more of an annoyance to have one of these door jamb switches not work but I was tired of getting into a dark car at night.  Takes all of 30 seconds to replace!
B001MU11AK|4|tthank you
B004A2YEUQ|5|Great fit and awesome price Too!<br />Novice can do this!
B001Y8L65U|2|Not same as pictured.  Weak plastic threads.  You get what you pay for.  The plastic &#34;nut&#34; part that works with the metal threads was flimsy and stripped easily under the little weight I applied.  It stabilizes - but sometimes gives out under weight.  Pay more and get a solid support made of all metal.
B000YOULYM|5|Great price and worth the almost non existent wait.
B000WYYP14|5|Very nice
B000P6WMM8|1|Cheap piece of junk,  doesn't work like it should going to but a metal one to replace this adapter.
B004WJPN2A|5|Luby.
B00CXU2QOI|5|NIce kit, the front went together nice, looks like you need large size rims to fit these, I didn't have an issue but the drop spindles seeps close to the rims and I am running 20's. the Back took a little more time but wasn't too bad when I figured out the best way to lay it out. if you have an extra set of hands or 2 it would be beneficial.
B007NNK3D6|5|I love it, very excellent. Fit for my bike.The color and design is pretty cool.
B000BEZNSO|5|couldn't find anywhere else and this was perfect for our camper
B00KN7H6LQ|4|Was what I expected and looks like original
B000C5DUN2|3|installed easily enough, but the backlighting has stopped working after a month of driving... very irritating..
B000GTW7QU|5|Works as described. I'm able to use it on both my 1980 FLH-80 Classic, and my 2007 FXDWG clutch hubs. Makes popping off the clutch hub an easy task. Great quality tool.
B0002SRGI4|5|PERFECT
B007USQWWA|4|Don't pay your dealership for these! I was quoted around $300 for parts and labor and it is not worth it. The cross bars attach to the rails very easily and are easy to adjust. I do wish that they had a locking function... if a theif wanted to steal our car top carrier, they would be able to loosen the clamp and lift the entire contraption, carrier and cross bars, off and away.
B00WYC1722|1|Tiny stickers, not worth the money. I kinda felt ripped off. But delivered timely so deserving of the one star.
B008EWPHZE|5|Looks sharp.  Way better  coverage than old OEM units.

B0022UPHHM|4|Does the job. Easily fits through valve stem hole to pull stem through. DO NOT pull ridiculously hard as you can strip the tool.
B00FW1JQZC|5|Badass
B006QH55YW|4|unfortunately when it arrived there were some small cracks in the plastic top, it doesn't seem to effect its performance. just a cosmetic flaw-too bad
B000TYEE2M|5|To this day still great. Can't go wrong with the warranty either
B006TMMTU2|5|1/4 of the price of the dealer and took a few minutes to install!
B00144I5KS|1|Not a very good product. It rather mucked up my job of putting compound on my car. I ended up having to do it by hand after all and I killed a drill battery (two actually) for what should've been a simple job.
B004XG3R3O|5|Fit and works great and is cheaper than the hinged type.
B00FJIT9BO|5|i threw away my spray on shine after first use of VRP
B000E2CVIS|4|It does what it is supposed to.

B001KQAAAS|4|bought this in October of 2013 and so far so good
B002696FA2|5|2000 Ford Ranger 3.0 liter V6 developed a coolant leak at the timing cover gasket, a common problem with these trucks. It was a bad leak: steady slow drip when cold, and a steady pee when pressurized. It was not safe to drive it more than 15 minutes without adding 2 quarts of coolant.  Added 1 bottle of Liquid Aluminum to the radiator, per instructions, then started the engine and let it idle. Within 5 minutes after the thermostat opened, the steady pee had slowed to a fast drip. Another 5 minutes and it became a slow drip, and at the end of 15 minutes total, the leak had stopped completely. I let it idle for 30 minutes just to be sure.  I have to say I am amazed. I did not have much hope it would actually work in this case. But the truck has been back on the road for 2 weeks now, and there is no coolant leakage whatsoever. The alternative was $800 at the shop, or a sweaty multi-hour DIY in my carport. Versus a $6 bottle of this excellent product .... I am highly pleased.  OTHER NOTES: 1) Two days after the leak was fixed, a heater hose split near the water pump and had to be replaced. I examined the failed hose and found abrasion marks on the outside at the split, possibly from previous repairs carelessly done to an adjacent part, so it's probable the hose was ready to fail anyway. But there is a chance, as one reviewer noted, that the Liquid Aluminum had accumulated in the radiator cap, interfering with coolant flow to the reservoir tank under pressure, resulting in over-pressurization of the system. I didn't see any obvious accumulation, but just to be sure, I replaced the radiator cap along with the heater hose. No problems at all since then. Just keep an eye on the radiator cap for a few days, and clean it off with water and a soft brush if necessary. If it's an old radiator cap, replace it anyway, they are generally inexpensive.  2) If you have any questions at all, contact Bar's Leaks from their website. My emails were answered promptly and the person at theother end was very straightforward. Just advice, no hard sell.  3) Given the severity of the leak I wasn't sure whether to use the Liquid Aluminum or their other more aggressive product Liquid Copper. When I described the leak, the guy at Bar's advised using the Copper, but since it wasn't my truck, I decided to be cautious and use the Aluminum, figuring that if it didn't work I could always flush the system and start again with fresh coolant and the Copper. As it turned out, the Aluminum did the trick.  4) I also asked Bar's Leaks what is the life expectancy of this kind of seal, and he said that they know of customers who have gone several years and thousands of miles with no recurrence. But he also said that it's impossible to generalize because each instance is different, and with hot/cold expansion and contraction the seal on a gasket can degrade. Makes sense to me. He said that if the leak does re-appear, in my case it would be better to flush the system and start with fresh coolant rather than adding another bottle of Aluminum on top of the one already in circulation. &#34;Better to be cautious&#34;.
B000GOG3PG|4|Motor makes a sound when spinning...But for the price...can't go wrong...
B00LKRUNNQ|5|pasted one on helmet, gave away two.
B001KZIUHO|5|No comment, simply the best plugs available.
B00AU3NFUE|5|Works so good. Brighter then expected. Good for parking lights and lighting my license plate.
B002WIN26W|5|Great product, does the job filtering some light, not to the point of harming your sight of the bumps.
B00PJD83XO|4|Nice product. Happy with purchase.
B0054R9Y4W|4|Great look, but it is a bit annoying as you can see the reflection of your face from within the helmet. Definitely not usable at night as you get blinded by night lights. It does block the sun perfectly though, and is awesome for daytime riding.
B00M36XZ4C|5|Worked thanks
B001O005L4|3|Good for the price. Has not been on car long enough to give it praise.
B002935IV2|4|Worked as expected
B00LUYGP0O|5|I love this sticker, it looks just as described and shown and the shipping was fast as well.
B000GU58Q0|4|kit was shipped in a timely manner and works well!
B009NHQ3XE|5|Very sturdy, folds easily. The height is just enough to let my petite 2 year old use the bathroom sink. She can fold and unfold it with ease and hauls it around to wherever she needs it (to turn on lights, reach things on a shelf, etc.) She also uses it for a coloring station, a tea table, a chair, and a baby bed... it's very versatile. :)
B00D9C2CDO|4|I used this car top carrier to move my son to school a week ago. I made sure it was completely full and that there were no loose ends to any of the straps. We had absolutely no noise and it seemed very secure. It was great to be able to store it in the car on the way home. I wrapped everything in garbage bags in case of rain, and although we only had a little, there was no indication that any water had leaked in.
B00D9GYZNU|3|It came fully charged and all, but it won't start my bike in cooler weather.  40F it really strains to start the bike, and at 32F it won't start at all.  Connections are tight, charged on a battery tender.
B001GMX9KE|5|Awesome deal and works great!!!
B004MTD9QM|5|They look great and stick great! I was worried they would be hard to install but satisfied to find them to be extremely easy! I would recommend them to any one and they greatly improved the look of my Camaro!
B002WQLS1K|5|Audi wants something like $35 a pop for these.  If you have dings or scrapes on your hubs just pop them off (Carefully) with a flat head screw driver and push a new one in by hand.  Bam! Done.  Good as new.<br /><br />Note: shipping time for these was nearly 3 weeks in my case.  My friend, however, ordered the same set and got them in &#60;1 week.
B00L2K75UK|5|I loved it, I used it as a gag on my daughters bumper and it got a lot of laughs. If I need another sign I definitely know where to get it from. The delivery was fast and I liked the way the sign applied and could be peeled off easily if needed.
B00CZG1ZRY|3|Does what it's supposed to, but I've come back to a hot car to find this thing sitting on the dash, since the suction cups have literally melted off the windshield in North Carolina.  Keep this thing in your glove box if you live in a hot environment with a lot of sun.
B004FRY7J4|4|Looks good but rattles. I just applied weather stripping to eliminate noise.
B00T3OW3JK|5|Very satisfied with the item great seller!
B004QHLG4W|1|Put this on in April/2015 to fix roaring/rubbing noise from wheel-well while the van was rolling, it was fine up until now.  Vehicle start back making the same noise, had it checked out and couldn't' believe this hub assembly was bad after only 4 months; changed it with another brand and noise went away again.
B007USQWWA|5|Genuine Toyota parts shipped out of Florida.  I take issue with the design, but that's a problem I have with Toyota not the seller.
B00CMZAYMK|5|Great fit
B004YIWIWM|5|Not stainless steel, but is aluminized steel so still resists rust more so than regular steel, I'd still recommend painting with vht flame proof, sound is awesome, quality of welds is fantastic, whole thing is super solid and for the shorter style, 18&#34; compared to 22 and 26, it drops noise down considerably but the straight through design gives you tons of performance without that obnoxiously loud noise when your revving to 7000rpm
B005HQLE7U|1|Have had it on my truck a month and it broke off from the base already.
B004NYOHK8|5|Nice lights
B008E7QGXG|1|Wrong part for my vehicle
B00XJ0WAN8|5|AWESOME INEXPENSIVE HOOK-UP FOR YOUR RIDE!!!!, Shipped in timely manor, Very easy to install & looks Great!!!
B00UBWQFBK|1|can't see the gauge
B0002SA1T0|4|good top, looks nice. there is a little stretching involved when placing it on which is normal with soft tops.
B00KTI7DZS|1|didn't work -- took it to a garage and they could't get it to work.
B003CK3TB2|5|Excellent fit. Easy installation. Excellent Quality.
B000C7LMNK|5|bien
B003LJEYHM|3|It would have been very helpful if it came with a set of installation instructions.<br />I noticed a website on the back (www.oracal.com, Oracal 651), where I was able to search for instructions. (http://www.orafol.com/tl_files/content/downloads/applicationinstructions/en/Information_PlotterMaterials.pdf).<br />Applying the decal was not a smooth process, but eventually, I got it on.
B00HVETS7Y|4|The product itself is excellent.<br />The shipping and packaging is super.<br />One down point; the vinyl is cut sloppy and not straight.
B00RVATBUC|5|Works great I even mounted it on my tj windshield frame with supplied brackets it was prefect size to fit with drilling holes and modifications
B00EOTE8BA|5|It's an exact fit and easy to install.
B007PK17BO|5|Very good. Fits perfectly my CX-5  2016-
B0055AZZ9G|5|I do not have navigation in my vehicle, but I do have an Ipad and it works great with this.
B003BZD03K|5|Must buy for any camper with a water hookup. It will save your self from a linked hose and leaking fittings.
B00SS3TUT8|5|NOT MARSOC EMBLEM
B00512QNPI|5|My husband loves these for his car!
B00EP3PX2S|5|Easy to install.  Look great.  Quality seems really good for the money.
B0065FRBZ6|4|Put it on the front of my Harley Dyna. Plenty of space for paperwork and some tools/gloves...
B0051DS5US|5|Awesome
B00IKMM0DK|1|P.o.s.
B00KTH8JGG|5|These mats fit my 2014 Traverse perfectly... very happy with my purchase!
B004AQZUX2|2|Worked great for a few weeks... Just long enough to pass inspection lol
B00C4YSXJ0|1|Total junk! The light still works with new batteries but the digital pressure reading doesn't work after four months of sitting in my truck,  Stay way from this.
B00JEO16PQ|1|The back bumper and side skirts fit and look good but the front bumper fit horrible. It has taken the body shop 2 extra weeks to finish my car because they have had to put in a ton of time cutting the bumper and re-shaping it with fiberglass.
B00VZEFCUI|5|I received package quick. Box was beat to Hell!! Huge opening in the side . But parts were all there . I have a buddy who owns a shop and he helped me put parts on . He even said that's one hell of a price for all this..said the control arms alone would be close to this total. Good quality parts , everything fit on my truck, an 01 silverado 2500 non HD.
B00ABYVTZA|5|Works great at cleaning both wash mitts, especially the white one I use for the lower portion of the car, with lots of grime and brake dust.
B00V361LXA|2|The motor is wired backwards so the window switch works in reverse!  Otherwise the unit looks OK, but this is a huge mistake that is now an annoyance.  It's too much of a pain to remove it again to send it back.  I guess you get what you pay for and next time I will buy a brand name.
B00EM8IMTM|5|Quick delivery and worked as advertised.  Easy to use and the fender flares are still on....
B0138A8SFW|2|well they would not post what I wrote the last 2 times so I guess this is not the place for truth....so I will just say, I would not purchase them again
B00R97VN26|1|they should write in amzon it made drom CHAINA !
B000C9K1PI|1|I ordered two 215-5522 EGR valves to keep one on hand as it is getting very difficult to find parts for my 30 year old Cutlass Supreme. Ironically, when I received them in the mail both boxes had the OEM number as well as the new product number (215-5522) on the label. When I opened each of the product boxes there were two different EGR valves in the respective boxes that did not match the identifying label nor would they even fit on my vehicle. So I shipped them back to Amazon and reordered them from Rock Auto.
B00LPHGM40|5|Plenty of power and simple to install.  No noise, starts instantly, runs cool.  Remember the sense line goes to the high voltage input!
B00SD2KJJ4|3|These lights are not as bright as I thought they would be I highly do not recommend
B00K3ECV8C|5|Very nice¡¡¡
B00F6E6QNA|5|great oem
B009M0S4U2|5|Bought these covers for my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee and love them. They are extremely durable and fit the bucket seats great. Nothing like this can be found in the stores. They stay put and don't slide around at all. I used them for a camping trip that was very dusty and dirty and never worried about my new seats once.  These are perfect for wet, sandy trips back from the beach. Would definitely buy them again and again. Well worth the money!
B004UTCLM2|5|Very good quality and craftsmanship. Very pleased.
B00MJUGUCG|5|I really like this helmet.  it's very pretty and has some sparkle to it.  I had initially ordered medium because I was right on the line.  Ended up sending it back for a small.  I'm really happy with it.  Doesn't make my head hot either.
B007ECFURK|5|Super cute! I have had this for several months and its still in perfect condition, i was hesitant when buying it as some other reviews said that it started falling apart after a little bit. I live in Florida and have been using it all summer, still looks good as new!
B009JWF1KO|5|Awsome
B00DHUA9VA|3|Three stars is generous.  Really should be two stars, but it does work as detailed.  The chime sounds AWFUL.  Buzzes while operating, the 'chime' itself sounds like a sick cat or something.  Not sure how much PAC saved by putting in the very cheap and AWFUL sounding chime, but it wasn't worth it.<br />Other than that, the audio sound is surprisingly good, even if you use the PAC to run the aftermarket speaker outputs to an OEM amp.  I have the Chevrolet Bose amplifier.<br />You can also use the radio pre-amp outputs (RCA jacks on back) and connecting to the amps inputs.  Then the PAC RP5-GM11, just transmits power, steering wheel controls, onstar, and the warning chimes through the AWFUL piezo type speaker.<br />Did I mention the chime sounds just TERRIBLE?  And besides that it is too loud.
B00CEX3U4Y|5|Looks great on my new Bettle!
B00Y5LHNZK|5|very good like the picture
B004QJLEOM|5|works well
B00JIIZCM6|5|Great product.  Well worth the money.  Wonderful value!
B00KE8LSPE|5|Much cheaper and nicer than weather tech floor mats, in my opinion. I took my car to the beach and they were perfect for saving my floors. I could just wipe the mats off and the sand was gone. Worth the price and I especially love the back seat mats. They all fit great.
B000C57KL0|5|Working well on my 71 ford 4x4
B008BT2KD2|5|Fast delivery.  My wife loves the product even more than I do.
B008RAFJ38|5|No leaks so far
B00D0UVWLI|5|Gorgeous, looks, and feels great! Easy to wrap with.
B0016D36EW|1|Instructions worse than horrible, faded, useless when you can interpret them. Different brand has much better instructions on line. Really need to know vehicles electronic diagrams to install this device or others like it. After I figured out the wiring I found tailgate handle mechanism drops down to block autoloc bolt. I am going to try to rig a spring inside handle, if that doesn't work I am removing and replacing with manual lock. Do yourself a favor and start with manual lock.
B0035LF254|5|This is a GREAT Tire Cover, just be sure to buy from the right seller. ANY cover shipped from China or ANY other country is not made in the US and is a fake. I had to return a few Chinese covers before spending the money for THIS cover, save the time and effort and buy American the first time. This is a lifetime cover. The piping on the edge makes such a difference and from what I am told protects the stitching from UV deterioration. I have seen a few factory Honda covers with exposed stitching fall apart at the top where the sun beats down on it.. Protect the US economy BUY AMERICAN !
B00M2MOUK0|4|i've got to lean on it to lift my silverado. But other than that seems to be ok.
B001TE0IMG|3|As described.
B001UGJPXQ|5|It's works !<br />Stopped the shaking of my 25 foot travel trailer<br />Installed on rear bumper
B0087FK172|4|They fit very well would buy again, thanks tim.
B00ONYBX46|5|Fit my '02 TW200 just fine without any mods or issues.
B00065L2D8|5|Works great
B00FJIT9BO|4|works okay. shine seems to last about as well as anything else though.
B001QFGMQE|4|Installation wasn't exactly a snap, but wasn't too complicated either. I still haven't decided how often I'll take it off and put it on (initial installation took me about two hours all told, though I think subsequent iterations should take less time -- maybe 45 mins or so). Haven't tried attaching a roof box yet, but the base bars feel secure and are surprisingly quiet. Fit like a charm on my 2008 hardtop - and buying it from Amazon and installing it myself was a tremendous savings over the installed dealer price.
B00DIPPZWC|5|This came with two flags, one for either direction you want the flag to face.
B0002JMDAE|5|Worked great for a leather chair in the house.
B00D69QLXC|1|Do not fit Honda hornett who knows what elc get real frame sliders
B00GOR6GF6|5|easy to install worked great
B000EAIERW|5|quick and easy install, work great
B000EDQR4Q|5|Product was as advertised, works great fast shipping AAAA  ++++
B005EPLJ9W|5|Easy to install, looks nice as well.
B00QC28RFA|5|Works great easy to install
B005U9JDPO|4|I was buying this as a gift for my husband to use in his truck...he loved it but it was a bit to small to use in his truck...so I am using it in my car.  Nice clear photo on the front.  Good and sturdy protection for the inside of my car...keeps it cool in the bright sunlight.
B00OLVGGZM|4|This article appears that it will do the job quite well.  The fit was perfect.  It did have a few blemishes on its surface but, hey, it's a pick-up bed cover.  Only a matter of time until it has a few more.  It appears to eliminate sliding of articles when starting or stopping which is a very good characteristic.
B00O4G5ZME|1|Two of the three switches were not even wired in.  Just sitting there, no wires attached.
B004GE3VVQ|5|This item was PERFECT
B00NS6ZFU8|5|Fit as described and they are working fine.
B00HMYIEGY|4|worked great
B004I8M03K|5|These headlights work great on my 95 d<br />Dodge truck there just like the factory ones highly recommend these headlights
B00K8VQE24|4|Great Product.. Item came on time
B00OPMIR2M|5|Recently purchased this Digital Air Gauge and so far I am well pleased with it. It appears to be accurate as I compared it to some analog gauges. It is easy to use and with the illuminated nozzle it makes checking tire pressure easy in dark conditions. I would recommend it highly. As I have not had it long I don't know how durable it will be but I keep it in the glove box of my vehicle.
B0031NP2JC|4|fixed my problem.  Worked great.
B00NSCWB5E|5|fits great, better than I thought
B003CK0PCS|5|Shipping work great perfect thank you very much will do business again
B000GV0I8C|5|Nice tuning kit!
B0018EPX7M|5|Fantastic! I bought the one up seat for my wife and it worked and she loves it, but did not look right as you could see the pins and there was a space around the drivers seat. I liked my seat, but after getting this one it is so much better. I have a Heritage softail classic 2011 with the king windshield, the Mustang seat raised me up a little and has better padding with great support, I did not want to add a backrest and this worked out perfect. I am 6'1&#34; and it gives me the right height. The seat I bought with it was stk# 76180 and part # was 488032. We like riding long distances and the is ready to hit the road.
B000CGFS0Y|5|Fit perfect and works great.
B000BLI23A|5|Easy install, work great and look fantastic.
B0072JK638|5|worked great
B00V5B3PTG|5|Nice detail for your steering wheel.
B000XBCURW|5|Have been using this on the vinyl flap of my heavy-duty pet door. Had to replace the old one when the vinyl began to split.  I've used it on the new door for a while, now, and it looks good. Still, it may take a year or two for any difference to really be seen - but 32 ounces should easily last that long for a single door. It is easy to apply - I clean the door each month, then spray some on the top of the door and wipe it along the rest with a cloth, being sure I get into the side expansion grooves. Inside and out. Doesn't take but a minute.
B00KC8OLYQ|1|Not the right thing.
B000B5P9EQ|5|Very nice, easy to install, came super fast. Thanks
B002P8R4JK|3|Wabbled slightly when first installed .. Had to make a manual fix to make it fit snug.
B0073WEZU4|5|This is my second Stubby by CravenSpeed. I think my reception actually improved over my factory F150 antenna. Would buy again.
B005MZWN6M|1|This product doesn't work. I don't know why it is being offered. Completely not functional on my Jeep Wrangler.
B007LIBPZS|5|I love the color and it matches perfectly with my synthetic leather car cover -<br />[[ASIN:B004IOD7C2 FH-PU007115 Deluxe Leatherette Car Seat Covers, Airbag compatible and Rear Split, Beige color]]<br /><br />I was a little in-confident that it will not fit my small Toyota Corolla. But it fits nicely and brings a glamorous look to my car.
B00XMNMBYK|3|Its ok for what you paying, did not fit my application very well but will find a use for it.<br />Quality is ok.
B000AMBNPY|1|The shades did not fit my windows (2015 Acura TLX) and the rear shade suction does not last. In five minutes after applying the rear shade was falling and became more of a driving hazard.<br />I would actually like to return the products. What do I need to do to do that.
B00MRCTL7M|2|Had Walmart install in wheel that needed it. Tech had hard time getting it to signal and clearing the message board.  When cleared, read 0, while others were showing their pressure.  I have not been back, but plan to run thru the routine myself.  Hope it is not defective as I would have to have the tire removed again.
B000M5ZWBA|5|For the price you can't go wrong great quality
B003NFOL4K|5|Meets eXpectations
B00K73M2J2|4|Fits good, edges are a little rough, though.
