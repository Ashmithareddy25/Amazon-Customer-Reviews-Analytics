B00L9B7IKE|3|Not a bad read, she was just a bit depressing as a character, and never got better.
B005FITIF0|5|Great Movie. I have been looking for this movie not realizing I could find it on Amazon. When I heard of it in 2011 I could not find it in a movie theater. This movie was not widely released.  Gerald Butler is fabulous as the preacher. This is a attention grabber.  From one selfish man to one who gives his life to saving children. He would move hell and high water if he could to save every child no matter the cost. Worth every dollar spent. I have shared this movie with many friends they were all entranced could not take their eyes off the film no bathroom breaks with this movie.
B004DI7HZ6|5|Love, Love Love this book.  Extremely well written.  Love the historical aspects in the story, informative but not boring.  It's got everything, magic, danger, love, lust, loyalty, and time travel.  The sequel is almost better!
B00F56AZK4|1|Could not get puzzles to download without purchasing. I was with the understanding they were free downloads!
B000056K04|1|this is really bad stuff.  its a good thing Mr. Matthews made an apology for this album (ask any member of the warehouse).  there are plenty of DMB cds, get the others.  this is aweful.
B004GCKRWY|4|Movie hunk Ryan Reynolds stars in this film as Paul Conroy, an outside contractor operating a truck in Iraq. After an attack which leaves his friends dead, he awakens in a crude coffin with a butane lighter and a cell phone which is not fully charged. So begins this movie that is essentially telling the story of Conroy being held hostage for a hefty ransom while waging a battle against time to be rescued and dealing with increasingly irrational captors.<br />Given that Reynolds is the only actor that the audience sees during the film and that his stage is his cramped coffin/wood box, he manages to do a great job as the anxiety filled captive struggling to be rescued. And herein lies my problem. This movie is a nightmare for anyone who is claustrophobic. Reynolds did such a great job adapting to his film environment that I had a problem not feeling confined.<br />The script was clever and not completely predictable. At one point while Reynolds is in a frenzy to be located (remember he has no idea of exactly where he is because he didn't come to until he was already buried) the company he contracted with goes through a protracted process of firing him over his ebbing phone signal so they won't bear any responsibility regarding his kidnapping. While I had a problem with a couple aspects imbedded in the script, this was a taut thriller that managed to be suspenseful and terrifying.
B00003CXXM|4|Having seen the excellent Richard Chamberlain mini-series of 'The Bourne Identity' when I was a kid (which is closer to the original Ludlum story than this - though that in itself does not make this movie any less worthy), I was looking forward to seeing a more modern take on the plot, complete with contemporary technology and hip young actors. This latest offering does not disappoint - it's gripping from start to finish. Damon in particular has a knack for drawing the audience in to his frantic, frightening world, and this enables us to empathise with his plight. Clever and fast-paced, it still has enough character development for us to feel some degree of emotion for the leads by the closing credits. <br />In the same way that 'Enemy of the State' made us realise how easy it could be for corrupt government organisations to find almost anyone (and eliminate them if considered enough of a threat), this movie shows us how advanced communication technology is today, and how important it is to have the right checks and balances for groups with this much power. This does not mean we come away feeling like conspiracy theorists, as one never really feels that this is more than just excellent entertainment - nevertheless, it is not hard to see the potential for a story like this to exist.
B0051ANPZQ|5|This story was so good I couldn't keep my.eyes off of it. It made.me want to cry at some parts and laugh at the other one over all this is a wonderful book for middle school students to read and get in to it
B006O5XYWG|5|Loved it.
B000059XUP|4|I've never seen the original Crow movie, so i can't really have a biased opinion about this movie.  And if people really say this sucks compared to the first Crow, than i'd really like to see the first becusae it must be amazing.  I did have one major problem with this movie, and that was the fact that the villans were just overly-done.  They have such a defined character and everything they do has to reek evil, and it gets to be repetitive the point of nausia.  Other than that, this was a pretty good film.  The dialouge is sparce, making most of the characters rely on their movements and thier looks to give you a feel of whats going on.  Obviously not everyone will like this kind of thing, its rather slow paced, and best for just sitting there and kind of laying around watching it, not really for people into intense action or comedies.
B000002WUD|5|Well, I put off the purchase of this set for a long, long time.  But after owning and loving the 50's and 60's sets for years I felt I needed to add the 70's set to my collection.  I even thought a few of the songs might be kind of good.  A few?  How about almost every song!!  There has been a lot of talk about the mature Elvis voice of the 1970's.  So true.  His voice was incredible during this period.  This box set shows Elvis the singer - of every type of music.  And I know what you are thinking - this guy is just another one of those Elvis nuts who worshipped the sideburns and jumpsuits.  Forget the image.  Forget Vegas.  Forget that TV movie they always show on VH1. This box set suggests something entirely different than the Elvis Presley who was the friend of donut makers and pharmacies everywhere.  This box set suggests a man who was confidently singing great songs until he passed.  And the evidence is overwelming that there was more to this man than met the eye.  105 songs!!  This guy was working overtime.  Sure there are other recordings that were weak and did not make this set but 105 great performances. Do yourself a favor.  Buy this box set.
B00NCGXXT4|5|very good
0345803485|1|Yes, those are the phrases the author chose to have her pitiful main female character utter when she realized she was falling for a complete pervert.  At first she was overwhelmed by his good looks and style and then by his creepiness and perversions.  Somehow this bright young woman was unable to resist trying to rescue her sadistic albeit very wealthy and handsome boyfriend from his inner demons.  This desire for women to change men is a waste of time in real life and on paper.  Could not read beyond the first couple chapters because it was so stupid and unreal.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Very good.  Hard to put it down once you start reading it
B000JK8OYU|5|This CD brought back memories of my teenage years. I enjoyed all 26 tracks thanks
B009KHDT0C|4|Ha, if this was on tv as a youth it would have been like when Porky's came out. Lines around the block. If you do not get that reference you are to young. Typical Depp, funny in a dark way.

B00ET9T2WK|4|I really like turn based strategy games and this one is a great addition to my collection(this feels almost like a turn based version of &#34;Rise of Nations,&#34; one of my all time favorite games, minus the progress through time). Sadly the in-game battles seem to be a little intense on my Kindle FIre HD's Wi-Fi strength and causes frequent disconnects or the servers they are running on drop me mid fight. I can no longer do the PVP battles and this has started to happen more and more frequently, but if you have a good connection and the tablet for it, this is worth a try.
B000BGH22W|3|I was a bit disappointed with this CD when I *first* heard it, but overall I like it now that I've heard it more.  It has a \\"classical orchestra\\" feel to it, which is very nice, but a little disappointing since I missed the eccentric feel that I was used to hearing for the first three movies (which seemed to capture the magic a bit more).  Because of that, I didn't expect this music to go well with the movie, but as I watched the movie, it seemed to fit very well.    I instantly loved the \\"Rita Skeeter\\" song.  I really enjoy the way it captures the sneaky, mischievousness of her character!  I also thought that \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\" portrayed the two quidditch teams very nicely.    It took me a little bit to really like most of the other songs, but after having listened to them more, and after having seen the movie, they've grown on me.    About the last three songs...  I would have liked them better if they were on the CD in the opposite order.  The screaming at the beginning of \\"Do the Hippogriff\\" was startling (I wish someone had warned me to turn the volume down) and seemed out of place.  In addition, I expected the Weird Sisters to be... sisters... rather than men.  (But they did a marvelous job of working these songs into the movie.)  The lyrics of \\"Do the Hippogriff\\", were quite funny at times, though.    Back when I read the book, I was paranoid throughout the entire thing for Harry's sake.  But I was greatly heartened when I heard this CD, because it sounds very lighthearted at times and helps me to momentarily forget the seriousness of Harry's situation and just enjoy things for a while.  This lightheartedness is perhaps my favorite aspect of this CD (and the movie), when compared to the book.  :)
B004GYY714|5|This radio app is awesome not only does it get my local channels by I can also find any genre of music in want.  This is by far the best radio app out there.
B00FRVH3V6|4|Nice ending to the series, but it seemed a little lack luster compared with the 4th book in the series.
B0064X7FVE|4|Use it daily. Reliable and accurate (as much as weather forecasting can be). Just wish Android/Kindle version had marine weather .
B00CL68QVQ|3|I don't remember anything about this movie!  I watched it a month or so ago... so that pretty much spells it out.
B00FATEJYE|5|The controls are easy to learn and its fun.Too bad there is no multiplayer in this version so get it its free.
B001BNFR6W|2|Some of the discs are scratched or blured, and it's suppose to be brand new. They are still playable I haven't encounter any problem with any of the discs, yet. That's why I treat them so carefully so they will get to still play on my dvd eventhough they are clearly damaged. Maybe NBC will put this series out in Blu-Ray like FRIENDS, we will have to wait and see.
B00HUU13Y0|4|A quick, to-the-point read that shares how Google manages its business and its people to come up with \\"The Next Big Thing.\\"<br /><br />Good reminders and inspiration for managers and entrepreneurs.
B007J4T2G8|3|The story pulls you in but the books are just not very well written.  If you can put up with that, it's a good read to fill your time.

B005XQLBU4|5|A very fun and addictive game. I would recommend playing this. No ads so far. Very stress relieving. Great time killer.
B009KS4XRO|5|It's a great game to pass the time.
B005IZLPKQ|4|Captain America is one of the best movies of its genre.  The story tries to remain true to the Jack Kirby story of WW II's best Super-Hero and then bringing him forward to today's story lines. The script is well written and the special effects make for an engaging, non-boring movie. The nicest part is that it never insults the viewers intelligence. The film is \\"story centered\\" and it works on most levels to satisfy fans and non-fans, and justifies the cost of the ticket. This is a movie that brings people into theaters and then sends them home with a smile and a feel-good feeling.
079073463X|4|I am not a fancy movie critic, but I know what I like and I like this movie.  There are very few movies that leave a lasting impression on me, and Ladyhawke is definitely one of them.  The story, music (no, it is NOT  disco-medieval) and acting is haunting, funny, romantic and hopeful.  This  was the first time I  ever saw Michelle Pfiffer and I remember thinking how  beautiful and perfectly suited she was for this part.  Rutger Hauer is  absolutely dashing as a knight in black and they make a perfect pair.   Matthew Broderick provides a wonderful balance of humor and support for the  2 cursed lovers.  I have loved this movie for 15 years and it still remains  one of my favorites.  The location and scenery is absolutely beautiful.   Like I said, I'm not some fancy movie critic, looking at every aspect of a  film.  But, I can say this:  It was one of the best films put out in the  80s and I still recommend it to friends when the topic of old movies comes  up.  If you're a romantic at heart, you'll love this movie, I promise.
B001VLXNLU|1|The 'vampyres' in this book are much more like witches. They are brought over by a tracker, who points at them, and then they are 'marked a fledgling vampyre. The only similarity between these vampyres and others is they sometimes drink blood. They basically have magical powers and have affinities for the elements. They worship a goddess, which in time becomes quite blasphemous.
B00DHHFKE4|3|Very interesting, descriptive and eye opening read. I found the characters refreshingly real and  able to draw sympathy from the reader without pitying them. After watching the drama filled TV series, the book is a little bit slower but follows the resilience of an amazing woman.
B00688628M|5|All American high school students--and their parents--need to see this series, to help them understand what WWII was all about, to help them know that war is not a game, and to see realistic scenes from the last war we fought with good cause.  We can see, too, how tenuous victories really are, the ebb and flow of battles, the sacrifices of the soldiers, the occasional incompetence of leaders, the special bravery of Army medics, and so much more.<br /><br />And, for those of us who served in the 101st--not in those valiant times but years later--it reminds us of the honor we have had to have been a part of that division.<br /><br />Each time that I drive near Currahee Mountain, I have always known and remembered its history.

0385341008|5|This book is one of my favorite books of all-time. It's a short, enjoyble read with wonderful dry wit, an historical perspective (tells of characters' heart-wrenching experiences during the WWII German occupation of the Channel Islands) and wonderful characters you grow to love, laugh with and root for. I also love that the book is a collection of letters, so it's very easy to pick up and get a letter or two in while water boils or you wait in line somewhere.  One of my favorite characters, Isola, summed it up, \\"Reading good books ruins you for enjoying bad books.\\" I already feel less engaged in the other books I'm reading now--this one was so enjoyable!

B0006GVJEE|5|Fresh from the international success of La Femme Nikita, Luc Besson attempted to conquer America with Leon. Trimmed of a few minutes for a potentially uncomfortable scene involving a little girl proclaiming her love for a hitman and renamed The Professional, it became a bonafide hit that would pave the way for his magnum opus, The Fifth Element. Eventually, the European cut of the movie was released in North America with all of the excised footage intact. Now, Sony/Columbia has released it on a DVD for the third time with a few new extras.<br /><br />Sony/Columbia has released several copies of The Professional on DVD. This latest incarnation includes the Superbit version of the movie with optimum sound and picture quality and a whole new selection of extras celebrating its 10th anniversary. Also of note, this is Besson's European cut a.k.a. \\"version integrale.\\"<br /><br />On the first disc is a fact track, which allows one to watch the movie with running subtitles that display all sorts of factoids and interesting bits of trivia about the movie and the people that worked on it.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with a \\"10 Year Retrospective\\" featurette. There are new interviews with Portman and Reno who talk about how they got involved with the movie and their experiences working on it. The most glaring omission with this doc is the lack of involvement from the director or Gary Oldman.<br /><br />\\"Jean Reno: The Road to Leon\\" briefly examines the life and career of this talented actor. Reno speaks very eloquently about his character.<br /><br />\\"Natalie Portman: Starting Young\\" is a good interview with the young actress. There is footage of her audition that clearly shows how talented she was so early in life. Portman is as charming as ever and fans of hers will enjoy this extra.
B00005JGAB|5|Read all the other reviews, they've done the hard work for me. I'm just giving this the 5 stars it deserves to boost the ratings & yh it rocks & it's a classic! Best punk album of all-time!
B0061S073A|3|Good for the kindle fire, but two problems.  The kindle app doesn't work within kids place on the kindle fire, so the only way kids can access their books is by giving them access to the launcher.  This lets them see all the content on the device (although they can only open apps you've selected).  Ideally it would be best if you could choose to give them the kindle app instead of the launcher. Second, I set it for airplane mode so it would automatically disable the wireless connection when the app is opened, it worked the first time but has stopped working and doesn't disable the connection even though the setting is turned on.  I manually turn off the wireless and open the app before giving it to the kids, but ideally if you choose this setting it would do what its supposed to do.  5 star app if those 2 issues were fixed.
B00CW6DAKC|5|The bug was fixed, I can play with my old farm now. Thank to our developer. I really like this game.

I just wish that u can make some thing on creative, then change to survival, and when u try to hit a pig, it sometimes glitches into the ground,but otherwise a 5 star and a great game. Ps. I make minigames on the minecraft for Xbox, we are called Sacred Games.
B0084QWB0O|4|Under most circumstances, I don’t enjoy reading books. However, this novel kept me interested with its characters, details, and saddening story of a true American hero. After reading this novel I have a much greater respect for the men and women of our armed forces than I did before. The courage that these men and women, especially the Navy SEALs, have is unreal. The acts that Marcus did to stay alive were not capable of ordinary people like us and his mere will to survive was extraordinary. If you are one who greatly respects and is interested in the duties of our armed forces or you are intrigued by survival stories, then I suggest that you read this. I gave this book four stars because of the reasons listed above, but while this book was well written and very interesting, it had its flaws. I was not fond of the chapters that talked about the training that the SEALs had to go through. I felt this subject should have been covered in about two chapters, instead of about four. That was the portion of the novel that I disliked the most, and other appearances that bothered me were very minor. Overall I did enjoy this book.
B004G600A4|5|I really enjoyed the movie.  Was true to Disney fashion and had good songs, funny charactera and a good story line.  Loved it!!!
B008Y6WRIA|4|Sweet remake from an original. All three leads are engaging in this movie.
B009DCOU9S|4|they kinda talk a lot but I like the story. fun game so far. more that just a hidden object game. definitely worth the free download
B00H4EPCGW|5|This book makes it very clear that we have choices about how we function in life and how we age. If you are willing to give up ingrained (ha ha) habits, your life can be so much more productive, enjoyable and best of all, pain free!
B004P8JPS6|2|Very predictable, after reading several Jack Reacher they all are similar.
B009SJ3LHI|5|I always look forward to seeing this show, its action packed and never misses a beat! I hope that the CW keeps it going! With every new episode the plot get better! The actors are great for their roles!
B000WSHF4E|4|When we last left Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett), she was young and inexperienced, struggling to come to terms with ruling a country. We now rejoin her in \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age,\\" which begins well into her reign; beginning in the year 1585, the film chronicles the growing tension between England and Spain and culminates with a fierce sea battle. It also examines the relationship between Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), an adventurous seafarer. What we're presented with is less of an actual account and more of a dramatic love story, which basically means that it isn't even close to being historically accurate. But I guess that isn't a bad thing, considering the film's more creative aspects--\\"The Golden Age\\" is a triumph of set and costume design, and the performances are top notch.    If only the story were at the same level. It would be too much to say that the plot isn't interesting; rather, it isn't interesting enough. Much of the material plays like a run of the mill romance, regardless of the time period. I just know that so much more defined Queen Elizabeth I, and I wish the filmmakers had given her character a little more depth. Not that she's completely shallow--if anything, quite a lot weighs heavy on her mind, not the least of which is her conniving cousin, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton). Most of their rivalry stems from different religious faiths: Elizabeth is Protestant while Mary is Catholic. Hoping to take control of the throne, Mary conspires to have Elizabeth assassinated. Intercepting on Elizabeth's behalf is Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), the Queen's most trusted advisor.    On Mary's side is Philip II (Jordi Mollà), King of Spain, who believes that Elizabeth has turned England into a godless country. He intends to conquer the Queen by sending a mighty armada, and the Spanish Inquisition along with it. Elizabeth understands that England's resources are depleted, as is its money; a counterattack will be muchharder to plan and execute. Despite being incredibly strong-willed, something is holding her back, something that's diminishing her confidence. She seems to rely on Raleigh to soothe her, despite not knowing who he is or where he came from. All we do know is that he's arrived home from the New World, where he named a colony in honor of the Virgin Queen (Virginia). We've seen many films that make the Mysterious Stranger engaging or downright sexy--indeed, Raleigh is dashing, flirtatious, and bold. Just watch the way he presents potatoes and tobacco to Elizabeth.    Hoping to win favor with the Queen, Raleigh gets close to her favorite Lady in Waiting, Bess (Abbie Cornish), and it becomes obvious that his affections are divided between these two women. This plot device could have been much more interesting had it not been so cliché; I've seen romantic conflict before, and it's usually reserved for escapist films. But \\"The Golden Age\\" is historical in context. I wanted more focus on the impending Spanish attack, especially since it was so intertwined with Elizabeth's assassination plot. The final major sequence does feature some battle, but not enough to be satisfying. It's as if the film fizzles out after spending so much time building itself up. It's not entirely a letdown, but it is a disappointment. This is especially true of Elizabeth's pre-battle speech: clad in armor, she rides a horse in front of her army while spewing encouraging sayings. I half expected her to say that the enemy may take their lives, but they'd never take their freedom.    Still, I have to give credit where credit is due. I greatly enjoyed Blanchett's performance; she gave Elizabeth a determined yet fragile quality that was compelling. I distinctly remember an emotional outburst aimed at the Spanish ambassador: \\"I too can command the wind, sir!\\" she screams. \\"I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare if you dare to try me!\\" This moment was raw and overwhelming, which was appropriate given her emotional state. I also remember a scene in an astrologist's lair showing Elizabeth's desperation. She clearly couldn't stand not knowing how everything would turn out. It was prophesized that two kingdoms would battle and only one would fall--the Queen would like nothing more than to hear that England will be victorious. Unfortunately, that cannot be guaranteed.    Yes, there is a lot to recommend about \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age,\\" and thank goodness that the good outweighs the bad. This is not a perfect film, but it can still get an audience from point A to point B. And it certainly is wonderful to look at; every shot is so richly detailed that you can't help but admire the work that went into it. The costumes are vivid, colorful, and intricate. The sets are lavish and bold, with practically every location dripping with colorful tapestries. The armada attack features a number of convincing special effects. Basically, everything felt real in terms of the film's look. The film's story, on the other hand, wasn't all that it could have been. There's a wealth of material on Queen Elizabeth I, and I can't help but feel that most of it was disregarded to make room for romantic elements. Romance works, but only to a point.
6303471714|2|I did this video when it first came out a few years back. I did it religously for a few monthes until my knees started hurting. I saw no results from this video. If Cindy Crawford knew what she was doing she wouldn't have used her body monetum to lift the weight in the video. I now go to a gym that has trainers available to actually SHOW me the right form so I don't hurt myself.

B00DR0PDNE|4|Recently purchased 2 of these, the first one was connected to my Samsung Surround Sound system, I love it because when the system notices that Chromecast is beginning to stream, it automatically switches to the correct input.  No issues with lagging, I stream movies Via Google Chrome to my Chromecast all the time.<br /><br />Now the 2nd one, i'm not sure what the issue is.  It hardly ever works, i'm lucky if my Chrome Browser even notices that this thing is connected to my network.  if i'm lucky enough to get them to connect, there's constant lag and stuttering and disconnects.  This 2nd Chromecast is the extact same distance away from my Router as the first one I purchase.  Not sure what the problem is, it's currently back in it's box not being used, may do some more testing later to see what the deal is.  I took 1 star off because of this.
B00AANGHXQ|5|Honestly, I never heard Stevie Ray before. I read that he was one of the best guitar players in its gender. As I heard the record it became one of my favorites. The quality of the music and production is outstanding. I thought I was hearing one of the great black rock and blues men. His voice, guitar and compositions are so good. As for the live record, it is great, you can´t decide which one is better. If you love rock music and blues this is a must have in your collection.
B000002KBU|5|This was my very first introduction to Joni's music, and I fell in love with it. The songwriting is wonderful, her voice is addictive, and the music is passionate. I particularly liked the songs &quot;Little Green&quot; and &quot;River&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; which stick with me...<br />Joni was the original to folk music with this type of magnitude, and although I must say I enjoy music by Sarah McLachlan and Jewel and other more modern day -- I still thoroughly enjoyed this one. I know that Joni still makes music to this day, but this cd -- THIS CD is definitely the one that sticks out the most and really truly shows her at her best. I highly recommend it.
0061969656|5|Review first posted on Amazon.co.uk on 6 October 2011<br /><br />I read this one in less than 36 hours, between Tuesday evening and Wednesday early morning, and just HAD to finish it as quickly as possible. The title I've given to my review sums it up, more or less. This would be true regardless of whether you love Uthred's personality and adventures or whether you are starting to get fed up with him and his story, as a few commentators seem to be. I happen to be part of the former bunch of people. I am still just as interested in the character, the story he tells and the events he lives through as I was when I read the very first book on Uthred, some years ago. I also find that each installment of Uthred's adventures is top quality (and a real treat and pleasure to read).<br /><br />This is because of the author's talent. To me, this is historical fiction at its best, and it has consistently been so from the very beginning.<br /><br />First, the period and events have, as usual with Cornwell, been well researched. Fortunately, some of his competitors can do as well as that, although there may only be a few of them.<br /><br />Second, and much rarer in my view, is the author's modesty and honesty. Unlike a number of others, you never get the impression that Cornwell is attempting to show off his knowledge, either in the story itself or in his historical note or annexes (map, list of place names in Saxon with their modern day equivalent). Even better, he never hesitates to mention in his historical note where he has introduced fiction or fabrication in the story. Very few do this, either because they do not want to be seen as having taking liberties with the historical \\"facts\\" (but aren't these are works of fiction after all?) or because they cannot be bothered and may believe that most of their readers will not notice it or not care about it. Another strong point is that you can in effect read this book (and any others in the series) separately, which is not that frequent and the author is talented and takes enough trouble to insert sufficient information in each installment to make it self-standing without feeling the need to summarize the previous books over some dozens of pages, as some authors sometimes do in a rather boring way. So, thank you Bernard for showing so much consideration for all of your readers, as opposed to just marketing a product...<br /><br />Third, well, I like Uthred as a character. I find him both credible (including his \\"kill-first-ask-questions-after\\" attitudes) and original. He both despises and defies the Church, its clerics, monks and bishops openly. This theme could already be found, in a much milder version, with Lord Derfel in Cornwell's trilogy on King Arthur. He, it is amplified but nevertheless credible in my view. After all, Uthred is a warlord brought up and trained by the Danes, and a pagan to boot. He would have little time and even less patience for the \\"nailed Tyrant\\", his mostly hypocritical self-serving servants and his philosophy of \\"brotherly love\\" so \\"unreal\\" to him. Uthred's mixture of boasting, blustering, bravery and cunning is also an interesting twist. This is not only about showing off. It is, as he alludes to in the book, about creating a reputation, living up to it, and showing that he is fearless (although he is afraid, of course). There are numerous other features that make him somewhat sympathetic, including his sense of loyalty to Alfred and his children.<br /><br />Fourth, of course, there are the fights and battle scenes, all described in much graphic and gory detail. This is one of the things that Cornwell does best. We have become accustomed to this, and it has been picked up and imitated with various degrees of success by many other authors writing on the same or on other periods (Greeks, Romans, Normans etc...). Nowadays, it sometimes feels like almost a \\"must\\". You get the impression that every author writting historical fiction gets told that having a couple of gore scenes is part of the ingredients of a \\"marketable\\" historical novel. The difference with Cornwell (and with a very few other authors, such as the late and much lamented Pressfield) is that all this blood and gore makes the story \\"sound and feel\\" REAL, as opposed to being a marketing ploy. You just have to close your eyes to imagine the shield walls crashing against each other.<br /><br />Very few, in my view, have managed to bring both their characters and their period to life as well as Bernard Cornwell.<br /><br />Waiting for the next installment will seem like a very, very long time...f gore scenes is part of the ingredients of a \\"marketable\\" historical novel.

B007UXT6T6|5|Another mission impossible with lots of action.  Cruise did marvelous.  Need to watch this on three D.  Skyscraper scene was incredible.
B00EUS9JF0|1|Love Macca...but found this CD painful to listen to.  Boring, mostly lifeless...not worth a second listen.  I was so turned off by Kisses on the Bottom...couldn't wait for the new stuff...just plain disappointed.
B00001U03Q|5|Eric Clapton remains as one of the greatest guitar geroes of all. In the 1990's he hailed a impressive comeback to the charts. A feat very few artists from the 70's have ever captured.<br />This collection contains hits from his career in the hard to handle 80's, to his rebound with Tears In Heaven in the 90's. Songs like Change The World, and Blue Eyes Blue from Runaway Bride, are companion songs that fit nicely here.<br />While people still prefer Eric Clapton from his days with The Yardbirds, Cream, and his solo efforts from the 1970's, Clapton Chronicles is a collection worth checking out.
B00CSR2J9I|5|It is a nice game FUN and addicting  well once you vet the hang of it my cousin's play it so does my brother and friends at school
B005DTEUAE|5|Purchased as a Christmas gift for a hard to buy for Brother in Law. So happy that Amazon sells vinyls!
B0027MJU00|4|I chose to read Gillian Flynn's early works before trying Gone Girl and I was not disappointed.  Dark Places had great characters, an interesting way of presenting a story, and a suspensful plot.  The story was written in present day with flashback chapters.  It didn't just focus on Libby Day, the protagonist of the book, it also was written from the brother and mother's point of view.  The ending was quite the twist and it was a great read.  I read it on my lunch breaks and was upset after my thirty minutes were up and I had to stop.  I am currently reading Sharp Objects and then will move on to her most recent Gone Girl.  This is a great book, especially if you are looking to try a new author.
B001CC7PPI|5|The Dream Sequence referred to in the last review was never part of the original film. It was inserted by local television stations in a lame attempt to recapitulate the plot for those who had tuned in late.  Exactly the kind of butchering that should be prevented by copywright laws.  The current restoration is completely faithful to the original film.
B006LSZECO|5|So engaging and keeps you hooked on the characters insights
B0031KC8OC|5|Veronica Mars season one was a great show.  She's a ittle detective at a big high school with bullies, snobs and freaks....
B00000JGHM|5|This is an excellent movie.  Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are excellent counterparts.  The bank robbing scene is one of the most intense scenes I have ever seen.<br />As usual, Michael Mann's cimetography sets the mood of the movie. The acting is excellent.  Dialog between De Niro and Pacino is classic.  This is a must have DVD.  Should be one of the first ones you purchase if buying your first DVD player.<br />The only negative of the DVD is there is no bonus material, but don't let that keep you from purchasing this movie.
055357342X|4|Love this series, but I could do without Caetlyn &amp; Deanerys and more Jon please!!
B0036FYO12|5|Of course, I'm biased.  It's been one of my favorites for a long time.  I've watched it many times.  I know how it ends.  And I still enjoy every minute of it.
B0044ZQ8QC|5|As a confirmed Corellian, I gave this album to a good friend, a violinist. However, he is practicing the \\"Four Seasons\\" right now, and the Corelli, remains unopened on his studio desk. Corelli's music, in my humble dogma, is better-written, more elegant and more charming than Vivaldi's.  So put down that fiddle already, and treat yourself, and Moi!  -- Conrad Susa
B004ZMWUCU|4|Great characters engaging in the simple forms of everyday living. I love the Irish dialog and humor.  Fast paced, but full of tender emotion.
B001JU4S44|3|it was ok.  Passed the time one afternoon.  Retread of a tried and true story.  Can't hardly miss.  I prefer finding new ideas but sometimes ya' gotta please the family, too.  :-)
B001UV4XJ2|5|This movie does not disappoint. If you have been with the series long enough to make it to the 8th movie, then you will truly enjoy this awesome conclusion to a beloved series. There really isn't any more to say about that.<br /><br />The ONLY reason it has been rated so low is because of people who keep 'reviewing' it, some who have boldly stated that they, in fact, do *not* own it, and choose to rate it 1-3 stars because of the new UltraViolet digital copies. I understand their frustration, but find it more frustrating that it may cause others to simply see the amount of stars it has, bypass the reviews, and conclude that it must suck - when that is simply not true. To me, it is the same as any other product: if you don't like something about it, you either a) do not purchase it, or b) purchase it, and suck it up that it isn't as perfect as you want. Or in this case, wait until you can purchase the region-free bluray on Amazon's UK site (For those wishing to do that, you can do so at amazon.co.uk)when it releases December 2.<br /><br />Please stop down-rating an excellent movie because of one tiny factor, especially when you can purchase an alternative. Your trolling is annoying.
B002ZG97RY|1|As if ruining Jason Bourne weren't enough now we have this travesty. This half pint hero's career has gone far enough. Hollywood needs some real men, PLEASE!
B003W5C0VM|5|If you love Get Your Ya Ya's Out this brings that album to life with tons of close-ups and great sound.
B004J4WNL2|5|Excellent review of the literature coupled with practical tips on how to navigate the extrovert world as an introvert. Great writing, too!
B003XTUZIM|5|i love this album. i think it has some great tracks and certainly takes you on a journey. very good surround mix. if you like king crimson, get this. if you like well written and thought out music, get this

0920668364|5|Always a great gift....bought this for a first-time mother who is a friend of mine.  Gave this to her with the verse from this story framed.
B00TXC4YVW|4|I haven't read this book in it's entirety, but so far it's been a great read....I've purchased several poker training videos, books & replays of Jonathan's and they all are well worth it. He's also accessible on twitter a lot of times for quick questions I have. So far, so good....Im pleased.
0525952926|5|A great book looking forward to the third one of the trilogy.Ken Follett is wonderful. I have said enough! This is too demanding!
B00J8CGU64|4|Good stuuf!!!
B00BMKDTNC|1|The last fourth of the book was scattered, careless, and left a lot to be desired.  But truly all that wasn't Jordan's lacked the vivid, strong, concise voice of The Wheel.  Such a disappointment with so many loose ends.  The ending sucked.  Terribly.
B00A50PDDY|5|I saw these guys at Bonnaroo and loved their set.  They had a ton of energy and creativity in addition to different and interesting music.  I bought both albums right away and can't stop listening to them.  They're both solid pieces of music.  Vessel is probably my favorite of the 2 but not by a lot.<br /><br />Best tracks off this album are Guns for Hands, Car Radio, Holding Onto You and The Run and Go.  Trees and Truce are also quite good if you're looking for something more contemplative.
0596527055|4|A good solid book - this isn't an inspirational book on innovation or a how-to book on innovation, it's more a 'from the trenches' book that educates using the misconceptions people usually have about innovation.     The thing I really liked about the book was the cross-references to sources / interesting articles, I wish the books web site had an easy list of these.     The thing I didn't care much in the book was Berkun's style of writing - he's got great data to share, but I found the style of writing to be flippant, presumptuous about the readers lack of knowledge about innovation myths & straining to be funny at times! I'd rather that he'd kept it more simple.    The chapters - \\"Good ideas are hard to find\\", \\"Your boss knows more about innovation than you\\" and \\"Problems and solutions\\" were terrific & was worth the price of this book.    Overall, 4 stars - I read this book, & want to read it again slowly, especially checking out the references.
B00127RAJY|4|o.k. I love this DVD, but as most things, nothing is perfect:  What I liked:  + 20 min workout, as they fit into my busy days  + combines weights, cardio & abs so I feel it's very balanced  + no-nonsence instructor style: no silly music or funny outfits: focus is on the exercise  + most exercises have a lower-impact/easier option and a higher-impact/harder option  + no equipment necessary (other than maybe a mat, if you're not doing it on a carpet and some weights, but depending on your fitness, cans do the trick, too)  + good comentary on explaining the exercises, but also motivation to keep you going.   What could be better:  - no explanation if or why these workouts can or should be done every single day without giving the body a day of rest in between  - no explanation as to when one should move on from the level 1 or 2 to level 3 - \\"when you're ready\\" does not imply that you can mix it up for diversity, or if you need to keep doing the same for 10 days before \\"upgrading\\"
B00003CXSP|1|This film lacked the style of \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" and only hard-boiled gore fans will like this one. Hopkins is a better actor than this film and I don't think he needed the money so much that he would stoop so low as to protray a ... like Hannibal. As mentioned before this film is not about suspense or terror which can be overcome as it was in \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\" It is all about gore. Don't let the R rating fool you because it deserves an X just for the gore.
B00004RWYJ|5|I have loved this movie Grease since this movie came out in I think 1978. I saw it dozens of times, and I can never get tired of it. High School Musical seems similar to it. Lots of dancing and singing.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Wonderful show.  Much more of a story-line than &#34;Despicable Me.&#34;  Very funny.  Characters much more developed.
B00CY0JY88|5|However I think that all loose ends could have been concluded in book 3.  I'm not sure there was so much of a cliffhanger to persuade me to buy the fourth book.  I may only buy if nothing else interests me at the time.
B007P6VM04|4|I really enjoy the show but I thought this would be better-there were a few songs that had been in the show that were not on the CD.  If you like the music of &#34;bombshell&#34;, buy that CD, not this one.
1101946342|1|If you are looking to read the first book again, then this book is for you. Save your money and just read the first book again, seriously!! Not worth the $$!!!!
B00DURGZHW|4|Great movie! Had not heard of it before watching it. Very impressed with entire supporting staff, especially the boys.
055338466X|3|I first read A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking in grade school, then later after garnering (to one degree or another) a decent understanding of the basic principles of physics and the universe. My level of understanding increased as I repeated my sojourn into the text as well as with age, experience, and studies. I was captivated and made physics, especially the quantum variety, something of an odd hobby. I rarely shared this passion with anyone...at least not until much later when \\"Bazinga\\" became a recognizable and more socially acceptable punch line.<br /><br />I only recently decided to dive into The Grand Design. My reading list is long, and not all hobbies and passions can be realized and explored at the same time (well, maybe they can in the multiverse concept). And what is time anyway? I will admit at the onset that this book did mess with my head. I remember upon completion (the same day I was becoming familiar with Krauss's new book about `nothing') I could barely sleep, and went to bed with complex ideas concerning how one really could divide by zero. I do have nerd issues.<br /><br />Conceptually, I liked reading The Grand Design. However, the authors could have had the same effect in achieving purpose by publishing this work in much shorter form, perhaps a long entry in an academic journal, or a more reachable even shorter piece in a magazine...something like Popular Science. I'd shorten the first chapter, then weld it right alongside Chapter 6, skipping most of the middle and only applying conceptual explanation where absolutely necessary for reader comprehension. As an effective piece of literature, I'm sure the authors lost readers around Chapter 3 in many cases. The material in the middle chapters is technical and easily beyond the scope of the average reader's abilities in understanding. Dumbing down the language and rhetoric is doubtfully helpful. I know lay people picked up A Brief History of Time and could immediately find value; I justdon't see that happening with this text, especially if it's prone to readers only getting through the first couple of chapters. Maybe the target audience is the hobbyist, like me.<br /><br />I guess it just wasn't what I expected, and there is nothing really wrong with that. But marketing for this book (at least what I've seen thus far), seems to equate this to Hawking's earlier works--a false comparison. Also, and more importantly, I really expected to learn something new and abrupt. This book was more of a rehash of ideas that have been around for a decade or more. Many authors have dealt with the something from nothing idea, M-theory, and more. I did enjoy the concept of the Game of Life, my sole `new' finding during my read. When I finished, I wanted more, but not in the literarily curious way, but in the way of answers. I didn't get many.<br /><br />If you do decide to read the book, I recommend the paper version as opposed to eBook. I read this on my Kindle, and it lacked what I saw in the store, beautiful glossy pictures to help along the way. Instead, I got miniatures in black and white. Perhaps it's time to update to the Fire.<br /><br />(3 out of 5 stars as I did get something out of the read and enjoy the authors as scientists...but, probably more of a 2 in terms of literary value)
B00G4Q3KOC|5|good and  think others would like it. Its a good movie for people to watch with some pop corn and soda.
B004HWYTP4|5|Spoof, funny and at time hilarious; should have seen this one before Red2, though the &#34;2&#34; was not considered a sequel.  All actors perm well.
B00AWJYJVA|4|le Carre annoys the hell out of me with his &#34;I say old chap&#34; style of conversation. I have sworn never to read him again because of that. However, there is less than usual of that highly stylised conversation in this book. And as always there is a compelling story. le Carre's stories and tension always draw me back - and this one doesn't disappoint. A big vote of approval.
B004GJDQT8|5|The UI and UX is awesome from a mobile device. What can I say, they make taking my money and receiving products an awesome experience.
B0097HSS4M|4|Very good app for making photo beautiful.
0307474259|5|The book will explain everything you need to know to understand your body, lose weight and be healthy. It will open your eyes.
B003G4W49C|3|Read this book last week or the week before and went through it quite quickly on my Kindle Paper White. Overall an OK novel. But if I had to compare it to great ones like Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels I like those better. The characters in this series just do not appeal as much to me as they did in other sic fi series. Call me old fashioned. I will continue this series sooner rather than later and I might add more stars to other sequels, we shall see. Three stars for now.
0345505387|5|Love this book!
B0000025RI|5|I know some may disagree but this albulm offers Michael Jackson at his best, and features some of pops most superb music and beats, with Michael's revolutionary Thriller, to Billie Jean, to the easy listening songs like The Girl is Mine with Paul McCartney and Baby Be Mine. If you do not own any albulms by Michael or are a newcomer to pop, this is a must buy. I find this is better than the new Thriller 25, which features a ton of extra generic, lame attempts by modern musicians at trying to mimic the late great, king of pop, which nobody can do as good as him. The only problem is this CD is not compatible with all CD players so you might want to get the 2001 remaster just in to be safe. But try to avoid Thriller 25, as it does have the originals, but also has a lot of crap by generic artists that taint the CD a little.
B00A0SO4S6|5|Just plain a solid movie, good actors with an interesting theme that is fully addressed and has good plot resolution at the end.
B0073U2F2Q|5|Great
0307454894|4|The affair profoundly effected his life. We never realize how deeply we may effect someone else's life. This book was well written but overall I think it was a very sad story without a happy ending.
B002Q7JYPC|5|The Eagles has always been my favorite musical group.  Over the years I have the band and the members individual careers.  I saw the documentary on TV and I knew I wantd a copy for myself.  As far as the CD content goes...same beautiful music I have loved since the beginning.  I am very satisfied.
B00F452NG0|3|I am stuck for over a week on #twenty something. It is not fun any more, it is very frustrating.
B0000AQS0F|5|I have the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; which was the closing movie after FOX stupidly canceled &#34;Firefly.&#34; So enjoy all the episodes of &#34;Firefly&#34; in order and then watch &#34;Serenity.&#34; FOX is eating crow when they canceled this show and they know it. There is an immense cult following for the show even though it lasted only one season. Catch a good time with &#34;Firefly&#34; characters at any Comicon.
B00AGJ4HC2|4|Love the game. Quick and fun. Can play in under 5 minutes.
B002RI9HUM|4|Right, so I am a big fan of Marian Keyes' novels. Although it's labelled as chick-lit, these are actually good books. I admit I was rather sceptic the first time I had Watermelon in my hands, because I'm normally not really into these chick literature thingies. But I decided to give it a try, and how glad I am that I did, because I ended up reading most of her books.<br />I admire the way Keyes writes about her subjects - starting with a serious theme at the base (like, in this case, drug abuse), added with some ligher stuff and a twist of humor. It's lighthearted, serious and humorous as the same time - if that is possible.<br /><br />Like many others, the Walsh Family books are my favourite Keyes books. It's just so comforting to get to know the family more and more, each sister with her own life and problem, but always going back to the base - the parents. Which gives cause to laughter and funny situations. And it's all recognisable. I mean, off course we don't all have a family like that, but there's a lot of things that you can identify with.<br /><br />Rachel's Holiday was the 3rd Keyes book I read, and I instantly loved it to bits. I re-read it once in a while and it never manages to get boring. I've read reviews where they said that it's a bit dark - that might be, but not for me. I like this kind of stuff. It gives a fairly good insight of drug addiction and everything that comes and goes with it, without it getting too depressing. A point of view from a girl that could be your neighbour, for instance.<br /><br />That's what I like about it. It's not about some star, some faraway chick who leads a glamourous life and all. It could be anyone. Just the life of some girl that got on the wrong track somewhere, somehow. How it's possible to end up as an addict in the first place. Told by herself - I always like that - and as said before, with lots of humour in it.<br /><br />Anyhow, each to his/her own, but for me this is the kind of book that never gets old. A good read for, well, anywhere and anytime.good read for, well, anywhere and anytime.
B0002KZAKS|5|I was expecting a so-so mike for the price, boy was I surprised!  This mike is great.  One thing I did notice was that if it wasn't fed into a mixer you need some low impedance filters to keep the thing from buzzing, other than that it works great.
0451169514|5|An excellent book that definitely is exemplary of Stephen King's horrific talents.  Imagine your worst ever nightmares incorporated into one terrifying being!   <br />Do not be daunted by the size of the novel.  I first  read this book in middle school where I read it cover to cover only to  close the book and immediately start again.  <br />Having just read it again  at 27, it is (morbidly) comforting to know that I remain awe of Stephen  King's genius.<br />Give it a try!
B00004YYDI|5|GREAT
B00HY7VU60|4|Really enjoyed it but it did not need all the nudity to tell a great story.
B0082SU98U|5|A sweet story that would be great to read to young children. A great story to teach children to find ways to be \\"glad\\" even when things are tough in life!
B00BD6EJRK|4|I love this app. This is the first one I have purchased. I love all the features the Pro offers
B0017R5UAA|2|VERY disappointed in this one.  After I saw the band perform on SNL, I was intrigued and thought this was the breath of fresh air I was looking for - not true.  This album is HIGHLY derivative of any folk-rock band from the late 60s/70s; Crosby, Stills & Nash, Cat Stevens, America - take your pick.  The first few minutes of the album were gripping, until I realized that every song sounded exactly alike: canned vocals, overblown harmonies, drippy lyrics and half-baked melodies.  Even the cover is trying too hard to look retro-folksy; you can't push all these throwbacks too much or you just become a gimmick, and that's exactly what they've done here.    I have to admit that I haven't completely written off the band as of yet.  They're working on a new album that should be released later this year and it supposedly is less poppy and more jam-like.  This might better suit the band and could yield a good album, but there certainly isn't one to be found here.
0142403873|5|This is a great children's book! It's funny, has some twists and turns in the story, and it's fun to read out loud! My little one is 5 months old and she likes to listen to the rhymes and look at the illustrations. The main character is a smart little mouse whose intelligence keeps him one step ahead of potential predators. When my husband heard me reading it aloud to my daughter, he thought it was so funny it became one of his favorite children's books to read to her.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B007FEFLTO|5|The story and characters from the first book were are wonderful woven in. I can't imagine what is under to come!!! Read this trilogy
B006TLZNDI|5|Beautiful story with a good ending.  I don't say this often, better than the book! (Did not finish the book)
B006RXQDH8|5|One of my favorite Uma Thurman movies
B000002HAJ|5|The Cure has been my favorite band for about 10 years now, which is literally when I started appreciating music.  Of all their recordings, Wish is the greatest in my opinion.  Although their other albums offer traditional favorites such as &quot;Pictures of You&quot; and &quot;Lovesong&quot;, the gloomy melodies and insightful lyrics make Wish a masterpiece.  It is impossible to listen to the Cure without a deep appreciation for the poetry and feeling in their lyrics, especially when you listen to a song such as &quot;Apart&quot; or &quot;A Letter to Elise.&quot;  Few songwriters, if any, can capture the mood and true feeling behind Cure lyrics and Wish offers the best of what they have, on the whole.  Although this album became popular with &quot;Friday I'm in Love&quot;, it's still a cute pop song that can't be written off.  This album, dark and haunting provides songs of love lost, trust broken and other themes that make this the timeless masterpiece that it is.  If you don't own it, you must buy it!
B00991TCOG|5|Excellent !!! A pretty good debut album. I hope many more will follow. It just hasn't enough exclusive titles !
B00KWVZ750|2|Wonderful game would be better if I didn't have to shut my kindle down almost every time I start a new stage I will give a five star review once this is fixed!
6303617719|5|Who could not laugh at the way Meg Ryan scrunches up her nose.  Or the way Kevin Kline misconstrues the meaning in a high five.  French Kiss is at the top of my list for romantic comedys.  It is the one movie i can watch over  and over again, and still not tire of the well acted and personable  characters, cute plot and overall way it makes me smile. I highly recomend  this light and yummy romance.
B00A0SKFLG|4|Not a bad piece of work. The director is definitely using Blade Runner as a theme for the look of this film. Nice production design but a little complicated to follow. Worth watching and more believable than the original Schwarzenegger version.
B006ID6NDQ|5|A very interesting but tragic piece of fairly recent history as experienced by an ordinary member of the public.  It demonstrates what can happen when the majority actively support  a brutal and savage regime.  However, the book also demonstrates the bravery and kindness of the few who were prepared to put their lives at risk in order to save a fellow human being.  A wonderful example of the unconquerable human spirit.
B0054JZC6E|4|I love this! I can waste time while I only have five minutes. and not enough time to get into a book
B0054JZC6E|4|this app is fun I like playing the games in class. I get a lot of points in history. my favorite game is bounce.
B008JGSM6G|3|This was okay but thought it was too repetitive.  I have deleled this.
0307272702|5|Book is well written with technical info that is easy to comprehend. Explains the science behind the conclusions. Can be read cover to cover in short while.
B0081SRJSY|5|Really fun to play, and also very quick. I can get in a 4 player game (3 computer opponents) finished before my lunch break ends. Easy to play, and being able to play with the River expansion is very nice.
B004SOR4H6|4|The ability to connect with varying persons, communicate with the stars of ur fave shows, that makes it so entertaining.
B00TLKOILW|5|Oh, ten years gone... well more like twenty!  My introduction to the best band EVER, began during the time when Jimmy Page first remastered their catalog in the early 90's. When I think of the young adults that are now discovering Led Zeppelin, I'm a little envious cause that time only happens once. For me, that experience remains to this day, the most special time of my life. Where does Physical Gaffiti fit in the timeline? For the band, it was a time of exploration, excess & success. For me, it was much the same. I think we played &#34;In the Light&#34; at least a dozen times in a row, one mind expanding night, while I created a godly light show on the ceiling with a flashlight... true story.

B000K7UBTI|4|It appears that the big wigs at MARVEL want to get as much wattage out of their product and produce merchandise that continues to \\"re-vamp\\" their cannon of characters.  This foray into the \\"Invincible Iron Man\\" is more in the vien of what we've seen with the recent \\"Ultimate Avengers\\" line and is really very dramatically portrayed.  It's not great...the animation stands to be tweaked still...but the combination of computer-wizardry to bring to life Iron Man is quite engaging.<br /><br />If you're a fan and anxiously awaiting the upcoming big screen venture, this is for you, but the real nugget here is the sneak-peek into the next MARVEL animation release: DOCTOR STRANGE!  Now that's one property they can evolve into a fantastic series!

B00005V9HH|3|Mr. Super Criminal walks free smoking a cig at the end and we're supposed to think what a winner he is. However, aside from Soze having no friends, some rich people in North Carolina have legally ripped him off and Soze is too dumb to know it.----I mean the cigarettes he buys from the tobacco companies and the heart disease or cancer he probably will get.--The shareholders of Philip Morris Corp.(Altria Corp.) must have laughed their heads off if they watched this.

Rushmore -  that were packed into that time. What I found most interesting was the way Bryson tracked the rise, and fall, of so many of the rich and famous of the time.

B0000DYJM6|4|As far as B-sides and rarities go, this collection by the seminal Seattle true to the roots of rock bands PJ, stacks up as one of the finest.  It ranks right up there with other greats in B-side collections, like R.E.M's &quot;Dead Letter Office.&quot;  If put to a &quot;must&quot; I'd have to say PJ's &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; tops out.  And let me tell ya why my friend.<br />For the PJ faithfull, &quot;Lost Dogs,&quot; reveals some things about the band.  First it lets PJ lay it down on vinyl as is...letting it all hang out, quirks, gems, shoulda never beens.  It's a wonderful thing for PJ fans and even makes for a good listen to those un-initiated.  I think B-side collections maybe reveals more about a band than their produced released albums do.  What does &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; say about PJ?  It reveals that there more multi-dimensional eclectic than they let on to be from other albums.  Granted &quot;No Code,&quot; and &quot;Vitalogy,&quot; were great horizon-stretching experimental stand-outs in the PJ catalogue, but &quot;Lost Dogs,&quot; puts out stuff PJ probably originally wished would have never seen the light of day.  Jack Irons' &quot;Whale Song,&quot; O'Brien's &quot;Gremmie&quot;, and Vedder and Ament's Rockline broadcast, &quot;Bee Girl,&quot; all might fall in that category.  But that's what makes &quot;Lost Dogs,&quot; great, it's all here, the good, the bad, the ugly.<br />Another very interesting thing &quot;Lost Dogs,&quot; reveals can be found in the liner notes.  They are worth the price of admission of &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; just to reach some enlightenment on PJ's albums.  One thing that stands out is:  Binaural really had the potential to be one of PJ's stronger albums instead of their perhaps weakest release.  There are no less than 6 out takes from the Binaural recordings.  The rolling tribal swing of &quot;Education,&quot; and the whispered hush life-pondering folk of &quot;Fatal,&quot; stand out as some of PJ's finer songs.  My, my...replace Binaural's first three tracks with those + maybe Cameron's 1-2 punch of &quot;In the Moonlight,&quot; and a fine fine album would have been made.  To me it reveals something was lacking in the chemistry between Binaural's producer Tschad Blake and the band.  Thank god for the return of PJ mainstay Brendan O'Brien...stick with him for future releases.<br />Another interesting thing revealed is just what a phenomenal catalogue the band had when releasing their first album &quot;Ten.&quot;  Out takes from Ten are pretty phenomenal on &quot;Lost Dogs.&quot;  &quot;Alone,&quot; has a very ten-ish sound to it...but what a song.  It has that throw-off punk-funk arena rock mesh that was PJ's signature in those days.  This seems like it would have made for a live show staple for PJ over the years...every bit as good and muchly better than &quot;Porch.&quot;  &quot;Wash,&quot; is pretty well-known to the PJ faithfull but plays much better live than the version that made &quot;Dogs.&quot;  And &quot;Brother,&quot; oh brother rocks harder than just about the whole PJ discography.  It has this wonderful driving groove with break-out solos that show off McCready's guitar axe-slinging wizardry.  I've heard there's a version that exist with lyrics...maybe &quot;Lost Dogs 2&quot; will bless us with that...call the dogcatcher boys.<br />The cover &quot;Leaving Here,&quot; is wonderful to have studio-version.  It really is a perfect vehicle for PJ and nice to have vs. some of the butchered live versions.  &quot;Undone,&quot; has radio-friendly hit (in a good way) written all over it and I think could have surpassed similar ultimately catchy PJ tunes like &quot;Yield's&quot; &quot;Wishlist.&quot;<br />I maybe a rabid drooling dog for not giving this one 5-stars, but it includes some of PJ's best along some of their not-so-best, so conscientiously I could not recommend it for the general audience.  PJ fans...&quot;Lost Dogs,&quot; is a must have.  Soon to be PJ fans, work yourself up with &quot;No Code,&quot; &quot;Riot Act,&quot; &quot;Yield,&quot; &quot;Ten,&quot; some live albums and then you too will be completely hooked like moi and you'll be ready for the big lost dogs.<br />--MMWith &quot;No Code,&quot; &quot;Riot Act,&quot; &quot;Yield,&quot; &quot;Ten,&quot; some live albums and then you too will be completely hooked like moi and you'll be ready for the big lost dogs.<BR>--MMW
B004FGMDOQ|5|I read this at random because I know there turning it into a movie I knew nothing about the book and I ended up loving it. It has some of the quality of other books but this one was special to me because even though time travel did not turn out to be the main theme it played a part it was adventurous and magical I recommend it to anyone this book is both appealing to young adults and adults.

1591841666|1|OK, I keep buying Godin's books expecting more.  But, all I get is content that seems like a well constructed blog posting.  Seth is a very good writer and communicator, but this book added zero to my life.  It is a very short book about quitting stuff you're not good at and sticking with (or starting) things you're not good at.  Life is short.  The longer you dwell in mediocrity, the longer it will take you to become exceptional.  Contrary to the book's claim, it doesn't really teach you WHEN to quit or when to stick...other than when the goal is worthwhile.  Such an examination takes more than just reading some words.  There is very little thought-provoking content here.  It seems like a summarized rip-off of Marcus Buckhingham and the \\"strengths\\" books...which are excellent and unlike this book...may change your life.  Godin is well respected in marketing, but how many more collections of blogs (small is the new big), other people's works (purple cow), and short discourses about the obvious can he keep putting out?  It's like people who compile ezines.

0385534639|5|This has to be one of the best books I've read all year.<br /><br />Magical, mysterious, and creative, this is Erin Morgenstern's first book -- and I can't WAIT for anything else she writes.<br /><br />The premise -- circus tents show up with no previous announcement.  They can appear anywhere in the word.  Rather than the colorful tents of the circus we know as kids, these circus tents are striped in black and white.  Tent after tent follows a winding path through the circus, and where you may have seen one thing one day, you might find something else later.<br /><br />Oh -- and the circus is only open at night.<br /><br />The characters are richly developed, but the main characters, Celia and Marco, are pitted against each other in a competition whose outcome is nebulous and until the end, not really known.  At first, the two have no idea who their opponent is, but as it begins to dawn on them, they also realize they're falling in love.<br /><br />So many magical things happen in this book -- it's emotional, exciting, mesmerizing, and suspenseful.  The ending will leave you spellbound.<br /><br />Read this book!
B0051ANPZQ|5|You will cheer for young August from the first page, and the book doesn't disappoint.  I really enjoyed the point of view changes in the middle.  We are able to see him how others see him; wondering what it must be like to grow up as one of 'those people' who scare little kids just by looking how he does.  This is definitely a 'glass is half-full' type of book, and I look forward to reading it with my 3rd grader.

0525478817|4|Yeah, I know everyone loved this young adult book, and it was good.  I just didn't think it was as fabulous as many others did.  It's a nice story, now apparently a great movie.  I don't like when a book gets over hyped, and sadly, I feel this is another one that fell into this same trap.  For young adults,  it is definitely a book worth reading.  However, for older adults, read Me Before You by Jojo Moyes instead.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|My five year old granddaughter loves this game- She likes the characters and scenes. A free app worth the time to download.
B000EMGAOY|5|hang on a sec, before i write this review i'm gonna get the thesaurus and look up great. this album certainly deserves the astronomical sales it'll undoubtably have. it starts off with 3 superbly catchy tracks and doesn't let up in quality right through. nearly every song would be a highlight on another album. their is a great range in here, from the soulful strip my mind to the funked-up hump de bump, without the dead-end self-indulgence which is usually the province of the double-album. the second disc, mars, will always be dwarfed by the epic jupiter with the irrepressible energy of torture me and charlie mixing with the cresendo of wet sand and the sad/beautiful hey to produce a hour of sonic bliss. mars for it's part has the great she looks to me and final track death of a martian, though it also contans the only bum note in soporific IF. To call it john frusciante's album would be a great injustice to anthony, whose vocals have improved immensely, but this has the most solos in a non-thrash metal album ever with the previous restraint of frusciante giving way to faster exuberent playing. chad and flea are solid throughout but should have tried to steal the show a bit more while anthony has reached some sort of lyrical nadir. but such flaws are forgiven by the sheer depth in class over these two hours. the greatest double album since melloncollie and the infinite sadness, stadium arcadium is the best the red hot chili peppers have ever done and that's worth a listen.
B001GSV3EC|5|Bloody ripper album. Great to hear Jeff in full flight in a live setting and get a taste of just how subtle, nuanced, and rip-snortin' he is live without any studio smoke 'n mirrors. Mind you, he has a reputation for using minimal special effects within or without the studio. It's all in the fingers. What control. What expression. Christ this guy can play. The consumate Euro rock guitarist. So damn good, he can't seem to play in a normal rock format - i.e. with singer in tow. Of course he kinda made the transition to jazz-rock but has remained essentially in the rock camp playing what would have to be described as \\"instrumental rock\\" rather than \\"jazz rock\\". Thank god he didn't get into wanky spiritualism and paradoxalism such as afflicted the jazz rockers - e.g. \\"return to ... forever\\", \\"visions of the emerald ... beyond\\", etc, etc. Of course all these guys were in thrall to Jimminy \\"Cricket\\" Hendrix and wanted to get a taste of unleashing that kind of sonic power. Jeff might have been a bit in thrall to the Jimster himself. But Jeff was there right at the start right along with Jimminy, Eric, Green, Page, etc. He was, perhaps more than any other Euro guitarist, the main guy to create the language of rock guitar. And more than any other, he took it somewhere else. Check out Nadia for a taste of what Jeff can do with micro-tones. Great to hear some of the old material getting a workout. Only disappointment I guess is a lack of new stuff. Be good to hear some great new tunes in the hands of the maestro. Interesting to speculate on what the Stones might have sounded like had Jeff joined at the time instead of Ronnie. I don't imagine he would have stuck around forever but it would have been fun to hear a couple of Stones disks with Jeff slashing and burning along with the riff-maester.
B0054JZC6E|4|Fun and fast paced easy games. Great for someone with a short attention span. It's definitely a great time passer.

B00HXYKYIE|3|I usually end up feeling sad that I finished one of Ms Picoult's books, but I was actually relieved when I finished this one.  Not that it was a horrible novel, just a slow read.  Compared to everything else I have read by her, this book was completely different.  The ending took me by surprise, but that was about all the emotion I have about this book.  Not her best, in my opinion, but it won't stop me from gobbling up her next novel.  I almost always enjoy reading her books-unfortunately this one ranks with &#34;The Song of the Humpback&#34; which I didn't enjoy that much either.

1580086810|5|And the transformation of the global diet impacts us all too.   <br /> <br />The photographs are vivid and beautifully laid out.  It becomes obvious that the authors of this book befriended each family and truly got to know them.  That sincerity is what takes this book from simple premise to a work of art.   <br /> <br />The profiles are fast and fun, giving you a colorful and oftentimes humorous sense of each family's daily life surrounding their sustenance.  Recipes are included as a great way to understand and perhaps actually taste an exotic dish. <br /> <br />The statistics are varied and interesting...\\"kangaroos killed under commercial harvest for meat and skins: 3,474,483\\"...but not obtrusive, you get the idea by looking at the pictures alone.   <br /> <br />The spectrum of families covered is striking, from a Sudanese refugee-camp family eating U.N. World Food Programme provided rations to a native Greenland family that eats as much commercially processed food as they do hunted seal meat.  <br /> <br />A perfect book to have in your kitchen...who isn't intrigued by what others are eating? <br />

0385341067|5|Mr.Pip turned out to be an interesting book after all.The story is set in a lonely island with only one white person whose uniqueness and love for English Literature leads him to be the teacher of a class of kids when all other teachers have fled the island in search for safety.  Mr.Pip introduces Dickens' to class by reading and discussing the book Great Expectations.  The students are as away from the British pattern of living as can be. Their only source of seeing this fascinating country is through the eyes of Pip, the protagonist of Great Expectations.  The students develop an immediate liking to the character as they identify with some of his struggles and also his age.  The unique classroom situations with little else to help them but the great Mr.Pip sometimes fascinates them and other times confuses them.    The confusion pointed out is the great pedagogical question of Making Meaning of the text. The Narrator, a young girl called Matilda seems to think that they had been given another piece of the world where they could enter anytime and do anything. But at other points she feels a disconnect as there is only so much she can learn about Pip or his life after which there seems to be a huge blank space full of questions.  This is precisely what the teachers face in class when they do texts which involve ordinary and extraordinary situations.  What a student makes out of them and gains from them is his calling.   This is what makes the book VERY TEACHABLE as it brings out the dilemmas that young readers face while they encounter new texts.  Explaining the book in terms of their own reading experience and identifying with Matilda's mind is what would make the students look insightfully and introsepctively at the book and all books that would follow.  Thumbs Up TO MISTER PIP.  The book has a tempting array of teachbale moments.  An enjoyable read for all who venture into reading it.
0399167064|4|This book is shrouded in mystery and only gives itself away a little at time.  It was impossible to put down.  Usually it takes me a week or two more to read books of this size.<br /><br />You know someone dies(a main character) and someone else is responsible for it (also a main character.)<br /><br />Strewn in between is the story of modern families and their every day struggles.  From a single mom to the not so perfect husband and wife, Moriary lets you into their lives behind the curtain.<br /><br />You can relate with the heartache of the characters.  Their lives revolve around their children.  Bringing up a family is tough work.  Throw in some baggage like second marriages and haunting pasts and you have a juicy book that leaves you guessing &#34;who done It?&#34; until the end.

B00000AD94|2|The Light was Spock's Beard's debut album, and it shows, as it feels rough and unfinished, and at times perhaps misconceived.  The arrangements are herky-jerky, the lyrics ranging from confusing to embarrassing, and the sound is often thin, quite a change from the fuller sounds we're used to from their recent albums.<br />The title track opens the album and displays all of these qualities in spades.  It starts with a cloying piano melody and then launches into an overture-like, uninspired instrumental sequence, before finally hitting the mark with the quirky but melodic &quot;One Man&quot; bit.  From there the track winds through several vaguely-connected melodies before returning to the &quot;One Man&quot; melodies and finally wrapping up with the unfortunate piano-and-vocals bit again.  The lyrics don't hold water at all, and the transitions between parts of the track feel very rough and unsatisfying.<br />&quot;Go the Way You Go&quot; and &quot;The Water&quot; are both similar in approach and outcome.  &quot;Go&quot; is the best of the three since it has the strongest melodies; &quot;The Water&quot; has some interesting bits, but is overall the weakest track of the album, and is not cube-friendly thanks to its extensive use of a four-letter word.  Lyrically, little here is of interest, as Neal Morse's tendency for portentiousness has not been reined in by his later facility to make a point.<br />&quot;On the Edge&quot; is a straightforward rocker, a little reminiscent of Peter Gabriel's &quot;On the Air&quot;.  It's the tightest track of the album, and is what it is.<br />The sound, as I said, often feels thin.  I'm not a big fan of Alan Morse's guitar work generally, but he was clearly still mastering his craft on this album.  Neal Morse's keyboards are decent, but the absence of Ryo Okumoto really shows; his arrival would give later albums a much deeper, more satisfying sound.<br />All in all, The Light is of only marginal interest to folks who aren't already big fans of Spock's Beard.  There's some good material here, enjoyable when you can unearth it, but the album is really only a template for much better work yet to come.ig fans of Spock's Beard.

I definitely recommend one of those furry windscreens to cover the wind noise (a quick search on eBay shows some different makers  (it does come with a standard foam screen)    These are more worries and nit picks than complaints:    1) 25 second boot-up  2) The case printing in the menu/select area is rubbing off after only 2 weeks  3) The jog wheel/select button worries me a lot in a long range time frame as far as breaking  4) You're going to want the remote control to cut down on case noise if you're using a tripod(a little shopping around will get you a bundle deal)  5) The Cubase 4LE is certainly intense, but comes with a pretty obnoxious DRM license scheme (I know that it is free.)  For all the complaining about the H4N manual, wait until you wade through the Cubase (non-printed) manual.  6) You can set the H4N for use with NiMH rechargeable batteries; this means the battery level indicator is calibrated properly, it does NOT mean you can recharge the batteries while in the unit (I verified this with zoom/samsontech)    having said that, it's so cool that it has a ton of features most people will never use (4 channels, music effects, metronome, multi-track).  I've used it with a cheap 16GB transcend SD card with no problem.  It actually came with a printed manual!(when was the last time that happened?)It has a case and a AC adapter!  For only $350!! (I feel like Billy Mays Here)
0061692042|4|This is not an action book. Other than the opening, and you wildly turn the pages looking for answers, it is written in hindsight... the narrator grown and looking back with both his naive present teen self and thoughts, what he should have known or watched out for (his very adult self), and how it all played out. It is a beautifully written, painful, portrait of a child (helpless) left to make a life for himself after his parents decide that the only way out of their despair...is to rob a bank. !!!!  Yes, and then the portrait of the criminal mind, or in their case...the lack of development of one.<br /><br />I did enjoy it after I quickly realized we would be focused on reflection (of a life lost), what it means/meant...how it worked out okay. And along the way very much introspection about life, death, good, evil, and all that. Heavy. Tons.<br /><br />Still, I liked it. Richard is an astute writer, has wonderful command of the written word but I sure felt like I wanted to sit down and see some mindless comedy as I turned the last page.
B00AAQRNQ8|4|Great mouse for the price however there are two main cons. One is that I've had it for like. 8 months and it's left click is starting to be sunk below the right and isn't flush. I worry it is going to go dead at some point. Second is that it's very light weight. Besides that the software is amazing but only works for Windows so be warned of that. sometimes the color isn't exactly where you want but that's not a huge deal.
B008M721MS|3|Nice app to have.
0780624890|4|This was an excellent action/vampire movie.  The storyline was well written and their seemed to be no problem in putting the storyline on the big screen.  It is not your classic vampire flick and if that is what you are looking for this Blade is not for you.  On the other hand I think you will enjoy this movie.<br />One thing that I found real cool that some of the vampire legends were not true in this movie.  For example, crosses no longer warded off vampires.  Also vampires often made allies of mortals.  This was one aspect I liked about the movie. Another thing I found very enjoyable was that Blade is exhibited to be a ruthless and cold blooded killer when it came to dealing with evil vampires. Yet on the other hand when it came to his friends and allies he was almost the exact opposite.  Snipes, and the creators of this movie did a very good job with displaying these two contradicting personalities in Blade's character.  I see some people commenting that Blade should have tried to save his vampire mother.  However, Blade realized that she was a vampire and that she posed a serious threat.  Because of this, he knew that he needed to take her out, which he did.<br />The fighting scenes were spectacular and for the most part Blade was beating the living crap out of any vampire who dared step in his path, and his skilled use of all his tools and gadjects were very appealing to watch.  However in the last scence blade got beat up pretty bad but he got his revenge later.  In addition to the fight scenes the special effects were done very well, nothing really spectacular, but that is certainly better then over doing it.  one scene that stands out in my mind is the scene were all of the vampires' blood joins and its begining to fall onto Frost's head.  This seems to be a very simple scene but the closeup of the single drop of blood was very pleasing and at the same time erie to watch.  Snipes acting was pretty good, but I think that the best acting in this movie goes to Stephen Dorf his character of Frost was VERY convincing and he himself was probally the scariest part of the movie.<br />There is also an alternate ending which I am VERY glad did not end up in the final cut of the movie.  The final scene in the alternate ending shows Frost actually changing into the blood god  and it was very corny and terribly done.  I am glad they decided to cut that part and im sure you will be glad too.<br />If there was one bad thing about this movie, there were 2 or 3 cheesy one liners that could have been left about the movie.  But, I guess it did add a bit of comic relief.<br />All in all Blade is a very well written and well done movie.  Non-critical veiwers and will enjoy this movie for what it is and will not try to compare Blade's character to other &quot;nicer&quot; superheroes.oes to Stephen Dorf his character of Frost was VERY convincing and he himself was probally the scariest part of the movie.<br />There is also an alternate ending which I am VERY glad did not end up in the final cut of the movie.

B000AWYOGE|4|i give it lots of credit because it's not very often they come out with something like this. it wasn't scary, but it was a thrill and suspenseful as well. the mother and daughter both seemed lost. they have to move on, hopefully to better things, but it's not so. the mother is haunted by her own past, as well as a haunting in her present. she thinks she's losing it, but she feels there's something more. her daughters in the middle, then in the end she pays the ultimate sacrifice for her little girl. now she must become what she onced feared. good plot and nice twist. although personally i wish it would have ended differently. jennifer connelly did a very good job, playing this woman, who thought she had control of her life, but not so.
B004GUSG4M|5|If you enjoyed the movie \\"Mememto,\\" you have to read this book.  What a premise!  The narrator can't remember anything from day to day.  The author has captured what this would be like allowing you to feel the frustration, helplessness, and terror that the narrator is experiencing.  The reader has as difficult time as the narrator in discerning what is real.  Think of the movie \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" which captured the audience in the main character's illusions.  You go back and forth thinking you have it figured out.  I couldn't put it down until the end, not that it's action-packed, but it is fast-paced due to its psychological edginess.
B00000IAU3|1|boring, derivative, whiny, sleep-inducing.<br />I guarantee, if Eminem had not sampled her unremarkable song &quot;Thank You&quot;, she would be nowhere. She has a nerve playing STADIUMS across the country (which, by the way, have been 1/3 to 1/2 full). She's not a particularly good songwriter - she's wishy-washy and dull. Go spend your hard-earned cash on PJ Harvey, Janet Jackson, Sheryl Crow, Madonna, Eva Cassidy or Lucinda Williams - Chicks who ROCK! Not on over-rated bland 'pop' sung by a girl who got really, really lucky one day.
B000BTJCRM|5|Ok, I just got back from Perth's Big Day Out. I was there to see Iggy and the Stooges, but some enthusiastic surffer boys commanded me to go see Wolfmother. So I did (Iggy too), and I was blown away!! This disc is classic rock. Crunch power chords mixed with progressive rock concepts and wonderful pop harmonies, and spine tingling vocal acrobatics.  Minds Eye starts out sounding like Radiohead, then morphs into some classic power rock from a by-gone era.  Dimensions is pure hard rock candy.  It is hard to believe this is a threesome generating so much hard core sound.  GET IT! You'll love it!
B003O86FMW|5|Anther heart stopper !  I could barely put this one down, part two bringing together so many events from the first book.  As of course written so if you never read The Hunger Games, you will still enjoy,,,,
B00FWLDHSY|5|An adrenaline rush with just the right amount of science.  It met my on-going need for scary, horrific films to be far enough out from real life that I don't &#34;hang garlic from neck and sleep with cross&#34; (stole that from some film, &#34;Cutting Edge??&#34;).
B0064TVQ5E|3|There is a limited amount of games - after completing them all you are supposed to buy the upgraded version - and it will only play in portrait mode - the games are very easy to complete, however I love Mahjong so enjoyed it while it lasted.

B00000251N|5|Listening to this soundtrack brought tears to my eyes just as it did when it was originally released.  I remember seeing Neil Diamond do a concert several years ago, and he had Jonathan Livingston Seagull in its entirety as his encore.  It's just amazing!  I play it over and over.
B00EL8JCGU|1|same old thing; never did find out why Pit was so wanted by the agency, it didn't look like he had any special skills.

B003XQPT9A|5|I must admit, after the Patrick Stewart \\"Christmas Carol\\" movie, this is my favorite. Michael Caine is terrific as Scrooge, and the songs are great. My kids love this movie, and it's not too scary for little kids. Highly recommended.
B00KMX5V8G|5|Stupid addictive game.  I like the short, pointless video games like this.  I can play it quick without having to invest too much time.
0240815807|5|It's a bible!<br />Best reference book for home mixers.
B000B5QWKG|4|The four stars I'm giving is for the music on the disc. But here's my warning about the DualDisc format of this album: even though the track listing here on Amazon.com suggests that the DVD side has the album in 5.1 surround sound, that is *not* true. If you read the label on the album, it says \\"enhanced stereo\\". <br />Getting a surround sound mix is the only reason I would ever buy a DualDisc and this one doesn't have it. The extra video content on the DVD side is not really worth the extra cost. Get the CD version of this album.
B00E9A656K|5|This is a really fun and challenging game.I decided to get this when I got my kindle fire hd for Christmas.Me and my brother play this five hours a day!I recommend anyone who loves drag racing games should get this.My personal favorite car is the chevrolet camaro zl1.

B004W1GCNC|5|Picks up close to where the original show ended.  If you enjoyed the original program, you will most certainly enjoy this continuing saga.
B00005YXZH|1|hard to believe records companies are spending millons of dollars<BR>to prevent coping this stuff!Not worth the plastic it's burned on
0446615641|5|Another Camel Club winner.
B00132D808|1|After their first effort that was so original and interesting with every track, I didn't think it was possible that they could screw up so monumentally, but they found a way.  This is the exact opposite of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.  No originality, no unique twists on the alternative genre we see today, and aside from 9 in the Afternoon, not one decent track on the whole CD!  I don't know what they were going for, but they had better pull that first attempt out of the trash and revisit those tunes, because this new attempt at a sophomore release misses the mark completely.  I don't write reviews very often, but this one actually is so bad it moved me to do so.  Go back and listen to \\"A Fever...\\" again and forget buying this cd.  Or better yet, wait another month and get the new cd from Jack's Mannequin.
B0083ZRAJS|5|Classic
B004LLDN3A|5|This 1964 Disney masterpiece has it all: great music, great dancing, great acting, good animation, character development, humor, charm, and a unique story. I won't delve into the plot, but rather want to focus on the aforementioned attributes. The film features some of the all-time classic songs, which add warmth to the experience. The acting is superb, with a vivacious Julie Andrews as the perfect choice in her role, as is the charming Dick Van Dyke. The actors in this movie mesh, which generates great character development, thus moving the story along. Mary Poppins is a balanced movie that's anchored by a great and unique story that touches our senses and leaves a lasting impression. A timeless classic that shouldn't be missed!
B00FJ2YTLK|5|This book did not disappoint.<br />I loved it all the way to the end.<br />More excitement and intrigue than the first two books.<br />I really loved all three.
B00IV0LP3M|1|This toy was horrible!  It was very expensive and did absolutely nothing.  Where can I return it?  All of my other amazon purchases were great.  This one was really bad.  Even my two year old granddaughter was unimpressed.
B0052BZ6X8|3|Decent flick.  Nothing I would rush to watch again, yet semi enjoyable.  If I'd paid movie theater prices to see it, I would have been disappointed.  Not worth the theater coin.
B009MCRHH6|5|What a great, fun game this is. I can't believe it's the FAOTD. It's definitely a merry Christmas this year!
B00KZ6WRAA|3|Malfunctionions often
B008UCJ7KO|2|I loved books 1 & 2 of this series but this book was tedious and boring compared to them.  It lacked substance and was drawn out unnecessarily. It felt like a 'filler' book whilst waiting for the next book to actually deliver on the story. I wish the author had stuck to her trilogy as planned and not stretched this series beyond the third book.  I also couldn't connect with the characters this time around as the story felt flat and monotonous. I had to force myself to keep reading and finish the book in the hope it would get better, but sadly it didn't. I don't expect I'll buy the next book. Sorry Sylvia Day, but you've lost a fan.
B00E4W40C4|5|Didn't watch any of the theatrical or original editions but this movie is good & potentially setting up a good X-Men run.
B003O86FMW|5|It was a great book and I recomend you read this so if you get this know it is a good book
B009RX85N0|4|Season one is very different from season two but other than a few weak episodes it was as magical as season one (season one had a few weak episodes too). I'm looking forward to season three, will Niel and Emma find each other again?
B00M8JCW3E|5|this album is great and I enjoy it very much.
1416914307|5|I thoroughly enjoyed what I thought was an ending to the series, but heard City of Fallen Angels is due 2011.  Usually I don't want time to pass so quickly, but I wish I could push FF.  City of Glass was mesmerizing in detail, story telling and Jace was awesome!  He is a great character and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure, love stories, and good tale of demons, vampires, magic and werewolves.
B00BD99JMW|1|I was so disappointed. Loved the first two books but this one fell flat. There was no flow to the story.
6302921384|4|This movie is no doubt one of stallones' best,but its a typical action-adventure.
B00AQ3K8IU|4|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down once I started. It is kind of predictable but definitely worth the read & it has some pretty interesting turn of events that happen that maybe you didn't expect.
0321784421|4|Authors do a great job in making the reading as easy as possible and try to make it enjoyable.<br />Lots of information and url addresses to many other sites to further your educational learning experience
B000031XCR|4|Okay, so I was one of the people who hated Celine Dion.  &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; started to work on me, and I had to admit that I loved that song.  Then I heard All the Way playing in a record store and I remembered how good &quot;Love Can Move Mountains&quot; was.  Next thing  you know, I was hustling to get this CD.  I just wish it had a  few more of her older hits on it, like &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat  Now?&quot;  I just love the new tracks, though!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Love it!
B008Y2FRFO|5|My grandmother loved playing a similar game when she went to Vegas. She got this game on her own Kindle and enjoys it so much I decided to give it a try. So glad I did! Addictive, yes. It is frustrating when you run out of coins, but at higher levels it's not a big deal.
B0073U2F12|5|Fast Delivery Great Movie!
B006LSZECO|3|Liked the final statements of the book better than the movie.
B00122OTQ6|5|If you've been a fan of Genesis for more than three decades, then you may have purchased Duke on vinyl and watched 14 cartoonish men follow each around your turntable in reverse at 33 1/3 rpm.<br /><br />Duke is a masterpiece of songwriting and musicianship, featuring The Story of Albert and hit singles written in 12/8 (Misunderstanding) and multiple time signatures (Turn It On Again).  The trio individually and collectively contributed a winning collection in Duke, which transitioned the band from its prog rock roots into the mainstream (Misunderstanding even made it to AM radio).<br /><br />The band's early 1980's concert opener Behind the Lines, which also opens the album, is followed by fantastic solo contributions including Cul-de-sac and the haunting Heathaze and Guide Vocal by Tony Banks, Man of Our Times and Alone Tonight by Mike Rutherford, and Please Don't Ask by Phil.<br /><br />The penultimate Duke's Travels is a hidden gem, showcasing Phil's thundering drums, wicked guitar riffs by Mike, and the brilliant Tony Banks serving up pure musical nirvana on the keys.<br /><br />The musical journey of Duke is a treat from the opening chord of Behind the Lines until the needle rises off of Duke's End.

B000OLGCI4|5|Go ahead and buy it now.<br /><br />Did I ever see this movie when I was young?  It is so hard to know with these Disney movies as I watch them with my daughter.  Some of the songs seem familiar, but is it from watching the movie?  We only got to see them every couple years or so on the Sunday night movie.<br /><br />This movie, which was released the same year I was born, is much more fresh and young than I am.  First- another Disney remastering where the film is absolutely flawless, crisp, and colorful.  The soundtrack is good as well.<br /><br />As for the film and story and music, this is one of the best from Disney.  Watching Baloo dance and sing the Bare Necessities is so enjoyable for adults and kids.  When Baloo puts on his \\"disguise\\" at the ruins and starts to dance with King Louie, he steals the show.<br /><br />All the songs are great, but my favorite is King Louie's \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\".  If there is one flaw with the whole DVD, it is the music video for that song by a youngish rock band, and it is a bad version.  Louis Prima's original is so good, perhaps nobody could top it, but this isn't even close.  Disney has done much better with some of the extra music videos on the other DVDs.<br /><br />One special touch of all these Disney movies, is compeletely unintentional, is \\"spotting\\" or hearing the voice actors in the various roles in the various movies.  In this one, of course you have Sebastian Cabot, but the one I really love is Sterling Holloway as Kaa the boa.  Holloway a decade later would go on to be Winnie the Pooh and you can always hear him as Pooh, so to hear Pooh's voice come out of the evil Kaa, is just delightful.  (Holloway also was the stork in Dumbo 25 years earlier than Jungle Book).<br /><br />My daughter loves this movie and so do I.
B00FAPF5U0|3|Love this game my kids love it too, we play it on the kindle, my phone, and on the computer on Facebook my only issues are that the kindle app is in need of a MAJOR update. Both the Apple and computer versions have several other features including a daily prize wheel, 500+ regular levels, and a night level section. This app only has the regular levels and doesn't even go as high as the other versions, this is particularly frustrating for me who is currently in the 500 levels. I love the graphics and smoothness of the kindle version just wish it would update so I can play my levels
B00170DEM8|5|One of my all time favorite movies.I like everything about it. I heartily recommend it to everyone.
B0055PSKE8|5|So  great  to  have  this  dictionary  at  my  fingertips  without  needing  to  be  online.
B000FC1HBY|5|Love the book the story every thing about it
B00HCMG6LG|5|This is a challenging but very fun game! I would recommend it to everyone. Plus there is a help button if you get stuck on a level.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|I loved this game sooooo much and It was so addicting and amazing but any time I made major progress it erased all my data. I got so mad that I eventually had to delete it. I'm on the kindle fire so if u r too and the same thing happens to u don't get ur hopes up. Just delete it and get addicted to some other game.
0765325950|1|The world is changing.  Paper books are being replaced by electronic ones.  Why wouldn't they release the kindle version of the book at the same time as the paper one?  The only reason I can think of is to try to make those of us who buy the e-book buy both the paper and electronic ones and steal money from us.  That is not acceptable.  Rather than buying this book I think I will go to my local library and check it out for free.  Congratulations, you now have lost money because you had to be greedy and wait three months for the e version.<br /><br />I encourage everyone to go to a library instead of buying this book.  It just wrong how publishing companies treat us.
B00A0MJA1I|5|I just recently started my blue ray disney DVD collection...great addition. Chrystal clear sounds, great picture a must have for your collection.
B009KS4XRO|5|Love it
0385738781|5|I love this book. The action and suspense is great. It has a mix of sad, happy, and relieving throughout the entire book.
B0013D8LOU|5|This was an excellent adaptation of one of my favorite Stephen Sondheim musicals. I have loved the story of Sweeney Todd ever since I saw the DVD recording of [[ASIN:B0013Z7RUC Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway) (Keepcase)]] starting Angela Lansbury and George Hearn.<br /><br />If anything I think Johnny Depp was a much better Sweeney Todd than Hearn was. As for the part of Mrs. Lovett? Carter and Lansbury both bring something special to the part that I would have a hard time telling you which one I really enjoyed in that part.<br /><br />Sure the movie gets bloody, but come on, this isn't a light hearted Wizard of Oz type musical. It's a story about a man unjustly imprisoned and seeking revenge.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to my family and friends.
B00F8L2VO4|5|There aren't any ads, first of all. I like this, I have been studying French. I don't think this would work for you if you have no experience with the given language. The first 2 levels  so far have been mainly review for me.  I had 2yrs of French in High school and 2 semesters in college.  This was, like, a whole bunch of years ago, but I remember a lot.<br />In any case, if a person never learned any of the language, I don't see how you could pick up the grammar. There isn't really any explanation of the conjugations, gender, etc.<br />My daughter did like it, and she is in her 1st year of Spanish in High school.
B005NFVZTM|5|Awesome! Never disappointed with Xmen for sure! I enjoyed it and was<br />Never board. Buy it for your collection. It's worth the money
0195102681|5|I like the book, it's certainly rigorous and explains the concepts reasonably well, at an advanced level. I have little to add to the other reviewers' comments on that. <br /> <br />I'd like to add that this textbook is definitely the most carefully produced I own. Even though it's in its first ed. there are very few typos. More importantly, the layout is very convincing. Even complex graphs are are clearly and beautifully drawn, the typesetting is 100% consistent throughout the book.  <br /> <br />OK, you might say what the heck? But I regrettably have to admit that I currently spend as much time with \\"MWG\\" as with my girlfriend. So, I learnt to appreciate that it looks as good as she does (in relative terms: for a book compared to other books as her compared to other women, that is). All of you who still remember Greene's 4th ed (the blue letters...) will agree with me that a well-produced book is something to which some attention should be paid!  <br />
B00IMYSCR4|5|Clearly, this movie deserves the Emmys it received! Fine acting and breath-taking special effects. I highly recommend this thrilling film.
B0035LMTZA|5|Great plot, great acting.  Well done movie.  We've watched it twice so far and may watch it again in the future!
B0091REZMW|2|Why? I got my eyes closed! Hahaha!<br /><br />Just kidding. That's an old joke from the Three Stooges. But, after playing this game, it's how I feel. The game itself is fine. Like most other seek/find apps there's plenty of rooms to explore, levels to climb and plots too read. It's fun and stimulating. Yay!<br /><br />Except, the writing, graphics, clues etc., are too small! Even after I enlarged the room, I could barely see anything in order to be able to find it! The wine glass was the size of a toothpick! And, that was after I made the room larger!<br /><br />I know this app can be played on the 'puter, but I use my tablet. Your technical department needs to make adjustments accordingly. I really don't want to have to use my REAL &quot;magnifying glass&quot;, just to play the game.! Hahaha!<br /><br />For now, it's two stars and, unfortunately, I'll be removing the app from my device. I'll keep it in the &quot;cloud&quot;. Who knows? They might just fix it. If so, I'll be right here...waiting! Hahaha!
B0064MPXFA|5|Loved it
B00FAPF5U0|2|It is a fun game but I don't need the aggravation of being timed out of the game unless I pony up money to keep playing.<br />This is not a good move on the part of the distributors - once ;you turn people off with your avarice they stay turned off.
0451160916|5|I read about one book per week and this book was by far the best book I have read.  I put off reading it for years as I have seen the film and didn't think the book would be any different, but oh how wrong was I.<br />This could be one of the only books that has kept me awake all night listening for things that go bump in the night.<br />Very good, I recommend any Stephen King fan to read this NOW.
034580404X|1|I hate to give a bad review on books since I love reading so much, but these books are really bad. They are not well written and very repetitive. The story line is irritating and i find myself skipping through most of it just to get to the end...which I still haven't.
B003XF1XOQ|5|This book was awesome.  Not what I expected from the last book in the series at all after reading the first two.  I still haven't seen the movies, and I am really looking forward to seeing them now.  I don't think the movie will be able to reflect how well these books were written.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is a great game for kids and I even got addicted.
B00A6CCF0K|5|Having seen the \\"Shining\\" it was natural to read the sequel.  I can't say enough but it is a must read for all his fans.
B00N9MQBKY|5|great
B009NPA3Q4|5|I have been fascinated with him since AI.  His CD did not disappoint me<br />I think he is going to be a big star

B00IMZ2PNK|4|Good, fun movie.
B006LR0XLM|5|I was committed to Dropbox long before I bought my Kindle Fire HD. It is an easy-to-use cloud storage system in which the files reside on my computer and work just like other files; they simply sync with other devices. When I wanted to put the app on my Kindle Fire HD, I went to Amazon to get it. When I clicked to purchase, I got a notice that it wasn't available for the Kindle Fire. What!!????!!! I went ahead anyway; I couldn't believe it. Sure enough. It didn't work. Called Amazon Help. No help there. They simply confirmed that it was not available for my device. I finally got on a forum and found out how to get it and now I am a lot happier with the Kindle Fire HD.
B00JB3NUHM|1|I thought the movie was boring and lacked a biblical backbone.. written, produced and directed for Jews and by Jews. Hmmm. And now we see why people have anti-Semitic views these days?! Let's take something that is adorned by a complete faith and change it's meanings and brutally hack the story to fit lengthy time constraints to make money.. not the first time the Jewish have come to doing these types of things.. and then protest being called money-hungry. Seems like a money making scheme to me. Make a movie that Christians are gonna go see about their beloved religious stories, charge the s*** outta them to go see it and then completely rape the original story.. ( higher population numbers=$$$) Some parts of the movie were exciting and thrilling.. The beginning and the end.
B0000028P8|5|THIS ALBUM IS MARIAH CAREY LIVE IN CONCERT.THIS IS REALLY GOOD.I LIKE  &quot;EMOTIONS&quot;,&quot;MAKE IT HAPPEN&quot;,AND &quot;VISON OF  LOVE&quot;.THIS SHOWS HOW SHE CAN SING LIVE AND YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS.
B000O76T8Q|1|Thought it was anamorphic! Thank you guys! Now when will we get the anamorphic version?
B00B2QG3K2|5|My daughter loved it, she is a big fan of Paramore. I do like Paramore too (although I am more the 80's). I like the Autorip and downloading in the kindle fire.
B00A285RC6|4|Adam Braun turned a dream into reality that now touches 1,000's of kids daily. This is a very inspiring story that will motivate you to do something that counts with your life.
B009H5IS1W|5|This is an awesome series. Have now seen them all. So pleased this was an option. Great price and great quality.
0446608955|4|<br />Title: A Walk to Remember <br />Author: Nicholas Sparks <br />Pages: 240 <br />Date Started: 11/4/2004 <br />Date Finished: 12/14/2004 <br /> <br />Annotation:  Every April, when the wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High.  It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister.  A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out.  Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood . . . <br />Author Biography:  Nicholas Charles Sparks was born in Omaha, Nebraska into a family of loving parents and two siblings.  His father, Patrick, mother Jill, sister Danielle, and brother Michael lived together in Fair Oaks, California.  Nicholas grew up to be a very determined and achieving track runner.  He was also successful in his studies.  He majored in Business Finance and graduated with high honors.  He met his wife Catherine on spring break in 1988.  Nicholas began writing and selling books in 1994.  Since then Nicholas Sparks has had eleven very successful novels and will continue to do so in the future. <br />Evaluation:  \\"A Walk to Remember\\" is about teenagers Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter.  Landon grew up being rebellious with his group of friends.  Because of the mistakes the Landon had made, his mother thought it would be a good idea for him to try tobecome student council president. After he broke up with his girlfriend, Landon had to find a new date to take to the homecoming dance.  All of the girls that he would normally consider going with were already being taken, so Landon was forced to ask the only girl left, Jamie Sullivan.  They went to the dance, and surprisingly had a great time.  Landon was confused by his feelings for Jamie and pushed them aside.  One day after school, Jamie called Landon and told him that she needed a favor.  She needed him to be Tom Thorton in her father's Christmas play.  Landon realized that he owed her so he accepted the part.  The play turned out to be a huge success.  From all of the time that he put into the play with Jamie, Landon realized that his feelings for Jamie had grown to be something real.  He had fallen for her.  They started hanging out all the time after school, doing things that Jamie liked such as visiting orphanages and dancing at fancy restaurants.  They had fallen in love.  As they grew closer, Landon began to notice changes in Jamie.  She was always tired and was always getting sick.  It was then the Landon found out that Jamie had leukemia and she was dying.  Landon was crushed.  He knew what he wanted to do so he asked Jamie to marry him.  They got married that summer and shortly before Jamie passed away.  Landon never loved anyone like he loved Jamie.  She had changed his life forever and he would never forget that. <br />   A Walk to Remember is one of my favorite books.  I love how Nicholas Sparks always seems to catch my attention with his romance novels.  This book showed me the true being of love and fate.  Reading this book gave me the chills to see how much true love Landon had for Jamie.  It made me happy to see that Landon could look past Jamie's image at high school and see the real person in Jamie.  The simple risk that Landon took of asking Jamie out on a date made for a complete positive change in his life.  I often wondered throughout thebook what would have happened with Landon's life had he not asked Jamie to the homecoming dance.  I wonder if he would have kept making mistakes with his life or if he would have found peace in himself and in his family.  I definitely thought that A Walk to Remember was well written.  It was the type of book that when you start reading, it is difficult to put down.  <br /> <br />
B00KMX5V8G|4|Love farm saga but can't get it to start. Loading it keeps shutting off now I can finish play what can I do?
B00005JGAF|5|I bought this on vinyl. On tape. On CD. Now I've bought it again on CD -- and the remastering and the bonus tracks are worth every penny I've spent on this title since the '70s.
0385505833|1|Big waste of money and time. Most shallow treatment of a good idea I've seen in a long time. When I was about three-fourths of the way through, I found myself wondering if maybe he knocked it out in about 2 or 3 days. Research pretty much nonexistent. No way this would've ever been published if he wasn't John Grisham. I found several implausibilities and at least one inconsistency that must have been an oversight on Grisham's part. It also contained a few typos, something you wouldn't expect to see in publishing at this level. Seems even the publisher just threw it out there as an afterthought. I want a refund.
B002NXSRX4|1|I'm sorry I couldn't find anything at all to like about this film.  This has to be the absolute King of those blockbuster films that love to hurl all sorts of poorly edited CGI filled action sequences at the viewer and hope that no one will notice the complete lack of coherence, character development or plot.  Yep, this is WORSE than TRANSFORMERS 2, TERMINATOR 4, 2012 and all the rest of the overbudgeted underwhelming nonsense the studios love to crank out.  There just wasn't anything to enjoy here. I loved GI Joe as a kid but this film has no genuine relationship to the GI joe stuff I grew up with.  Thats fine if the film makers had bothered to change it into something thoughtful, interesting or entertaining.  They didn't.  It's just one gigantic incomprehensible action sequence after another and for me, that isn't enough to make a film worthwhile.
B008JGSM6G|5|I love this game! I'll start playing it and become completely engrossed! Is a great way to pass the time.
B009ZZDNT6|2|couldn't figure it out - deleted it<br />the clock was small and I honestly could not firue out how to set the clock or the alarm
B000OVLBF8|4|Unlike the uneven \\"Punisher\\" film and the dismal \\"Fantastic Four\\", Ghost Rider succeeds due to its interesting premise, great casting, great special effects and great villians.     The comic on which the movie is based has gone through alot of changes itself; from a standard superhero-with-a-gimmick story to a Clive Barkerish action/horror graphic novel. Fortunately for the movie audience, the screenwriters chose the latter theme.     This one is well worth your time..
B005LAIIKI|5|This is a great movie and it is so  nice to have tow disc so I can play it on any player
B004I85CY4|5|Great use of the 3D on my tv!
0618526412|3|This book was overall, &quot;Ok&quot;. For most of the beginning, I kept waiting and reading, thinking that it was building up to something. Welllll...it didn't. After about 150 pages, I realized that the point of the novel was just observation, and thinking. McCullers had a few good points, some interesting ideas, but they never went anywhere. It was well written, but I had to force myself to finish it, just so it would not have been a waste of money. Not a bad read if you are just looking for something, but it you want an absorbing page-turner, this is not the book for you.
B002LC2DQ4|5|We kept our old digital camera, and XD memory is no longer available in stores, so we are glad to find it here.
B000YRY7TO|4|The Movie may not remind you of action from Police story series or the Armour of God but yes its worth the watch for the different character chosen by Jackie this time. The Baby is too cute and the movie has certain excellent choreographed stunts and the comedy timing is smooth in all the scenes. This Dragon Dynasty version has an interview of Jackie with run time of almost one hour and the best part is the same has a English Audio too with the print of this edition being far better than the other Rob B Hood version from different distributor versions....... A die hard Jackie Chan fan should purchase a own copy of this special 2 disc edition.
B00A0SQBDM|4|I love that I can play and ask for hints whenever I want. Great when I don't want to think too hard.
B00C1BU7V8|5|Don't remember watching it......
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Great!  Easy and fun!
B000N4SHOE|5|An utterly enchanting story about one of my favorite childhood authors.  It was fascinating to learn of the story behind the story, which was portrayed beautifully by the actors and the location settings.
B00HDMMISA|5|This book is fantastic! As the tension built, I couldn't stop reading. It's an interesting perspective and unusual style of a murder mystery type story; I highly recommend it!
B000002MY3|5|What can I say - it is Alanis Morissette - and she is at her best!  well done and one to keep playing
B0089EHWQE|4|The story was really compelling.  I kept thinking of Christopher Reeve (the movie star) and hoped that our hero would think the same way because I wanted to see the love story develop into fruition.  Both decisions take a lot of courage.
B00DAPOHU6|5|I first heard of Jack Johnson when I saw a video on VH1 from the \\"In Between Dreams\\" album.  I was going into the hospital for hip-replacement surgery in 2006 and wanted to have some good music to listen to so I purchased the CD.  One of my nurses saw that I was listening to Jack Johnson and asked if I had his other CD's.  I said \\"No, I thought he was a new artist.  She burned another CD for me of his previous CDs so I had more music to listen to while in rehab.  When I was fully recovered enough to go to the store on my own, I purchased his first 2 CDs and have continued to buy his music and will continue to do so as long he records music.  \\"Mr. Jack Johnson, keep making great music!\\"
B0040I09RM|5|What's not to love bikes boys tattoos beards action did I mention JACKS OH YEAH LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
B00QW8TYWO|3|Its a never ending Frogger with unlockable animals which you could just as easy pay for instead of unlock via gameplay.  Not ground breaking but a solid game if you have a few spare minutes to kill.
B000GFLE1S|5|The story will stretch your mind. While you are laughing you will recognize the meaning of tolerance.
B00AEFXJ86|5|Not What I Expected But Even Better !
B00G4EXNNM|3|It's good, but kind of boring after the first listen. I'd like to hear more variation from the originals, and more of Norah.
B00JQIPX68|5|Great game for kids.  Reminds me of River Raiders.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|It fine and cool my lil sis always plays it on my tablet it's fun
B0017ZB8M6|5|If you like pop music , this is an A+
0765325950|5|I read A Memory of Light yesterday in pretty much one-sitting. It was quite the experience...and it was quite a fitting ending for an already remarkable series. The action does not really stop throughout the entire book and sometimes it feels a little like a roller-coaster ride, but it was good. It was fun.<br /><br />Part of me is sad that it is all finally over. And it really is the end...there will be no more Wheel of Time books coming out...and the storyline has been wrapped up. However, I feel extremely satisfied with the ending. It was wrapped up beautifully and with style. Yes, there are some questions left unanswered at the end...but then, when aren't there? Some questions are not meant to be answered. Mostly, however, my questions were answered as fully as I wanted them to be.<br /><br />Sanderson took the reigns with the Gathering Storm and is laying them down again after finishing A Memory of Light. He did a marvelous job and I applaud him for his excellent work. This is a series that I cherish and I hope you all get a chance to read the ending. It is worth the journey.
B00LZXOI5E|5|Bright colors. Pieces fit well. Works fine on my KF HD. I would recommend if you enjoy puzzles.
B00BEZTMFY|4|I liked Lord of the Rings better ,but my wife says I should have gave it a five star, but it's a good flick worth seeing
B00K2CHWOI|3|It feels like a mix of the movie Groundhog Day, Alien / Predator, and Independence Day.  So the day just repeat again and again, with some aliens, and you just need to send a bomb into some central place and the whole problem is solved.  The only thing worth watching is Emily Blunt being a tough warrior.
B00AF6MF9I|4|It's fun to play and has great graphics. Easy to understand for most ages too. I don't usually play these type of games, but I am really enjoying this one.
B004FRX0MY|5|Love it
B00006AG5N|5|A great Elvis CD!!! 30 #1 hits all in a row!!! A+!!! Awesome!!!
B00SXK316E|5|Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B000002UAU|3|apparently they were recording this album for 6 months...so you would have expected something truly amazing.but in my opinion it is no where near the best beatles album.abbey road is so much better.the 30 seconds in the middle of \\"a day in the life\\"(p macartney sings) is worth the money on its own.
B007J4T2G8|4|I went to have dinner and drinks with 4 girlfriends and found I could not even join in the conversation at the table.  The reason?  I had not read Fifty Shades of Grey.  So, I just started book 3.  I will have to admit that I have enjoyed it.  Oh La La, Mr. Grey!
B003F3FJQO|5|This book was awesome that's all I can say... I'm obsessed with this series. It's awesome I need the third book like right now
B006Z9SP3E|5|This rating is chosen as Jeffery Archer books are very addictive and a complusive read.  Looking forward to next release.
B00CATSONE|5|This was a Good quick read about Tesla, his inventions and his misfortune.  Strongly recommend to anyone who is interested in Tesla.
B00005JLK1|3|After watching this movie I went to the documentary featurette and I was summarily dumbfounded to hear every cast member and producer, even the director, absolutely convinced that they were making a genuinely scary movie.  Well, the information is in...this movie is not scary at all.  The times when there is potential for a good fright the music swells prematurely or the camera movement changes slightly too soon warning the viewer that something is about to startle you.  Therefore, the moments are not startling.  The upsides to this film are that there are some decent visual effects and outstanding makeup effects that are effectively gory.  Many people, and many of the characters, die in interesting ways.  The gore factor in this film is top-notch!  The cast is also surprisingly good given they have yet another ghost story to inhabit; but they all come across as human, not super-human; although there is a Ripley-type lead character that will surely survive.  There is no telling which of the remaining characters will survive.  This movie is simply okay, invoking frequent cringes at all the gore but never ever an instance where the viewer is clutching at somebody else for security, being frightened in any way.  I recommend this film as a rental only, unless gory movies are your thing.
B00000G3PA|5|The movie Armageddon is about a group of NASA trained astronauts who have to go on a dangerous mission to help save the world. They have to venture out into space so they can land on an asteroid the size of Texas.  Their mission is to drill a very large hole so they can blow it up before it reaches Earth.  But no only does it have alot of action it also is a serious tear jerker.  It made me cry at least 4 different times.  The sad parts don't over throw the humorous parts.  Althought the whole story plot may be a bit of a stretch the graphics and actors help to make it more believable.  Bruce Willis as in all of his other movies was top notch and awesome' while Ben Affleck wasn't at his best.  The soundtrack also kept your foot taping, some songs by Aerosmith.  This is by far my absolute favorite movie; it is timeless and will keep making people awe for years.
B0071DJZZA|5|I enjoyed this very much.  There was a lot of information that was left out of the movie.  A must for those who thought something was lacking from the movie.
B002MQYOFW|2|This will probably be well received by someone in Jr. High.  Even then, it is more like a comic book than a real novel.
B00CH26TL8|5|This is so fun. The only problem is is I can't figure out how to unlock eternal isles. Maybe I haven't gotten far enough. I am on lvl. 56. I also love how you can get the witch of precision because that can really help you complete some levels. Another e r thing that is cool is that it lets you try a wish when you unlock it. This is the best game ever.
0061649694|4|I had never heard of Coraline until I read about it on a book blog.  I borrowed it from my local library and devoured it in about 2 hours.  Neil Gaiman, who I've since come to appreciate in the form of his adult novel American Gods, writes a strange little tale of the headstrong and clever Coraline and her adventures \\"through the looking glass.\\"  This book is genuinely creepy and all that business about the imposter parents having buttons for eyes and wanting to sew buttons on Coraline's eyes with a sharp needle and some thread not only makes my eyes water, but is creeping me out even as I type this.     Coraline is a quick read wonderfully rich and textured fairy tale with a dark underbelly. *insert shudder here*  I'm looking forward to the movie, but be sure to read the book before you see the movie...especially if you have small children!
B0055S348W|5|I have said in previous reviews,I think,,along with Star Print,this is excellent for your Kindle,,easy download,,easy install,,easy to use,,<br />I leave this one on my carousel,,just one touch and excellent resolution,,no driver installations,,no pre sets,!!no BS,,Just download and print,,this is the one I prefer,,no wasted time,,just a great printer app.
B00G0OHMUG|5|The transfer is great, the sounds are loud and the 3D is nice. A great update to a classic action flick.<br /><br />There are a few quarks with the transfer like Dillon looking like a CGI character in the opening scene with him and a few times some of the actors look like they are standing in front of a greens screen (twice) but apart from that, everything else is solid.<br /><br />No real need to breakdown the film. It's Predator! I always enjoy more of a POP in the 3D but aside from the personal preference that's lacking, the depth is very nice.
B001UV4XJ2|5|Very nice.  Happy with my purchase.  Would recommend it.
B00BB8SKPW|3|Movie starts with full frontal nudity for about 5 min.<br />Filthy language through-out the whole movie.<br />All the airplane action is at the beginning.<br />But it does show what addiction does to a person.<br />It shows what denial does to a person.<br />The message is a 5*  but the movie is a 1* .
B000SC245E|5|Factory - OEM product which is what I needed.
B008Y78AO4|3|The first movie was much more creative. Volume 2 finishes the story but leaves you wanting more from Terantino
B008HK3XU4|4|Kindle fits in securely.  Method of propping Kindle up at an angle works well in landscape view (as advertised) but doesn't have that option in portrait.  The texturing is only on one side of the case.  The only things I don't like may be more of an issue with the Kindle design.  You need to remove the Kindle or leave the case open to charge because the power jack is on the inside fold of the case.  The case is designed to have the camera to your right, but some apps that only display in portrait mode require you to hold the case &#34;upside down&#34;.  I have no regrets about this purchase.
B003YVLC18|5|Love this version of the Cinderella story. Have watched several times.
B00DEG4Z1W|3|Ok its fun but its just like one of those games on friv. Would I keep it, NO! Not worth keeping but its fun.
B00DP8XSQ2|1|Anti-virus on phone flagged this program, would not allow installation due to viruses and permission settings. Not installing and will be deleting from my Amazon account totally.
0452289963|2|For some it may help, but for me I didn't agree with what was written.  But hey try it.  You may like it!
B000003TAL|5|There is a reason that my name is cynic-youth. I adopted this name out of shame, shame for doubting the greatness of Daydream Nation.  <br />When I first heard Sonic Youth, it was on Murray Street, an album that I enjoyed for a while, then filed away. I found its grooves pleasant, its guitars unorthodox, and its songs completely different from everything else on my shelf. When I was told by a respected friend to check out SY's 'best' album, \\"Daydream Nation\\", I bought it without hesitation.  <br />For a period of weeks, I hated this album. After the rollicking opener, \\"Teenage Riot\\", I found no reason to stick around. The songs had no substance or structure; they floated and melted away without impact or importance. I felt like a fool for having wasted ten dollars on a worthless album. <br />How wrong I was. <br />I finished listening to Pink Floyd one day and began looking around for something else to explore. Lo and behold, the shelf held the detestable \\"Daydream Nation\\". I listened again out of morbid curiosity. <br />It seemed like an entirely new album a few hours later. I jumped around the album, hearing snippets of songs and soundscapes, then settled back to experience it all at once. <br />When the second chorus of \\"Silver Rocket\\" came around, I expected a solo or instrumental break, perhaps a hip little twiddling guitar duel or drum break. What I felt drill a hole into my brain was pure insanity. The screech and hum of lightning and thunder rolling through my head, smashes of the cymbals punctuating an angry drone, a wash of screaming sonic love. I backtracked to the break again, then again. What I felt was pure joy, ecstacy; never before had a song sucker-punched me in the face and made me like it. Delving deeper, I discovered the unearthly distortion-drenched soundscape of \\"The Sprawl\\", the harmonic twang of \\"Hey Joni\\", and the blown-amp faux-thunder of \\"Providence\\". Each song building up to the inevitable conclusion, a cohesive message of discontent andhope within a daydream. For a period of two years, I listened to this album once nearly every day; I listened to nothing else. It withstood all my scrutiny, my misgivings, my ignorance. Now, I see it as it truly is: one of the greatest albums of all time, a feedback symphony, a work of art and noise blended to become a musical dream. This is my favorite album of all time. Let it become yours, too.
B007KUFDBY|5|SMOOTH!!!
B00JOT3HQ2|4|This games is very Hard but very fun to say, the game also has a great soundtrack!
B004GYY714|2|Can't get it to work. Keeps making me sign up again. Phoooey,
B006LSZECO|5|Better than the movie
0307596885|5|Complex characters slowly revealed, allowing the reader to participate. Aways original and suprising.  Munro's writing is so beautiful, I often re-read each sentence simply to savor HOW she says what she's saying, on many levels
B00KFUU6H2|5|Excellent series of our country beginnings!
B00DCX08MW|5|As I a cancer patient and have to avoid the sun as much as possible, this is an excellent way to enjoy flying airplanes for me.  It is also a great pass time.
B005ZOBNOI|3|Sweet book. Appropriate for adolescents and young adults.
B00AKKGX4W|2|I don't care if I sound like an immature high schooler, the love scenes in this book were hilarious, and I was cracking up the whole time I tried to read through them. Other than that, it was pretty boring. The hero did not appeal to me at all, and the heroine became extremely annoying. Too angsty and whiney for me.
B00J8CG6KE|1|Could not get through it.  Waaaay too much use of the F word and redundant scenes of sex and drug use.  Not how I want to spend 3 hours.
B0095ZQ36G|5|This is an amazing story and I always appreciate examples that demonstrate the best of human nature.  The split second decision for good that changed so many lives.  Awesome!
B00DPM7TIG|2|thought it would never end.  Not very inspiring
B00I6IKSZ0|5|It's really fun and it's mine craft plus shooting games take it from me XD
0385344430|4|Another good book in the series.  I always enjoy Gabaldon even when she is stuffing the story with filler stories to pad the size of the book.  I could see this main story continuing through another couple of books if the author and the readers keep their interest.  Several twists and turns occur that spark new interests.  Gabaldon can't help herself when she keeps adding a bit of Homosexual theme undercurrents at times.  I over look this for the content of the whole.  Readers in general will gain much more from reading the first book, Outlander, and continuing through the series.  If you have the stamina.
B00GIGGS6A|5|Love it! I have been using for 3 months now and it's great! I was a little concerned when I bought because being an &#34;off brand&#34; compared to wacom but was on a budget and I'm so happy I ordered it. I didn't have any problems installing it at all and no compatibility issues. Sometimes though after hours of use the short keys would stop workimg but the tablet and pen still work I just restart the computer and it fixes the issue. I also love that it feels like drawing on paper. Happily surprised!
B00EFWU91E|4|I found this book fascinating. All fell into place and I loved it, though life is not always so accommodating. Happy it was more than a trilogy, just long enough to keep the story line interesting and not extend it with nothing to add to the story and it's characters.<br /><br />Liked the link, in the end, with the Infernal Devices series. I would recommend the series to anyone who enjoys a good story with adventure and a love stories.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the new series, as maybe we meet the characters again or meet a new generation of shadowhunters.
B0013FNC38|5|I just discovered Jason Mraz a couple of months ago.  I really enjoy his music.  It's fresh and upbeat !!
B006VRDZ44|5|Can't get enough of this series, compelling and very well written, comparable quality to Sopranos and Deadwood.
B0067Q42BY|4|I just enjoy the game. The game play is fun and relatively easy to grasp. Nothing too challenging for most
B000JBWWRY|5|I ordered it, it shipped the next day and I got it the following day.  After having trouble with a previous Peter Pan I bought, this was a breath of fresh air!  Thank you!
B0086700CM|5|best game on the kindle fire i would have bought it if it costed 5 99 good game awsome game
B000GPIPVU|3|I loved RL`s first cd , Trouble , I was seriously excited awaiting his new disc. What a major disappointment . The songs themselves are not as strong as the first effort , and the completely over-wrought production on many of the tunes made at least half of this cd cringe-worthy. You don`t mix the strings equal or louder than the vocals . RL`s softer vocal delivery on this disc is not in any way enhanced by the production values chosen. I think that anyone would agree that a voice like RL`s is so unique that less is certainly more , and he doesn`t need to flounder around in the mess that half of this cd is.

B0088ETCHW|5|This is an excellent book! I have this book on Kindle and find it to be invaluable. It's very well written, very insightful, and the authors  do an excellent job of getting the point across regardless of your  experience level swimming.<br /><br />Even though the title mentions coaching system, this book is a really good reference/instruction guide for swimmers of any level and anybody that's looking  to improve for swim skills for pool or open water. Lots of well done illustrations and clearly written.<br /><br />I have been a big fan of the swim smooth approach to swimming. I think this is one of their best efforts yet. Highly recommend this book to swimmers and/or triathletes.

630516603X|5|\\"Feet of Flames\\" truly is the best dance show ever done! Michael Flatley sure knows how to do it right...the music, sets, costumes, lights...and of course the dancing. His talent and artistic sense shine through every moment. Everything is superb...an immense feast for the senses!<br />The best thing with the DVD version is that it includes a 60-minute (or so) &quot;making of&quot; feature with interviews and extra footage of the show!  Also included is a biography detailing Michael Flatley's career.<br />If you are deciding on whether to buy Feet of Flames or Lord of the Dance, you'd probably want to choose this one instead.  Feet of Flames is basically the same as Lord of the Dance in the sense of storyline, however there are additional dances, a special flute solo performed my Michael Flatley himself, different &amp; better costuming and the camera work is a whole lot better! The one thing I did not like about Lord of the Dance was the bad editing/camera work.  The scenes cut away much too quickly. I owe both LOTD and FOF and I've found it more enjoyable to watch FOF purely for this reason. With Feet of Flames you get lots of different angles and extended views. Overall it's a much better put-together show. <br />If you're looking for traditional Irish dance, this shouldn't disappoint you either.  Sure, it has modernized the idea of traditional dance and it is a couple of steps up from Riverdance but that's what makes it fun! It's so modern and exciting yet it still gives you that feel of deep-rooted Irish tradition.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|its a great game if you get it you will get addicted to it! the best game ever I love it!
B00000I8BX|5|ive recently got a ton of albums and while listening to them 3 stood out. sinner by dp, machine by static-x, and obsolete by ff. as i looked at the tracks EDGECRUSHER caught my eye. i love the remix so i put it on and realized THIS IS THE BEST SONG OF THE CENTURY LIKE NOTHING ANYONES HEARD BEFORE, now the remix soundeds demented. another thing cool about obsolete is if u look in the book, theres a story that includes the songs, for example \\"EDGECRUSHER stops in an abandoned building to rest himself. as he falls to sleep on a cold, flat floor, he repeats the ame words that he does every night\\" then its the lyrics for descent. buy this cd the songs will grow on you and eat u.
B0060AY85C|4|My book club reviews books for other book clubs in the network on a scale of 1-6, and we gave it a 5. We agreed it wasn't Toni Morrison's best, but it was an interesting book to discuss. Some of us liked it and others didn't, but after discussion and the deeper understanding that results, we all agreed it was worth reading and we enjoyed talking about it.

B003O86FMW|5|This is the best book ever . It is crazy! If you liked the hunger games you are going to like this!
B005ZOBNOI|5|I haven't seen the movie that is so popular, based on this book. I don't want to ruin what for me was a coming of age story that finally didn't have to be a dystopian, violence-filled, sex-teasing yet inauthentic super drama written to become a movie. The narrator's cynicism and surprised tenderness that are happening within are the tastiest part of this novel. I can't see how that would be translated well on the big screen.<br />For me the take aways on the loving time we spend, and how we choose to spend it, and the well-writtend dialogue made this book a winner.
B00DVKOYBM|5|This is a great little app, it is pay to play, but a little skill makes money superfluous.
B008JFUO4U|5|A really great movie and incredible special effects.  This was my first opportunity to view a Blu-Ray DVD on my HD TV, and it was more than I expected.
B00AP9RQE4|5|This is the latest in the Vorkosigan Saga.  It has humor, surprises, wonderful characters, an engaging story.  If you've read any of Ms. Bujold's other books, you won't be disappointed in this one!
B0094M2Z9O|5|AWESOME movie.lots of good acting and action. I like any kind of war movie. the movie is almost 3 hrs long so make a big batch of popcorn
B00BAXFECK|5|Extremely well written. Worth the many many pages (it's a long one!) interesting, twisty plot. A bit dark at times though...
B007KQ6XYY|4|I did like the game. It was fun but can be annoying due to some of the timing aspects. It was worth the money.
B005ETA5K2|1|Installed driver/utility.  Driver/utility was NOT what was on the CD.  Figured out how to install it and it worked.  Saw 17 stations and connected to one marked &#34;48%&#34; on the utility's list.  It worked.  Left it sit, connected, as I did other things.  Somewhere around 40 minutes later, looked at utility screen as unit was no longer connected to anything.  Tried everything, no change.  Returned to Amazon for refund.  Searched Google for others with similar results.  I'm not alone in my observations.  Something's bad wrong with NHR.  Ordered Etekcity 300M to try that.  Amazon makes defect returns so easy....thanks.
B007PKSN6Q|4|Love it
B0098VKIRC|4|Great card, runs most games on max, i had no problems running Arma 3 on maximum graphics with no lag.
B00D2K40WY|4|The game is really cool. My daughter enjoys designing outfits and doing makeup and hair. I didn't think it was going to be this good.

B005CM9DX6|4|Opeth's new album is not for everyone... Opeth as a band has always been that way, but it is especially true for this album. Mikael Akerfeldt has expressed dissatisfaction with the contemporary heavy metal scene, which has lead him to the conclusion that Opeth should abandon it altogether. The result of this thought process is Heritage... An album that, although not one of my all-time favorites, I found to be thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />I'll admit I wasn't fully convinced of how good this album was until just recently. I got this album as a Christmas present from my sister, so I have had it for a couple months. I've listened to it a couple times in that time span... The first time I listened to it I was at work, which, in retrospect, was not a good idea, because I was too busy ACTUALLY WORKING and didn't really have time to properly evaluate it. I listened to it a couple more times after that in the following months but eventually wrote off the new direction taken in this album as just not my thing... My initial rating on I-Tunes was a 3 out of 5.<br /><br />But a couple things happened between then and now that changed my mind.<br /><br />First: I saw them live. I had to accept the fact that the new album was going to make up most of the set list. When they played the new songs I enjoyed them more than I remembered. Also, they wrapped up the concert with Demon of the Fall and The Grand Conjuration, proving they could still do the heavy songs and keeping everyone satisfied.<br /><br />Second: Recently, my respect for Mikael Akerfeldt and his reasons for making this album has skyrocketed. I love metal, but I also understand his exhaustion with it's elitist fans. And when you're in a creative career like making music, I don't think you should be confined to working in a specific genre if you don't want to. Think about it... If someone forced you into doing a job you don't want to do, wouldn't you be miserable? Plus, think about the quality factor... If he wrote adeath metal album just because some of his fans won't accept Opeth any other way, would it have been any good? His heart wouldn't have been in it. It's better to turn out a quality album that's polarizing to some than to put out a safe, but crappy album. Also, after discovering Opeth and listening to all their material, without knowing anything about Mikael, I assumed he was a somber and serious person, just like his music. But I found out... The guy has a sense of humor. The first time I got a sense of this is when I stumbled across an interview with him where he talked about played Angry Birds on the toilet. I also got a pretty good taste of it at the live show I went to. Mikael has a great stage presence in general... He keeps the segments between the songs interesting, cracking jokes and giving fun facts, asking trivia.<br /><br />Finally: I had been thinking about branching out anyway. Like I said, I love metal, it always has been, and probably always will be, my favorite genre. But at the same time, I've heard about all the different varieties of growls, screams, shrieks, guitar riffs and blast beats that there are. I want to expand my palette a little bit... That being said, my current problem in experimenting is getting past the album art from different genres... I kind of look at them and my mind kind of automatically goes \\"THAT ALBUM ART ISN'T METAL!!!\\".<br /><br />So, I came back to Heritage with an open mind. And, lo and behold, I like it. It's still not my favorite album of theirs, but there are plenty of good songs and moments on it. You can recognize the sound as Opeth, but at the same time, it's like nothing else you've ever heard and full of unique things. I've spent so much time explaining why I opened up to it, so I think I'm just going to end with my 4 favorite tracks, a fun fact, and some advice to people who don't like this album.<br /><br />(In no particular order)<br /><br />1.Heritage<br />2.The Devil's Orchard<br />3.Famine<br />4.The Line's in my Hand<br /><br />Fun fact: This is only the third Opeth album to not have any 10+ minute songs. To put that into context, this is their 10th album.<br /><br />Advice for people who don't like Heritage: Check out Bloodbath, the death metal super-group that Mikael was involved with for a couple of years. They only came out with a couple albums, but they more than make up for the lack of brutality in this album.
B0051MKNV8|5|I LOVE that this film really explores the possibilities of what could be done by a person who is \\"given\\" the gift of genius!  Bradley Cooper is Eddie who gets his hands on a stash of a super secret drug that unlocks your mind's full potential.  He writes a best seller in four days, he learns foreign languages, advanced mathematics, economics and finally the concepts of global finance and makes a fortune.  BUT, he runs out of the drug.  He owes a loan shark money, but the loan shark isn't just satisfied with money anymore.  This movie is so well-written and has jaw-dropping twists that you begin to think maybe the writers were on this drug!  Completely fascinating look at human intelligence and human nature plus excellent writing and dialogue!  I highly recommend this movie!

B004Q7DQLS|5|Forty + people have already said it, so I'll just say it again.  It's a wonderful book and I can't wait to read the next in the series.  I now have another 'favorite' author.<br /><br />It met my 5 star criteria-<br />I read it in one sitting, immediately re-read my favorite portions, told friends about it, continued thinking about it and re-read the book.<br /><br />It's sweet book, even with dark characters and subjects but the juxtaposition between the dark and light in is the joy of the story.  Reads more like an adult fairy tale than a PNR, so even those who are wary or weary of vampires and werewolves would find a delightful read in this book.  I won't retell what everyone else has told other than it's a book that leaves you happier for having read it....so read it.<br /><br />Please ;)
B006OOHYIC|5|Quell part II, just as addicting as the original Quell. With the same calming music, worth it just for the music, from the original.<br />Definitely a must as a FAOTD.

1577314808|1|Recently, I realized that I spend a lot of time thinking of the past and reliving arguments in my mind or focusing on the future and anticipating problems and how I would handle them. I was getting myself worked up all the time and stressing myself out. I wanted to learn more about how to just relax and focus on the present.<br /><br />The first 50 or so page of the book talk about how important it is to focus on the present. I completely agree with that. But then after that, it keeps talking in circles and using vague terms saying the same things. I didn't find anything in there that helped me practice to focus on the present.<br /><br />I am an engineering and science type person. I am not superstitious nor do I believe in psychics, ghosts or anything otherworldly. Ultimately, that's why I couldn't get into this book even though I really tried to. Once I got to about page 100, I stopped reading and just glanced at the rest of the book to see if there was anything that would be more helpful to me. I didn't find anything.<br /><br />To me, a better book about having your brain learn new things, a more science based and factual book which is more my style is \\"The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science\\" by Norman Doidge.
B00008BLB8|5|CAUGHT IN THE ACT, Grand Funk Railroad's final album for Capitol, is a great live album showing a great rock & roll band going down fighting (they would break up the following year). The only flaw is that it lacks the opening song from shows performed on the 1975 tour, \\"Are You Ready?\\", in order to keep it to a single CD. Nevertheless, you shouldn't pass this one up.
B004GUSG4M|5|Excellent, twisty and surprising. Read the book before you see the movie!
B000002PB2|3|\\"Dawn Patrol\\" was Night Ranger's debut album, released in 1982 was a great rock record in the day, but for me it hasn't aged well.  This sounded good when I was 22, but now at 51, some of these songs don't click anymore.  The songs that still do it for me are:  \\"Don't Tell Me You Love Me\\" #40 hot 100 and #4 mainstream rock, still a smoking' hot number.  \\"Sing Me Away\\" #54 hot 100, \\"Eddie's coming Out Tonight\\" and \\"Night Ranger\\".  The rest of the disc has gone flat for me now.
B00006AW2L|5|The Rolling Stones' Aftermath was quite a big deal back in 1966 when it was first released. Their first album in stereo, it featured experimental instrumentation and arrangements, all songs were Jagger/Richards compositions (for the first time) and it included a #1 hit single with Paint It Black. It just got pushed to the back of the room when The Beach Boys released [[ASIN:B000002UDV Pet Sounds]] and The Beatles followed with [[ASIN:B000002UAU Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] the next year. And when the Stones themselves released their classic [[ASIN:B000003BEM Beggars Banquet]] album in 1968, Aftermath suddenly seemed like old news. It still doesn't take away the fact that Aftermath is the Stones' best early (pre-Beggars Banquet) album, and one of my personal all-time favorites from the band.<br /><br />It opens with a total classic, Paint It Black. Not many songs dare to go where this one does, into the bleak and dangerous world of depression. With an Indian beat that's augmented by Brian Jones playing the sitar, the song rocks in and out of two different formats while Mick Jagger sings of living in hopelessness.<br /><br />Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts<br />It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black<br /><br />Stupid Girl is a mod/hip London scene groupie put-down, and the refined Lady Jane shows an uncharacteristically disciplined side of the band (Brian plays the harpsichord). The marimba (Brian again) and guitar rock Under My Thumb is a classic that's still playing on classic rock radio stations today, and is one of the Stones' greatest songs. Kinda hard to resist the get-even politics, isn't it?<br /><br />Under my thumb<br />The girl who once had me down<br />Under my thumb<br />The girl who once pushed me around<br /><br />The slide guitar blues of Doncha Bother Me is a real winner, and then they go bluesy country with acoustic guitars and a harmonica on High And Dry. Keith Richards shows off some nice guitar work on both. Flight 505 has an old-timey piano intro that gives way to a laid-back rock n' harmony exercise, and It's Not Easy is an irrestible toe-tapping Chuck Berry sounding rocker. I Am Waiting is a strange and hypnotic bit of country psychedelia that features the omnipotent Brian Jones on the dulcimer.<br /><br />The album closes with Going Home, an eleven minute blues epic that starts out innocently enough, but then embarks on a dark, sexual and shamanistic trip into the unknown night. Mick Jagger's sensual vocal improvisations and spirit channeling over a heavy bass and harmonica blues jam won't appeal to the more tidy and polished Stones fans, but it's quite a fascinating piece of work.<br /><br />Bottom line, Aftermath is an essential part of The Rolling Stones catalog and a top-notch Rolling Stones production.

B009WO7NQO|5|Love it and challenging. The graphics are incredible and I find myself coming back to this Angry Birds more than the others.  Lots of levels!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I was disappointed by the number of characters lost in this season, but the story line was awesome! The Dowager Countess is always a great comic relief, and the introduction to the other grandmother made things interesting.  I also loved the transition into the 20's with jazz music and flapper outfits.
B000FA5TTW|5|Susie Salmon was murdered when she was fourteen years old. She is also the narrator of this book. Susie watches family and friends from her heaven. Susie describes how her murder affected her family and friends. She tells about her murderer, and what might have led him to his destructive way of life. Susie also expresses the beauty and joy of human existence. As her story unfurls, we learn more about Susie and her community. We are also reminded of the beauty of everyday life.<br /><br />This book truly deserves more stars than I can give it here. Written in a down-to-earth manner, the human condition is examined. The characters are real and the settings vivid. This book is moving and utterly unforgettable!
B000WAEK0E|5|I have been listening to Van Morrison since the early '70s.  I even saw him in 1973 at the San Diego Sports Arena.  Many of these wonderful songs bring back memories of high school and college.

B00005JNS0|3|Of all the movies Pixar has made this one left me the least amused once I left the theatre.  There's nothing wrong with it and it is cute (but not really funny).  The soundtrack is great for the movie but it's pretty cliche.    The soundtrack in particular does not hold a candle to the ones Randy Newman made for the Toy Story movies.  \\"Life is a Highway\\" rocks out and starts the movie with a serious bang, but my 6 year old thought it was too loud.  A lot of little kids were holding their ears at the start of the movie.   <br /> <br />The plot is entertaining but it doesn't really function on that \\"next level\\" that many of the Pixar movies do.  And it is impossible not to remember \\"Doc Hollywood\\" with Michael J. Fox and think Fox would not have been better than Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen. <br /> <br />I guess I think Monsters, Inc. and the Toy Story movies were much better than this one because they created characters that expanded out of the worlds of children.  Also, Monster, Inc. and Finding Nemo both talk to the adults in the audience about parenting while entertaining the kids you went with to the movie.  It's just genius that they can pull that off.  I don't see Cars trying to pull off anything so admirable, heck, it doesn't even function on a level other than the one the kids are watching, too.  I admit there is a nostalgia thing going that kids might not quite understand but it is an upfront part of the movie plot.  The nostalgia gets a little drippy too and probably takes aim at grandparents more than 35-year-old parents because it is all about \\"life before the interstate\\" which was created in the late 50's early 60's...
0316666343|5|Rich, well-drawn, complete characters, a moving, emotional plot, and  narrator that grips you and won't let go. These are my initial reactions to Alice Sebold's newest offering, \\"The Lovely Bones\\".<br />Much has been said about the plot, in fact, too much has been revealed. The narrator of the book, a young girl named Susie, is brutally murdered and tells her family's story from Heaven, a profoundly unique point of view to tell this story. Susie is very much a middle school girl, and her doubts and fears ,and essential innocence serve this story very well. The different events spell out after her death, as you see her family seize the immediacy of her death and then force to deal with its quiet horror for years afterward.<br />I can appreciate some people's dissatisfaction with a certain plot device, but taken within the whole context of the story, it worked well for me. In fact, this isn't a story that solely relies on plot to move forward, but the rich characters that you come to love. This books unfurls before you like a rich quilt, and scene after scene builds a quiet sense of beauty, moreso than the last one, so that by the time the book is finished, you are sorry to let it go.<br />Letting go is a central theme in this book, and thanks to Alice Sebold, it has been explored in a truly unique way. Ignore the naysayers of the book... read this in the quiet of your life, and appreciate well crafted writing at its finest.

B0052RDHTM|2|Good story but too long.  Interesting characters, but too much detail on WW1.  It felt more like a history book in places.
B006H8BIIM|2|This is a good looking game! The HD graphics are top notch and look very smooth on my Tablets.<br /><br />The game makes a reasonable attempt at a plot with a fairly predictable,yet, reasonably engaging story about aliens attacking. Nothing groundbreaking, but , still better than no storyline.<br /><br />The gameplay is fairly bland. The basic, ultra-repetitive &quot;Tower Defense&quot; game mechanic that drives this game is exactly what you would expect from this kind of game. Events transpire a little too slowly in the game for it to ever feelexciting,however,the thin plotline and better than average graphics are enough incentive to drive a player to complete the game.<br /><br />This would be a solid 4 star game were it not for the integrated IAP, which certainly does not belong in a paid app,but,also would utterly nullify any challenge or enjoyment the game might offer if purchased.<br /><br />The IAP garbage that this greedy scumbag double-dipper of a developer has integrated into this otherwise decent game does NOT sell anything that cannot be earned through gameplay, and the game is not balanced in a way that tries to force the user to commit IAP, so, it is not gamebreaking.<br /><br />4 stars for graphics,  gameplay,  sound ,story and fun factor.<br /><br />-2 Stars for integrated IAP ripoff scam

The characters, the scenery, the music, even the dialogue is mythical - everyday people just don't talk like the main characters talk in this story - it is more like poetry. Early in the film, Harmonica says \\"I saw three dusters (overcoats) like that earlier today. Inside the dusters were three men. Inside the men were three bullets.\\" Or, toward the end of the film, Harmonica says \\"So, Frank, you found out that you're not a businessman after all.\\" Frank shakes his head, \\"Just a man,\\" he replies.\\"An ancient race,\\" says Harmonica, nodding.  Similar to one of my favorite books, the Lord of the Rings, I am drawn back to this film every few years for another visit.
B0000542DH|4|This review is partly in reponse to the review by \\"Technopagan.\\" <br /> <br />The first DVD release (2000) of Natural Born Killers is in the original theatrical aspect ratio.  The problem with the original DVD release is that it is not enhanced for widescreen TVs (i.e., anamorphic).  This means the film was encoded on the DVD to display within a 4:3 shape using letterboxing on the top and bottom to preserve the proper aspect ratio of the film.   <br /> <br />(Sidenote: That does NOT mean it is a full-frame version with the top and bottom cut off to fake a widescreen image. That is an entirely different issue misunderstood by consumers who don't understand the way movies are filmed.) <br /> <br />Non-anamorphic DVDs appear fine on a regular TV, but they were not designed with widescreen TVs in mind.   They appear \\"stretched\\" horizontally.  Most widescreen TVs have modes to squish or stretch the image into the proper shape, but the results are never satisfying. <br /> <br />In the early days of DVD, non-anamorphic DVDs were common since consumers did not yet have widescreen TVs.   I know this because I've had a DVD player since late 1997 and a widescreen display since 2003.  Anyone who buys a widescreen TV will soon discover a few of these \\"not enhanced for 16x9 displays\\" DVDs in their existing collection. <br /> <br />By the time Natural Born Killers (NBK) was finally released on DVD in 2000, it was inexcusable to make it non-anamorphic.  To add injury to insult, it was released again almost exactly a year later as part of the \\"Oliver Stone Collection\\" and enhanced for widescreen TVs.  My only conclusion is that they knew they would re-release it and wanted to give people even more reason to buy (or rebuy) the newer disc.  <br /> <br />Indeed, the \\"The Oliver Stone Collection\\" release is the version you should buy, especially if you have a widescreen TV or plan to get one eventually. <br /> <br />In sum, in both versions you see the film as it was shown in the theater.  The only problem is that the first release was not designed with widescreen TVs in mind.

1932100660|2|DISCLAIMER ADDED: AFTER FURTHER RESEARCH I NO LONGER CONDONE THE USE OF RAW DAIRY PRODUCTS. Please do not feed your family or self raw dairy until you have visited [...]!!! Some of the incidents listed as \\"illnesses\\" become horrible, tragic life long struggles for the victims. I AM STILL A BIG PROPONENT OF WESTON PRICE BUT HAVE FALLEN OFF THE RAW DAIRY BANDWAGON. WEBSITE AFTER WEBSITE INSISTS THAT RAW DAIRY IS HEALTHY BUT WHEN I FINALLY DID MY RESEARCH I WAS HORRIFIED. THE VERY REASON FOR PASTEURIZATION LAWS WERE THE HIGH INFANT MORTALITY RATES CAUSED BY VARIOUS DISEASE TRANSMITTED VIA RAW MILK. IN NYC IN 1914 1/4 OF LIVE BIRTHS DIED FROM A TYPHOID OUTBREAK TRACED TO UNPASTEURIZED MILK. YES, PASTEURIZATION IS A COMPROMISE. IT DOES DESTROY ENZYMES AND SOME NUTRIENTS AND MAY EVEN MAKE MILK MORE DIFFICULT TO DIGEST BUT IT MAY EVEN BE THAT THE OVERUSE OF ANTIBIOTICS HAS CREATED SUPER ECOLI THAT REQUIRES PASTEURIZATION. Seems to me that the answer is to use pasteurized dairy but drink buttermilk in place of regular milk and consume yogurt and cheeses in place of drinking milk. The cultures used to make these products partially predigest the dairy AND replace the enzymes with new ones. I still want to have my own dairy goats raised on green pasture but I will be milking them into a pan and taking the pan directly to the stove to heat to 160 degrees (more like 180 after what I've seen!)<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: Wouldn't it be nice if there were someone who had discovered and carefully documented what these remarkably healthy \\"tribes\\" and cultures with virtually no diseases (including cancer and heart disease) and perfect teeth actually ate before civilization brought them sugar and processed foods? There is! His name was Weston A. Price. He was a dentist who decided to go and see these fabled cultures for himself before they disappeared, traveling all over the world including the tropics and the arctic. He not only wrote a book about it called Nutrition and Physical Degeneration he took many pictures and even x-rays and blood samples of these seemingly perfect specimens of humanity. There is even a website sharing the info he discovered and conclusions he came to [...]] . NONE if these people were vegans or vegetarians but far from it.<br />  WARNING: He is hated and vilified by vegans and vegetarians who don't seem to realize that ending the practice of raising farm animals would lead to soil depletion of nutrients and failing health of not only people but the planet itself. Animals are going to be eaten--by humans or other carnivores. Time to wake up and smell the coffee and focus on sensible, sustainable farming practices that also happen to be kind! Animals raised on green pastures produce much healthier meat, milk, butter, eggs etc. for example.<br />  ANYWAY, humans need to consume animal products in order to be healthy. Saturated animal fats do NOT lead to heart disease or cancer. Cancer and heart disease became epidemic only after the introduction of the unnatural hydrogenated oils and seed and vegetable  oils that humans never previously could have consumed in such huge portions. Our ancestors living on farms consumed loads of lard (pig fat), raw butter, RAW milk (very important) and raw cheeses and did not have epidemics of these diseases. How Americans could ever have been convinced that our more tradtitional diet was the problem is astonishing.<br />  Biggest flaw with the book? He chose to use casein from milk in an unnatural ISOLATED dried and heated form as the protein in his experiments.  How many of us humans are getting their protein in an isolated form that also happens to be practically indigestible??  Casein is known for being extremely difficult to digest. The enzymes in raw milk and dairy products helped our ancestors digest them far more easily. All raw foods contain enzymes that help us break down foods and absorb their nutrients. It's hard to believe this substance could be chosen as the representative for protein in human diets without their being some sort of agenda. Remember, he got grants to do these studies in the first place. Hmmmm. Weston Price discovered that these healthy people ate much more raw food than we do although they also consumed cooked foods. The discoveries he made and the ease with which we can adapt many of them into modern life is fascinating and fun to read about and should make a huge difference in the health of our families. PLEASE check it out. Also, there are videos on youtube by people who went vegan and within a year or two their teeth started rotting. Animals can be raised and killed humanely and I believe smaller farms are the answer and the future.iets without their being some sort of agenda.

B00030590I|5|A movie of this complexity really cannot be described without the reviewer sounding like they think they are the next world famous movie critic.  Plus, a movie of this calibur is tough to review without becoming too verbose.  That being said, I do not fashion myself a movie critic by any means, and I will try to keep my review concise.    Summary? This movie is nothing less than a masterpiece.    I stumbled upon this movie quite accidentially.  However, I am certainly glad I did.  It is a simple story which is masterfully and flawlessly told.  It unfolds before you like a carefully crafted series of chess moves, is very entertaining and engaging, and has a few twists along the way.      A point that must be made is that this is not a \\"kung-fu\\" movie.  It has action scenes that will please any martial arts fan, but this movie is so much more.    Although I preferred the musical score of Crouching Tiger to Hero (it seemed as if Hero's music was heavily influenced by Crouching Tiger), the score is very enjoyable and perfectly suited to the movie.    What can I say about the other major components?  Set design and shooting locations were almost flawless and in most cases absolutely stunning.  It struck me that maybe Crouching Tiger's (ok, so I'm a big fan) outdoor lighting (effective use of time of day) may have been more dramatic than Hero, but Hero is still far and away better than virtually any other movie you are likely to have seen.    One of the main things this movie does more than any other movie I can recall was the effective use of color in costume and sets.  Whoever thought of this and chose the actual color pallet (sp?) is no less than brilliant.  It really is a visually beautiful movie.    This is one of the best movies I've ever seen at any and all levels.  It's really not surprising that it's not a Hollywood original.  I don't think they make them like this anymore.    Is this Communist propaganda like some have summized?  I believe you need to view thisfilm in it's historical perspective.  Come on people!  What was the set of ideals driving this part of the world during the era of the film?  I believe it was one of self-sacrific and honor to the greater good.  You don't necessarily have to agree with these principles to enjoy this movie!  As a matter of fact, there are a couple of scenes (won't reveal them here) that on a personal level I certainly objected to.  However, the characters actions were much like I would assume given their philosophies displayed.    Conclusion?  You won't know what you're missing until you watch it.  After you watch it, you will be forever glad you did.
B000XUBFE2|5|Optimistic survival story
B000002WNP|5|Elvis reclaimed his throne immediately after his return from the army in 1960. This 5 CD set illuminates the reasons why. From the early 60s through to the beginning of the 70s Elvis captured the feel of pop music in its  purest form: &quot;Loveletters&quot;, Dylan's &quot;Tomorrow Is A Long  Time&quot;, &quot;In The Ghetto&quot; and &quot;Reconsider Baby&quot; are  essential recordings for the pop connoisseur.  &quot;From Nashville To  Memphis&quot; is Elvis at his unqualified best.
B00OIG3CAC|5|The story is so engaging and the music makes it just that much better! This is Howard Shore at his very best and I am proud to say that I own this soundtrack. If you are a music and Middle Earth lover like me, this would make a great gift! It definitely captures the mood that this is the end of Middle Earth on the screen. But if this is to end, then let it end with a bang!

B002ZTIIXK|5|I am not a big fan of country music and listened to very little through the years, although I do keep an open mind and have dabbled in and own all types of music.  I had never listened to k.d. lang until I sampled her CD \\"Drag\\" when it was first released.  I was immediately blown away by her voice, and have been hooked on her ever since.  She has such a distinctive, transcendent style and manages to make every song her own somehow, even when doing covers that I love by the originals.  She is truly a classic, with a voice that will be remembered and revered for many years to come.  This CD represents a good cross-section of her many styles and shows how no matter what style she chooses to sing, she owns it, makes it her own.  She sings with such a deep sense of feeling, as though she is sharing an intimate glimpse into her soul, softly caressing your own soul until you lose yourself completely and willingly into the comfortable silkiness of her sound, a sound that will continue to haunt your memory long after the CD has ended.

B00008PW3O|4|I began listening to Fleetwood Mac in an order reversed compared to most.  I got hooked on Stevie Nicks back when she released 'Trouble in Shangri-La' in 2001.  Since then I've been a huge Nicks fan and in an effort to find more of her music I discovered Fleetwood Mac.  I've been a fan ever since I first heard 'The Dance'.  That being said, realize this reveiw is coming from the perspective of someone who is a Nicks fan first and a Fleetwood Mac fan second.<br />The first reason I love this album is because Nicks has some great songs on here.  Everybody Finds Out is a great rock song and gets me psyched up no matter how many times I've heard it before.  Say You Will is a nice pop song, but I actually think it would have been better sung by Christine McVie.  Nicks does a nice job filling in for her though.  Illume is a prime example of just how wonderfully cryptic and beautiful Nicks' poetic songs can be.  Finally, Running Through the Garden harkens back to some of Nicks' solo work from the 80's, especially from 'The Wild Heart'.  <br />Lindsey Buckingham has some good moments on this album as well, but some of his songs seem to be out of place here.  'Red Rover' and 'Murrow Turning Over In His Grave' are good examples of songs that would have been better on a Buckingham solo project.  However, since 'Say You Will' came out of such a project, that doesn't come as a surprise.  'Peacekeeper', however, is a great example that Fleetwood Mac hasn't lost its distinctive sound.<br />Probably the best part about this album though are the pair of songs at the end.  'Say Goodbye' (sung by Buckingham) and 'Goodbye Baby' (sung by Nicks) are essentially Nicks and Buckingham putting closure on their volatile relationship that spawned some of Fleetwood Mac's most famous songs.  Its a very nice way to end the album and it ends on a most satisfying note.<br />Only big Fleetwood Mac fans should by the 'Enhanced' album.  It contains some nice picture extras, and the extra songs are decent.  But casual fans may not appreciate these extras to justify the extra cost.  The serious fan will very much enjoy the Enhanced version though.

B005QUQP76|5|I was initially very pleased with the mouse, I bought it in February this year, and it lasted about 3 months without problems. But after 3 months I had to uninstall and install the driver a couple of times, had to plug it in and unplug it a couple of times to make it work, at first, I tough it was my PC, my USB port, but those were brand new 3.0 ports.<br /><br />I tested the ports, and I got to the conclusion I've gotten a lemon, even then I had to say that the problem was very rare every now and then, I decided to keep it, since it was like once or twice a week I had to unplug-plug the mouse back in the port.<br /><br />Now, after 6 months of regular use, it doesn't work, simply stopped working, very sad since I had the illusion of keeping it, even after knowing it had a flaw.<br /><br />I tried contacted the seller &#34;Corsair&#34; for a warranty, but they have not answered any of my e-mails, too bad, that's a 1 star review for you, I'd give you probably 4 stars but you just can't sell a $60 mouse that last 6months.<br /><br />I researched the web and it seems like it's a common problem, they advice you to re-install the software and solve the problem, and if you're lucky it will, but probably like me, you won't be so lucky, so re-installing the software will just give you &#34;please connect M60 to the computer and try again&#34; error.<br /><br />I was really please with the features of the mouse, changing profiles with the dedicated buttons, I could just lift the mouse, it wont go all over the screen, it was a good (and expensive) 6 months experience.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />Corsair finally answered back, and they replaced the M60 with a M65, free of charge. If I loved my M60, I definitively love my M65 way more.<br />Thank you corsair for a awesome customer service.

B0000AXE8I|4|Neo (Keanu Reeves) is still trying to come to terms with being The One, the person who will save Zion and bring an end to the war with the machines.  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) firmly believes in the Prophecy and does his utmost to convince the Council and everyone else in Zion that Neo can accomplish this task, but Neo is not so sure that he can.  The Oracle keeps telling him what he will do and what will happen and Neo does not like to think that his life has already been decided - what happened to his own say in his life?  Still, Neo knows that he has other people to think about so he tries to follow the Oracle's advice.  She tells him that he must rescue the Keymaker so that the Keymaker can get Neo into The Source, where he will meet with the Architect, the person who created the Matrix.  The only problem is, the Keymaker is held prisoner by a powerful program who does not want to let him go...<br />This movie wasn't as good as The Matrix, but it was still a very good movie.  It had me on the edge of my seat almost the whole time and left me hanging at the end so I was frantic to see the third film.  The reason why it was not as good was simply that the surprise factor was gone - I knew that the special effects would be amazing and the fighting sequences would be brilliant and, funnily enough, they were, but I knew that they would be before I saw the movie so, no matter how spectacular they were, I felt that I had seen them in the first film.  Still, the Wachowski brothers did a fabulous job with the 'Burly Brawl' scene and I loved meeting other programs in the Matrix, they were just like really wealthy, snooty people that you really wanted to take down a peg or two.  Of course, the freeway chase sequence was spectacular and, personally, I thought that it was worth watching the whole film just to see that, but that is just my opinion.  If you enjoy science fiction or action/thrillers, then I am confident that you will enjoy this film also.

B00EUVG3P6|5|I used this processor to build a low power machine strictly for internet usage.<br /><br />The 54 watt power consumption is great for people that leave their machines on all day.  It really doesn't generate much heat at all.  The box stayed VERY COOL after several hours of web surfing.<br /><br />It was simple to install.  It comes with a beefy high quality fan that mounts directly on top of the processor.<br /><br />The added bonus is the on board video.  This means you do not have to shell out extra cash for a video card.  You just have to buy a compatible mother board, plug in the cpu and plug in your monitor.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this for gaming, graphic editing, or any heavy duty work.  Go with an i3, i5 or i7.<br /><br />Overall, a great processor to use for building an internet surfing machine.

B000FC12YQ|2|Book reviews and movie reviews are much the same.  Two people can read the same book and have totally opposite opinions.<br />If one person loved it and the other hated it, is the book good or bad?  Neither.  Having said that, I found this not to be one of Agatha's best.  No exotic locale, just a stodgy English village.  The book itself seemed stodgy and pedantic, not a page-turner, by any means.  And the ending......what a disappointment!  Frustrating.  No fair.......
1423146735|5|With the last book of the series,  it brought every thing to a head. With the earth goddess waking from her slumber, with the demi gods in her firing line, and through them the gods them selves. This a must read for any age.
2245267346|5|Beautifully translated, easily readable, and a great gift for child and adult alike. While not a &#34;collector's edition&#34;-style book, constructed to last through generations and be passed down to your grandchildren's grandchildren, the price point vs quality came as a pleasant surprise to me when the item arrived.
B001SKB1Y0|4|This movie is about wanting something, not wanting something, getting it, not being happy that you like it, etc etc. Javier Bardem is sexy and appealing while being both romantic, impulsive and pretty full of himself. What girl hasn't fallen for the guy who just is so confident in himself and the whole, go with what you're feeling' thing and then regretted it another day. (but secretly longed for it again!). There are love trysts, settling in relationships and plenty of heat, especially between real life spouses Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. I can't imagine what it is like in their real house!<br /><br />A fun movie as long as you watch with an open mind.
0307887448|5|Awesome book for anyone who was a teen in the 80s. I totally got most of the culture references and knew several super nerds who had a terrifyingly deep knowledge of (pick one), RUSH (songs, liner notes, band bios, etc), video games, movies, Japanese cartoons, 80s sitcoms, etc etc.<br /><br />The book is also a great story of late-teen self-discovery where Parzival, our protagonist, must come to terms with who he is, his limitations and the differences between immersive simulated reality and the crude and mean 'real' world.<br /><br />Finally, like all great books, there is a clear story arc, in this case, a Quest - almost a Grail Quest to solve a puzzle. Like all quests that matter, no one can get there alone.<br /><br />This book easily moved into my top 5 of all time. Someone will probably make a movie and it will be horrible. Just read the book.
B00J8CG6KE|5|I loved this movie. DiCaprio was a wonderful mix of funny and pathetic at the same time.  I would watch this again
B00011RPB0|5|Ms. Coppola has accomplished a remarkable feat.  First, I know of no other film that captures &quot;jet lag&quot; and its mind-numbing physical effects on the weary traveler.  Second, she gives an example of detachment and the acute introspection that can result.  Bill Murray knows that much of what is being translated for him from Japanese is &quot;lost,&quot; thus resulting in truncated and unsatisfactory communication -- in fact, the absence of communication.  But it is not just the Japanese that alludes him. His interaction, even the long distance calls home, are misunderstood, taken out of context, void of meaning.  The central characters of this film find themselves in Japan and are forced to re-invent or perhaps re-discover themselves.  That is what this film is conveying.  Anyone who has travelled extensively, and faced the long nights away from home will recognize the way the mind works in such instances, will know that there are times when one is uncertain of understanding oneself, let alone the foreign tongues on all sides of you.  This film is a work of stark originality.  At a time when it always seem possible to see the antecedents to every movie -- The Perfect Storm meets Ferris Bueller meets Oceans Eleven -- this work has the distinct advantage of occupying a uniquely creative, first position.
B000H305U0|2|The problem that I've always had with Justin as a solo artist is that he relies way too much on beats in his music. Sure, it's catchy, but at some point it becomes annoying and repetitive. His image doesn't help either, it's becoming a cliche. I think he's way too comfortable with vocally imitating MJ and Prince. I mean to be honest, I don't think Justin is THAT talented, but i was expecting something cool and sexy out of this album, but it falls flat to just cliche beats and not much substance to make the album as a whole very interesting.
0790735431|5|Cornball scripts? No way! It portrays the &quot;superstitious&quot; nature of aviators then and now. Trust me, when was the last time you flew in a commuter airplane in heavy turbulence. And during a bombing a run into the  heart of Germany without fighter escort and flying like &quot;sitting  ducks&quot;, you will take out all the lucky charms you ever had since you  were a kid. Accurate portray of a bomber flight crew and the political  garbage that goes on during a war. As far as using &quot;permission&quot;  clips, what is wrong with that! Just make the movie more creditable. Love  to see the Maltin's reviews of the Cameron's Titanic movie with the actual  video clips of the ship. In fact, Professional Wall Street traders/brokers  is also heavy into superstition. Closing the Stock market on Good Friday. I  would seriously question the reviews in Mr.Leonard Maltin's Movie &amp;  Video Guide and question the value of his book. At bet he may be reviewing  your wallet!
B0088W6Y7K|5|I enjoyed this series more than SG-1 because they didn't have any religious zealots as bad guys....<br />I also really liked the way they finished the series with actually bringing the story line to a conclusion with Atlantis making it back to earth.  Too many series end with the story just hanging out there.<br />This is great science fiction.
B00004Z459|4|I believe this CD is excellent because the songs are a great mix of rap, rock, and even techno. Linkin Park shows in this CD that they can make great songs using beats from the rock genre and lyrics from the rap genre. Also, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; offers more than just bland, repetative songs in which someone would lose interest. The songs in &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; have an effect on the listener by making him/her let a lot of closed in emotions out. If you enjoy rap/rock bands such as Limp Bizkit, then this CD is for you.<br />     There's no doubt that this CD has a lot to offer, but I feel that only 40 minutes for any CD wouldn't be long enough to be perfect. But Other than that, this CD is great.
B00IOVH8AW|5|Pharrell Williams' critiques were all about his look when they should have been about the best song/recording of the century.  You can not listen to this and not feel good about your day.<br />It is also a great match for the movie!
B006VFLIYK|4|Entertaining and a good \\"escape\\" read.  Story has complex elements and engaging characters.  Some of the coincidences are a bit difficult to swallow completely and one really needs to suspend belief.  The abilities of the 14 year-old girl are also somewhat hard to accept.  Overall it was still intriguing.

B000002B7M|5|When Ozzy went solo he took a gamble by creating a brash new &quot;Balls to the wall&quot; sound that would put Black Sabbath six feet under... He hit the jackpot.<br />      This CD is a true titan that turned its songs into  anthems. (Crazy Train being undoubtedly the best.) Randy Rhoads had  perfected what Ozzy started, and he will never be surpassed.<br />      This  album will live on forever. Accept no imitations, this is centerpiece of  metal.

0618918248|5|The essence of this book is set forth at the bottom of page 31 where Dawkins defines the God Hypothesis as follows: &#34;there exists a superhuman, supernatural  intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us.&#34;<br /><br />This book, says Dawkins, will advocate an alternative view: &#34;any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only at the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution. Creative intelligences, being evolved, necessarily arrive late in the universe, and therefore cannot be responsible for designing it. God, in the sense defined, is a delusion; and, as later chapters will show, a pernicious delusion.&#34;<br /><br />The first and last chapters of this book explain, in their different ways, &#34;how a proper understanding of the magnificence of the real world, while never becoming a religion, can fill the inspirational  role that religion has historically - and inadequately - played. In between are eight chapters designed to raise consciousness to the fact that to be an atheist is a realistic aspiration and, a brave and splendid one.&#34;<br /><br />Some points raised: Ch. 2, &#34;The God Hypothesis&#34; is a scientific hypothesis about the universe, which should be analyzed as skeptically as any other; Ch. 3 Arguments for God's existence turn out to be spectacularly weak. In Ch. 4 &#34;Why there almost certainly is no God,&#34; Dawkins shows that the illusion of design in the living world is explained with far greater economy and with devastating elegance by Darwinian natural selection.<br />Ch. 5 explains why religious belief is so ubiquitous and Chapters 6 and 7 tell us why we don't need God to have justifiable morals or to be good. Ch. 8 will invite you to think about ways in which religion is not such a good idea. &#34;There is no such thing as a Muslim child or a Christian child&#34; says Ch. 9 - &#34;that child is too young to knowwhether it is Muslim, Christian or not.&#34;<br /><br />The consequences of Charles Darwin's &#34;evolution by natural selection&#34; are aptly set out - God is a Delusion.

B002OUV7SS|5|A few years back my wife and I spent a couple of evenings in St Marks. The music was a delightful send off for Venice. This recording brings back the ambiance of those evenings. These intimate renditions of some of the most beautiful music in the western world are a welcome back to a most pleasent time. I'm not sure Wagner wouldn't have appreciated the care and artistry that went into these arrangments. In a concert hall maybe these selections wouldn't be all that gratifying, but in the open plaza of St. Marks they would be a delight along with a glass of champagne, coffee, or whatever.

B000008GHW|5|Though all of these songs appear (remastered at that) on First Rays of the New Rising Sun, I prefer this album and wish it was still in print.  Rays (like the older out of print Voodoo Soup) is filled with great songs, but the sound is all over the place with different line-ups and studio work.    This album was almost completely made of up songs perfored by the Hendrix-Mitchell-Cox trio (with guest Steve Winwood on I believe, Ezy Rider) and as such this feels like a complete album.  It sounds like the songs were meant to be a single album.  Those compilations feel like compilations.      Though I've rarely heard any of these songs on the radio, nearly every one of them is great.  In From the Storm, Freedom and Ezy Rider are three of his strongest most straight forward rockers.  His best collection of straight ahead rocks songs since Experienced.  Plus the great ballad Drifting and the amazing Angel.  (Fiona Apple closed her shows in 97 with a gorgeous version of Angel.  Very awesome)      You might not be familiar with the songs when you buy this, but you will wonder why you weren't more familiar with this.  Though I'm sure this was compiled from various studio sessions, the end result sounds more like a signle tight band than even Band of Gypsys did.      A final note, I'm basing this review off of my old Reprise label CD of this album which has the song listing above and not the song listing mentioned by Kurt Leith in his review (Beginning, Izabella and Highway Chile are not on this).  Also, other than the front and rear cover, I've never seen the artwork shown above.  Did MCA rerelease this before Experience Hendrix deleted the title?  Or is that the Track gatefold import?
B008Y5UADK|5|Creative use of Eraserhead-like black and white cinematography. Awesome concepts. Will appeal to those who like independent movies with an edge and those who are interested in how the universe can be represented mathematically, those who fantasize about figuring out how to get rich off the stock market and those who would enjoy gritty Hasidim.

0452289963|5|Many books are good to read, this book is good for you.  It takes all the silly day to day shallow things that happen in life and point you to the meaningful and important.  As we live our lives, we sometimes forget the whole purpose.  This book brings that back to focus.  It teaches how we can avoid petty actions and reactions, allowing us to move on to the bigger things that are usually in our background, but with the this book, we learn how to keep them in view.  An excellent,life changing book that will affect your soul.

B008Y2FRFO|3|Not the best game in the world but it is o.k .It gets sort of annoying after about ten min. of playing it.
B00CNNPOHG|5|I have owned one of these for quite a long time now and I am still totally passionate about it. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone with a little patience and time on their hands, and for anyone who is a fan of skill toys, puzzles, kinetic or ball-maze toys. The thing is gorgeous to look at, and so cheap for potentially hours of fun. It is the undisputed king off these ball labyrinth toys. If you're looking at this thing thinking, &#34;I think it's for me...&#34; or  &#34;I know someone who would love that.&#34;, you're probably right.<br /><br />Apparently they're a little fragile, but I haven't dropped mine. Probably best for ages 10+ as the difficulty is quite high.

B00003CX5P|4|Would anybody be totally happy with anything George Lucas came out with following the outrageous build-up for this film? Probably not, but one tends to think he could have done just a bit better than this. I know there are some &quot;Star&quot; fans who adore anything new about &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and there were many who despised this film after only half the film. Granted, I hated Jar-Jar Binks, myself, thinking he was just too silly for words. But the film does have some really fine moments, and some greatness, too. <BR>No matter what I thought of the film, however, I really have to take my hat off to Mr. Lucas for putting out such a high-quality DVD. The picture transfer is exceptional, the sound out-of-this-world, and enough extras to satisfy ANYBODY. All included, the film and extras take up two discs, with all sorts of behind the scenes stuff and commentary.<BR>Really, only DVD does this film any kind of justice, because only here can one see all the background scenery in all its complex glory. One can watch this film many times and still see something new every time. What incredible detail.<BR>Well, as I said, the film could have been better, but it does have its moments, and the DVD is one of the best ever produced, so indeed well-worth including in any DVD collection.
B00005JO5L|4|I say this movie when it first came out and it gave me the creeps.  This sub-culture of leathermen in leatherbar is truly bizarre and Friedkin captures the atmosphere precisely.    Pacino's performance must have been one of the hardest he had to do since there are so many layers of sexuality and doubt and mystery surrounding his character that to give a convincing portrayal of a possible murderer of gay men must have tested his acting abilities to the limit.  He succeeds.    Since today is World Aids Day - 1 Dec 2007 - I am just wondering how many of the \\"extras\\" are still alive since their performances are so real and convincing.  Were they acting or just being themselves?    A cult classic with a few loose ends and for a very limited audience.  Don't screen it for your mother or grandmother.
B005ZCXPP0|4|I am sure you will like this movie if you enjoy action flix. Just another one in the series of the great hero movie, we all wish we had.
B0069G5Z9K|5|I loved this game on iOs and I'm loving it on my Android now that I got it from the Amazon Appstore. For those of who never played this game, it's a no-brainer. You have to play this game. It's extremely addictive - although repetitive. The art style is awesome and the game is totally worth it (I think it's free). You cannot go wrong with any game made by Halfbrick Studios.
B000ICXQU6|4|The Movie is a classic. Loved it. The slow and blurry feed from Amazon not so much.
B009ZQC7MY|5|This is the best series in a long time.  I can't wait to watch the next episode!!!!  Love it.  Love all the actors and actresses.
B00MNYTWMI|5|Love the game. It is very addicting to play. It's very educational. I would like to play more games like this
B0071XO8RA|5|Wool is that rarest of things – a completely character driven dystopian novel. Its a beautifully written one at that.This is epic storytelling, told with a taut hand on the tiller, controlling the pace and direction, allowing the reader to uncover truths together with the many, care worthy, relatable characters that populate this place, a lot of whom for one reason or another start to doubt the facts they have been living with. Endlessly fascinating, this little snapshot of a life led in one place and in one way, following very specific rules whose purpose seem to have been lost in the mists of time, its a living breathing thing.<br />From page 1 I found myself entrenched in this bleak, hopeless world.
B000FCKC4C|5|Excellent read, very inspiring and calming. I would recommend this to anyone dealing with our over stressed world.
B005IZLPKQ|5|Bought this movie to add to our DVD collection and we really enjoyed watching it as a family.  Happy with purchase!

B00F8H7DYQ|5|Bought for collection purpose. Packaging was in perfect condition. I had an idea this wouldn't be tolerated in toy stores and I'm hoping it's discontinued so the value will go up! Only time will tell. Haven't opened and don't plan to.
B0045XGRQE|5|very good
0452289963|2|Unnecessarily wordy and shallow  I have read many books on topics such as this and I was disappointed on how complicated the author tired to make the subject.   It wasn't until page 72 that a simple sentence finally rang through all of the noise, and that \\"shining through\\" was very rare in this book. I hope that people don't miss the simple truths, a simple awareness and the simplicity of Being.
B000W91RUG|5|I love The Big Bang Theory so I love the DVD.  Gave it as a gift.  They love it too.
B000AYEL1A|5|I absolutely loved this movie&#62;
B008Y7EYSK|4|Good suspenseful movie
B000NQRE9Q|5|Definitely worth springing for the Blu-Ray!  The HD is a very great quality and the audio is very good quality as well.
B0020BUWX2|5|I just finished this novel, and I'm feeling a bit awestruck. The plot is deceptively crafted, appearing to be low key while keeping you on the edge of your emotional seat. Mia, the main character is the daughter/sister/friend/lover that we all wish we could be - or have - in our lives. Forman's writing is perfect.<br /><br />These characters are perhaps not the sort of people you hang out with. They are creatives, and therefore a bit edgy, yet they are so completely human that they feel comfortable and oh so sympathetic.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the sequel.
630471193X|5|Phenomenon may not be John Travolta best movie but he certainly gave his best performance as an actor and it is a shame that he was not even nominated for this movie. The story about a mechanic (Travolta) from a small town in California who witnessed a bright light from the sky and the next day he woke up as incredibly smart man. Robert Duvall gave excellent performance as the town doctor and Kyra Sedwick is the love interest. The story is moving and quite a few funny moments. <br />The DVD is OK as this is an early release. The picture is bright and sharp and the 5.1 sound is about average. Higly recommended DVD.
B0000085N4|5|This album is definetely a classic all-time great album. When a friend told me he saw it was remastered, i knew i had to buy the new one even though i still had the original disc. But alas, after flipping through the liner notes of the new one i realized that it WASN'T remastered at all. How? Because it still says &quot;Mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound&quot; instead of &quot;Remastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound&quot;. And then after listening to it alongside the original realizing it is an exact duplicate of the original. So as far as i can tell, there is no difference between the two except for the expanded artwork. But i guess i'll keep it nonetheless and give my original to my friend.
B00HPYMVD8|1|Unfortunately I was expecting a lot more from this book. Thoroughly enjoyed the previous two Will Robie books, but this book didn't have anything for me throughout. Book seemed to lack real substance. Enjoyed the insights into North Korea, obviously its a Western perspective, but still interesting nonetheless.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Crossy Road is awesome because I love strategy games, and this is one that I really recommend. It is partly funny when your character gets run over or hit.

B00004W510|5|Sounding like it was recorded in Uncle Bob's Basement and Garage (they used a house in the Hollywood Hills owned by Sammy Davis, Jr and padded it out with blankets and wood) - The Band's self-titled second album delivered on the promise of their 1968 debut \\"Music From Big Pink\\" in a huge way. Today it's revered as an Americana classic and this cool little CD remaster from 2000 hammers that home big time. Here are the rag mama rags...<br /><br />Released September 2000 (August 2000 in the USA) - \\"The Band\\" is an expanded CD reissue on Capitol 525 3892 (Barcode 724352538928) and breaks down as follows (71:57 minutes):<br /><br />1. Across The Great Divide<br />2. Rag Mama Rag<br />3. The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down<br />4. When You Awake<br />5. Up On Cripple Creek<br />6. Whispering Pines<br />7. Jemima Surrender [Side 2]<br />8. Rockin' Chair<br />9. Look Out Cleveland<br />10. Jawbone<br />11. The Unfaithful Servant<br />12. King Harvest (Has Surely Come)<br />Tracks 1 to 12 are their 2nd album \\"The Band\\" - released September 1969 in the USA on Capitol Records STAO-132 and January 1970 in the UK on capitol Records E-ST 132.<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS:<br />13. Get Up Jake (Outtake - Stereo Mix)<br />14. Raga Mama Rag (Alternate Vocal Take - Rough Mix)<br />15. The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down (Alternate Mix)<br />16. Up On Cripple Creek (Alternate Take)<br />17. Whispering Pines (Alternate Take)<br />18. Jemima Surrender (Alternate Take)<br />19. King Harvest (Has Surely Come) (Alternate Performance)<br /><br />THE BAND was:<br />GARTH HUDSON - Organ, Clavinette, Piano, Accordion, Soprano Tenor & Baritone Sax and Slide Trumpet<br />RICHARD MANUEL - Vocals, Piano, Drums, Baritone Sax & Mouth Harp<br />LEVON HELM - Vocals, Drums, Mandolin & Guitar<br />RICK DANKO - Vocals, Bass, Violin & Trombone<br />ROBBIE ROBERTSON - Guitar<br /><br />Compiled by Cheryl Pawelski and Andrew Sandoval - the 16-page booklet has fantastically comprehensive liner notes by ROB BOWMAN that feature interviews stretching back twelve years (from 2000), photos of tracking sheets, mix instructions, American 45s and Picture Sleeves, trade adverts, colour snaps from the session in the house - and even a Time Magazine cover from January 1970. It's very well done as befits an album of this stature. But the big news is a great remaster by DAN HERSCH and ANDREW SANDOVAL. Recorded outside of a conventional studio in a loose manner and with `feel' being all-important - the tracks vary in sound quality. And you have to say that this remaster allows the whole lot to `breathe'. On tracks like \\"King Harvest (Has Surely Come)\\" and the beautiful \\"Whispering Pines\\" where hiss is more than evident - the transfers haven't tried to supress it - but given it space to shine - it's properly lovely.<br /><br />Almost a mission statement as to `this is how we sound - love it or lump it' - the openers \\"Across The Great Divide\\" and the single \\"Raga Mama Rag\\" establishes that `Band' sound and feel. The joviality abates for the epic \\"Virgil Cane\\" Civil War ballad \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\" with Levon Helm sounding literally like a beaten soldier from the South. It's one of Robbie Robertson's finest songwriting moments. Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson do a great vocal trade off on \\"When You Awake\\" but Manuel's lead on \\"Whispering Pines\\" is probably most people's crave - a gorgeous melody with all those croaking voices harmonizing and that organ giving it a church on Sunday backdrop. It ends Side One perfectly.<br /><br />We go into boogie mode for \\"Jemima Surrender\\" - a top-notch chugger with the group sounding like they're enjoying themselves while discovering a special chemistry (\\"I'll bring over my Fender and play all night for you...\\"). But the biggies are the two finishers - Rick Danko sings \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" where \\"that train is comin'...\\" and the malevolent \\"King Harvest (Has Surely Come)\\" is handled by Richard Manuel. There's even traces of Little Feat's funky sound in its 1969 grooves. The extra tracks provide a fabulous insight into the recording process - beginning with a real find - an outtake called \\"Get Up Jake\\" considered at the time as one too many for the album - its great. Listening to a string of Alternate Takes of songs you've known for decades is a strange and exhilarating experience - the acoustic \\"Dixie\\" is unbelievably intimate with its false starts and great sound. A keyboard-funky \\"Up On Cripple Creek\\" follows - but the real prize has to be another version of \\"Whispering Pines\\" which is just as achingly beautiful as the finished cut (even when it breaks down mid-take because of a `squeaky chair'). The loose guitar jam of \\"King Harvest\\" feels like eavesdropping on \\"union man\\" Americana. Wicked...<br /><br />Dirt cheap from most online retailers - this is one of those occasions where you don't have to pay through the CD nose to get that great combo of top music and quality sound. And if ever a group deserved such a sweet outcome - then The Band are it...led \\"Get Up Jake\\" considered at the time as one too many for the album - its great.

B0000009LG|5|THIS IS A CLASSIC ALBUM AND ONE YOU OUGHT TO HEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN. Smooth, polished, perfect -- if David Bowie had emerged from the primordial goo of 60s/70s music to deliver only this single album (as opposed to his Picasso-like eternal rock brilliance) he would still be considered a genius.<br /><br /> For someone to term this album &quot;plastic&quot; is an abomination. This is brilliant work, satisfying on several levels at once, not the least of which is the joy of hearing the stellar production and playing throughout the album. The arrangements will have you out of your seat with joy, shouting out the open front door to the neighbors to get over here and listen to this, no, wait, I'll just turn it up. It's *exciting* how good this music is.<br /><br /> There's one point in &quot;Win&quot; where the background singers, Bowie, and the bass line are all happening and it's a kind of vortex or singularity that delivers all that music has to offer, I mean they really grab the gold ring and bring it home to show Grandma. This album is so good that I've never objected to the horn charts, which always irritate me otherwise. It's a beautifully crafted album, truly a work of art.<br /><br /> Yes, &quot;Across The Universe&quot; blows monkey chunks. Listen, not every oyster you slice open is going to contain a pearl, you know what I mean..? And I heard &quot;Young Americans&quot; often enough in high school to really never want to hear the song again, though 25 years on it's not half as bad as I recall.<br /><br /> The combination of Win &gt; Fascination &gt; Right &gt; Somebody Up There stands as the vital, beating heart of the album. Excellent for slow f*cking. This album is like the Seventh Cavalry riding over the mountain to save the day, this album is like Charlemagne or King Arthur's Camelot riding up to your house on horseback with nothing but good news. Boundless riches.<br /><br /> Can he sing the blues? Don't stray. This is an excellent album, well worth the price. You will never regret having purchased it. There are more visceral and more forgettable Bowie albums, but this is the most elegant and refined rock album that God has so far seen fit to release to the general public (you and me).<br /><br /> Note from 2004: DB is apparently mortal after all, having had a stent installed in a heart procedure this year. Difficult to believe. Anyone that's reached the stratospheric heights like David Bowie has hit musically ought to be immune from death... what a genius. This album is irrefutable proof of his staggering talent. David Bowie defines what a rock star is. You have GOT to hear this album!rchased it.

B00BBW16HW|5|It moves from a rough sketch of predictable characters to a subtle transformation in both that changes both of their lives...while one thinks he is helping the other and vice versa. It smacks a little of the French socialist tendencies...&#34;if you'll only give the guy a chance he will be good&#34;...but for the most part the very real portrayal of the developing relationship overshadows that. Worth every minute and every dime.

Everything about this book was stereotypical,trying to be deep but somehow leaving you deflated and wanting to get something out of the time you spent reading it!
B0055SWM08|4|4 Stars, haven&apos;t seen many games I would rate as perfect :) Excellent and entertaining. Usually not my sort of game but this one has held my attention. Keep up the good work and add many more levels please!
B008FRFN7A|5|I use this app it works great it prints off everything I want I have a wireless printer hp  it's easy to set up to your wireless printer
B00G3HSF7O|2|it was not as good as I thought it would to slow paced. not enough action.
B000000JO3|5|Anyone should be able to understand that Ian was pretty passionate and probably still is about life and society's constraints.  Youthful angst at it's height.  You can really feel his emotion.  And if you must get stoned or @!$#!#$'d up somehew, this music is infectious and grows every listen.  Between this and Damaged by Black Flag, there is no better hardcore in my opinion.  Buy them both if you can.
B003WAV02M|5|Fabulous movie
B00HYTSTNU|5|well done even though the outcome is known it keeps you in suspense throughout the movie. The acting was superb and and you felt as if they were the real characters and puts you in the action. I gave it a 5 star rating.
B000HEWEJO|5|alphha bravo charlie ran out of things to say. mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow.
B0047Y17P2|5|Connelly once again keeps his reader on the edge and wanting to turn the page..if you do not want to stay up late reading then do not read in the early evening. He makes you want to see what the next outcome is around the corner...
B00000K0T8|5|This is another Wu banger that seems to get overshadowed by the previous year solo releases of GZA's Liquid Swords and Raekwon's Only Built For Cuban Linx. In my opinion Ironman should not take a backseat to either of these two classics. It is worthy of classic status in its own right. RZA is his usual razor sharp self with the production. Once again he delves into the early 70's soul samples and dark keyboard tones mixed with dialogue from various films that were so ubiquitous on Liquid Swords and OB4CL. Ghost's frenetic delivery is complemented nicely with Raekwon's steady and confident lyrical stylings. But ironically the lyrical highlight of the album belongs to neither Ghostface or Raekwon. That honour is bestowed upon Cappadonna who spits a long, freewheeling, in your face verse on posse cut 'Winter Warz', my favourite song on the album.    Top 5 tracks  1. Winter Warz  2. Camay  3. Daytona 500  4. Iron Maiden  5. After The Smoke is Clear ft. Delfonics    Rating: 87/100
B0089LOG02|5|I loved it
B000001EGA|5|Great album. Classic.
B00LTMIAF0|1|Appreciate the artistic approach but moved too slow for me to enjoy
B005MLOOJA|5|It is refreshing to see a show portray an intelligent woman who is not overly emotional or defining every aspect of her life by the man she is currently sleeping with. This show has fantastic character development and depicts an interesting 'behind the scenes&#34; look at the world of high powered defense attorneys with both the bureaucracy and politics intact.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it.
B000NA2BEU|5|Really enjoyed watching this series.  Liked the way there was a plot woven through all the episodes  and guessing at the \\"who dunit\\".
B006MW3UZW|5|Another Downton fan here!  I can watch this series (all 5 seasons) over and over -- and cannot say that for many other tv series.  Season 2, episode 8 has what I feel is probably the most romantic love scene (Mary and Matthew) ever written for a tv series.  Bravo Julian Fellowes, the entire cast of Downton, the producers/directors/crew.  All accolades received are perfectly justified.  A true &#34;Masterpiece.&#34;  Thank you PBS.
B00KA7JIII|2|pros<br />great graphics and art style, very unique and nice to look at.<br /><br />con<br />too short - just completed it, replayed the first level and realised how short it is, so it is really only 9 levels. they could have add more of the levels near the start to make it longer.<br />there is no replay value, after playing it once, there is no reason to play it again.<br />levels are too easy, where is the challenge, you can walk through the entire game with minimal difficulty, there is no point where you will get stuck on this game.<br />the level selection menu is stupid, rotate a cube around to get 10 levels, maybe they were trying to hide how short the game is, the buttons aren't intuitive at all, they are just circles and squares with patterns with no indication what they do.<br />value for money, for $4 this is on the expensive side in my opinion, it should be a $1-2 dollar game, however, if you have amazon coins spare that you got for free, there is nothing else in this genre that is a relaxing and short piece of eye candy that will pass an hour of your time.
B002BU0DPE|5|Bought these for my husband and he loves them. You can hear other players sneaking up from behind..and you hear them....from behind!! Excellent pricing! Very satisfied!!
B000XJ5TOK|5|To me this movie is the best in the series, and really nice looking on blu ray.  Not the best blu ray out there but definitely worth it for the price.  If you've never seen this and your a fan of horror you definitely should get this.
B00DHHWXYY|2|I love the Great Gatsby story BUT this over stylized sham of a production defecates all over the original work<br />1st the positives. It looks good, the party scenes and the set design are every bit as audacious as you'd expect from a work that lampooned the gross excessiveness of the roaring 20s.<br />2nd The acting is pretty good and they had the right cast<br /><br />Now the bad<br />1) I cant stand an historical piece that uses modern music. WHY IS JAY-Z on the soundtrack and why do I hear his annoying hip hop rhymes throughout the movie? It just takes you out the story completely. The 1920s had a soundtrack and hip hop and rap was not part of it. And for that matter neither was techno music which is also featured throughout the movie and during the party scenes. You wouldn't make a civil war movie and have Britney Spears singing Opps I Did it Again during one of the battle scenes, then why have Jay-Z playing when they walk into a speakeasy<br />2) They miss a lot of the character story and the symbolic meaning of the book as embodied in the characters. What they did to Daisey is a shame, she isn't just a person she represents something each person is metaphor and when you change how certain characters acted and reacted to the storyline then you lose the metaphor they were supposed to represent<br /><br />In short, this movie was a butchering of a classic. A very stylized butchering but it butchers the work that F Scott Fitzgerald created, but it does use a pearl handled hatchet
B008CPZNL6|4|Current as well as interesting news items; e.g., background info on Downton Abbey. I especially like the tech section which has updates on the latest phones, tablets, etc. Attractive layout. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to keep up with current events.
B000FC2L1Y|5|A great read.
B0012YYZYK|2|My copy of this blu-ray seems as though it was transferred from a crappy VHS tape. there are skips and lines through the picture through the entire thing.  This was my first time seeing it so I am not sure if this is some sort of intentional effect.
B000GCFG7E|5|Good suspense. Fast ending.<br />At the end Reacher disappears quickly--so American.<br />Lee Child at the top of his game, for sure.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|this app is amazing for not only small kids but now my mom is addicted to it I love this app fun and simple and the bird poops
B002UWH8P6|5|wonderful
B0028MBKVG|4|Very interesting.  Starts off slow, but gets better.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5|I watched the Youtube releases and knew that  I wanted to see the complete movie.  Master Chief is awesome!  Halo 4 is awesome!
B00F91SCXC|4|Enjoyable and somewhat intelligent zombie movie! At least treated zombie-ness as a legitimate issue with somewhat of an explanation. Brad Pitt was great, as always! Had that Legends of the Fall thing going on with his hair... Beautiful!
B000OZ0NXA|3|I so looked forward to reading the jack reacher novels by lee child.  Starting with the first book in the series seemed like a good idea.  When the novel was ported to ebook, did nobody actually look at how the book would appear on the kindle?  Micro sized print detracts from the reading experience.  Each chapter starts with the first line in micro print?  Ebooks may be a new medium for selling books but if you can't read fine print, this novel will drive you crazy.  Just sayin
B000LGOPW2|5|By far one of my favorite scarey movies of all time. Great story, great visuals and the cast was excellent. LOVE this movie
B000SEGUDE|4|While it takes a little bit of effort to immerse yourself in the narrative of cloud atlas, I found the conclusion satisfying.  The stories show themselves to be a interesting journey through time, different from H G Wells' Time Machine but shown from the same sensibilities of characters.
B008XG1X18|5|I think Pinterest is wonderful!  I had to find a Thanksgiving dish that was new & exciting for dinner at a friends house and I ended up finding a delicious recipe on Pinterest.  Then this weekend my daughter had an assignment of making a Leprechaun trap, which I found great ideas for on Pinterest.  Love love love it!!
B000000I0I|5|It should be a law -- all human beings should have to listen to Part 1 of &quot;Ommadawn&quot; at least once in their lives. Real emotion, real musical idea development, real imagination, and really being moved am I by this 3rd release by Master Oldfield!<br />I put this album on and I am transported to midnight moors, soft spring hills, elegant mansions that dissolve into swirling stars that dissolve into mad passionate dancing by the firelight in the middle of the desert...the transcendant sounds tickle and trickle and then break my heart with their beauty and then build up and into my heart with their spiritual strength until I ask myself, or anyone, &quot;Is this what music would sound like if made by the Divine?&quot;<br />I don't mean to sound trite in my praise for this recording, but when something reaches into you and grabs you by the loins and makes full love to your ears and Soul at the same time, believe me, you take notice. Please buy this music if you want to feel the magic again...it does exist beyond these gates...
B001H4R4LQ|4|The book intrigues me alot it makes me want to join the opposition against the mean king who enslaved his people
B005LAIIJY|5|Best Freakin' movie EVER!!!!!!  They want more words  watch this movie  you will love it too  BLOOD  and revenge  and rockin'  i have watched this movie many times and i never do that.  Jamie Foxx  gives riveting performance  but The Dentist/bounty hunter......I quote him!
B0028MBKVG|5|Awesome book!  I have run over 100 miles since reading the book just over a month ago.  Before that, a bad back and bad knees had me down and getting fat.  I think this book may have changed my life.  Time will tell.  For now, I just want to run.
B00PTB7B34|3|In app purchasing seems odd to me, but it seems fun.
B000H0MKGK|5|John Mayer continues to amaze me with his creative lyrics, amazing guitar skills, and musical versatility. This CD will not disappoint. From the great vibes of \\"Vultures\\" to the thought-provoking lyrics of \\"Waiting on the World to Change,\\" John Mayer is one of the most creative artists of our time. And, as a 50+ female, he's also not hard on the eyes. I've got all his CD's and can't wait for the next.
B0097HSS4M|5|This is a very good app.  I change the effects of a lot of my pictures.  I know many people who use this and like it too.
B0055IU4GM|4|I'm a huge John Hiatt fan, but it seems to have been a bit since he put out a CD up to standard.  Well that has changed now.  This latest is some of his best stuff in years.  Sit back and enjoy.
B002JXK5VU|5|entertaining, a everyday sheriff living in a town of genius'. There are problems we never contend with. How about a house that gets mad if you do not call that you will be late for dinner.
B00N6PD3GE|5|This book is a real page-turner.  I learned a lot about the German submarine attacks and World War I in general.  Lots of information about submarines and about the United States' policy of non-involvement.  I recommend this book highly.
B009XHAM8G|5|This will be great to read to my little sister.If you have a sibling YOU should read it to them.
B001GCUO1Q|5|Loved it!
B001HNE3NO|5|Anyone interested in what happened to Jews in Hitler's time would like this.  Importantly, it gives good information on non Jews in the occupied territories that most of us forget.
B007XKEY6Q|3|i want the updated version its so much better my friend has it im waiting and waitjng untill it comes out!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001OB7R7S|5|Steely Dan, need I say more?  This is Donald Fagen's solo work, but he can't get away from the sound that made him famous.  Moreover, he shouldn't try to.  I have this album and decided to purchase the CD ( I missed the tunes).  From &#34;I.G.Y&#34; to &#34;Walk Between The Raindrops&#34;, this CD is solid.
B0040I09RM|5|Never watched this when it first came out because thought it was going to be your normal stereotypycal type biker story.  Very addictive!  Characters that you can understand where they are coming from and twist in the plots that you would not normally anticipate.<br /><br />GOOD JOB!
B006LSZECO|4|I generally liked reading the book, but I did not like the ending.i would recommend the book as easy reading.
6305511055|5|I'm just getting around to seeing this espionage film.  A young Redford scrambles to understand and outwit the unknown elements trying to eliminate him.  Despite being over 20 years old, it doesn't have that dated feel that some films have.<br />The action grabs you without a lot of special effects and car chases.  The scenes with the leading lady sizzle.  Just watching Redford is a treat.<br />Of course, he was great in Butch Cassidy and in The Sting, so I don't know how I missed this one before.  If you haven't seen it for awhile, treat yourself to a fresh viewing.
B004WGGQPQ|5|Such a fantastic app! My three year old loves it. So much to do, and he likes the way you can save and revisit an album.
B002XISFGS|4|back in 1979 , Wise directed  the first STAR TREK film , the only one that looked an had the feel of a \\"epic \\" movie . Wise was a great dirctor an hired the best special effects men around , though Paramount pushed the him to hurry up an get in the theaters before he had the time to re-edit the film , so , yeah you have alot of scenes with just the crew looking at the viewscreen , gasping an with their mouths open . If he had more time to finish the film the right way , We may had enjoyed it better . I liked the film , the 'bridge looked awesome \\" , finally we saw the Enterprise look  enchanting , the crew 10 years older and they didnt wear those doppy red (hide the waistline ) jackets , but Kirk wore 3 diffrent uniforms an the movie had a good budget after this film they reused Enterprise scenes from each other films in different angles . yeah im waiting for the release of this film in 3/13 in blu ray an hope its as good this verison an perhaps more
B00EV6T6DQ|5|Beautifully drawn, Blue is the Warmest Color hits you  the gut while caressing your hand. Martin's illustrations with few words give better life to a complex story than prose could.
B004LROUNG|5|I enjoy Carl Hiassen's books.  He has a way of writing and some of the situations are so ridiculous that I have laughing fits.  Though not as much, Grisham's way of writing elicits the same chuckles.  This book, in particular, had its funny spots and was an all around good story.
B00005AQE7|5|Super dope, prefect condition!
B000QRIGLC|5|A compelling and often polarizing story.  Politics asids, this story of survival and heorism will bring tears to just about anyone's eyes.  Marcus Luttrell is an American hero that is not afraid to stand by his beliefs in a story that is nothing short of a page turner.
B002OSY2T6|5|Great toy for a 3 month old.  It keeps him smiling and entertained.  Nice toy to grow with once he begins to crawl!
B000AMMSQC|5|Finally, there is a production of Swan Lake that doesn't absolutely depress me or put me to sleep, if you can imagine such a thing.  Unlike La Scala's production of Giselle, the orchestral score is outstanding and if you are a Maxwell Parrish fan, as I am, the sets take one back to a time of mythical bliss.  Quite frankly, this production fits the story line of Swan Lake as I have always imagined it should be in my head.  I have seen Fonteyne's and Makharova's performances and Baryshnikov's choreography and all three left me numb . . . in fact, I couldn't finish watching any to the end (we were live for Baryshnikov's premiere).  I am not normally a Zakharova fan but she hit the part right on, and I still say that Roberto Bolle is underestimated for his technical skill.  What a thrill and delight to see these two performing together, plus the corps de ballet were near perfection.  Now, I can enjoy watching this over and over again.  And I must confess--for those who have read my other critiques--the camera person has not been at fault on my recently acquired DVDs for cutting off the footwork of the danseurs; my remote control had reset my plasma screen for zoom viewing without my knowing.  Now, I have had the satisfaction of going back and watching the performances of La Scala's Giselle and Bolshoi's The Pharoah's Daughter again without the stress of having the critical footwork chopped off at the bottom of my screen.
B000AJIF4E|5|I love listening to vintage speakers but I wanted to have a good pair of headphones for when the wife needs it quiet.  These work perfect and sound very good to my ears.
B005HED11Y|5|I love Star Trek.  Quality is good.
B008Y6Q38A|5|Jesse Eisenberg is amazing in this movie. The story of Facebook is a fascinating one and this movie does a great job at both being entertaining and faithful to the story of Facebook's origin (of course there's embellishment, but the bulk of the story is accurate).
B00G5G7EXY|5|We loved this movie, I got the soundtrack right away and we were waiting until it came out on DVD. I got the regular DVD which is missing the part that says &#34;that's no blizzard, that's my sister&#34;  - didn't notice anything else missing.  There were no extras except for the the advertisements for other movies which was a disappointment and it is not full screen - it;s wide screen - the reason for the 5 stars is really because of the movie.
B004I744AS|5|So good to have the dictionary on the go and it's very easy to use and results are almost instant.
0307476073|5|I love Cheryl's story - the way she describes the journey makes you feel as if you are there with her! Anyone who may be questioning their next steps in life should read this book!
B001RJXA7S|4|I have always enjoyed the vampire genre of movies and the different twists that each movie brings.  Blade, even though it is on the older side of things, is a great movie that brings the good versus evil conflict together with mystery and suspense.  The main character is so dynamic and tested in all ways to overcome his own demons and try to make the world a better place, even though he suffers for that world.  And, the good guys win the day.
B00005JOFQ|5|Subtle story, delicate direction, unbelievable scenary, make us see that love is the matter, whoever may be.  Marcelo Lanat Júnior.
B001AOKA3W|3|Well, I am one who has been entertained by horror movies since I was a child with the first B/W small TV screens.  Throughout this time the writers and producers have learned the macabre fascinates and permeates  the audience before, during & after viewing the movie.  The plot is anticipated and falls in place without damaging any protocol.  The action/destruction scenes were A and entertaining.  There's no skin to show or hedge to mow in this film so the middle school children can get nothing more than questions from the movie.  One exception:  Godzilla appears at least once in complete frontal nudity.
B000XUBFE2|5|I like to read the book before watching the movie, hoping they won't mess up the movie since this book was well written and I look forward to reading more of the Authors work.
B009WUBERW|4|With the collection of action movie stars and the plan for nothing but violence and action, don't expect an Oscar-worthy storyline or deep dramatic performances. If you're looking for non-stop action, shooting, blowing stuff up and one-liners poking fun at the stars' previous characters and movies, you will LOVE this one.
B00992CF6W|4|I love minecraft so i purchased the Xbox version, it has so much more, the computer version has more than that, this seems more of a demo then the game itself, the creative inventory is tiny, but it is still a great game, don't get me wrong there, but very small compared to Xbox or pc.
B001NBEWN6|3|First, I want to clarify the background for such a &#34;neutral&#34; number of stars, namely 3:  I read this book in three days.  Immediately after the first day's reading, I recommended it to my friends and family that I saw the next day.  And, now, after actually having finished the book, I have had to emphatically renege my first recommendation.<br /><br />This is quite possibly the most severely depressing book that I have ever read.  Undoubtedly, part of the book's depressiveness is simply the expression of aspects of Indian, or specifically Keralan, politics and culture of the time.  Moreover, those aspects are so intertwined with other aspects of the lives and events of the characters, that I don't claim that a boundary can be drawn about them.  Rather, one witnesses to many domino effects, caused and abetted by various &#34;Indian societal problems&#34;, that one cannot help but wonder about the fatalism.  It may even be the case that this is exactly the message that the author Arundhati Roy wished to convey about India.  She is very politically active herself, and may have wished to move the reader to the feeling of the necessity of sweeping change in India.  That is both understandable and respectable.<br /><br />However, the book is a novel.  A novel has characters and plots concerning the actual lives of the characters.  To orchestrate such a reduction of societal fatalism upon the characters loses something in the process.  In the case of &#34;God of Small Things&#34;, this loss manifests in many forms.  For example, the multi-dimensionality of the characters is lost.  I'm not just talking about the myriad charicature characters like Baby Kochamma, Papachi, Mamachi, or Comrade Pillai.  Eventually, I could not help the feeling that the very primary protagonists of the novel, Rahel, Estha, Ammu, and Velutha, themselves did not yield more than one dimension.<br /><br />The novel is told primarily in Rahel's voice, sometimes with Rahel and her twin Estha'svoices intertwining.  And, at first, the many colorful creative adjectives that they had for many seeming details was refreshing and delightful to read.  Even when a horrible event happened, their colorful peripheral observations and descriptions would not cease.  As if continuously thinking to each other, making each other happy, despite real external unhappiness.  This dichotomy may have moved me to recommend the book after my first day's reading.<br /><br />Eventually, however, this type of illusory &#34;childishness&#34; that pervaded all descriptions felt psychotic and not necessarily childish at all.  Eventually, one realizes that there is very little emotion conveyed throughout all of the descriptions except for mere desensitization.<br /><br />The book is a downward spiral.  All of the many &#34;colorful&#34; adjectives eventually become repetitive and lose any life.<br /><br />By the time one gets to the tender scene between Ammu and Velutha, the reader herself is so desensitized that it is difficult to feel it.  All the physical descriptions become simply physical.<br /><br />And, there is so much physical description throughout the book.  A main &#34;villain&#34;, Baby Kochamma, is often described in thoroughly ugly terms -- though a long time ago she happened to be pretty.  Ammu and her twins, the protagonists, are coincidentally beautiful.  More charicaturization.<br /><br />I sought a human story, and I am disappointed.
B007FG9LIE|5|LOVE THIS BOOK... Kept  you on the edge of your seat.  Very good believable characters and a twisting every changing plot.  ( I have read ALL the book in the series and this was my first one).  Crouch weaves stories of terror and suspense that are NOT of a super natural nature, which makes them more believable and therefore more intriguing.<br /><br />It is a GREAT story.  You will NOT be disappointed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|This game is awesome , it's short but worth it. If you want something new, fresh, this is it. Tired of h o games.
B0059WTMLW|5|I've tried a lot of Sudoku games, so I didn't have much hope this would be any better than the rest, but I was WRONG!  This one is EXCEPTIONAL!  It really is the best I've ever played!<br /><br />I've never seen the variety of Sudoku games which are available in this one.  And the paper marks which can be turned on instantly (saving TONS of work on your part -- not to mention eliminating the chance for error) make it easy to play a quick game at the easy levels and let you jump straight into the deduction and elimination stages on the harder levels.<br /><br />And there's another big perk...the variety of levels and their increasing difficulty is PERFECTLY done!<br /><br />I have this one on the Home screen of both my phone and my Samsung tablet...and its not going to leave any time soon!<br /><br />If I had to come up with one small gripe, its that the Main Menu could be a little more detailed.  But that's being really picky on a fantastic version of the game.<br /><br />UPDATED THIS REVIEW ON 6/29 AS MY (MINOR) GRIPE ABOUT NOT HAVING MULTIPLE SAVE GAMES IS UNFOUNDED.  A multiple save game feature is indeed there.
B00002MZ4V|5|This is the music of John William as we recall form the movies .ride into battle with Luke or march with Darth Vader it is all here to hear
0887307280|5|Purchased this book as a gift but have had the opportunity to read it. It is a very informative book and I highly recommend it to everyone!
B00006J3T4|5|Great album!!  Its hard to compare Mark Knopfler's albums. They are all so great! This was the last for me to get around to adding to my collection of all of his Solo work cds & I was bummed I waited so long. Love how the album starts strong & exciting with Why Aye Man. :-)   Thank you. Very pleased with this purchase.
B00MIA0KGY|5|What can I say about Barbara that hasn't been said by so many others? Because of her partners and her voice the CD was outstanding. I never expected anything but!
B00J6YA1V4|4|If you like Anne Rice's vampire series, this is a must. I really enjoyed her writing.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good game.
B006LSZECO|4|The middle part pf the book was fascinating,gripping, engaging. I found the beginning slow and I disliked the end.
B00DJFIMW6|5|y'all need to try it! I had a lot of fun with this app everyone should get it! have fun playing this app!
B00AEBBA36|5|Amazing movie with a star studded cast. Also before mel went crazy.
B003M6EAXM|5|Season 8 lives up to the previous seasons of 24.  It's fast paced and keep you on the edge of your seat.
B001BKVWYG|5|Well done<br /><br />On time and just what we were looking for!  This will work very well for us.  Thank you for your service!
B00SM3VALA|5|great
B005HEDI3K|5|What is better than TOS?  brought back memories of when I was a kid and watching it on my old black and white tv.  Now I can watch it in HD
B00BRUQ7ZY|5|This is a book written from a very objective perspective by an author who has a Ph.D in the study of religions--ALL religions, not just one. He writes from an HISTORICAL perspective rather than the usual dogmatic perspective. I found it immensely readable and I learned a lot from it.
B001EN71CW|5|Loved this show when I first saw it on DVD, and the Blue-ray is even better!
B00A23MYCC|3|This movie was funny not as funny as I thought it would be as I am a Family Guy fan.<br />I thought the acting was not that good but could be due to the directing, maybe he should stick to cartoons.<br />Overall worth the watch.
B00384RX8W|5|add it to your movie collection - it is long but very very very well done.... you can't miss on this one
B009KWU6Q2|5|A great movie!
0345803485|5|The book was sooo good, I ordered the rest of the Trilogy.  Just fair warning - this book is not for your teenager!  Definitely  x-rated.
0316187216|4|This latest book is keeping the same driving line as the previous books by Abercrombie, a fantasy universe with very little magic and a lot of blood. A few characters have links with the earlier novels, the least spoiler being the band of mercenaries led by Cosca. However, despite reproducing a lot of features from the earlier books, Red Country is much more of a western, with several characteristics of the genre. From the duel to the wild pursuit to the wagon train to the confrontation between locals and settlers to the mushrooming gold-rush towns to the brothel madam. I am not very much into this literature so I did not like the book as much as The Heroes, still it makes for an enjoyable read The central characters are “grey” enough to be likely, the extension of the universe plausible and the only gap in the plot is the intervention of the mountain tribe of the Dragon People that just feel like a convenient trick to tie a lot of loose ends. Red Country could have been better and may signal that Joe Abercrombie should now consider a new universe and a new set of heroes, but I’d still recommend it!
0399226907|5|We (my 2 year old and I) enjoy reading this and we are able to follow along watching the animated version on netflix.
0321701763|5|This has been an excellent book. The directions are clear and easy to follow and I am learning a great deal. Well worth the money.

B00JOT3HQ2|5|This game is great, especially since its free.
B002DOSBMK|4|What an amazing adventure! Once I got past the Spider Queen, and the evilness this book talks about, I was able to finish reading it! Trust me the first 100 pages gave me nightmares. It was just a bit dark for my liking. But once I got past that, I just couldn't put it down. I love Drizzt! He shows that no matter how you grow up, or what your environment you're in, that as long as you a good moral compass, compassion, heart, and will, you can overcome anything! And that is just what he did! He overcame his upbringing, his mother and sisters, and the evil drow society he was born into. Good thing I have the second book already! I'm off to see what adventures awaits Drizzt!
B00CH26TL8|5|Love it
B00DPM7TIG|4|Excellent engagement of the reader into the story as well as into the setting in war time St Malo.  The main characters were believable and engaged the sympathy of the reader to their lives as defined by the war and it's effect on their lives.  I would definitely recommend this book.<br />St Malo has always been on my wish list to visit---even more so now.
B009LGO88E|5|got this piece of equipment for Monster Hunter mainly. its much better then using the virtual D pad or the new auto lock on in my opinion

6305165912|5|Quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. The dialogue is incredibly smart and witty the whole way through, and the film is full of priceless  moments and characters. One of those movies where you find something new  every time you watch it. Buy this movie...you will be happy you did.
B0019N8P2W|5|DVD in great shape, son loved it and I would order another product .<br />have let family know where to get this product

0307408868|5|It is always sad to read about history and find out how much could have been changed. However, we cannot judge other times and other folks decisions. I enjoy history so much and Larson has written many fine books. Thanks that he has done it again. We are not always in charge of our own lives, maybe never,but the brave people who were on this ship will be a grand inspiration to others.
B00HGJ18C2|2|Nice game but tooooo many adds
B001EN71DG|4|Maybe I'm not a Star Wars purist, but I've enjoyed the movies and so I have my kids.  Quality is great and I'm fine with the minor modifications.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy the original 3 again and maybe share them with the next generation.
B004QSQMKE|5|Love the beginning and the of the movie. I will buy somehting similar to it. the kids loved it., thanks
B0026NWBY2|4|Very good singing and a good cd .  I didn't realize what a good singer George Harrison was as a soloist.
B002KH4KSY|1|I will give the filmmakers credit in that they did try to stick a bit more closely to King's original short story...but that's a problem. It's a short story, under 20 pages in length, and they have to make a 90 minute film, so you know this thing will be padded to the gills.<br /><br />Right off the bat we see the kids of Gatlin, Nebraska in a tent revival being preached to by a very timid looking Isaac in 1963? I know I'm in trouble now..Isaac should be all \\"hellfire\\" & \\"damnation\\", and while this little actor may be saying the right things...he's too adorable. It's like listening to Cindy Brady read the lyrics to a death metal song, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />Flash forward to the mid-70's (of course, no one talks or looks like someone from the mid-70's), we meet a bickering couple on the backroads of Nebraska as they argue along a road passing a huge cornfield. The couple argues, and kid with a cut throat comes stumbling out of the corn, and as the couple argues, they hit the dying kid with their car. Getting of the car arguing, the couple walk over and argue over the corpse. While arguing about what to do next, they argue some more. Arguing, the couple put the dead body in the back of the car and decide to argue their way into Gatlin to find help, while arguing. Arguing, they arrive in Gatlin, and they argue getting out of the car, and argue themselves into a deserted diner where they argue. Finally they separate to look for help, and still manage to argue, even when they are not together. Pretty soon the kids show to murder these two...and thank god, I'm actually rooting for them to succeed just so the arguing will stop.<br /><br />Now we get a prolonged chase through the corn. Lots of running and ducking in the corn, so much running and ducking that our hero flashes back to Vietnam. The kids chase the guy through the corn, and they even have a flashback montage of all of the events from the opening of the movie...and we see some more arguing. They are still running through corn.<br /><br />This movie is just awful. I enjoyed the original Linda Hamilton, 80's slasher version of this tale, but this was a complete waste of time. Honestly, the first hour of this film is spent with this grating couple driving around arguing, and that is not an exaggeration. I'm not quite sure what they were going for, as you honestly begin to loathe these people, and hope to see them die just to shut them up! The casting is just so bad, with only the kid playing Malachai being somewhat decent, the rest of the kids are just awful. Toss in a bizarre and rather explicit sex scene, and the desperation by the filmmakers to shock just oozes out of the DVD player.<br /><br />Nothing to recommend, and I can see why King refused to have anything to do with movie.ll running through corn.<br /><br />This movie is just awful.

B000083C49|5|This is the highest grossing Star Trek movie to date, and for good reason. It's funny, and has a socially-conscious theme. I just wish they included the Director's Edition interview with Leonard Nimoy from the first dvd release.
B00005KA9G|5|I was quite impressed with this story centering on a hard-luck post industrial town and its desperate but likeable inhabitants.<br />The main character represents a type we are all familiar with, a man who believes that charm alone will bring him all he wants and needs...until his ex-wife puts his back to the wall with a threat to withdraw access to his young son unless he starts paying court ordered child support.<br />This slick slacker is someone you'd be hard pressed to find sympathy for until you understand the very deep love for his son battling the Peter Pan immaturity of his nature.<br />What a wonderful light bulb clicking moment when he finds his ex accompanied by his luckless pal's wife at a Chippendale type entertainment. <br />Believing his own talents equal to the money making muscle bound strippers, he sets off on a journey of self-discovery dragging his skeptical but loyal young son along.<br />As he ensnares one after another of the down-on-their-luck former employees of the defunct factory into his get rich by getting naked scheme, each unknowingly becomes the kind of man he didn't believe possible.<br />But will this timid team of cash poor prancers go the whole way in front of everyone they know? I won't spoil the ending but beyond going \\"the full monty\\", they reveal more to themselves than the town.
B009R659L8|5|Very intriguing.
078689136X|4|Richard Castle books are a lot like potato chips--you can't read just one. As soon as I finished Heat Wave (see review) I started craving another Castle book, and I caved in within a couple of days and started Naked Heat. It was pure indulgence, and I loved every sinful page of it.<br /><br />This story starts with Lt. Nikki Heat and her two detectives Raley and Ochoa discovering Jameson Rook at the scene of a recent homicide, listening to his iPod, with the body of the victim in the next room. (Any resemblances between events in the book and episodes of seasons 2 and 3 of Castle are undoubtedly intentional).<br /><br />Heat hasn't seen her former shadow and occasional lover, journalist Rook, for a few months. Not since his article in First Press magazine about his \\"ride-along\\" with her and her detectives was published. That article made her the focus of the piece, and brought her a lot of unwanted attention. Nikki only wants to be a cop, not a media darling. And the article made her look like a one-woman crimefighter, totally shortchanging her team.<br /><br />No one at the Precinct really wanted to see Rook again. He'd screwed all of them in that article, one way or another.<br /><br />But the dead body in the next room was Cassidy Towne, mud-slinging gossip-raker extraordinaire...and Jameson Rook's current subject. Without, as he explained to Nikki, the sex.<br /><br />Even if none of the team wanted Rook back, they needed him this time. He was the insider, both in the publishing world, and on the subject of Cassidy Towne's current projects and potential enemies.<br /><br />So they were stuck with Rook after all, trying to charm his way into everyone's good graces again, and back into Nikki's bed. All the while, trying to help the police solve the case of Cassidy Towne's death before the killer strikes again.<br /><br />Escape Rating B: I was struck by how much Nikki Heat reminds me of Eve Dallas in the J.D. Robb In Death series. And through Dallas, Sigrid Harald from Margaret Maron's series as well. The tough female detective with the damaged past who builds a family out of the members of her precinct house, and eventually finds love in a most unlikely place. Nikki, Eve and Sigrid are all sisters under the skin.<br /><br />But if Nikki is an avatar for Eve Dallas, Jameson Rook is no Roarke. Not on Rook's best day and Roarke's worst. I like Jameson Rook as a character, but there's no resemblance. The analogy just doesn't stretch that far, in spite of the similar names.<br /><br />Jameson Rook, unlike Richard Castle, is a magazine writer, and presumbly doesn't make as comfortable a living. So Rook has to supplement his earnings by writing under a pseudonym. And what does Jameson Rook write, and as whom? Under the name Victoria St. Clair, Jameson Rook writes romance novels. And he's not the first fictional hero to make his living this way, either. In Tanya Huff's Blood series, Victoria Nelson's vampire partner, Henry Fitzroy, also wrote historical romances. I keep imagining Henry and Rook meeting at a romance writers' convention. It would have to be at night, of course.<br /><br />I read this just for fun. And did I ever have fun.

B000EJ9MTW|5|Being a fan of new and old rock and roll, i constantly have to listen to my high school friends complain about how todays rock and roll sucks. Since i'm listening to new music, i stumbled on to Wolfmother way before them and passed the word on. Needless to say they were hooked, and often quoted how \\"rock and roll was back\\" even though it really never left. This is clearly a work that rock and roll fans of all kinds can celebrate. Great songs, one after another. Mind's Eye, Woman are solid downloads if you're looking to explore while with White Unicorn, Where the Eagle Have Been, Joker and the Theif they are all single worthy material. The album starts and doesnt stop. The lead singer says in White Unicorn \\"we can live in another time, we could live together\\" and with this record rock and roll fans can, and they can feel happy as hell about it.  <br />
B00HB62MC0|5|One of my favorite Colleen books.

B00AK57N00|5|Great game to occupy for short periods of time.  Actually gets quite difficult at the later stages and requires quite a bit of feel, but for the duration we played it, it was fun and challenging
B0015DROBO|5|Read this on a bus across the country and couldn't put it down. Finished the entire novel in under 12 hours. Literally could. not. put. it. down.
B003F5WOEC|3|The vinyl is so dirty and has some scratches. The sound quality is good, but is uncomfortable hearing the skips.
B000003TAW|5|I can't begin to describe the feeling I get whenever I hear those opening finger picking notes on the acoustic guitar ridden song \\"My name is Jonas.\\" The Blue album is the apex of what music means to me. All the tracks are phenomenally written Pop gems. This album will never get old to me. I'm buying a copy for my nephew when he turns 8 years old. I was 8 years old in 1994 when it came out. Don't listen to a single negative review of the blue album if you ever come across one. This is music from a great band that hit it right on the head with this release. Go and buy Blue, you will not be dissapointed in the LEAST bit.

6305126062|1|The old Little House on the Praire view of the west, with Redford shot through six inches of cheesecloth and nothing but handsome, straight-talking honest folk in sight - no racists, or world wrestling  federation fans in 4X4s, or gun nuts. This idealized version of Montana is  contrasted with the city, with its neurotic vegetarians. (The movie,  incidentally, is a paean to the beef industry.) Anyone who really lives in  the country (I don't mean on a sprawling ranch like Rob Redford) will  recognize the Hollywood sham straight off, but people must have their myths  I suppose... unbearable.

B00A2H9X6I|3|For 38 years the original Carrie has remained one of the greatest horror movies ever made, a shining example of not only how to adapt a book into a movie, but also how to make you....Fear, so it was inevitable that a remake would be made.<br /> To not compare this film to the original is impossible. Brian De Palma's version is an immersive experience, a psychological assault on the mind, you feel what Carrie White feels. Chloe Grace Moretz is an incredible actress, but her Carrie doesn't quite project her fears and emotions into us like Sissy Spacek's did.<br />  In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie, the mother(played by Julianne Moore) nearly lacks the controlling dominance the original had over Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz's Carrie right from the start doesn't hardly fear her mother, but instead shes defiant towards her, hates her, and this is what separates this new Carrie from the original. Brian De Palma's Carrie FEARS and Kimberly Peirce's Carrie HATES.<br /> For the most part the majority of the middle of this film plays out almost identically to that of De Palma's, the actors are the only real difference. Some of the new actors are good and some are just terrible, like Judy Greer(Miss Desjardin / the P.E. teacher), she sounds so week and juvenile when shes speaking her lines it's hard to take her seriously as an authority figure.<br /> Lets fast forward to the prom scene. In Brian De Palma's Carrie after winning prom queen and king Carrie and Tommy Ross head up to the stage, this scene is gloriously shot in slow motion, eventually the blood gets poured on her and she goes into a state of absolute shock, the only sound that can be heard is the bucket swaying back and forth, then the bucket falls and hits Tommy in the head knocking him unconscious, in her state She takes no notice of whats happened to Tommy as the overwhelming fear that has enveloped her causes her to lose control unleashing her powers on all her school mates. In Kimberly Peirce's Carrie...well lets faceit, the prom scene lacks the build up of the original, no slow motion, no sounds of a swaying bucket, how this scene was shot by De Palma is what made the original so fantastic. Kimberly Peirce's Carrie somewhat figures out how to control her powers, unlike De Palma's who's powers mainly activated out of fear. This time when the blood is poured on her head she doesn't go into shock, instead she nearly walks off stage before turning around after Tommy is hit by the bucket. This pushes her emotions over the edge and in a fully aware state of mind she unleashes her powers on her class mates.<br /> I personally feel nothing for Kimberly Peirce's version of Carrie, it may have followed the plot of the book a little closer in some areas, but it did it with far less sophistication. It has some unique changes that make it worth a watch, but ultimately it doesn't come close to the brilliance of the original.
B004P7CNUY|3|This review is for the Echo Bridge single-feature DVD release of Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.<br /><br />First off, I strongly prefer H20 to all of the other sequels - so much so that I actually only really like three films in the series - Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween H20. The beauty of H20 is that it ignores the increasingly bizarre and unbelievable events of Halloween 3-6 and brings the focus back to the series' original protagonist, Laurie Strode, played once again by Jamie Lee Curtis. Smart, modern (even today), and full of plenty of shocks and surprises, Jamie Lee proves why she is the ultimate Final Girl of the horror genre.<br /><br />When Disney and Miramax parted ways, home video distribution of their film titles became very scattered. Most of the studio's prestige titles like the original Scream trilogy, The Others, Chicago, and others are handled by Lionsgate entertainment, and the content of the home video re-releases generally remains the same as their original releases from Disney. Anchor Bay has released some titles too, including Scream 4. A good amount of titles, however, have been licensed to budget company Echo Bridge, which has been a well-known company among the $5 WalMart bin and $1 DVD rack aficionados for a long time now. These days, Echo Bridge and Mill Creek are branching out beyond the public domain fare and licensing more titles from major studios to varying results.<br /><br />I had actually bought a 4-movie set called Masters Of Terror from Echo Bridge featuring four horror sequels from Dimension Films that included H20 for $5 at a local grocery store that was packaged with Echo Bridge's DVD of From Dusk Till Dawn. All four films, as is typical for the company, are squeezed onto a single dual-layer disc. Despite compression, most films in the set are watchable, but H20 had a very choppy laggy feel during motion. Felt like a badly encoded AVI file one would have downloaded off a torrent. Not to mention each film only has fourchapters.<br /><br />When I came on here and saw that the standalone DVD was $2, I figured it might be worth it, and hoped it'd be better, and it was. The motion is definitely smoother on this disc, and Echo Bridge is far more generous with the chapter stops, giving the film 15 of them this time. Other issues remain, such as dirt, specks, DNR, MPEG2 general issues, etc. And yes, it's not the theatrical aspect ratio - it's been opened up (NOT cropped) to 16:9. While I'd rather have the original 2.35:1 composition, I'm ok with this as no information is lost AND it's anamorphic, which is the one advantage this disc has over the original disc from Disney. Audio is 2.0, but I only have a 2-speaker setup so I'm ok with this, but since the film IS mixed in 5.1, it'd only make sense for them to use that. And one does wish subtitles were available, as well as the bonus materials from the previous DVD.<br /><br />I'd recommend spending $4-$5 at the most for this DVD, which has a list price of $6.99. The film could stand a better disc, both SD and HD, from a bigger company like Lionsgate, which would have at the least retained previous bonus materials, the 5.1 audio mix, 2.35:1 composition, and offered subtitles. But for a few bucks, it's not a bad purchase. For $2, I'm happy with this disc.
B00A0NOF7G|3|Very short story, quick to fall in love and solve the murder, no mystery to it.  Her Blackmore sisters series was great and kept you guessing,<br />but even n that she likes her &#34;girls&#34; matched up quickly.

B003VANOFY|1|I have 0 good things to say about these headphones.<br /><br />Pros:<br />None, they look cool?<br /><br />Cons:<br />Low battery life, even fully charged I feel like I'm constantly hearing the low battery alert.<br />Uncomfortable, these things hurt after wearing them for an hour or two.<br />Microphone is horrible, mine doesn't work at all, very quiet with no easy fixes from logitech.<br />If you're going to use these for gaming find another pair, footsteps and other directional sounds do not work at all.<br />When I play a game like Arma 3 I have no idea where a vehicle or helicopter is approaching from. At most it will give me a very general direction, but you'll never tell whether it's in front left or behind right.<br />Buttons are clunky, seem to have random uses that aren't useful.<br />Power button works 50% of the time.<br />Volume dial doesn't work very well, has lag issues that will kick in whenever they feel like it.<br />These headphones also have an issue with humming and crashing for several minutes. You have to force exit out of the logitech button to maybe fix this. Otherwise you just have to keep pressing the power button and waiting it out.<br /><br />If I had known these would be this bad I would have selected a different company and a different headset. Logitech technical support isn't helpful and their headsets aren't as nice as they would like people to believe.
B00004YZFR|5|I confess that I'm a sucker for all things Maysles, but this might have been their finest moment (with the possible exception of \\"Salesman\\"). The combination of their unique documentary technique, the inherent mystique of the Rolling Stones, and the tragic events of Altamont make for a film you can't turn your eyes away from. We all know what happened, and yet you find yourself spellbound as the events unfold, and they still seem fresh--and sad--when they happen. Wisely, the Maysles avoided commentary, either on the Stones themselves or the individuals involved in the melee. You, the viewer, are left to merely watch what happened and make up your own mind. Regardless of where you come down, this is an invaluable and fascinating historical document of a day that, for all intents and purposes, spelled the end of the lovefest of the 60's.
B00IF943GA|1|I just wasted $5 on a game that conks out at start even when I'm online.<br />I tested this on a third generation Fire HDX.<br />This needs to be fixed.

0792156684|3|When Titanic was released, it became one of the largest grossing movies of  all time. The reason? No, it wasn't great acting- nor was it good plot or  accurate historical portrayal. In the end, this movie succeeded for two  major reasons: great computer graphics, and hype.<br />I'm not trying to bash  this movie, nor am I saying that it is completely without its merits. All I  am saying is that it is definitely NOT one of the best movies of all time.  It was an alright movie, that deserved some credit. I mean, a lot of effort  was put into it, and it did have its moments. The portrayal of the ship  itself, along with its infamous sinking was great. However, this movie just  doesn't live up to its publicity.<br />I believe that when James Cameron set  out to make this movie he wanted to create a film of epic proportions. He,  at least partially, did achieve this goal. However, it did not become an  epic because of phenomonal moviemaking, original plot, or great acting. It  became an epic because of the wonderfully contrived plot, together with the  infamous Titanic story and some famous actors. I mean, come on- boy from a  poor background meets high society girl who is dissatisfied- romance  ensues, despite previous engagements, and later comes to a tragic end.  We've seen this kind of story before- yet we accept it as great. This  appears to be one of the best historical examples of people &quot;jumping  on the bandwagon&quot;.<br />The movie also had many flaws- much of the  historical information is innacurate, and the character's decisions are  often not believable. And, for the record: there is absolutely no chemistry  between Leonardo and Kate- they look like what they really are; actors. The  entire plot is much too predictable, and doesn't convey much sense of  realism.<br />In the end, this movie is alright, and one viewing of it is  fine, though there's no reason to waste any more time on it. I'd say rent  it, don't buy it.
B008S4YZCO|5|its a really awesome game i like how you.can get your own monster and stuff. i amlike glued to it every time i play it
B00GEEB9YC|5|Sam Harris's first book, The End of Faith, was a fearless demolition not only of organized religion, but of the very notion of having faith (i.e. belief without evidence) in certain books, factual propositions, and historical figures. After dealing with topics including a brief history of Christianity, the current collision between Islam and the west, and the American culture war, the book dove into an exploration of spiritual experience that shattered my naive preconceptions regarding the topic. Sam's new book,Waking Up, is a book-length treatment of that subject, but don't worry - it's not simply a retread. In this book, you will find: a fascinating discussion of the &#34;split-brain&#34; phenomenon and its implications for the nature of consciousness and the ego; succinct and straight-forward instructions on how to meditate successfully; advice on how to avoid charlatans while searching for a spiritual teacher; and a discussion of the utility and potential risks of psychadelic pharmacology. If you, like me, have made a commitment not to believe anything on faith, but are nonetheless interested in exploring the nuggets of contemplative wisdom which (some) religions have been mining for centuries, this book is the perfect starting point. And if you think that spirituality is either a) complete bupkiss or b) not attainable without swearing fealty to a deity, then I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Prepare to have your preconceptions shattered.
B00C7KXUOE|5|Will really mess with  your head :)  Still can't believe this was broadcast on network tv.
B003QS9TKU|5|I grew up loving this movie and was excited to share it with my kids. They did not have the same reaction to it as I did unfortunately. And I could get them to sit through the movie (yet) but it has so many great messages about acceptance and love and also great layers for conversation (world war II, religion and spirituality ) will try again with them when they are a little older

B0007Y08IS|5|Team America reinforces the idea that sometimes simple is just better. Trey Parker and his associates show \\"South Park\\" showed that a piece of colored construction paper cutouts could turn into the lovable character named \\"Cartman\\". I love the simple stuff. I'm tired of all these big budget movies and then I leave the theatre and it wasn't even good. Lets take things back to the basics. I like this movie. What I like most about it is that its \\"cheezy\\". I love cheezy movies. These hollywood guys think that you need to spend 50 million to make a good movie. I think thats crap. Look at movies like \\"Team America, \\"FDTV\\" and \\"South Park\\". These show you that it doesn't take a big budget to make timeless classics. I love this kinda stuff!
B0086DBE62|1|There were a lot of things that could have been great with this movie...but they just never made it to the screen!  Oh well, it was fun at least but not a movie you watch over and over.

Can you believe my dismay when I tried to play it in my DVD player and it wouldnt play as it is only for US regions. Amazon should know this and should have sent me an Australian able copy. Not happy!!!
1628600543|5|This is a book everyone should read at least once in their life. It has opened my eyes to treat my body better and what I am putting in it. A must read!!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Easy to setup! Recommended!<br /><br />The setup for desktop should remove the requirement for a wifi connection since casting is possible via LAN
B001TXWJ4M|4|Just a great story with fantastic acting! I highly recommend this series. I've watched them all on my Amazon Kindle fire, most enjoyable.
B008FPOIT6|4|I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me of The DaVinci Code. The book didn't really dwelve very deeply into the characters beyond superficial personality traits but it wasn't necessary for the story line.
B00H2EQFBK|5|This is history and real documentary movie, very Detailed... director is like god of Viking...!!
B00EMXBDMA|5|Science and adventure blended beautifully.
B008B1VYP0|5|While not as good an album as their past two, Maroon 5 has yet again produced another winner. There are many songs on this album that are worth the collective expense to purchase it, my favorite being &#34;Sad&#34;. If you like Maroon 5, this cannot be left out from your collection.

B008602KQI|5|Classic &#34;good triumphs over evil&#34; tale presented in an entertaining way with just the right amount of suspense and mystery. Excellent character casting. One of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time.

0784011796|5|under donnie darko and natural born killers.<br />this is a really ODD movie.  things seem to happen to this guy for NO APPARENT REASON...and it does answer your questions at the end, however, just as in donnie darko, you hafta be smart enough to realize they're giving you answers.  <br />if you dig psychological freak-out movies, check this one out.
B002VECLVO|5|This is the first film since \\"I've Loved You So Long\\" that I went to bed thinking about, woke up thinking about and am still thinking about.<br /><br />It's a \\"day in the life\\" story set in the early '60s about a middle aged English professor  who has lost his longtime lover in a car crash, sees nothing in his future and intends this day to be his last.  As his otherwise everyday-day goes on, it attains increasing vibrancy as it becomes more and more clear that everything and everyone he sees this day he'll never see again and that only he and we know that.<br /><br />I rented it because I'm a big fan of Firth, Moore & Goode, all of whom were just superb, as was Nicholas Hoult, the now nearly grown up kid from \\"About a Boy.\\"  But I fell in love with it for Ford's marvelous screen adaptation and direction of this Christopher Isherwood story. It could easily have turned into one of those films I re-rent every couple of years or so, but I'm buying a copy instead,  in large measure because of this Tom Ford comment on the \\"making of\\" extra:  He said \\"If I can get the audience to leave the theater and think 'Wow! I need to pay more attention to my day, because this is all I get!' then I think the film will have meant something.\\"  I've decided that what that means for me is that  I need Ford's movie available to snap me back to attention whenever needed. Which I suspect will be far too often.

0345363132|5|Although Penman may be paying court to the Richard III Society, the controversy is strengthened (I still think he killed the kids). OK, so I'm not very open minded on Richard.....but Penman had me convinced throughout the read that I was wrong. This speaks well for her reputation as one of the best historical novelists. This is where she started. Her special genius lies in the bright and shining historical detail that she can weave into both plot and dialog (she's a very good student of history and at times is absolutely brilliant in conveying to us the workings of medieval minds).<br />I have no problem with Penman's romantic feelings about her heros. From Eleanor in the 1st trilogy to Joanna in Here Be Dragons to her raising the standard of Simon de Montfort as a visionary (but historically too early) icon of democracy, she does use them as a vehicle to carry forward a dynamic presentation of history....all in the best traditions of the historical novel.<br />Penman's true genius is the broad historical scope that is painted on top of the shimmering details of brief moments. It truely does feel as if you are living the story yourself, and it is this bringing us readers in as witnesses that stands as Penman's contribution to the art of the historical<BR>novel.<br />If you prefer to read in chronological order:<BR>1101-1154 When Christ And His Saints Slept (Vol 1 of Trilogy)<BR>1156-1171 Time And Space (Vol 2 of Trilogy)<BR>12th Cent Devil's Brood (Vol 3 of Trilogy)- not yet released<BR>1192-1193 The Queen's Man<BR>1193 Cruel As The Grave<BR>1183-1232 Here Be Dragons (Vol 1 of Welsh Trilogy)<BR>1231-1267 Falls The Shadow (Vol 2 of Welsh Trilogy)<BR>1271-1283 The Reckoning (Vol 3 of Welsh Trilogy)<BR>1459-1492 The Sunne In Splendour

B001F12J48|1|I just upgraded to the new 3D TVs, and wanted to get a movie to test it out.  I did a search on Amazon for &#34;3D&#34; movies, and this one popped up.  Great movie, so why not?  Well, turns out it's the old version of 3D, with the red and blue glasses.  So, if you're looking for the new technology, this is not the movie you want.
B00000J631|5|Short Music for Short People gives you great bands doing what punk bands do, playing 30 second songs.  Great bands like h2o, pennywise, sick of it all, the misfits, nofx, bad religion, black flag, the descendents and any  other punk band you can think of. Buy it!!!!

B0015KO52S|5|This album has stayed in rotation on my MP3 player for longer than any album I can recall in a long time, and almost every song has made it on to one of my song mixes. Other reviewers have already described why, I just can't resist adding my props and vote for five stars.

B00ET0PZDO|5|Me and my son have had a blast playing this and look forward to many more. Thanks for putting it up for free!!
B000BTC5LW|5|Amazing concert. The lighting and sound come together nearly perfectly. My 20-year-old son watched this (he is a Korn, Metallica etc fan) and was simply amazed by it. He said he has never seen or heard anything like it. The Run Like Hell finale is stunning. To hear and see that kind of end to a concert and then see these older guys and band members wearing sweaters and ties was something else!
B005T9ZTSU|4|Flickr is one of the first social media sites I joined when I was new to the net. Back in the day, the site was very user-friendly, even for the non-techy that I was - and still am in many ways. I was mostly a lurker in those days, trying to learn the ropes and getting ideas of how to contribute and fit in. I mostly hung out in the artists communities and the photos and images that were shared there were easily accessible.  I can vouch for the customer service which as been very helpful to me when some problem or question has come up. It is a great place for artists and other creative people can hang out.
B00DQEB1V4|1|I was excited about this stylus.  Unfortunately, a $1.00 stylus works better.  The bluetooth refused to stay connected even when using with recommend app (Write Pad for example).  The bluetooth would not stay connected for other apps.  The multi-tasking was turned off, control center within apps was turned off, and bluetooth turned on.  What a disappointment.  I am writing this review to alert others this pen acts like a beta version at best and other options are better out there, i.e. the $1 stylus.
B0000TB03W|5|Incredible performance. A must have. One of the best concert of the 2003. Awaiting for the next one.
B004Q7CIFI|5|Another masterpiece by Mr. King, it's really hard to stop reading, and you'll find yourself craving to read just one more page.  I really recommend it.
1101946342|5|People need to understand that this book is a rewrite of the original which is why, of course, it's so similar. It gives more insighton Christian's general attitude towardhis previous submissives as opposed to his attitude toward Ana. It also features episodes of the graphic nightmares he suffers from and how his dreams take a different course when he sleeps with Ana and his relationships with Elena and his family and how he bonds with certain characters differently. But what i like the most about his version is the unfamiliar sensation of love overtaking his senses and doesn't understand the feeling of falling in love. I thought that was a really sweet aspect. And lastly his version ends on a much more positive note that Ana's. I highly recommend it.
B00L9B7IKE|5|There's nothing I love more than a book I just can't put down!  This was one of them!
B008CLI4N4|2|Just watched the first four hours of season 1. The story is compelling to a certain extent, but I choose to stop watching it now, before I get sucked into more soulless sex and vicious brawling. I can't believe people let their children watch this stuff.  I loved House of  Cards and Homeland, shows with plenty of violence, but probably not very appealing to kids. In  Game of Thrones, very young people, even young children, are right there with the adults brawling and slashing and murdering.  Was life really that brutal centuries ago? Sure. But why encourage that kind of brutality to return?  Anyway, after four hours of  Game of Thrones, the net-net was feeling rather down and depressed the next day. Not OK with me.  I wanted to add that I got this from the library; very glad I didn't spend  money on it.
B00H71PBQ8|5|This series continues to surprise and keep you wanting to see more
B0010SKUYM|5|I received this book as a gift from a friend. As he is not someone typically prone to this type of recommendation I quickly dove in. This book is a treasure. It is a breath of fresh air in a genre I had started to lose hope with. Read it now.
B00PRXAGR2|1|Pure crap!
B0071XO8RA|4|In most books I read, it takes an hour or so to get immersed in the story.  This immediately captured my attention and held it to the end.  Great story and great storytelling!
0385504225|3|Loved the Da Vinci Code, despite the controversy, liked very much Angels and Demons and was mostly bored silly by The Lost Symbol. Its feels recycled and plodding. Da Vinci was so exciting and moved like lightening. Maybe the character of Langdon is burned out, but it felt really slow and false. Still there are interesting bits and enjoyable semantic revelations, but as a whole it was not nearly as good as his previous work. The revelation of the villain at the end (figured it out hundreds of pages prior) had the feel of a Scooby Doo episode where the villain is unmasked at the end.
B000HCO83G|3|Excellent special effects, of course.  And yet, where's the excitement? <br />Hollywood writers/ directors need to stop pretending all sci-fi and  <br />fantasy films need to be formated for the intellect of a 10 year old.  <br />Worth seeing, but don't get excited about seeing this Last Stand ... the  <br />writers may have felt inspired but somehow the studio managed to kill that emotion ... maybe it's just too much to inspire kids, lot's of action is better, eh?  For good action, excitement and a thought provoking plot, try the movie Equalibrium ... even the title get's you  <br />thinking. <br />
B00KLF5J64|5|Super cool mix, exactly as the title claims.
B00F8GYC1Y|4|there's something strangely fun about shooting little bird balls from a slingshot into a fort full of little piggy balls...having them dressed up in star wars costumes with related powers makes it even better.
B0020BUWX2|3|This was ok. I didn't realize how short the story was.
B000BKDOCA|5|There are only a two tracks on this album that are not great, those being the Me Against the Music remix and the Baby One More Time.  Other than that, it's a great album that I would recommend.
0439023521|5|OMG! The twists, turns, and suspense in this book are unreal. Such a book deserves special recognition. If you read any other review about The Hunger Games, they will probably agree. This story has suspense, darkness, action, and a just a hint of romance all culminated in one novel. Once you start reading, there is no going back. You will most likely breeze through this novel. You would be on chapter 5 but you will probably feel as if you have only been reading for a minute. This is a fantasy novel. However, the idea of society is pretty relevant in this book. The Hunger Games is about a girl who must overcome many obstacles and challenges in order to stay alive. That is a straight-up summary of this book. However, the ending is very interesting. This lovely novel will really make you think and infer your own ideas a lot. This review is different than all the others because I will tell you that the main character, Katniss, is strong and brave, and doesn't give a damn what the world thinks of her. She is what makes this whole story make you keep on reading. If you like people standing up for others and what they believe in, this book is a good choice. Anyone can relate to this book due to the social diversity in it. This novel is a must read! I also recommend reading the whole trilogy. You won't regret it.

0345535529|5|came wrapped still in box it looks great not marks or anything the art on the side is really cool to fromthe show perfect for any bookshelf
B00006690G|5|This CD is one of the best CD's ever released it is a must buy! If you have any since at all you'll love this CD with a passion. The only song thats not all that good is \\"My Dad's gone Crazy\\" but that is the only one that is not good, and thats not too bad! Don't listen to the stupid guy talkin about its not good because with songs like \\"super man, without me, Halies Song, Square Dance, Cleanin out my Closet\\", and others. THIS CD IS A MUST BUY, YOU CAN LISTEN TO THIS \\"MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY, YO!\\"
B002VECLVO|5|This was simply a beautiful love story.  It addresses the grief and despair of the loss of a loved one.  It has nothing to do with  homosexual or straight.  It is just a love story.  Acting superb.  Highly recommend.
1601257155|1|Most of this book is characterized by the same problems that plague words of power,not being finished and not going far enough. It is the only pathfinder book I find myself wishing I had not purchased.<br /><br />The rather puzzling choice to make two of the three &#34;Unchained&#34; classes a variety of nerfs is very disappointing as well. After this book I will no longer buy any Paizo book before looking through a copy. A sad departure from the regular books in the &#34;Core&#34; line.
B0038IYKYI|5|Good things come to those who work hard and keep their word. All star cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, Rosie Perez.
0802411401|4|An excellent book when it isn't beating you over the head with the author's Christian and heteronormative rhetoric...without these flaws (hence the four stars, rather than five), the book would be a boon to ALL human beings, regardless of their religious or sexual orientation. That being said, it helped me enormously to put into perspective my (hetero) romantic relationships in order to see how they worked and where they failed..<br /><br />Probably the best residual outcome of understanding these love languages is that one begins to see how these ideas can cross over into one's non-romantic relationships with friends and family.

B000002JPA|5|I was lost in the 70's and eighties when it came  to hard rock and metal music and I was fortunate enough to be turned on to Dream Theatre by a friend of mine close to 4 years ago. I was listening to this album for the first time ,when my best friend was fighting cancer and through prayer, positive thinking and the music of Dream Theatre, it helped carry me through the rough time. I might add that my friend beat cancer. Anyway, it's so refreshing to see such talented musicians as Dream Theatre create positive and such creative music that  isn't what I would call angry, aggressive heavier rock that is so popular today. Dream Theatre is right up there with my favorites such as Van Halen, UFO, Joe Satriani and Jimi Hendrix to name a few.  Pull Me Under, Another Day and Under A Glass Moon are my 3 favorite tracks on this album.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes hard, progressive virtuoso rock. You won't be disappointed.
0140177396|5|Superbly written, powerful.  I am still amazed at being moved so much by so few words.
B00EW9GQR6|2|i love lady gaga but this album is horrible. only a few decent songs, applause NOT being one of them. what a let down.
B002U5HKZ6|5|Shantaram is a wonderful story of a criminal who has a nurturing side and ends up helping bring medicine to the slums of India then runs forgeries into Afghanistan. A wonderful tale. Gets a bit stale in the middle but picks right back up. Sent it with my husband for his time overseas. It's a long book but you want to read every page! It's also been passed through out my friends who have all loved it and we still rave about it to others. Not easily forgotten.
B004EPYZSU|5|When this movie was first announced, a lot of people were expecting it to flop because of its title, because, well, it does seem dumb at first. But honestly, how better to name a movie based on its plot? But, happily, there is so much more to Cowboys & Aliens than just aliens battling Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig. When a man wakes up with no memory of who he is or why he's in the small town of Absolution, with a strange metal bracelet on his wrist, he seeks out answers, only to be arrested for being the famous criminal Jake Lonergan. But, when he meets a mysterious woman (Olivia Wilde), things pick up speed. Col. William Dolarhyde shows up to collect Lonergan, only to be attacked by aliens, along with the rest of the town. Then, they must team together to find out what these beings want, and why some of the citizens were captured.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau, who brought us Iron Man, Cowboys & Aliens is an adaptation of the Platinum Comics story of the same name. Some might go into it thinking they're gonna see a mindless, action-packed thrill ride, but it actually is more character-driven and complex than that. Harrison Ford's Dolarhyde is easily his best character since Deckard from Blade Runner (after Indiana Jones and Han Solo). A man scarred by battle and death, he does what he can to keep his reputation up, and his son out of trouble, who is captured by the creatures. Daniel Craig's Lonergan is partly the classic Western hero, bearing resemblance to Eastwood's \\"Man with No Name,\\" but also more modern characters too. Olivia Wilde's character, Ella, is really good too, there being more to her than meets the eye. When the movie first starts, it doesn't feel like a Western/Sci-fi hybrid, but a straight-up Western for the first ten minutes. Jon's directing here definitely shows his skill, and improvement into being a great Hollywood director. The script, with five writers attached, was actually very impressive. While the third act had some of the standardfight and battle scenes any action/sci-fi blockbuster usually comes with, it does feel more satisfying than most, as the conflict is resolved without any Deus Ex Machina scenarios or clichés. Plus, the characters (as said before) are very well-written, and very likable. There are, of course, some cheesy parts and goofy moments, but what damn good blockbuster doesn't have them? The visual effects were incredible, and I have no clue why they weren't given the Oscar nomination (Hugo was nothing compared to this, even if it was a good movie). The cinematography was great, as well, showing off the Old West in a very big way, paying homage to the older westerns. Then, the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams was just spectacular. It has both Western elements and great emotional investment, bringing heart and soul into the violent chaos.<br /><br />In the end, Cowboys & Aliens is not for everyone, but is a well-made movie that must be seen by sci-fi, action and western fans. Even the comedy here is well-written. It's sad that this was a flop, because, if it wasn't for the stupidity of \\"judging a book by its cover,\\" we might have gotten a sequel because, how the movie was given to us, it was possible.<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars
B000002J0B|4|Like the middle son in a family in which both the elder (Led Zeppelin [IV]) and younger (Physical Graffiti) get all the praise, Led Zeppelin's 1973 album Houses of the Holy is an oft overlooked piece of the collection.  But there's no question that the album is strong, piecing together a variety of styles and approaches in what was Zep's first album where they wrote all of the songs, rather than reinterpreting a couple of blues classics.<br /><br />It isn't my \\"go to\\" Zep album...in fact, it's well down the list.  But it is my favorite Zep to spin when I'm feeling like listening to some laid back music.

B00H71PHS0|5|Downton Abbey has everything Brit: the domestic pecking order, the wonderfully hide-bound attitudes, the unhurried lives of the leisure class.  Besides that, it is a spiffing good tale, with the ins and outs of the characters you come to love---even Thomas!  I recommend it with all of my anglophilic heart.

B003G4W49C|5|Plenty has already been said about Card's masterpiece, &#34;Ender's Game.&#34; Thus, I shall not repeat what has already been reviewed exhaustively.<br /><br />I will instead focus on the technique the author used along with his voice and the political allegory involved.<br /><br />I would first like to praise the author's use of the third person unlimited perspective, shifting between that and limited in flawless fashion. The flow between the &#34;god&#34;-like perspective and the individual POVs of each of the viewpoint characters is seamless and flows like a river through a valley floor. There are no jarring moments where one has to pause to figure out how one arrived from dealing with the politics on earth to a sudden battle that has materialized in the blackness of space. The children, being geniuses, and the officers, being masterminds, provide the perfect vehicles for the delivery of this narrative. This author most definitely knows how to use each character's different knowledges, wisdoms, and ignorances to his advantage, weaving a story that is incomplete one moment, and then complemented by another character in a different point of view. I thank you, Orson Scott Card, for a wonderful experience in this aspect.<br /><br />The author's voice is also very smooth and devoid of poor word choice. The shifts between the objective narrator and the subjective thoughts of the characters are executed with excellence. No communication is lost in the conveyance of both story and characterization within the same paragraph. Ah, but perhaps the paragraphs are where I would subtract some points for being much longer than usual, though I refrain from doing so as this book was written long before another different kind of Games. Nowadays, we have much shorter paragraphs crafted for varying effects.<br /><br />***Potential Spoiler Here***<br />Card's political allegory, involving both domestic affairs on earth and interstellar affairs, will never become obsolete. They are more relevant now than ever, as we are in an age in which information circles the globe at light speed, bringing to illumination such offenses as the persecutions of the Karen and Rohingya in what is now called Myanmar, the regular massacres and non-illegal war rapes committed daily in the numerous African nations, the never-ending oppression of the North Korean people. Card does not deal with these individual issues on a micro level in his novel, but they are all related to what actually does happen in the story. The same thing happened to the Native Americans during European expansion into this half of the globe. Along this thread, I would like to add something a professor of mine once told us, one Dr. Olga Griswold of Cal Poly Pomona. In our sociolinguistics class, she said that &#34;when a language dies, an entire culture dies.&#34; In this case, the &#34;buggers&#34; stood no chance for they had no language to speak of. They were dead from the start, with no chance against the vengeful wrath of the fighting animal known as Homo sapiens. Ironic that &#34;sapiens&#34; is Latin for &#34;wise.&#34;<br /><br />And now, with the looming military action in Syria, the militarism presented in this novel will always be perfectly relevant no matter which culture is dominant on this earth. The greatest cultures to ever reign in human history have unilaterally been militaristic. The next great culture to dominate this planet will undoubtedly see relevance with this novel. Perhaps it may even be censored by the next &#34;Minitrue&#34; (in our age, it is the NSA). This discussion on militarism certainly does not level with the likes of &#34;Starship Troopers,&#34; but is effective nonetheless.<br /><br />The only portion in which Card is lacking (I attribute this to the norms of his time) is in the dialogue. Though it does not interfere with communication (as far as I am concerned anyway), there was at least one point in the narrative where I had to go back several lines to figure out who the heck was talking between Ender and Val. Dialogue tags are unnecessary in an exchange once identities have been established, but because of Card's style, which is to incorporate individual personae with entire blocks of text, dialogue tags are omitted and one must be more attentive than perhaps a (very) casual reader might be. I likely screwed up in this category because I plowed through the entire novel in a single day and my brain was rather exhausted from working in an office for eight hours beforehand. Needless to say, perhaps that was not the wisest decision, but I digress.<br /><br />Highly recommended, mainly for adults and more...mature children, just like that other Game.re out who the heck was talking between Ender and Val.

B0086700CM|5|I've been waiting for Temple Run to be released for Kindle Fire. For aime reason, I thought it's never happen. Thankfully, it did :D
B0063IH60K|5|This is a great app that is very easy to use. Great way to pass time when you are bored. Would highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|5|Really kept me guessing.
B0097NGUJG|5|If you buy one album this year, this should be it.<br /><br />It's so good, I often listen to the entire album on repeat (not skipping any tracks), which is rare for me.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and when you're listening to it, actually listen to it. Once you get hooked, you'll be addicted to it.<br /><br />If you _have_ to &#34;sample&#34; a few tracks, listen to &#34;Bloodflood&#34;, &#34;Fitzpleasure&#34; and &#34;Taro&#34;.
034580404X|5|Not porn, very erotic with an interesting story line.  Must read all three to understand the story line.  Would recommend to all my female friends.
1400052181|5|This book works on so many levels: as a medical history, a cultural history, the hard life of a black woman in the early to mid 20th century, and the inequities in American health care access.  Sounds so terribly dry, but this book is anything but dry.  The author managed to engross me in this tale of medical history and how it intersects with one family's story.  Like Henrietta Lacks, I had no idea that anyone who has ever had surgery may have those excised parts of themselves in a lab right now as part of an experiment.  Ms Skloot has taken a difficult subject and made it readable.
B00000DZTO|5|JUMP BACK * THE BEST OF THE ROLLING STONES has tracks that span the years 1971 to 1989. Taken direct from masters, and using what was then the latest technology (20 bit), sound quality of these 18 tunes is excellent. Included is a nicely illustrated 12-page booklet, that has comments about each song by band members-- the sort of details fans and trivia buffs go for. Some examples: \\"Brown Sugar\\" was written by Mick while he was filming NED KELLY in Australia, the demo of \\"It's Only Rock 'N' Roll (But I Like It)\\" featured Jagger and David Bowie, \\"Undercover Of The Night\\" was inspired by a William Borroughs novel called CITIES OF THE RED NIGHT, and so on.<br /><br />JUMP BACK is a solid collection of later-career Rolling Stones tracks, recorded while they were still at the top of their game.<br /><br />TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 74:19
B006LSZECO|5|I loved every minute of it except the last few pages. I hate how it ended...so much lost potential! Ugh! It was a phenomenal book until then.
B00L9B7IKE|5|I really enjoyed this book. It was engaging from the beginning , weaving the characters and their stories together. I feel that the pace picked up towards the  middle of the book, and it was very difficult for me to put down. I liked the suspense, the ending wasn't predictable to me, and I really appreciated to fact that it had a definite ending, rather than leaving the reader hanging.<br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good, sometimes twisted story line.
B001UV4XHY|5|A movie that will never go out of style! Definately worth the buy. Great purchase and a great price! My collection is now complete.
B00B0X4PIO|5|A beautifully written tale by a master story teller. Spanning over fifty years, this evocative and tragic story offers some insight to the both the beauties and horrors of life in Afghanistan and all of the cruelty and deprivation that accompanies such a war torn location. Evocative and moving story of the enduring love of a brother and sister separated by a cruel fate and the paths of their lives as they try to make sense of their<br />life journey.Highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5|Fun and busy. Do try not to get lost in it as I have. Time will run out faster than you can believe. So far not had to spend money but I can tell I probably will. Patience is not one of my virtues.
B0054JZC6E|5|this games. are fantastic and they are FREE!!!!! What else can you ask for? go get it and have a fun day with this amazon games
B004478AS4|4|It was good . Very detailed and full of imagery. A great read for all interested. Looking forward to more from this author.
B00DR0PDNE|3|Works pretty much as advertised (with occasional software lockups),<br />but adds very little that's not available from my $100 streaming DVD<br />player. ChromeCasting of web pages through the Chrome browser<br />is &#34;cute&#34; but -- to my surprise -- turned out not to be terribly useful.<br /><br />Considering the price, it's hard to criticize the device. My expectations<br />were just higher than warranted.  Mostly my fault, not Google's.
B00MO21WUE|5|my wifes favorite
B008PZ69T8|5|Rec'd the item & thank you.
B0097GVJWQ|5|Good game. Hours of fun. Highly recommend. I can't wait for part 2. Well worth price. Nice graphics too. Tally ho.
031603438X|4|It would seem the very thing that kept Keith Richards healthy enough to survive all his near misses with law and limb, plus his famously gritty drug of choice was a musical connection he made with the minds and fingertips of African Amercian guitarists like Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry. These heroes of the blues left America for Europe because segregation was so bad in the states. Little Ketih was hungry for their albums so he could steal every lick, and ultimately he'd play with them, for them, around them for years. This is before he began to shape his own tunes and figure out that you could play Brown Sugar backwards and get a product like Jumping Jack Flash. It's the story of a guitar hero as a child and what happened when he discovered that he'd been chosen to be one of those rare people to fall into the category of legend. It all starts with a feeling.
B00A6CCF0K|5|I recommend this to those who understand that Stephen King transcends horror. He knows how to write characters you care about, root for, cry for and those you despise.<br />He is quite simply a master storyteller, a great escape.
B005HE5J7I|5|After 3 weeks visiting England, Ireland, Scotland with 5 days in LONDON; reading the book LONDON was like examining each layer of an onion; as the book told the stories of 2,000 plus years of life; revealed from the artifacts found on display in the LONDON museum; the book tells the stories of a life worth living in cluster of villages; that became a struggling development of an inland landing.  Where Vikings, Europeans, and Romans came and some stayed; soon a town followed by a fort, then towers built to protect the leadership, a major city followed by a country.  We think of our nation as a melting pot.  LONDON was one of the original melting pot in this globalization; where mans ideas were seeking an area to be developed; the ideas found maturity, financing, a market plus a global distribution center in that nation that soon was soon to emerge called the British Empire.  The blood of all of our global ancestors are participants in this story.
B00TPEMK3M|1|Was hard to get into and jumps around. I won't be watching it again. Dont waste your money. So disappointed.
B000002U8G|5|I give this album 5 stars because of the amazing one of these days and echoes. The other songs are good too, but it's Echoes that makes this album a classic.
B007RCJNDE|5|An epic end to an epic story. Am relieved for the closure and yet am sad to say goodbye to the truly wonderful, charismatic friends / characters of the wheel of time.<br />And to borrow and adapt from Alfred lord Tennyson's phrase I am better to have known and lost than never to have known at all.<br />Best of luck Rand and co.
B00BEZTMFY|5|We had tire watch The Hobbit before we saw the next movie.. A great addition to our collection. I hate the number of word requirements in revews !
B00F1BFRA6|5|This season was just as good as the others! It continues on with the story lines set from the first 3 seasons, as well opens more into the lives of other characters. It provides all the emotions one would look for while also including a historically rich show. Love the clothes and accents. Always keeps my attention and wanting more!
B00HV2KU5A|5|I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED THE CHARACTERS MORE.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Functions as a good calculator should.
B00GSAC1UI|5|Great!
B00E7Z7D2M|5|As expected, relaxing and soulful. Robert Glasper is slept on. Way before his time and not appreciated for his demonstration of hip hop meets contemporary jazz.
B008SAZHLQ|5|I can't believe it took me so long to finally get this book. I read it in one day because as soon as I picked it up I needed to finish it. It was so heart breaking and gorgeous at the same time I wasn't sure how to feel. I don't know if any words are the correct ones to describe this book, it was simply magnificent.
B009O5CLZY|5|My 5 year old plays this game all the time.
B004FGMDOQ|5|Very creative book. I am looking for to the sequel.
0374275637|5|A Classic on Accurate Thinking and  A Must Read for anyone interested in human psychology, finance & investments, economics or even business.<br /><br />Daniel Kahneman and his colleague Amos did years of research and have articulated some of their work in this book. It is about how we think and why we think that way.<br /><br />We have 2 systems of thinking which explains the choices we make. One is System 1 which is our fast, intuitive and emotional thinking and the second is system 2 where we think slow, more deliberate and logical.<br /><br />There are several illusions and biases in our thinking which can affect us if we don't think thoroughly. Sunken cost fallacy( putting good money over bad ) for example is very common in investments. Individual Investors like to lock their gain by selling their winning stocks which have appreciated more instead of selling the losers who don't give anything for years.<br /><br />We can get overly optimistic or pessimistic on something when we are on system 1 thinking while system 2 will help regulate this and help us be more realistic.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed on the section on overconfidence where he trains us how to tame our intuitions, make them more accurate and when can we really trust our intuitions.  Kahneman also applauds the benefits to being optimistic. It is the optimists who play a major role in shaping our lives. Their decisions make a difference whether they be in business, military or even politics. They are talented, lucky and got to where they are by seeking challenges and taking risks. With an Optimistic Attitude in life, we can be blessed if we are only mildly biased and don't lose track of reality.<br /><br />This is a transformational book and will make you Think. Go slow and you will get the best out of this book.<br /><br />I Love This Book...a Very Enjoyable Read.
B00005B36H|3|I just got the cd today and listened to the whole thing through.  This CD isnt as good as Tool's other CDs.  There arent any pure, clean, heavy tool songs on the album.  Every once in a while you hear something that sounds like the classic Tool sound but most of it is slow drums and synthesized noises.  I cant believe they spent so long in the studio with this almbum and did not live up to our expectations.
B0063IH60K|4|Good graphics and fun little game. Took a bit of playtime to get used to the interface and control locations but once you are up to speed its fun to pass the time with.
B00BMT9SQA|5|Son, estranged, a little introvert, happy in science and unlucky in business, surprises both, his loving and over-acting mother  and himself, with taking her for a cross-country trip. Excellent acting and script, very human and touching story.
B00A12Z264|5|I think this is her best album she's put out yet! Loving it. Great vocals and good beats. Great stuff.
B005VPRFSY|5|If you're a lego fan then you understand the quality of product they produce. This set met their standards (as they all do) and I am happy to add it to my collection.
B00HBQWGXK|3|Not one of his best. I've read all of his Reacher books and this one wasn't a fast read...too many descriptions... Slow
B0007ZEO4G|5|glenn hughes and tommy bolin were added to this stellar lineup,and it does not dissappoint,from the title track to might just take your life,classic jon lord riffs and tommy tearin it up,sounds as fresh as when i bought it 30 years ago
B005FDXT32|5|Clean and clear! Scarface at its best! Perfect picture and perfect sound. The best possible way to watch the film at home.
B0000029AP|5|I agree with excellent. On time andnew packaging .
1400069289|5|It is said that we are all creatures of habit, and if there was any doubt that's true, Charles Duhigg's book is all the proof you will need.  His idea is simple; our lives are made up of all of our little habits, from brushing our teeth to not going to the gym in the morning.  We do the things we do because we have trained ourselves to behave that way, unthinking in our actions. Once you've done the same thing a number of times your brain becomes wired to follow the same path.  However, we are not bound by these habits, and difficult thought it may be, we can change our habits. It's all about the cycles of cue (what sets a habit in motion), routine (what you do when the cue occurs), and reward (the expected satisfaction you get when you've completed the routine).  By recognizing this pattern and altering it to get the desired result we change our habits.  The process isn't easy, and it will take effort, but knowing is half the battle, and once you start repeating your desired action enough a new, and better, habit will be formed.<br /><br />The simplistic summary above just begins to touch the surface of Mr. Duhigg's powerful and interesting book.  The book covers not only the habits of individuals, but also of organizations, and society.  There are many fascinating studies, stories, and examples of successfully changed habits both large and small in the book to illustrate all of his points.  The section that deals with how our minds work and are wired, was especially engaging to me.<br /><br />Everything is explained in plain language, so you don't have to be a scientist to follow it.  Better still, lots of great illustrations are scattered through the book, to assist in the understanding of the concepts.<br /><br />All in all...a fun and fascinating read, that can also change your life.
B00AIBZM40|5|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Quite a few jump out of your seat scares, and an overall creepiness from the two child actors. I've read the younger child did not speak English at the start of production which must have added a layer to her performance of being a feral child. The 'Mama' was scary as heck too, and i was NOT expecting the ending! I recommend it. It won't change your life, but it was a notch above most of the very mediocre horror movies we see nowadays.
0920668372|5|One of my absolute favorite books as a parent. The story shows the bonding of parents to their children. It shows how it should be in my opinion; the parents take care of the children and as we age the children take care of the parents. I buy this book for every baby shower and new parents as it is a classic in my book.
B009JZSC9S|5|A terrific series with a cast full of well-developed characters.  Plus, I've never seen so many famous guest appearances in one show.  They parade the A-lister actors in and out of different episodes which, of course, the show's format allows since they're always fighting a battle in court, good-guy vs. bad guy.  What startles me the most (SPOILER ALERT!) is why they would remove one of the headliners...?  We'll see how that balance develops, but overall, it's a good show with enough action and intelligence to keep you glued.
6303212263|5|A wonderful, entertaining movie.  The best ever adaptation of a comic book to film, great special effects, terrific story and phenomenal direction  make this movie something to see.  The opening credits alone are the most  spectacular of any movie made so far.  The special effects hold up rather  well.  Some of the characters are bit over the top.  Clark Kent may be seen  as a little too wimpy, Otis may be too extreme of a doofus, but they are  surrounded by characters who manage to be wholly credible.  Kudos to Mario  Puzo for his script and story (he also worked on Superman II, and his  absence was noticed on III and IV: The Quest for Peace) The only other  possibly superior interpretation of The Man of Steel is the first season of  Lois and Clark. But still, a movie of this much grandeur and spectacle,  which is superior in every way to all of the Batman movies combined (sorry,  Tim.  Love your work, but this movie is better), should be viewed in its  original widescreen format.  Warner Bros. should get off their butts and  give a good digital remastering and widescreen release onto video and/or  DVD.
B00BVYKWJI|5|the season has  good story telling  and it features  a lot of true  highlights  frying the actual story of  the Borgia  family.
B00ID4HRYC|5|This is such an awesome chick flick!  I will always love this movie!
B000I9W08I|5|Fine movie for every one.  We all have had a Dolly Levi in our lives.  Fun for me and my children.  Now that I own it I will watch it at least once a month if not more.  Ms. Streisand can make any film heart warming.
B009GX7IRA|5|Never gets old.  Always keeps my interest and I love the characters they have great personlities. The writers are exceptional.
B0063GORYU|5|excellent spider solitaire game.  great functionality. thank you.  a late night treat.  love all their offerings.  a big. solitaire fan.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I feel like I need a joystick to properly play.
B00DR0PDNE|5|This product dies exactly what we needed it to: play youtube videos for our kids on the tv and not tie up our device while it plays
098357670X|5|Keeping it simple.<br />This is the best book on caricaturing, covering all the topics on this art that I have ever read.<br />Clear, concise and entertaining.<br />Tom learnt from the best and is now earning that title.<br />Buy it.
B00009ZYBY|5|I remember first watching this movie in the cinema, because at that time there were no other movies showing that my friends and I have not watched. What followed was an amazing cinematic experience like no other, my eyes were glued on the screen at all times and I was literally on the edge of my seat. \\"This is the story that would resonate in the years to come, the \\"Spartacus\\" and \\"Ben-Hur\\" of our time\\", I was thinking to myself...and true enough, it took home 5 Academy Awards. <br /> <br />Maximus is a grizzled war veteran in the eyes of his soldiers and the Emperor, Marcus Aurelius...but what he wants more than anything else is to go home to his wife and child and tend to his crops. After leading the Roman army to victory in one of the most breath-taking battle scenes I have seen in movie history, Marcus Aurelius summons Maximus to his camp, and asks him to take over administration of Rome until he sees fit to pass governance to the senators. Before Marcus Aurelius announces his decision, his son, a very upset Commodus kills the Emperor and takes his father's place. Commodus asks Maximus to swear loyalty to him, he doesn't and what follows is a story that is emotional, powerful and compelling at the same time. <br /> <br />Strengthening the story in every way possible is a very talented cast, led by none other than Russell \\"the Oscar\\" Crowe. It seems that every movie he does earns him an Oscar nomination and in this movie, he deservedly won the award. Casting Crowe at that time was a brilliant decision by the film's director, Ridley Scott because he was relatively unknown, so we don't see Crowe as Maximus...we just see Maximus. His portrayal of the man was exceptional, every tear, every stare, every move speaks volumes. This was a man tormented about his past, unhappy about his present and doubtful about his future. This was one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. Of course, the rest of the cast are no less impressive. Joaquin Phoenix, as Commodusgave a fine performance as someone who is evil, not because he chooses to be, but because of the way he had been raised. He has felt vulnerable and not loved his whole life. It's easy to read his mind, \\"Why do these people who hate me be treated any nicer?\\" With a supporting cast that includes Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, you expect nothing but the best, and they do deliver in spades. <br /> <br />The directing of the movie was also flawless. Ridley Scott knows what he's doing, he has a good idea what the audience is expecting and he makes the right decisions. Where other directors have tried and failed (Troy and Alexander comes to mind), Scott weaves a story that by the end of the movie, every person who is watching the movie, would want the hero to win..but will he? The anticipation that Scott evokes is what makes this movie special. The action sequences in this movie is also no walk in the park. They are shot with extreme precision, that when you watch it...every strike, every blow seems to be happening right in front of you. With a good home theater set, I am sure you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br />But ultimately, no home theater set is needed for you to really appreciate this movie, the powerful storytelling and superb acting is the driving force behind this movie and I for one, am all for that. If you have not watched this movie, I'm afraid you're missing out something special as movies like this, they come once a blue moon. Hope my review was helpful enough to spark some interest in getting this movie, you won't regret it!
B000JVT1U0|4|It was a decent movie, the remake was of course better in the updated filming, but besides that they were both equally interesting.
B004J4WKUQ|5|I've never er written a review before but I feel that I must after finishing \\"Ready Player One.\\"  I've been in love with video games, comics, tv, and movies for as long as I can remember. In a word, this book is every geeky daydream that I've ever had and it's wonderful.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Wonderful entertainment for all of us since we are all over the age if 13,  This game is not boring and can be challenging.
B00LNP9H0K|5|The game's great. I like the stories between levels. I really recommend this game to give it a try.
B005IML464|2|the quality of the recording is ok.  however the digital information is incorrect, e.g. on copying to my computer, symphony # 9 shows as symphony # 6 and so on.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|Addicting game, but it's not exactly like the actual game flappy bird. The bird seems more heavy on this version. Why can't Amazon just get the real one.
B006YXTRHY|5|Awesome movie and at a great price of only .99.  Thank you for the opportunity to rent the movie. now i am caught up on the series.
B00FJ2YTLK|2|took me two hours to read... LAME. Each chapter was about five- six pages long. Waste of money because it was really short, shoreline stinks (didn't explain much) but it was very good considering the fact I couldn't help but yell \\"JUST TELL HIM YOU LOVE HIM IDIOT!\\" time to time.
B00881PTRC|4|A lot of fun, and easy to use. Some words are very hard, and unusual...the graphics are very funny and I love the background music as well.
6305313687|5|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which for some reason I thought was going to be an action flick. Instead, I found a socially powerful, gripping film. The theme isn't new but the sympathetic (but not condoning) treatment of Neo-nazis/skinheads was refreshing. It's not an easy movie to watch, but I'm glad I did, and hope to see it again soon. Edward Norton once again proves that he is a fine actor.
B004P68T30|5|My four year old loves to read this story with me.  We try to read it as fast as possible without messing up.  Works great on Samsung Fascinate, voice over is okay.
1938469011|5|Stan Hiereonymus does justice!  This is the best book on hops that I have read.  It is a great book written for the masses.  Well done Stan.

B00DFFHUUA|3|Ehhh
0452295548|5|This is a fascinating book.  It is good for those who need the science part but also a fun read as she shares the story of her own stroke.
B001OQCV24|5|I just saw this one in the theater and it was excellent!  I love a good disaster movie.  It was a good storyline of disasters striking and the stunning visual effects that go with the disasters.  No kidding, the computer graphics were some of the best stuff I have ever seen in a disaster movie. It was about 3 hours long and I would watch it again, in a heartbeat.  John Cusak is one of the primary characters.  Morgan Freeman plays the US President.<br /><br />The movie begins in 2009, in India, where heavy rains are taking place.  An elevator descends deep into a copper mine where scientists are studying solar eruptions that have been occurring and \\"are heating up the Earth's core like a microwave.\\"  From India, our Geologist, Adrian, travels to Washington DC to advise the White House of a national geological crisis.  We fast-forward 6 months, into 2010, to a summit in British Columbia, advising members that the world will soon be coming to an end.  We then travel to see Tibetan Monks talking (in Tibet), to London in 2011, and to Paris.<br /><br />Then it is 2012.  The biggest solar climax in history, along with a galactic alignment, is predicted.  The governments are making arrangements to ensure their continued operation, and the filthy rich are buying tickets for special passage \\"out of Dodge\\", so to speak.<br /><br />All of a sudden, the xxxx begins to hit the fan as the San Andreas Fault begins to shift and streets start cracking down the middle in San Francisco.  About this time, Cusak (a divorced father of 2 children) picks his children up to take them to Yellowstone National Park, not knowing the military has closed the park off to tourists.  It seems the super volcano has become rather active and is expected to erupt as the Earth's crust is destabilizing (like dissolving).  In the wooded area surrounding the Park, we meet Woody Harrelson, who appears to be a hippy fruit-loop kinda guy.  Woody is studying all this stuff and broadcasting to anyone who will listen.<br /><br />Meanwhile, temperatures continue to rise globally as spectacular visual effects begin appearing.  The story heats up as fast as the Earth's crust and things are poppin' and people are hoppin'!  Everything stayed pretty intense for the rest of the movie, so much so that I left with a very slight headache from the level of intensity.  Quite simply, I was bustin' outta my chair.  It was completely enjoyable and very entertaining.<br /><br />As a side note, I have read quite a bit on 2012 and no one knows what is going to happen, if something will happen, or when something will happen. I have my own thoughts and feelings.  If you watch this movie, please don't do so in fear.  Watch it for entertainment purposes.  It was much the same type of movie as the popular and exciting \\"Independence Day\\" but was without aliens.peratures continue to rise globally as spectacular visual effects begin appearing.

B00K6D1HUI|5|This Dvd is. Awesome. Show was fantastic if u haven't got a copy of this dvd yet you should. I have been a long time fan of this band since 1987 they still rock! Love it.
B009NFHF0Q|4|I loved the whimsy of the novel, but most of all I loved the reflection at the end.  It made the rest of the book seem ever so much more magical.
B0094M6A18|5|All time fav
B00O8NPCA8|4|Interesting &#34;Ground Hog Day&#34; plot twists and surprises.  Fun to watch if you like pure scifi!
B00GRPD0J0|3|no complaints, does the job
B005LAIIKI|4|The basic story of the movie was excellent. The acting was very good. Enjoyed the movie for the most part but, it was a little slow.
B00C7KXUOE|5|love it  great acting and well written . visuals are amazing and hannibal is creepy and intelligent can't wait for the new season
B000VAHR00|5|A classic and I'm so VERY pleased I purchased a cop for myself!
B009RI4FRU|4|He's already got a built in fan with me, but I'm not one of those that thinks Anderson walks on water or anything.  Not really a fan of Life Aquatic or Royal Tenenbaums, but Rushmore is one of my all time favorites, for instance.<br />I found this to be quite charming.  I love the idea of a child fantasy about young love and adventure come to life, if you will.<br />Odd that so many concentrate on the \\"quirky\\" side of the movie when the story itself takes over in my opinion.  I recommend it.
B0070DQYPU|3|It is a fun, cheeky feel good movie. I find the style it was filmed in almost comedic in nature. Sean Connery's cameo at the end of the film was a little over the top.
B00JB3NUHM|2|Good special effects.  Story starts out great, but then incorporates a few elements that didn't suit me.  Several of the other reviews elaborate on this.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Really have enjoyed playing many hours invested and always looking forward to the next level.
B00127RAJY|5|I love this work out.  I love the 3 levels.  All levels are very hard, but they can be done & they do get easier.  This work out toned my legs like nothing else I've ever done.  I would definitely recommend it.
B001GXF2YY|4|As usual, Michael Connelly writes so well.  It is easy to really get involved in his books.  I've read many of his books and never been disappointed.
B000I9YWDO|5|I love this movie! Most quotable movie of the decade.
B0000VCZKM|5|Very good.
B00SH00N3Y|5|I'm truly not sure why this movie got so many bad reviews from the public/press.  I assume it's because it makes people who are used to &#34;Captain America&#34; uncomfortable because it has moments that make you think.  It's generally an action movie but delves into the idea of &#34;singularity&#34;, in which a conscious being has power beyond comprehension.  Most disparaging remarks I've noticed deal with how far this goes or how &#34;inhuman&#34; the main character seems.  I'd argue: That is exactly the point.  Best movie I've seen in years.
B002MQYOFW|5|I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK/KINDLE READING DOWN.<br />IT GRABBED FROM THE GET GO AND I DID NOT THINK<br />I WOULD LIKE THIS BOOK.  MY GRANDSON TOLD ME I<br />WOULD LIKE IT....I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE TRAILERS<br />AND THOUGHT 'NO WAY'  BUT IT IS A VERY GOOD AND<br />THRILLING READ....RECOMMEND IT!!!!

B005V4FJC4|5|Another great addition to the music library from She & Him. They do renditions of timeless songs that go well with Zooey's voice. I especially love Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.
B00097DX3U|4|A much better effort. <br />The self-titled album consisted of RATM tracks with Cornell's vocals about drug addiction, which got boring after a few listens, and simply made me want to listen to RATM and Soundgarden respectively. <br />This time around the band is clicking. There's strange similarities in song structure with Led Zeppelin, and I swear that one of the tracks sounds like it could have been written by U2 - but overall, the album is much better than the original and more indicative of what these guys are capable of.<br />It's not perfect though. Almost all the songs follow the same basic formula: Intro, power chords, chorus, Morello indulging in effects, repeat. But hell, that's why I listen to it - sometimes it's good to breakaway from more complex and artsy music and just indulge.<br />Keep in mind that it's stadium rock and that you're supposed to have fun listening to it. Don't expect genius or mind, in fact, don't expect anything. Just listen pop it in and have a good time.
B004SJ3BCI|4|I am in much pain from my current health condition. Sometimes the pain is so severe that it won't even let me pray.<br />That's when I turn to my Angry Birds and  most of the time they manage to distract me from my misery.<br />I don't care for the music they chose, so I play it almost always in silent mode, if not for that I would rate 5 stars.
B00H6PG6J6|5|Excellent Movie with excellent had picked historical details of our roots and our democracy developments . I bought this movie to watch it again and again.
B00IG2DOKM|5|If you love games like Farmville then you will love Township. The thing I like the most is the fact that this game can be played whether or not you have friends playing. There is no constant requesting things from your Facebook friends to get things done, you can make things you need at your factories to complete orders for the Town folks. The developers are constantly upgrading the game to make it even better. Township doesn't cause my Kindle to lag some other games do, and the game is easy to navigate and play.
B00AEFY0F2|5|This is a great movie at a great price!
B00DVKOYBM|5|I've played this game on miniclip and loved it and now I can take it on the go I can log in with my miniclip account and have my stats and coins there very fun game I recommend downloading and playing as a guest then when you feel that your good enough then make an account and challenge your friends and enter tournaments

B00E3UN44W|5|Sherlock immediately sucked me in and I now measure time in my life as before BC and after BC (BC of course being Benedict Cumberbatch).<br /><br />Season 2 was nothing short of amazing and brilliant.  The introduction of characters Moriarty (my favorite villain ever) and Irene Adler made for the best chemistry & drama (and humor), I've ever seen on TV!! Since this review is geared toward Season 3, I'll keep it to just that, but just wanted to mention season 2.<br /><br />Season 3, WOW! Sherlock delivered again! BEST SHOW ON TV BAR NONE! Wonderfully written, superb acting (supurb is an understatement), amazing plot twists.  Did I say WOW already?? I laughed a lot, cried, and laughed some more.  I CAN NOT take my eyes off the screen when Sherlock is on.  My house can be burning down and I would never even notice it. The action, the plot twists, the camera angles, the cast (doesn't hurt that Cumberbatch is a nice piece of eye candy) and the on screen texts and thoughts make for an invigorating show (to say the least).  Sherlock developing more feelings & \\"human\\" characteristics is so interesting and unique to watch.  LOVE that there is more Dr. Watson...Martin Freeman is an incredible actor! Sherlock & John are terrific together and their interactions are perfect. Since watching I've become a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman..their acting is outstanding and it sucks you in...you are doomed right from the start. The characters in Sherlock have a way of getting under your skin, making themselves comfortable, and staying right there...<br /><br />I won't post spoilers, but the episodes are really, really great and I am SO happy that Sherlock is back with Dr. Watson at his side. So pleased that the last show of the series (His Last Vow) ended like it did...it was PERFECT.  Left me happy, and of course, wanting more. Can not wait for the return of Andrew Scott (Moriarty) next season!!! I can only pray that co-creators Steven Moffat & Mark Gatiss create many, many more seasons of Sherlock with Cumberbatch & Freeman. Please make the episodes longer (1.5 hours goes by like 10 minutes) AND PLEASE DON'T MAKE US WAIT TWO YEARS for the next season.  Yes, I am SHERLOCKED.

B00002SSKI|5|I loved this movie in my adolescent years! Very much a chick-flick. Now watching it as an adult I love the memories it brings back.
B000000OF6|5|If you like Queen you will absolutely enjoy this CD collection.  Queen is just fantastic even after  all these years.  Very satisfied with this purchase.  Highly recommend for those that enjoy talented groups of the past that still 'rock' even today.  Talent never ages and this CD is a classic example of one of the best!

B00CLD65X0|5|Loving this series! Now I know why my friends who watched it have been nagging me to give it a try.  Looking forward to diving into season 4 : )!
B00MB6IYHW|4|I really enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />It was a test for my 8 year old, though.  We don't use that kind of language, and I don't feel that it was artistically necessary.  Don't get me wrong, the language wasn't all that offensive, but what they did was just not necessary.  Cleaning it up would not have hurt the movie.<br /><br />You would have to leave the &#34;A-Hole&#34; line in, though.  That is funny stuff...

B00005JNEI|3|I'm registered independent, and I'm a filmmaker. I watched this movie, like I watched Fahrenhype 911 with an open mind. Michael's Moore film does an excellent job in portraying a point of view, in a way that is more powerful than Faherhype 911. However, as a filmmaker, and with a bit of research, it is a no brainier that this movie needs to be dismissed as a factual movie.  <br /> <br />I could go through the whole movie to point out how the art of editing was used to manipulate footage so that it would align with a point of view, but I'll only use two examples for the sake of time. <br /> <br />Example 1: <br />Moore showed us a crass statement from Bush that said: \\"Some people call you the elite, I call you my base\\" as he stood there among a bunch of rich folks, despite that the uncropped shot of that speech showed that Bush was sitting next to Al Gore at that fundraiser, not for a campaign, but for a children's hospital where they raised 10 million for the charity.  <br /> <br />Example 2: <br />Moore uses the article from the Washington Post about bush spending 42% of his first seven month on vacation. Those 42%, as it reported in the Washington Post, include weekends, time traveled for presidential engagements, and time spent with foreign leaders at Camp David. <br /> <br />Manipulation of footage was pretty much throughout the movie. As a movie expressing a point of view, as a filmmaker, it was powerful and well done, but as a factual documentary, well, it doesn't hold.  <br />

B00B2V66VS|5|Temple Run 2 is the best free game I've ever played. I like the controls because they are the same as the original Temple Run. This version has ziplines, caves with carts, waterfalls and new powerups. The new powerups include a powerup that if you hit a fallen tree or something like that (not including getting swept by the waterfall or missed jumps.)  Get this game! It's better than the original!
B004J4WLPU|3|I really liked the story, but hated the 'letter' style.  I just found that so distracting.<br />I loved the sisterly story and the mystery, just wish she had written it differently.
B00005JM1F|4|Mitch (Luke Wilson; Bongwater), Frank (Will Ferrell; Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn; The Cell) are disillusioned with their personal lives begining when Mitch's nymphomanic girlfriend, Heidi (Juliette Lewis; Natural Born Killers), cheats on him, then former party animal Frank gets married, but unwilling to get go of his wild life, and Beanie is a family man seeking to reclaim his wild and crazy youth. Beanie suggests that they form their own fraternity in Mitch's new house on a college campus to re-live their glory days by bringing together a variety of misfit college students, losers, middle-aged and elderly retirees as their new friends and later try to avoid being evicted by the new Dean of Students, Pritchard, whom still holds a personal grudge against all three of them.<br />I heard about this film from a friend, so I tried it, and laughed myself senseless. Will Ferrell is hilarious as a newly-wed numb-skull. Luke Wilson is quite funny himself. But the funniest was Vince Vaughn. I thought his role in this was about as funny as Swingers (in which he was hilarious). As good as the film was, I still couldn't give it the full five stars. It's a hilarious film nonetheless.<br />If you enjoyed Old School, don't forget to check out the following comedies:<br />National Lampoon's Van Wilder<BR>National Lampoon's Senior Trip<BR>How High

B00GRPD0J0|3|It's &#34;just&#34; OK. Found a mucho better one that lets me have multiple engines, incl. my favorite BING! So I'll use latter.
B000OXHRRC|3|This is a movie that never really gets going on the plot, though the setting is pleasant and some of the characters likeable. The major plot points from the book are absent and instead we focus on the metamorphosis of Russell Crowe's character from complete jerk to something approximating an okay guy as he reconnects w/his childhood self and the joy he used to feel when visiting his uncle in Provence.  It was okay.  Not great, not horrible.  Okay.

B000099T2L|2|for all the Hype&whatnot that comes with Beyonce the bottom line is that She just doesn't cut it as a legit Solo Artist.She has the Diana Ross Persona but the Mary Wilson Material&that doesn't equal a Legit Solo Career.Catchy Stuff&She Sings alright but She isn't close to where She must go to Being what the Hype will lead you to believe.She needs to take a cue from Her Group Mate Kelly Rowland: drop a Real Catchy first song.
B00EOFJAT4|5|This is a typical classy Ellie Goulding album. She has so much creativity and style.  Love her songs and her voice.  Thanks for sharing.
B000FCKGPC|5|Martin has a way of making you believe that this will be some typical fairy tale where there just may be a happy ending and then boom... again the axe falls. One of the best books I've read in my adulthood. This has rekindled my love for reading. Thank you.

B0026Q8F6C|5|One of the funniest movies ever, South Park is always edgy, funny and relevant. This didn't disappoint! I wouldn't recommend it for younger viewers but if you love the show this movie is for you.
B00003BDXG|5|Natural Born Killers took a stab at the media, penal system, and American culture so deep that it still has not recovered. Oliver Stone has always made risqué films, and has always in my personal opinion put his heart and soul into them. Films such \\"The Doors\\", \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Nixon\\" which all captured some degree of humanity and subculture do not even hold a candle to this phenomenal work. The infusion of animation, pop culture and askew directing make this story (written by Quentin Tarantino) one of epic proportions.  <br /> I may be going a bit over board when I say this, but to me this is the best love story since Romeo and Juliet, except this one is much more bloody and sadistic. You have two unusual human beings, one was brought up by an alcoholic sex addict father that rapes and pillages every chance he gets along with a mother that lets it all happen, and the other is brought up by a physically abusive father and a mentally abusive mother. The two have a lot in common; mostly rage and anger but also a longing for someone to love them. Because of these factors the two go on a homicidal spree across the country.  <br /> Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory Knox (Juliette Lewis) tear through Route 666 in a frenzy of murder and lust until they are picked up at a convenient store by Detective Scagnettie (Tom Sizemore) and some of his police pals. The two maniacs were almost forced into the store after being bit by rattlesnakes in the desert. Then they go to prison and the real fun begins. Don't worry I won't spoil it for you. <br />  The sex and violence formula plays out for these two twisted heroes, until of course their eventual capture and demise. While the viewer is unsure whether or not to root for these apocalyptic crusaders, they do triumph in the end.  <br /> The extras that accompany this flick are wonderful, especially the deleted scenes and the alternate ending. When Ashley Judd is in the courtroom being cross examined by Woody Harrelson, welllets just say that should have been put in the movie instead of just being an outtake.  <br />
B0014EAN8K|3|It's worth watching if you are a fan of the series or Milla Jovovich.  Lots of action too and keeps your interest but it's a bit weaker in   plot and big budget effects than the first two movies.    Zombies in the desert..lots of it seems similar to a Romero film..  maybe Day of the Dead?  It's still fun but has all been seen before..
B00CNQ7HAU|3|I would recommend this book. Parts of it were a little slow and repetitive. A little predictable. But easy read and overall a good story.
B00007E8V4|3|...this album seems to lacking what the first two had.<BR>Don't get me wrong, there are some truly amazing songs, such as streamline for example, but what destroys this record i sthe over production. Serj's voice is as usual, phenomenal, but is ruined by the guitarists constant backing vocals. He whines like a little girl. Why doesn't someone tell him, this??OK, he writes all the songs, but there is no need to put listeners in such pain.<br />Most of this record was originally leaked on the internet. If you can find those versions, burn those to a cd instead. No annoying backups can be found on any of them....<br />but still, some great songs. I just hope the next one isn't so polished.

B0050PYNP8|3|It's mildly funny, but unfortunately not too smart - like \\"Dogma\\", it's unable to get past brain-dead puns (Agent Zoil's first name, for example) and unintelligent cliched caricatures about creationists, who are somewhat - well, a lot - abused in this movie. Tellingly, the movie's only reply to their beliefs is \\"Paul is an alien and he says we evolved, so there - you guys are idiots!\\" I was hoping for a smarter, or at least funny argument. Sadly, all we get is the above, like Richard Dawkins' baseless insistence that he is right, yet refusing to debate the most compelling argument for intelligent design - irreducible complexity - because \\"I'm not an expert\\". You don't say!<br /><br />Paul, the all-knowing alien, seems completely unaware that some of the most famous believers in intelligent design were, in fact, atheists - distinguished scientists such Fred Hoyle and Allan Sandage (who later became a Christian) who, through their scientific work, found \\"everything here by chance\\" too anti-scientific and too puerile to believe. Hoyle's amazement at the evidence for design led him to conclude \\"A common-sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature. The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question.\\" (Being an atheist, he theorized that life came from outer space.) Agnostics such as molecular biologist Michael Denton have similarly found evolutionism to be anti-scientific in nature, whereas former believers in evolution such as Michael Behe have instead found evidence for a Designer in their study of life at the molecular level. Lifelong atheist philosopher Antony Flew is another: [[ASIN:0061335304 There Is a God: How the World's Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind]]<br /><br />However, those who thought Dogma was \\"smart\\" will probably not even be cognizant of the above issues. They will scratch their heads, gigglingly vote Not Helpful, and move on. So much for Questioning Authority and being an independent thinker :)<br /><br />Apparently, the movie also thinks that believing in evolution will result in obsession with sex and profanity. And marijuana. Perhaps they are right, I don't know. Strangely, they didn't mention another result - war, torture, imprisonment, and mass murder to the tune of 120 million (ask Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, or see [[ASIN:140397201X From Darwin to Hitler: Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics, and Racism in Germany]]) - ruins the mood, I guess, or afraid of giving ideas to impressionable youth like Jeffrey Dahmer or the Columbine shooters, who did mention Darwinism as rationale for their actions.<br /><br />Oh. Sorry. I suppose there are some who are totally unaware of the Hitler-Darwin connection. Just for you:<br /><br />Evolutionist Sir Arthur Keith: \\"The German Fuhrer as I have consistently maintained, is an evolutionist; he has consciously sought to make the practice of Germany conform to the theory of evolution\\" (Keith, Evolution and Ethics, 230). There, all done. We may continue.<br /><br />Also, inexplicably, the movie doesn't bash Muslims at all, who also believe in - ah, wait a minute. That would be dangerous, wouldn't it? Always easy to slap someone who's supposed to turn the other cheek. But not too brave, natch. Also pokes fun at the only politically acceptable classes to mock, such as rednecks with trucks. But what's a little racism and intolerance in Hollywood? All in good fun, as long as you follow the rules.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever been interested in UFOs will probably like this movie. I enjoyed the main characters' enjoyment of their worlds of UFOs and Comic-Con. It takes a while to ramp up, though, and the middle stretch gets tedious, but if you're not too demanding (and not too worried about science) it's likeable enough for the most part. A couple of characters - their pursuers - take unexpected turns, which are not altogether explicable or satisfying. Why did these lovable goofballs suddenly become nasty? Dunno, but they waste a fair amount of goodwill invested in them.<br /><br />So, if you're willing to put aside your brain for a bit, or if you lack it in the first place, you'll probably have some fun with this movie. Unless ...<br /><br />It's quite possible that the writers are mocking viewers who are cheering the creationist-bashing. (Not to mention, as they cheer, the movie potentially exposes their hypocrisy regarding tolerance, reason, and being informed.) Because, for all his other traits, Paul ... Is a Christ-figure! The idea of sacrificial healing, the healer taking into himself the injuries and diseases of others, is a deeply Christian concept. Pre-Christian heroes were conquerors who destroyed their enemies, not self-sacrificial healers (seekers of knowledge, see [[ASIN:1595553223 The Book that Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization]]). So we cheer Paul as he heals, giving of himself that others may be healed, yet mock the only religio-philosophical foundation for cheering this as a virtue, not a weakness. And although Ruth is \\"freed\\" from her religion by Paul, her religion - as portrayed by her father as judgmental and warped - is more representative of religions like modern environmentalism, e.g. Al Gore calling global warming doubters \\"racists\\", global warming believers excommunicating and censoring doubters, recycling nuts tut-tutting their acquaintances for not being good recyclers, and neo-liberals calling for and perpetrating actual physical violence against their \\"enemies\\".<br /><br />Is this far-fetched? Dan Brown mischievously outed elitist critics who praised his \\"accurate\\" books as uninformed know-nothings who apparently were easy prey to easily-debunkable conspiracy theories. Perhaps this movie is doing the same. But I'm just pulling your chain, actually. Pretty sure the writers were clueless about actual science.<br /><br />You may ask, \\"It's a comedy! Why not just enjoy it for the laughs?\\" I would answer with a question: do you agree with the saying, \\"It's funny because it's true?\\" I do. When comedy departs from truth, it loses its funniness, because your brain keeps interfering. Allow me to illustrate.<br /><br />Let's suppose you believe Obama is the best President ever, and this movie is a comedy about him. In the movie, Obama is portrayed as a clueless incompetent who never accomplished anything before becoming President, and wastes billions of taxpayer money on ill-advised schemes which strangely benefit his cronies. Probably untrue, of course, but stay with me. Suppose the jokes about his incompetence and corruption are hilarious. You could not enjoy it as a comedy, since you see it as an attack piece on the President, not a comedy. Furthermore, you would be concerned that clueless viewers will enjoy it and think they are \\"learning\\" something about Obama that is false.<br /><br />Same thing.ogether explicable or satisfying. Why did these lovable goofballs suddenly become nasty? Dunno, but they waste a fair amount of goodwill invested in them.

Blackstone Discovery's software and hardware now allows one lawyer to more accurately and far faster do the work of 500 in the legal discovery process. Online shopping has made Americans comfortable with buying a wide range of products w/o the help of salespeople/clerks - threatening an industry employing nearly 10% of Americans.<br /><br />Now 'Race Against the Machine' tells of a new threat - accelerating technology that is bringing cheaper and more capable robots. Even truck-driving jobs are expected to become vulnerable - 10/2010 Google modified a fleet of Priuses and made them fully autonomous.<br /><br />Common to both the rapid development of computer and robot capabilities is Moore's Law - first reported in a 1965 article noting that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit had been doubling every 12 (now 18) months, and was forecast to continue doing so. Variations of that law have also appeared in storage capacity, display resolutions, and bandwidth. Algorithms are also improving - by 43,000X for standard optimization problems between 1988-2003. Stats-Monkey writes sports stories. Another important phenomenon - digital technologies make it possible to instantly upgrade far-flung processes - eg. pharmacy ordering systems across a 4,000 store network.<br /><br />Ray Kurzweil was the first to point out that constant doubling is deceptive because it is initially unremarkable. However, it's exponential impact becomes quickly apparent. In addition, their value is further boosted by new uses - eg. Google's adding value to the Internet.<br /><br />This last decade is the first to bring declining inflation-adjusted median incomes since the data were first compiled. Median net worth also declined. Meanwhile, GDP/person continues to grow. Yet, the last decade was the first since the Great Depression that saw no net job creation.<br /><br />The key to winning is not to compete against machines but to compete with them. Unfortunately, both educational and health sectors lag as adopters of information technologies. That is changing - online courses on artificial intelligence at Stanford have attracted at least 58,000 students. Khan Academy offers over 2,600 short educational videos and 144 self-assessment modules for free for K-12 students.<br /><br />Recommends improved education via use of technology, more time spent on education, improving our infrastructure, shortening copyright periods, reducing subsidies to the financial sector (eg. 'too big to fail'), decoupling benefits from jobs, encourage the immigration of those with technical skills.cade is the first to bring declining inflation-adjusted median incomes since the data were first compiled.

B005KPDAN4|5|bought this on amazon video thru amazon prime. love the show, excellent quality / HD.
B000OVLBGC|5|Excellent writing and acting give this movie a great edge. I had no idea what would happen next and it's seldom a movie can surprise me anymore.  The Lives Of Others had me on the edge of my seat to the very end. Totally recommend it.
0061719544|2|Ferguson is, of course, the host of The Late Late Show, one of those staples of late night television that airs way past my bedtime. Ferguson was chosen to take over the reins from Craig Kilborn when he stepped aside in 2004. A native of Scotland who boasts a thick, Glasgow accent, Ferguson was always a long shot. But his zany sense of humor and his ability to lead compelling interviews eventually landed him the position over many competitors. American on Purpose tells how he got there and does so under the rather thin veneer of the joys of becoming a U.S. citizen.<br /><br />The book, like its subject, is profane and obnoxious. Growing up in working-class Glasgow, Ferguson was introduced early to alcohol and, hot on its heels, drugs. He gave himself over to both and for decades they dominated his life. Despite his addictions, he put together a career as an actor and comedian-a career that eventually brought him to the United States. After acting in a handful of films, many of which were far from successful, and after years spent in a recurring role on The Drew Carey Show, he was offered his current position as host of The Late Late Show. Along the way he drank endless amounts of alcohol, inhaled vast quantities of drugs, successfully passed through rehab, slept with countless women, married three times, got rich and became a celebrity. All of this is described in the 270 pages of his memoir.<br /><br />The book's title, American on Purpose, refers to Ferguson's decision to pursue American citizenship, something he accomplished in 2008, though he chose to hold on to his British citizenship as well. in the book's final chapter he says, \\"America truly is the best idea for a country that anyone has ever come up with so far\\" and offers a few words of explanation about his love for the nation. But beyond that, there is little in the book that really explains the title. It is, I think, a bit of a gimmick.<br /><br />This celebrity memoir, as with so many like it, will probably only appeal to people who are fans of its subject or people who have to endure long airplane rides and brought along only the one book. If you enjoy The Late Late Show and are a fan of Craig Ferguson, I can understand why you might want to read it. I'll grant that there is some value to be had in hearing about how an addict has learned to overcome his addictions. Yet even then I doubt you will find much there to enjoy. It is just another celebrity memoir, filled with drugs and alcohol and tales of sexual conquest and inevitable divorces. It is a big yawn.ple who are fans of its subject or people who have to endure long airplane rides and brought along only the one book.
