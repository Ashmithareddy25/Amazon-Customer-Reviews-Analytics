0143034901|5.0|Shadow of the Wind is one of my favorite books. This time I purchased it as a gift. The content covers many interest levels; suspense, love, history...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This case is very stretchy.  I was hoping for a snug fit.  It covers the phone well, however it is very thin and comes off easily.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great game.  Keeps you entertained and easy to use.  I like the ability to do the outer frame pieces first.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Especially at thirty five dollars! This newer technology from Google has basically one function: it connects to your flat screen and wirelessly streams data from nearly any mobile device to the TV, including video. So, you plug the Chromecast into the back of your TV using one of its HDMI ports, wirelessly connect the device to your home network (yes, this little device is a wireless device that uses your home network, so you must connect it to your network, just like you do everything else, including your smart phone, your laptop, your tablet, etc.), then install one of the Chromecast apps on either your tablet or PC (including the Google Chrome browser, which is Chromecast aware), and then you fiddle around until you will see the content on your mobile device showing up on your TV.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this is that, sitting on your couch with tablet in hand, you can browse YouTube, NetFlix, etc, etc. (more applets are added over time) and then watch them on your large TV screen. It's like having a projection device without all the cables, and much more convenient, because once you have all the configurations set and the apps installed, it's like having a huge screen tablet or PC on which to watch your content!<br /><br />Is it ready for prime time? Yes, but \\"yes\\" at about 80%. There are still some apps we would wish to see, and not every device you have is equally supported. And I've had some issues where, after watching something on YouTube (on my second generation Nexus 7, no less), the system freezes up, and I have to disconnect and reconnect to move forward to the next thing. Resolution is generally good, but it's not going to look like your Blu-Ray player in terms of sharpness. And configuring the Chromecast to connect to your router may require changing some router settings. And again, my own mobile device is Google's own Nexus 7 (2nd generation), and even it is not 100% perfect in functionality with Chromecast, so you cannot expect absolute perfection yet in terms of functionality.<br /><br />But as this is a new technological device, and because it brings new functionality to your home computer-based devices, and because the price is so affordable (think of what the case would be if this device had been priced at $100, instead of $35), its really worth trying out and getting to know. It will likely turn out to be a lot of fun and give you some new ways to watch digital media. Four stars out of five, and it will probably move to a \\"five over time as more apps are released.e perfection yet in terms of functionality.<br /><br />But as this is a new technological device, and because it brings new functionality to your home computer-based devices, and because the price is so affordable (think of what the case would be if this device had been priced at $100, instead of $35), its really worth trying out and getting to know.

B00BEIYMAG|5.0|FINALLY a ghost flick that is actually chilling from start to finish without stupid, cheesy graphics that look like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean. I try not to get my expectations up since I usually get disappointed but this did NOT let me down.<br /><br />This movie has great body to it. A good build, and intense scenes throughout until the end. I don't think my boyfriend and I have squeezed each others hands so much and we like our scary movies.<br /><br />I really like the cast and how it was acted as well. Vera Farmiga has such a natural-feel to her acting you don't even think she's acting at all. I like the actor playing Ed Warren much better in this movie than Insidious<br /><br />Totally buying this DVD
0451169514|3.0|The book was o.k., but not my favorite from Stephen King. He has an amazing way with words, but this book was not quite my style. Amazon shipped it quickly though.
B008Y5OWI4|5.0|This picture is a major classic for anyone interested in film and epistemology (how do we know what we know).
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Excellent album! Probably her best work to date and best pop album released in 2013. Favorites include Birthday, Dark Horse, Roar, Double Rainbow, By the Grace of God, It Takes Two, Choose Your Battles, Legendary Lovers
0812986180|5.0|I start to watch this and i can't stop watching until i get the end of the story its really amazing story i try to look on the amazon if they sale some dvd of the whole story of this but nothing I like to watch this using netflex but sad i live in remote area of Alaska were the internet is like a meter of electricity when you exceed you pay much more and its so sad!! but anyway this a very good story.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|WOW!! I'm so immersed in this series I did t even want to take the time to write a review!!! Rose is a KICK ASS WOMAN!!! I'm amazed at the depth of emotion I've been thru with this series!! Off to follow Rose on her journey & praying for her to find herself thru all of this!!! What a heart breaking story & thrill ride!!!
0439023521|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.  If you liked the novel &#34;Donor 23,&#34; you'll like this.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Would recommended to anyone who likes science fiction, a must read adventure, read it in just two days it was so good
141690977X|5.0|A very important dating bible for ALL women!!  Ladies STOP wasting your time and energy on guy that don't even give you a 2nd thought.  Greg tells you the secrets that guys don't want you to know.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|What a book!!!! I'm about to get the third one and I cannot wait to read it. Hope it is just as good as this one!
B000FC13Y0|3.0|Some great writing in the book, but the pacing threw me off--particularly around the time Tristan meets the hairy stranger. There were a lot of elements that I really enjoyed about the book, but I never felt sucked in or got to the point where I forgot I was reading.
B007LB5MF4|5.0|If you are a fan of the series, whether in book form, the HBO show, or both, it's extremely cool and fascinating to see it brought to life in this medium.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I had some big gripes with some turns the plot took but I was won over by the end, I'm definitely going to pick up the second.
B004OYDVT0|5.0|Great DVD. Luv the two different renditions of certain tunes.  A great voice and great lyrics.  Sing alone in the car!
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is the best book I've ever disliked! It was incredibly well written and left me feeling cold and empty. An incredible book, but I'm so glad it's over. I think that Sci-Fi is not my most favorite genre.
B00005AWMF|3.0|Always a big fan of Sade, this production has too much background noise (concert crowd, etc.)  Hard to hear or enjoy.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|Wow, I've never cried so much in a book! It was well written, however, incredibly depressing the whole way through.
B00DIDORH8|5.0|This is the perfect deal for those of us who can't afford the Batman Anthology box set. All four original Batman movies (Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, and Batman & Robin) are included in one case on individual discs stacked on either side. The films look and sound fantastic, and any Batman fan on a budget would agree this deal is well worth the money. True, it is not as pretty-looking as the Anthology box set with four separate cases for each movie, but it stands on its own as an incredible set with four classic films! I'm happy I picked this up at Best Buy for $20: It can't be beat!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have bought several books like this and my 6 yr old niece loves them since she is very interested in drawing. It has helped me get back into it as well. Great price and good quality, will be ordering more!

B003O86FMW|5.0|The best in the series I cant wait for the movie. I didn't want to reread it before the movie because movies always fall short compared to our imagination based on books.
B0086700CM|3.0|I have bought several books like this and my 6 yr old niece loves them since she is very interested in drawing. It has helped me get back into it as well. Great price and good quality, will be ordering more!
B007STBUIW|5.0|Awesome movie now on HD. It also came with a UV code so I have access to it digitally. I'm gonna need a bigger tv!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love rpg and time management games and this one hits on both levels.  It is quite involved there is a lot to do and something is always happening.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is by far my favorite military  book. Doesn't over do the whole bravado macho SEAL that other books have and has a more human and dramatic theme. It's hard to put down after you start reading it. I was soexcited when I found out they're making a movie based on this book.
B005HI7MRE|5.0|I bought this item as a gift. My friend really loved this CD, one of master pieces from Depeche Mode.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|A slightly depressing story of a man's journey to discover happiness in his life and make amends for past wrongdoings. Not an uplifting story, but had a good message. Dragged a bit in the middle but the last 40-50 pages were very good. The author developed the story well and connected all characters and plot lines seamlessly.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great job love the game hours of fun could get a new one now I feel old because now I feel old
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|I had it on my mom's iPhone and I liked it, but on my kindle fire hd, I LOVE it!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It is fun and faster paced than most of this type.  My daughter's are on also, so we can trade each other . Plus there was free coin.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this is the best horse game ever<br />I think that the people who did I this game should make a newer and better one
B008MM9630|4.0|It's really fun but it's supper hard to get crystals and all of the crystals you can buy are too expensive.Without crystals the game is pointless. Other than that a good game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing I love the graphics and little kids are  happy to ply anytime love it so so so much !
B000059TFO|5.0|I purchased this DVD to replace a old VHS copy.  It arrived on time and the<br />film quality better than my  VHS  copy.  I have added the DVD to my film<br />collection.  Charles
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very easy read! One of the best stories of the century. Many twists and turns that make you keep reading!
B003JTHXN6|5.0|This book was a very easy read. As a business owner, we all suffered through the Great Recession. It's great to see Zappos and Amazon came out the other side stronger. Tony shows how people truly do make the world go round. Everyone is interesting and has a story to tell which you can learn from. All we need to do is take an interest in them and listen. This book reminded me once again why that is so important.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|the pieces are really small on the kindle, hard to see. can't make it bigger. the game itself is good
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Great book. Lots of history about Steve, Apple, Pixar and Disney. Very thorough, with lots of insight from many people that knew Steve personally and in business.<br /><br />The 4 stars is not about the writing, at all. That part was great. Unfortunately, the 4 stars is because Isaacson had to (and probably rightly so) repeat different peoples' perspective that Steve Jobs could be a real jerk sometimes. That's who he was. He was great in many ways, but just sort of mean, otherwise.  I simply got tired of reading that over and over.<br /><br />The writing and the depth of information were a 5, by itself.
B00GOQ9M4O|3.0|Overall Story Line is Great!  The Actual Happenings Not So Much!  Ok,, Im glad they brought Governor Back.  But Why do the Chicks want to Leave a Perfectly Great Compound That Has Every Comfort They Need??  Yeah the One is in Love with the Governor, I Get That. But Still!!!  Next, Do We Really Need to Know the One is a Lesbian?? Who Cares?? Its just a Stupid Subplot That Has No Significance.  I Like Everyone Esle Has Said ,, Your Afraid to Get Your DaD O2 Cause you Dont Know you Need to Stab Them In the Head?? Really??? OK I Expect Better Next Epsidoe ...
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Gladwell is an author people either love or hate.<br /><br />Fans cite his stories endlessly and research loose ends on the internet (let's face it- the reporting isn't always 100% accurate in the books). Detractors consider him a sellout pandering McInteresting to the masses- sort of a portable TED talk.<br /><br />Whichever side of the fence you sit on, Gladwell is clearly a force in modern writing (see his imitators in the suggestion list, below). He sells a LOT of books. Sadly, this particular effort seems like an attempt to cash another paycheck.<br /><br />Don't get my wrong. I love Gladwell. There were a lot of interesting ideas in this book- I just don't remember the other books being as obvious about which way I was being &#34;steered&#34;. I had the uncanny (founded, it turned out) sensation while reading that my opinion was being deliberately manipulated by the strategic inclusion/exclusion of facts. I didn't have the oomph to research the issue myself, but the review of the book in Slate seemed to confirm my suspicions.<br /><br />This is a good book. It is head and shoulders about the wannabes, but I know that Gladwell is capable of more. My favorite remains &#34;The Tipping Point&#34;.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book.  Really looking forward to the movie.  Should be a really good one.  Katniss rocks. Will there be more?
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|This was a real disappointment. It was like watching the Lifetime version of Stand By Me or the cliff notes of Huck Finn.  They didn't even change up the appearance of the characters.  Save your money and wait for Prime to carry it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie is not for the action adventure seeker. But it is an adventure. A strange engrossing one that kept watching it more than once because it time I would find something I missed the first time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is so look fun!The little minions are so funny and they do different things to help you go farther.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Beautifully written, gripping, a tour de force. I am astonished at the quality of the writing, the story itself and the vivid descriptions of the characters. I haven't enjoyed a book this much in ages. I can see why it won the Booker Prize.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I rented this movie with a sense of trepidation.<br /><br />As with many people, &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; is an almost-holy text to me. I have an emotional investment in this book such that butchering it for a movie would enrage me in a way that messing with &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; does not. On the other hand, I love a lot of what Baz Luhrmann has done. I think that Moulin Rouge and Romeo+Juliet were spectacular. The themes and setting of Gatsby definitely lend themselves to Luhrmann's over-the-top-style.<br /><br />Parts of this movie were every bit as bad as I feared. Nick, as a character, was butchered. The &#34;added story&#34; was unnecessary and dumb. Acting-wise, it felt like Tobey Macguire just stood around, star-eyed as the other actors moved around him. I also thought that the &#34;modern soundtract&#34; was a bit self-conscious in some places. It worked in the party scenes, but not so well in other bits. I do appreciate what Luhrmann was trying to do, however, and it wasn't entirely painful.<br /><br />This film contains some real brilliance in bits. The movie was exceptionally well-cast. I never jumped on the Carey Mulligan bandwagon, but she was fantastic as Daisy. Her portrayal added a lot to my understanding of the character, and Leonardo was, as usual, perfect as Gatsby. Visually, the party scenes and Gatsby's house were spot-on. I know that there were a lot of matte drawings. Sometimes things didn't look precisely &#34;real&#34;, but that really works within the context of this story.<br /><br />I didn't love it, but I like it a lot.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed the book but I would have liked to know more about what happened to Gale and her mother and buttercup
1439152810|4.0|Great story with a nice twist to the ending. Our book club read it and all enjoyed it.<br />It started off a little &#34;wordy&#34; but then became very interesting.
B00006JIA4|5.0|If your a Queen fan like myself this is a great collection. Hours of music and memories. Baby boomers delight.
B00DOPEGAS|4.0|My grandaughter loves it. I would have given it 5 stars but felt it was a bit pricey for what it is.
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll love this! Bravo to the animators they do a wonderful job with this series!
B000AU1OIW|5.0|Very nice japanese remaster with MINILP artwork. Great interpretations by VDGG of some classics and Hammill solo material with a new darker and heavier sound.
B00511ONPG|5.0|Extremely helpful. Here is why  I loved this book:<br />1) straightforward writing style is easy to read.<br />2) It got me excited about starting my business.<br />3) these people promote being open and honest about yourself and your business.  Imagine that!  No wonder we all love it.<br />4) this book shares a new paradigm about marketing that I had not thought about but that I believe is the way of the future.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Very intuitive and easy to use! Power supply cord could be longer to allow to stay far from power outlet.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|l love this cordless swivel sweeper it is the bomb.  It works good everywhere, I go under everything, on stairs.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It took me a long time to read this book but I do love it. For anyone who thinks they already know a lot about the man, this book gives an even deeper look.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 27 month old daughter loves this app! We have had it for a few months but it took her awhile to get the hang of it considering she doesn't have a phone in her hand 24/7 like most adults (;  She loves seeing the &#34;bye byes&#34; after she puts them all together and gets excited to pop the balloons and the bubbles! Fun for little ones!
B00881VLCE|5.0|The colors are so vibrant. The music in the background is very relaxing. After a stressful day it helped me unwind
B00DONF9SS|4.0|I am in love with my Mercury figure, however my box from amazon showed up in rough shape. The figure inside is fine but the box won't look so pretty on display anymore. Bummer on amazon packaging. Mercury came with so many accessories (especially extra hands) and I love the fact that she has a heat shaped stand just like Usagi. No paint issues with mine either, so A+ from Figuarts.
B0009E76IG|5.0|This is a definitive I interpretation of Manon. Sills is great as Manon. The way she &#34;frees&#34;  Price from his cell at St. Suplice is a great example of teasing to get her way.  One has to look at the way Sills tilts her head and winks her eye to manipulates the situation.  The scenery and costuming are decadent reminders of the past.  The staging of Manon is dynamic.  The death scene make one shudder and even brings a tear to ones eye.  My only negative response is that this recording is only in VHS format, but still magnificent.
1616614609|5.0|Amazing game, great art and very intense and fun to play. Because it's a deck building game, asynchronous, and expansion packs keep coming out, it feels new every time I play. Takes a while to learn to play, and is full of rules confirmations for the initial play period (be prepared for this). Recommended!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Dylan does have a reputation of being somewhat droll and, most of the time in his current incarnation, extremely difficult to understand or decipher, to put it mildly.<br /><br />He has however, for some inexplicable reason, departed from his standard image with this album.  He has in essence, composed a ballad that for all time will be remembered as one of the greatest EVER written.  In my judgment, the Tempest exceeds by far ANYTHING he has ever written, even as great as they were.  Any believe me, I lived thru the era in the 60s when he achieved world fame.<br /><br />The Tempest will go down in history as one of, if not the greatest, ballad ever written.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works well and helps a lot for math love it. I recommend buying it. If you need help on something in math then use this app. It works great
0425266060|3.0|I loved the story of Gideon and Eva I loved their passion. I didn't like the ending .The characters were well written. ♡
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This was well constructed with a physics engine and It's Free!! When I first got this game I thought it was going to be the worst but It turnout amazing. That why I personally recommend getting this game.
B0089K7DGW|4.0|OK, I was hoping for a drama that was historically accurate, fast-paced, and titillating.  While it gets the atmospherics very well with a good story and great acting, I was disappointed to learn that the historical figure it is based on - Nucky Johnson - in fact employed no violence with the exception of economic -  he drove his enemies out of business but didn't off them in the gruesome manner in the series.<br /><br />With that big caveat, it is a very fun viewing experience that can be played more than once with enjoyment.  What really makes it is the actors:  each projects a powerful, believable character that evolves through the season.  It is a cut above soap opera, however over the top it can be at times.  You really get a sense of what people and the country were like in the 20s.<br /><br />Nucky Thompson is a political machine boss and gangster during the Prohibition era.  He protects and consolidates his territory, falls in love (revealing hidden parts of himself, such as his childhood abuse), and struggles to evade the law, in which the Federal government begins its \\"encroachments\\" into corrupt state and local politics.  It is splashy, there is never a dull moment, and the viewer empathizes with him just enough to root for him, yet feel horrified.  His inner circle includes a dangerously disgruntled brother, his bitter old mentor, and his stupidly self-destructive ward just back from WWI.  They challenge him while depending on him.  Side characters include Lucky Luciano, Al Capone and many others.<br /><br />Recommended.  It is truly lush, a masterpiece of TV melodrama.
1476729085|5.0|Don Tillman, the heart of the Rosie Project is so adorably irresistible.  Many other reviewers can tell you about the synopsis of this story; I will tell you about my reaction.  Don Tillman’s realization and acceptance of his feeling for his friends and for Rosie is what makes this novel superb,  Don is an extremely logical man, an intellectual and quite snobbish so his journey in learning how to feel and accept that feeling make life more interesting  makes this novel very relatable to almost anyone. Simsion writes Don so well that you cannot help but like him and cheer for him because you can relate to his feelings.  This is my favorite novel of 2013 and I look forward to reading more from the author.
031623480X|3.0|As a celiac, I am always interested in current research. This was very enlightening. I am interested to see in this is accepted by Doctors.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Wonderful book. Can't get enough of this author's work. Will be finishing this series and moving on to the Kane series.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read I've yet to be disappointed in a Grisham novel.  The story catches you on the first page and never lets you go.  It was a long over due sequel to &#34;Time to kill&#34;.  This did not disappoint and would recommend to all Grisham fans.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Since starting this series, I have loved every minute of it. Thank you for making it available on kindle.  The thought and imagination that has been put into this series is nothing short of GREATNESS.  Right down to the last few pages of this last book have kept me intrigued.  I would recommend this series to everyone.  Please keep writing, I will keep reading then....Thank you.
B009IU6BIS|4.0|This month this movie was genuinely funny. There were some really stupid parts that leave you in stitches. The only complaint is that there could've been less profanity.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Loved this book. I started this and just couldn't put it down. It was well-researched, the characters were believable, and the story drew me in. (I even sneak-read at work!). I wanted to keep reading it, and was sad when it was over. I can't even explain why I loved it so much. I was telling someone I was reading a really good book, and they asked \\"What's it about?\\" \\"Botany,\\" I answered. \\"And family. Science. The role of women 100 plus year ago. And unrealized passion.\\" I don't think I made a sale for Elizabeth Gilbert. Sorry about that!<br /><br />I almost didn't read this, because I did NOT enjoy \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\" Now, however, I want to seek out some of her other books and read them. Reading some of the negative reviews, it looks like some people didn't like this book because they loved \\"Eat Pray Love.\\"<br /><br />To each his own. I highly recommend it, and this is probably one of the few books I'd read again.
B00BATG18K|2.0|Love almost anything written by Amy Tan.  I was so looking forward to this book and had pre-ordered it.  What a disappointment!!!<br />It was way too long, the characters (especially violet) were unlikable no matter how hard you tried.  All three women in the story, mother, daughter, granddaughter were silly and shallow.  I kept going thinking it had to get better and actually found myself skimming some pages.  Wanted to love it (like the Joy Luck Club) but, would not recommend this to anyone.  Really rather depressing and a total let down for so much anticipation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book eluded me as I thought it was sci fi. it turned out to be something like I've never read before and kept me up at night until finishing. awesome story.
0553381687|5.0|This is the greatest *modern* fantasy series written so far. I won't even say &#34;in my opinion&#34;. Fantasy novels have come a long way since Lord of the Rings or the Gormenghast trilogy, so you can't really compare them across eras. But this stands out -- way out -- from everything else out there written to the considerably advanced standards of modern works. (Because of modern communications and technology, novels have made advances similar to or even greater than movies.) Anyway, to my knowledge this is the best modern fantasy has to offer, and I mean the whole series. As far as I know, fantasy does not boast a super genius like Iain Banks with his Culture series (science fiction), but for fantasy (my bias may be operating here) this is the current high point.
6305205620|5.0|It came in as &#34;Like New&#34; condition as stated by the seller. I missed my rock, even though my lifestyle is somewhat conservative, I remained a metal head for life, I messed up the original I purchased over ten years ago, this is a really nice replacement.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The story line and character growth was very disappointing after the first two books that were very enjoyable reading (I couldn't put the first two books down).  Tris's maturity & wisdon was not that of a 16 year old but more of a 30-something.  The description of Evelyn's choice of Tobias over &#34;the cause&#34; was not believable nor was Evelyn & Marcus' stance with the handling of the leadership role.  Needless to say Ms. Roth killing off Tris was unexpected and disappointing.  The narrative of Tris's demise was not well scripted, in my opinion.  Tris survives the death serum to be shot and dies in her mother's spirit - with a job well done daughter scenario. There is more to say about how the book progressed from the first chapter on but I believe enough has been said.  I would not recommend the book series due to the last book - &#34;Allegiant.&#34;. It was immature writing and a big let down - again, in my opinion.
006202406X|1.0|Poorly Done.  I don't understand people who say they didn't like it and still gave it three stars.  I love YA and this is the worst ending I've ever read to one. I wish I would have just read Insurgent and left it at that.  Honestly, it's slow and confusing.  Nothing is clearly resolved in the end.  The worse part is after Tris does die, Tobias has no sense of purpose or identity- he is just a boring character after her death (And he was my favorite character). This could have been an amazing book even if Tris did die, but unfortunately the whole book died.
1451666179|5.0|This book was a great read. I'm a big fan of Allie's web site and have already read and shared this book with others.
B004NSVE4Q|5.0|This is a very interesting book, I must say! It's an inside view of what goes on in the private sector where the new<br />interns and their supervisors collaborate, and give the interns the real scoop on how things are done in the hospital setting! It is a very thick book, and i haven't finished it, but will some day. I want to see how everything ends.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone with a medical student in school, or regular people desiring to get an inner view of what could be happening in a hospital near you!!

B00EW9GQR6|2.0|I've really enjoyed her earlier music, but was less than enthralled with her last two albums (this one included).  Nothing grabbed me as being really fun, clever or hummable with the exception of the commercial-ly appealing and fun \\"Applause\\" and \\"Do What You Want\\". It's more like she was using this album to convey some deeper message or something, when all I personally really wanted was some fun, danceable music.<br />While I applaud other artists in Gaga's \\"genre\\" trying to stretch their historical baseline in order to stay current and fresh (e.g., experimenting and pushing the envelope a bit, moving out of their comfort zone by experimenting with ballads, techno, disco, rock, urban r&b etc.), I think they still try to keep their music fun and danceable.  Gaga just didn't do it for me.  It just seems too forced and labored.
B00E1SM5UA|4.0|It is true that this album is basically adding many more notes and ornamentation to beautiful melodies that really didn't need that. However, the arrangements are well crafted and the music allows for a very enjoyable listen nonetheless.<br /><br />Update: I find myself liking and listening to this album more and more. Maybe the ornamentation just takes a while to get used to. As I said the arrangements are really good and di Meola is as much of a virtuoso as ever (bumping from 3 to 4 stars).
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|Loved the character development. Plot was thin IMHO but it kept me reading. I'd have liked to see greater effort taken to build the environment though. I couldn't get a good feel for the city from the lack of description. It never pulled me in the way other books have. But, all things aside, it's a great entry book in to the world of fantasy and I'll be reading the next two sequels for sure!

B00FSMN0AW|5.0|This movie is fantastic. It's amazing. Heart-breaking. Sweet. Perfect. Wonderful. I don't know enough words to even start to describe how this movie is. When you watch it, you'll understand. =')
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Good start at a cheap price, just that it needs to support more apps and add support for playing of local content from android and chrome devices (after all it's from google and i expect at least the entire google ecosystem is supported here).
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I mean I like this app but really Gameloft why gems for Rarity! I have Rarity but people don't want to buy gems they don't want to waste their money for an app and you can't resist to use gems after  you get them and really I saw a pony that was over 2000 bits!!!!! It's hard to get that many bits! I saw a video and they had about<br />123273832 bits and gems! How do they get all of that..... they could of wasted their money to get all of that. This is a terrific game but use your money wisely to buy gems and bits.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Love this movie. I leant this out, hoping to get the word out, never did get it back, and hope it is making the rounds making people aware of just one more crazy aspect of our modern life. I really recommend this to anyone who eats!<br />A real eye opener! Would also recommend joining groups who are advocating for sane food choices such as Organic consumers association and Food and Water Watch.
B0001MIQMG|2.0|The DVD was recieved but had a country code other than the United States. I think it was for Russia and Asia.

1400069289|3.0|This is an interesting book that explains the reasons behind formation of habits -tasks that people do without thinking- and their application to everyday life and business. Duhigg uses selected scientific research findings to present a theory about habit formation.  At  a cursory reading, the simplistic style of writing  seems to give an impression that the theory is quite new. A closer look at all the sources cited (and some lieterature search) shows that this theory has been around for some time. First proposed by  Dr. LR Squire of Univ of California, San Diego, the model suggests that habits are formed in a 3-step loop process triggered by a cue to follow a routine in the pursuit of a reward. The element of ‘craving’ acts as a driver of this loop according to Dr. W. Schultz (Univ of Cambridge, UK). Duhigg does a wonderful job in applying this concept of psychology to everyday life using real-life examples.<br /><br />The book desribes a practical framework for action to change a habit. It includes examination of the habit (in terms of cue, a routine, reward, and craving), identifying the routine, experimenting with rewards, isolating the cues and having a plan to modify the habit using a new routine as a response to the same cue to reach the same reward. Duhigg illustrates this approach by using an example of his own habit of eating a cookie at the cafeteria during the afternoon breaks. Duhigg has craftfully created a handbook of applied psychology that multiple segments of the society – addicts/behavioral disorder sufferers, organizations and marketers – could use.The strength of this book is the simplicity of a science-based model to show how habits are formed packaged with an ‘anyone can do it’ approach to change a habit. But it leaves out an important and well-accepted view that 'survival' is the evolutionary reason for habit formation (to prevent brain from wasting energy on routine tasks). The success of any habit changing effort depends on theextent to which the brain perceives the goal (of that behavior) as a matter of 'pro-survival'. In many (perhaps all) examples described in this book, the individual or the organization was facing the issue of survival (do or die) in one sense of the other; hence the successful transformation of a behavior. Another striking point of this book is that both habit and addiction were handeld as if they are one and the same without really explaing the basis. Habit is ‘by choice’ (until it becomes subconscious) while addiction is by definition ‘uncontrollable’ and not ‘by choice and according experts, they have entirely different neurobiologies. Lastly, with the story of a gambling addict and a major retailer's analytics-based marketing tactics disregarding customer privacy, he fails to adequately address the nuances of the underlying ethical issues.<br /><br />In conclusion, although this book is filled with topics that resonates well with the business community, its effectiveness (ROI - measured in terms of number of people/firms who could change their habits) is likely to be very low.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is fun to play and moves at a good pace. Great! ! ! ! I play it with my son every day.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I got this for free so I really shouldn't complain BUT I refuse to buy things within the game. Because I won' t purchase things or SPAM my Facebook friends I can't really enjoy this game for more than 15 minutes. Also I played for a little while and have been stuck at a level for days. I don't think you can even pass it without purchasing items to help you pass the level. Huge money grab!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|its defiantly a tom cruise movie...if you have seen mission impossible you have already seen this bad acting before.....STARTS OFF STRONG THEN GETS STUPID !!!
B00DHBOQMM|4.0|Anyone intrigued by the blurb of the latest 'Lincoln Lawyer' novel will not be disappointed by Connelly's recent dramatically named piece The Gods of Guilt.<br /><br />The story revolves around the murder of a once-time cilent of Haller's, and his determination to discover the truth of it, while defending the prime suspect. The book is a little slow burn for the first half, and then risks becoming uncomfortably dense with intrigue. Nonetheless the finale saves all and combines tension and slightly cynical fun to create a good conclusion.<br /><br />I only have two beefs with this book - the link between Haller and the murder victim didn't deliver on tension. This story was promised to pass judgment on whether Haller himself was guilty or innocent, but ultimately the relationship just felt like an excuse to get Haller involved in the case, rather than a conflict generator itself.<br /><br />My second (small) beef is the prose of this book. While I am a fan of 'plain-speak' and enjoy authors who can communicate clear action without flowery purplish prose, I felt at times I was reading creative writing from high-school. Mayhap this is just my opinion, but it would be interesting to see what others thought.<br /><br />Overall Gods of Guilt is a great legal-drama that delivers on both drama and legalese - recommended for fans of Connelly and the genre.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Love the audio quality of these mics so much I bought a 3rd just as a back up. I've compared the audio recordings I've get with these mics from numerous handheld dynamic microphones, and condenser microphones such as the MXL 840 ($100 for 2). The MXL 840's are slightly crisper, noticeable mainly when recording paino. However, because they are XLR, they require me to upgrade to a recorder like the Tascam d40 (which I do NOT recommend) that can accept XLR inputs. Anyway, after basic cleanup in Audacity (eg: noise removal and normalizing), I and my family have a very hard time hearing any significant audio improvement from using the MXL mics vs these. These mics are much better (less noise) than dynamic mics.<br /><br />Note that I'm completely misusing these mics, as I have two of them taped at the front of a community theater stage to pick up the actors -- and they work very well for that purpose. If you aren't willing to spend a few hundred $ per microphone for better mics, then I'd suggest just using these. They work great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great! A great way to chill out and relax. I did find a glitch. Sometimes it just shuts down in the middle of a game.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Josh Whedon doesn't disappoint, and the cast shined in their roles.  He just seems to know actors that are actually great in their roles, not just beautiful box office faces.  This is how Shakespeare should be brought to the new generations, with brilliant directors like Whedon

B00EUUJID6|5.0|Christmas Album<br />This trio is just amazing!  I hope they never break up as so many do.  I saw them at Tampa Bay Forum, but the lighting there I felt was too much in background; therefore, making it difficult to really see them.  I just LOVE them and their music!!!!!

B003P2WO5E|5.0|Five stars  for this almost perfectly written book on a realm far far away in the magical kingdom of knights, Parshendi and soulcasters. A fantastic military adventure in a fantasy world that will bind you to this series forever. The one miniscule problem I have to wait for the next installment. A great read for all genders and ages.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I want to read my book. It won't let me read it until I write some review thing on here
B003G4W49C|4.0|My sister recommended this book to me for years, and I always opted for something else based on the presumption that it was a sci-fi novel. Not that I have anything against sci-fi, I just have to be in the mood to read it.<br />This book was impressive. I would not classify if as a sci-fi novel, but more as a drama. It's like Harry Potter meets Star Wars.  And the technical Vision of the author in the 80's is absolutely amazing. He writes about students having 'desks' that are literally equivalent to today's tablets. The 'nets' used for political dialogue are today's blogs. It's amazing the insight and foresight the author had in describing the technology that a has now become as much a staple for people today as it was for the characters in the book.<br /><br />I think the most pleasant surprise about this book is that it is about Ender. About his feelings, experiences, triumphs, failures (few as they were) desires, history and character.  He is literally the original Harry Potter.
1442359919|5.0|It’s been many many years since I read a book by Stephen King. Probably about 8 or so and that was a reread of Pet Semetary. So when I had the opportunity to review Joyland I jumped on it.<br /><br />I did have just a few hesitations when I found out Joyland isn’t Stephen King’s regular horror fair, but then I reminded myself of The Body, The Green Mile, and Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. I hoped that this would be a story as good as those and it was.<br /><br />At its heart Joyland is a coming of age tale that anyone could relate too. Devin Jones tells us the story of the summer his heart was broken, the summer he saved lives by chance, and the summer he solved a murder.<br /><br />Dev’s story is entwined with that of the ghost that haunts the horror house at Joyland. The mystery is a good one. I did figure it out before Dev but not by much.<br /><br />The audiobook is read by Michael Kelly. He has a pleasant voice and it was so easy to picture him as Dev. I’ve listened to some audiobooks and thought the narrators weren’t a good fit but that wasn’t the case at all with Joyland.<br /><br />I really can’t recommend this book enough. The story and characters were so well done that I continued to think about them long after I was done.

B001GQO50I|4.0|Heard several stories about how this should-have Doors 2-CD release became a reality. Most common is that 'Live At The Matrix '67' was notably a bootleg recording that (was never meant) to be heard by the general public. Do keep in mind that the overall sound quality of these two live discs aren't perfect - but still very good + quite acceptable. 'Matrix '67' is two early live performances by The Doors (in their entirety). Gigs took place in San Fransisco @ the famed Matrix club on March 7 and 10, 1967. The -original- tapes were later re-stored while being played on a professionally used four-channel tape recorder. Assuming that the intended purpose was to make these two historic shows of (very) listenable quality to the masses. In my humble opinion, mission was definitely accomplished, to say the very least. Essential for all true Doors fans.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Very unique Dvd.<br />Decent acting and sort of a deep story, but made a lot of sense<br />about the other side, and how some may perceive it.
B007A2O3FO|3.0|There's an elephant in the room here.  I don't want to spoil this for anyone, but if you need joy around you at Christmas or you have a sensitive child-one for whom &#34;The Little Matchgirl&#34; or &#34;Charlotte's Web&#34; is NOT an option-- this is NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU!  Yes, Maggie Smith is wonderful, the sets are wonderful, but the sadness may not be for everyone.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Although I felt this book ended abruptly, I loved it. Kept me wanting to read all the time. The stories are well written and weaved together fabulously. Been on my 'to read' list for years.
B00011CZRE|5.0|What a great movie!  This movie has a great action filled plot that really leaves you thinking.  The ending was not expected at all!
B00F1W1SQW|4.0|The setlist is great, though I maybe would have swapped out some of the ADToE songs for some more of 6DOIT or SFAM stuff. The Awake songs played are the highlights for me. James' singing sounds really good to me, better than Budokan but not as good as on Score.<br /><br />The worst part of this is the mix though- Petrucci is God, but he's way too loud and he almost completely drowns out Jordan (keys) and Myung (bass). In fact, not only can't you hear the bass you almost never see Myung at all! What did he mess around with the editor's wife or something? Strange that's he's left out on almost every song.<br /><br />Mangini is a machine, almost to a fault. At least it looks like he's having a great time and he can play Portnoy's stuff with his eyes closed if tasked I'm sure. I'm sure JP doesn't miss Portnoy's spittle all over his amps but I think I miss his presence. I miss his alternating setlists, that's for sure.

B008JFUS28|5.0|I went into this movie cautiosly optimistic because of two reasons: (1) sequels usually fall short of the original and (2) Thor is the most unique of the Avengers (not being from earth, he's a God instead of a human, etc.).  My expectations were completely blown away.  This is one of a few sequels that I think are better than the original.  I personally liked the original, but the character depth and storyline in this sequel are much better.  Everything from camera angles to balance of action scenes was done extremely well.  If you're a fan of Thor/Avengers and Game of Thrones, then this is the love child of those two franchises.  Coincidentally, this was directed by one of the directors from Game of Thrones and you can see some of those tones here in this movie.<br /><br />This movie also has some decent setups for future Marvel Phase 2 movies as well.  Stay for the mid-credit extra scene and you'll see the biggest of these setups.<br /><br />Marvel likes to remind its audience about its larger universe of characters that are tied together.  The hints here and there for referencing the larger Marvel universe are mostly done well, except a few, but those aren't by any means a bad thing.  Some of them just felt like a little bit of a stretch in an effort to get something in there.<br /><br />See the film - you won't be dissapointed.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This has been my favorite program since the first one aired.  As I told my son-in-law, Gerald Luss, a few years  ago as we were discussing politics and the current situation at the time, &#34;Why don't we just put The West Wing actors in Washington and let them run the government - they would probably do a better job than what's going on now.&#34;
B001F2W4Y2|2.0|When buying a new AC/DC album, which have become increasingly far between, you mustn't let the critics set you up for disappointment - it seems with each new studio release, the critics complain that AC/DC's sound hasn't changed in thirty-plus years. This is much like a wife seeing her husband in his underwear every morning for thirty years, his gut overflowing from constant Pabst Blue Ribbon consumption, and suddenly expecting him to have a Thor-like physique at the next sunrise. But AC/DC's refusal to change their sound by any drastic lengths - yet still providing decades of some of the best hard rock ever known to man - is part of their charm.<br />However, upon buying &#34;Black Ice&#34; in 2008, I was disappointed. Not by the lack of musical expansion (who in their right mind would want AC/DC to begin employing strings and Eastern influences?), but by the lack of passion. I still remember the trek to Wal-Mart...backpacking through the Himalayas to reach the store, two of my guides devoured by wild beasts (I managed to fend off the animals using a broken Quiet Riot disc - the only good kind - as a shiv). When I finally got there, I stood in awe at the array of differently colored versions of the CD (I bought the red one, in case you were wondering, though I'm sure you weren't).<br />But what I remember most is being greatly let down when I played the album.<br />'Rock N' Roll Train,' one of four tracks on a single disc containing the word &#34;rock&#34; or a variation thereof in the title, started things off promisingly enough, though by now I was desperately wishing Brian Johnson would take back the lyrical reigns from the Young brothers (still scratching my head at what they mean when they insist I &#34;pick it up and move it, give it to the spot&#34;). A large fraction of the rest of &#34;Black Ice&#34; was a bore - it seemed AC/DC was just going through the motions, with no direction, and certainly lacking the frenzied attack of previous albums. As brilliant a producer as Brendan O'Brien is, a producer is still left with little to improve upon with weak material. The riffs mostly seem like the first thing that came to the Angus and Malcolm's heads in order to fill space.<br />However, a few tracks are worth repetition; 'Rock n' Roll Train,' a guilty pleasure in that it seems like every AC/DC cliche packed into four minutes, the infectious 'Anything Goes,' 'Stormy May Day' (for Angus' interesting use of slide guitar), the growling title track, the downright awesome 'Spoilin' For a Fight,' and there's a reason Brian Johnson cites 'Money Made' as his favorite track from &#34;Black Ice&#34; - its arrangement and approach are more soulful than hard rock, fitting Johnson's still-potent, exciting vocals.<br />And, one must note that it's great to still hear hard rock's greatest rhythm section, Cliff Williams and Phil Rudd, playing with such determination, even on lackluster material. It's actually great to hear AC/DC play anything, even if it's a cover of 'We've Only Just Begun' - but I couldn't help but be disappointed by the seemingly unmotivated material after eight years of waiting for the next AC/DC attack.a producer as Brendan O'Brien is, a producer is still left with little to improve upon with weak material.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|I think Johnny Lee Miller is a much better Knightley than Jeremy Northam ever was, which is the main reason I love this movie.  Romola Garai is also a very good Emma, and having Michael Gambon in any movie is a plus.  :)  The storyline is well-developed as I've come to expect from the BBC, the soundtrack adds to the whole thing, and the filming is beautifully done.  This is my favorite adaptation of Emma, even if it does take most of the day to watch the whole thing.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad the screens are different with either move limits scores clear jellys or removing ingredients. You need to think before to get max out of moves.<br />I swore I would not download this app but I did and I can't put it down.
B0049985XW|5.0|One of the best movies ever made, Walter Huston and Humphrey Bogart shine in this classic.  It's a movie I can enjoy viewing every year.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book. Brought me to tears a few times. Very thought provoking  loved the development of the  characters  didn't  want to put it down
4805311193|1.0|If you have no idea who the Shinsengumi were and perhaps never even heard of them, then maybe you will glean a little bit of information from this text. For the most part it is underwhelming, lacks critical information and is poorly written. For each point or event the author skims past, there are numerous pieces of critical or supporting information that was left out, making the text very shallow and nowhere near as informative as it could be.<br /><br />Personally, I got nothing out of this text, but I am glad I didn't buy the hardcover when it first came out, because even $10 for the paperback makes me feel like I was robbed.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I like true stories on DVD.  This one keeps you looking at this movie.  I was blown away at how the use of items back in that time.  And they showed the real people to the actors playing a part.  This was in the bonus features.  It was almost the same.  People who like action, and true stores this is one they will like.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A page turner. A wonderfully open and entertaining look into a few women's lives that simultaneously make you smile and empathize. Well worth it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I like the old weather channel app. The one that was easy to  read and did not constantly offer you crap.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|This is another great CD from Jack Johnson,  I still like his beat from his first great CD to this one.  Reminds me of CCR with their songs using the same or similar repeating beat
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|Good headset.  Surround sound and wireless for the same cost as some of the wired competition.  I have two younger kids (5 and 2) and a knack for getting consumed and extremely competitive in COD; I knew if one of them tripped over the cord and yanked it off my head I would be prone to use some adult language to express my surprise.<br /><br />Pros: Wireless, surround sound, good sound quality.<br /><br />Cons: Though marketed as &#34;the only PS4 compatible headset out of the box&#34; there isn't a shred of direction for setting up on the PS4.  You can go to their website, though, and find the directions.  It is truthfully an XBox 360 headset (even has a sticker of the controller on it) that was wisely equipped with a cable that would make it work with the PS4.  Neither here nor there.<br /><br />It works.  Sounds good.  Fair price.  If I didn't have little ones and a need for wireless, I would probably have bought the Tritton 7.1's
B002WVCRHO|5.0|Exciting movie about friends and love. Paints Germany in a different way. Competition at the finest, general good sportsmanship at it's best.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|It was ok. to star trek fans it my now think very good.  Trying to look like a cast new actors for the TV star trec.  With &#34;deep space&#34;  you had all different actors with new named star track.  The special effects a outstanding.  But that was all for me.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|If I had to sum up this book in one sentence, the sentence that springs to mind is: this is the best book I’ve ever read, that I never, ever want to read again.<br />It was an intense book. Extremely well written, but probably the scariest book I have ever read in my life. Seriously, put this book up against the more gruesome horror novel and I will almost guarantee you that this is the one that will give you nightmares all night long. It did to me. For two nights solid after plowing through Still Alice I found myself plagued with nightmares, waking myself up in panic because I had convinced myself that my memory was failing me.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show, great acting, good stories. Benedict Cumberbatch is hot, hot, hot as Sherlock. He's impatient and kind of mean but fascinating. Martin Freeman is great as his long-suffering friend and detective companion. Have watched all the episodes more than once.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A coming of age story that combined the good and the bad of reality. I think the book should have ended mid sentence..
B006XBSAP2|4.0|i was told this was a teenage musician - strange I am far from teenage years and i like her music.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Tuf is a surprising character. I didn't realize his depths. It makes me wish there were more books to this series.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Awesome and perfectly easy to use app. Would recommend. Was able to clean up junk file free up memory and uninstall old apps. Now running smooth again.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|I gave this book five stars because I found this novel to be completely flawless. The writing, the characters, the pacing, setting…everything was completely perfect and I loved every second I spend reading this novel, even when it broke my heart.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Great Movie, I give it 5 stars to offset the haters who dismiss this movie without any understanding of the Dune saga. 4//5  -  i wish the ending were different and tone back on the overacting, Kyle McLaughlin's hair was too big .
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I really enjoyed the second installment and look forward to watching the movie hopefully it does the book justice and not a disappointment
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is pretty addictive. It is really fun but gets a little blotchy and freezes up sometimes, which can be really annoying if you're in the middle of a lane switch.
B00DJYJQ36|1.0|This movie is so blah, I've yet to watch it in full. Got 30mins in then went to bed. Tried again a few nights later, where I left off and then only got 20mins in and was falling asleep. I think I should just give up.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Amazing voice, amazing disc... All of It.  Enjoy.  Can't go wrong owning it. Hard to STOP listening to, she's so mesmerizing.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Wedding Night is the fourth stand alone novel I’ve read to date and although it had it’s charms, it was not my favorite. The biggest problem for me is that the novel was just a tad too long. Now, I love a long novel, I mean, my favorite novel of all time is probably the unabridged version of The Stand…but this novel just felt unnecessarily long. I never before felt as though a Sophie Kinsella novel dragged but this one did. Not terribly so, but the buildup just kept going and going and after awhile I just wanted to skip ahead to see how it all played out.<br /><br />Despite that, it was a very fun novel to read and I found myself chuckling out loud more than once. It definitely had the Kinsella charm and I could totally see a sequel coming from Wedding Night. I think I’d actually enjoy that.
006117758X|5.0|“It was a joy! Words weren't dull, words were things that could make your mind hum. If you read them and let yourself feel the magic, you could live without pain, with hope, no matter what happened to you.”<br /><br />Truly one of the grittiest, hilarious, and dirtiest novels of our times.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|At day 50, great. I guess added verbiage is demanded, meaning I just cannot say it is great I have to add a bunch of words in the Oh and Ah categorical lexicon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this is on kindle now!!! I love it. :) it is really easy to use and looks super good on your kindle. Get it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The kind of  book you think about everyday. Fantastic in every way. So impressed and so worth the purchase, new favorite.
B00EVW0VTI|4.0|Wasn't really my kind of movie, but it was pretty action packed, it kept my attention! It was movie night so I couldn't go wrong.
B008UX2UIO|3.0|This will probably be the most difficult book I’ve reviewed thus far, and not because of the pint of beer and two glasses of wine I had at dinner tonight…nope, it is strictly due to the fact that two days after finishing the final page of The Confederacy of Dunces I still am not sure what to think about it.<br />On one hand, I have to admit that it was a brilliantly written book. Each character, no matter how minor had a very specific voice that practically made the novel sing. On the other hand…God, I hated Ignatius. So many times I just wanted to take the novel and chuck it across the room because I would get so worked up about something Ignatius did (or didn’t do) or something he said. My feelings for him got really intense to the point where I was looking forward to getting to the end just so I could get rid of him. Pretty irrational I know, but I’m fairly certain this is the reason why this novel won a Pulitzer Prize and people still laud over it, three decades after it was first published.<br />As a reader who also possessed a Bachelors Degree in Psychology, I could not help but wonder, more than a few times. whether or not Ignatius did in fact suffer from Asperger’s, I’m almost certain that when this book was written, this diagnosis was uncommon and most likely NOT an intentional diagnosis but one does have to wonder upon reading just the opening chapter of this book. If I was still a student, I would have loved to do a character study on Ignatius on a psychological standpoint. He definitely is one of those characters that stand out, and probably will stick with me for the rest of my life.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|This is the second book i'm reading by Chimamanda and i must say she has done it again! I could almost taste and smell the surroundings. This book did not disappoint.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is better than the castle Ville for Facebook.  I'm not getting bombarded with a million quests all at the same time.  The quests are actually achievable.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|I gave this book a .3star enjoyed this book that could be truthful and romance mix that made you want to keep reading to find that happy ending.  I look forward to reading more of these books
B000QRIGLC|5.0|has to be the best account of a military operation I ever read . no holes bared real talk !
B0070Z9KWM|3.0|Must have watched a trillion times, very good movie, have to really pay attention though, even if you miss just a little part of this movie, you won't be able to fully understand it! I love Daniel Craig, very good actor. If you have a day, or a night for just  relaxing watching movies, this one will be a great pick!!
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|An interesting angle to the horrible past of - and present - racism. A very good plot, written by an expert on litigation.
0618918248|5.0|Although sometimes he becomes rather philosophical and occasionally a little complicated to understand, in the course of the reading, you clarify your doubts and he gave me a lot of new questions to think about and always new answers. I am very fond of this writer.
B00FXEL00W|4.0|Initially difficult to get into - the book then moved along nicely to a relatively realistic ending ~<br />Tenderly written with an appreciation of the difficulties attached to finding yourself in love for the first time with your best friend.<br />Sensitively describing the difficulties of coming out.<br />Good love story!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is not even close too being worse than minecraft. The people that created this are a LOT more creative. I highly recommend this game to you.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Sorry! But I thought it was awful! I bought it for my grandson, & he he insisted that I watch it with him, he was all into it, but I could hardly wait until it was over! I pretended to like it just as much as he did!
147676459X|5.0|Buy this book if:  1) You want a good laugh; 2) You admire a great cartoonist; 3) You are depressed and feel alone or know someone who is depressed and wonder why; 4) You already read Hyperbole on the internet and want more); and, what hit me hardest, 5) the final chapter.  I identified with most of the book (I have depression and an uncontrollable dog), but Chapter 5 told me that my darkest feelings are not unique,that maybe they are just a symptom of depression, not my true self.  Thanks, Ms. Brosh (I was raised in Virginia so I can't just call you Allie).  Your internet stories showed an honest view of depression, and your last chapter was so revealing it brought me to tears.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great game! Still playing it 3 weeks later and I think there still a lot left to do.
B00GME2NCG|5.0|I have no clue why such low ratings. This was such a good movie. At first I was skeptical because of Ashton Kutcher, but he was brilliant. Very informative. Awe inspiring. A must watch!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome trilogy and looks great on Blu-Ray. Recommended for any Batman fans. Was able to purchase for much less from here opposed to other outlets.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|If you're familiar with the works of Shakespeare (which it should be noted I am not, with an exception or two), you'll find the plot of Much Ado About Nothing familiar: Beatrice (Amy Acker) and Benedick (Alexis Denisof) are engaged in a war of words, their witty barbs concealing their true love. While Benedick claims he will die a bachelor, the young Claudio (Fran Kranz) is determined to marry Hero (Jillian Morgese). While waiting for the wedding to occur, Benedick and Beatrice's friends/family decide to play a trick on them by declaring within earshot of one that the other is in love with them. Hilarity and drama ensue.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the works of Joss Whedon (which it should be noted I am), you won't be at all surprised by how well he is able to combine thoroughly modern dress with Shakespeare's text. Whedon, ever an admirer of words, has changed but one word of the original dialogue (he got rid of an anti-Semitic joke), which is why you'll find snazzily dressed businessmen talking of war and citizens of the 21st century behaving as if a woman has no value other than her purity. Unlike Ralph Fiennes' recent adaptation of Coriolanus, which felt stiff and dull, Whedon's adaptation of Much Ado is full of life and energy. Though this is the first major non-SF/fantasy work he's done, it feels very much of a piece with the sort of genre mish-mashing Whedon does so well.<br /><br />In some ways, this is the Joss Whedon movie I've always wanted. Just as some are worshipers of the Bard, I am a devout Whedonite. If you're screaming bloody bias right now, hey, I can't fault you. I've genuinely loved everything he's done--even Dollhouse, the weakest and least-regarded of his work, is fascinating--but Much Ado About Nothing is different. It's not that there are no monsters or spaceships, as I've seen some stodgy critics applaud the film for, but because Whedon has been freed from all creative restraints, as he was with 2008's Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.The off-the-cuff nature of the production, which went from conception to filming during a month's worth of downtime from The Avengers, lends the film a liberated, anything-goes spirit. The only set is Whedon's home, and the cast consists of good friends coming together for a laugh, but it is so much more than an in-joke.<br /><br />For one, it just looks great. Shot in black-and-white by Dollhouse DP Jay Hunter, there isn't a single shot of this film that doesn't look gorgeous. Whedon financed the film himself, and while I'm sure he has deeper pockets than many other independent filmmakers, it's still impressive just how rich the photography is. The B&W screwball nature of the film recalls classics from the '30s and '40s; it's not hard to imagine Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant assuming the roles of Beatrice and Benedick in Whedon's version. While I've adored all his films, and Serenity in particular has some beautiful stuff, each of them has lacked some of the pure aesthetic verve of his TV work. That's not the usual complaint you hear; movies aren't supposed to look like TV! But the episodes of his series directed by the man himself, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer's &#34;The Body&#34; or Firefly's &#34;Objects in Space,&#34; are some of the most riveting pieces of filmmaking I've seen. Unrestrained by an anxious studio or Marvel's house style, Much Ado About Nothing captures the clever visual artistry of Whedon's best work.<br /><br />So Whedon is a witty guy who knows his way around words, and he's got directorial chops. That's great. None of it would mean anything, though, if he hadn't assembled a cast capable of doing justice to Shakespeare's play. Luckily, almost all of the actors have worked with Whedon before and...well, what can I say? Whedon actors are just better than other actors. Acker and Denisof are terrific as Beatrice and Benedick. Denisof's macho blustering as Benedick hides a childish need to be loved; there's a great sight gag of him lying onhis bed, legs swaying back and forth in the air as he gazes lovestruck at Beatrice's picture. Acker outdoes herself, giving one of the most confident and fully-realized performances of the year as Beatrice. Like Benedick, she talks a good talk, but only to hide from herself the fact that she loves Benedick more than anyone. Like nearly all the actors, they handle Shakespeare's dialogue with gusto, their modern line readings giving a new perspective on the Bard's work.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is terrific as well. I liked Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson in the Marvel movies, but I never knew he could be as smart and cunning as he is as Leonato; Nathan Fillion works some of his Captain Hammer macho cluelessness on the role of Dogberry; Reed Diamond proves that he's one of the most undervalued actors in the Whedon stable as Don Pedro; Fran Kranz completely owns the role of Claudio, showing that there's more to him than the lovable nerd types of Dollhouse and The Cabin in the Woods; and newcomer Jillian Morgese makes a memorable debut as Hero, showing a talent for both the comedic and the dramatic, both of which are very important tools for Shakespeare and Whedon. A couple of the minor actors, like Garfunkel and Oates' Riki Lindhome and Spencer Treat Clark, don't handle the language as well, but they certainly don't derail the film.<br /><br />After all that, what else is there to say? If you're a Whedon fan such as myself, you'll recognize everything you love about the man's work in a new setting and get goosebumps over Fred and Wesley being reunited; if you're a Shakespeare fan, you'll be pleased by such an inventive modern adaptation. And if you're a movie fan, well, you'll find that Much Ado About Nothing is simply a delight from start to finish.
0316322407|5.0|A personal view through Malala of what it is like to live in Pakistan as a female and how the Taliban slowly integrated themselves into the city via propaganda, threats, religious compliance and fear. In my opinion, Malala deserved the Nobel Peace Prize. What she did as a young girl to speak for education in the midst of the above takes overwhelming courage and is far above what past recipients did who won this award. She paid the price but she has the ultimate revenge in that her cause is now receiving global support. I primarily bought this book to help her cause and because I felt for her; however, I really enjoyed this book, much more than I thought I would. You go girl!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So much better than the original Castleville! No waiting for mana or energy refills. Just smooth graphics and interesting game play. Lots to do and several ways to use crafted or gathered items. Never boring. Even daily chances to win crowns for extra stuff!
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I love the game the graphics are amazing. its easy to play and a great time passer. I gave it 3 stars only because it lags a little

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I have a healthy appetite for devouring numerous books from various genres each year. The Name of the Wind is one of the few books I have read cover to cover without pause, several times.<br /><br />The characters are complex, yet simple. And the token fantasy elements are present, yet spun into a ravishing story in an incredibly addictive and new way that makes me feel as if I'm discovering the fantasy genre again for the first time. The second volume continues to garner the same praise from me as I eagerly await the third. Thank you for sharing your passion and creativity with me, Patrick Rothfuss.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The best game ever!  I'm on level 250... where's the hospital?? It's clear and i love the graphics. Go ahead and try it'

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual, King never disappoints me.  I've been a loyal fan of his books since Salem' s Lot and Carrie.  I found it intriguing to see what powers Danny still possessed since The Shining.  Very good read.  Intertwining his past with his present by saving Abra from evil \\"steam stealers\\".  Keep' em coming !!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I' ve never written a review before, but felt absolutely compelled to share this cautionary note on this publication. The character decisions in this book were poorly planned and even more poorly executed. I could not believe that an Author who has written so masterfully and deeply about these characters in the past, could ever think that they would make these decisions in the future. The rehabilitation of certain characters was absolutely laughable. And Ms. Roth definitely went for a cheap emotional thrill with her final story arc for Tris. the payoff was hollow and depressing when Ms Roth clearly wanted us to be uplifted. I could not have been more disappointed in the outcome and will do my best to demonstrate that by skipping the movie when it comes out. I may have already bought the book and lined her pocket, but I don't have to do anything more to give her the impression that this was okay. I hear people are outraged by this book, and rightly so. I join you in your outrage and hope that you will feel vindicated as more people share your perspective!

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|My husband handed me the game and I started playing it . Then I found out it was like his Simpson's game only with more things to do so I told hi. It was my game now
B00992CF6W|5.0|You really need to get this app! They make there updates just on time, and the controls are so easy to use! If you put a bad comment...<br />I would say, so it's blocks.. but it's still fun if you ask me. Thank you for adding the great amazing apps Amazon! You are doing great so far. But first, I'm just saying, do not install your kik. Then they have a new version when you install it again! But again... thanks for the app
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Very good movie!! Couldn't pull myself away from the TV while watching it to even use the restroom!!! I loved this movie!! Very suspenseful!!
B002TXZRNQ|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was given to me as a gift from a friend. She knew it wasn’t my kind of genre and said, “Just trust me on this on.” I figured I’d probably only get through half of it. How surprised I was to find such a poignant  true story with a very special<br />message for all of us about what really matters most in life. I loved the format as it was told from the viewpoints of a dying professor and his former student. I really couldn’t put this one down. It was a short and easy read. This dedicated student now a man forms such a strong bond with his professor and the bonds grow even stronger when Morrie reveals more of life lessons to Mitch. It touched me so much on every level.There are moments through the book that caused me to reflect upon my own life and almost felt Morrie’s messages were intended for me .<br />I highly recommend this one to curl up with and make you feel good about life.<br />I have already purchased Mitch Albom’s The Five People You Meet in Heaven.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I love the game, everything is good except.....you have to get lives from friends or wait 15-20 mins. to play. Also I beat a certain level 3 times and wouldn't even give me a star, even when I had 12 shots left. I wish it didn't link up to Facebook, I just want to play the game on my time!
0230768695|5.0|This is a wonderful historical novel, centering on the life of Richard III, but also weaves and tells the story of his York family and the historical events that most associate with the &#34;Cousin's War&#34;. Anyone with an interest in the royal houses of York, Lancaster or Tudor will absolutely love this book. it was originally published 30 years ago, but contains an updated forward by the author. I actually came across this title while reading comments on the Starz channel's &#34;The White Queen&#34;  Facebook page. A number of individuals who were also following this mini-series recommended this novel in their commentary. Highly recommended!

B009RX7IX8|5.0|As a Castle fanatic I eagerly awaited the date when Season Five would be available on DVD.  I own all the seasons of Castle on DVD and have watched them frequently.  This lastest season is by far my favorite since Season Two, with the mother of all cliffhangers to keep you dangling in suspense until Season Six.  Seeing the culminatilon of five years of longing glances, innuendo, and sly witticisms lead to a mature, romantic relationship between the two leads was well worth the wait.  The DVD collections packaging is well done, just as on previous seasons, and don't miss out on the numerous outakes, special features and behind the scenes extras.  Highly recommed.
B000O77QD8|4.0|To see this in Blu-ray,it will show you what the Marines went thru on Iwo Jima.A very fair telling of the reality of war.There is insight and meticulous details in this.Worth it to get it.Its better to get this first.Then get&#34;Letters from Iwo Jima&#34;.Very affordable,fast delivery,no problems at all.

B009KS4XRO|2.0|Its fun to play but would rather buy a game and be able to play all I want. Basically, &#34;the free&#34; is just to bring you in then they want you to buy credits to be able to continue playing. No thanks. Becky
B001I9B9I4|3.0|Story at times was overly simplistic in resolutions. Direction of Katie H could have been better in some scenes. Marc is a very good actor with great facial expressions as is Michael Keaton who added much to the believability of this film.  Sappy ending.But great dance scenes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Starts easy. and builds to be challenging.  Levels can be beat without paying extra for a few levels. Try and see. Addictive.

B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|Despite the expected kibbitzing, this is a great collection and self-recommending. While it does NOT contain every B-side or cover (and since it's volume one, we need to wait for more), it is a monumental and beautifully packaged set for an endlessly important and rewarding musical career. It's nice to have the underrated gems like &#34;Self-Portait&#34; alongside the accepted classics.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there is a problem with mine, so be forewarned. The copy of &#34;Blonde on Blonde&#34; in the box has two identical Disc Ones, rather than Disc One and Two, so I get &#34;Visions of Joanna,&#34; etc. twice, but no &#34;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.&#34; It's a problem, especially considering the cost, and it doesn't seem to have a solution. I -- and one other person -- may just be unlucky. I hope that's the case.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Since  I have to keep kid friendly games on my kindle, this is great fun for the family (and me :) )
B002SR2PKG|3.0|I read this as a hard cover when it was first released, and it became one of my favorite horror stories. Told in a non-linear fashion, it chronicled the story of seven kids who defeated an ancient evil in the town of Derry, returning to finish the job once and for all as adults. On a deeper level, it had tremendous insight into the magical nature of youth, and the limitations of adulthood. Just having finished the ebook after first reading the novel so many years ago, I'm better able to see both the good and bad of the story.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />It's absolutely delightful in its treatment of children. It fully illustrates the magical essence of childhood innocence coupled with kids' surprisingly accurate assessment of human nature. Their hopes and fears are fully brought to life. The novel is also, frankly, terrifying. As high as the highs are, there is an almost constant sense of danger as the evil entity (later named by the children as simply &#34;It&#34;) manipulates and preys upon the entire town. The non-linear fashion is also very rewarding, with both the past and present progressing along in unison. At any moment, we're also thrown further into the future and far into the past.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Stephen King delights in extreme characters and personalities. It's tiring after a while to be inundated with so many extreme personalities. Each extreme character is agonizingly examined in excessive detail. It's why I stopped reading Stephen King stories several years ago, I just got tired of constantly being thrown into the minds and psyche of so many obsessive and psychologically-extreme people. Also, the jaunts into the past in this story are rewarding at first, but start to get a bit tedious later as those events are given incredible detail. It seems as if each character needs to be explained and detailed fully, and it gets overwhelming after a fashion.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give the story four stars. In spite of its weaknesses, it's a thrilling, terrifying, and immensely enjoyable story. I gave it three stars though because the ebook is wrought with technical problems. The original electronic manuscript wasn't used to generate the ebook. Rather, the novel itself was scanned into a computer and an OCR (optical character recognition) program converted the image of the pages back into text. This causes MANY typos. For example, Beverly is frequently referred to as &#34;Bevvie&#34; by her family and friends. The OCR program translated that to &#34;Bewie&#34;. When Bill stutters, he would say &#34;l...l...like&#34;, but it would translate as &#34;1...1...like&#34;. Spaces are missing between words, and some spellings are so far off that you have to reread the sentence a few times to infer what words were originally intended. I easily recommend the book, but just warn that this electronic version does have problems resulting from the translation from printed book back to an electronic medium.thrilling, terrifying, and immensely enjoyable story.

B00BB67UNW|4.0|I really liked this one a lot.  This is modern day film noir at its best.  Well written, sharply directed, beautifully filmed - and the cast knocked it out of the park.  As is almost expected out of Hollywood these days, there's a hint of a liberal political bias bubbling under the surface, but it's not in your face in every scene.  Every character has his flaws and his secrets.  The entire cast turned in outstanding performances, but Mark Wahlberg, Katherine Zeta-Jones and Russell Crowe were all at their best.  If you like the Bogie movies of the 40's, this is about as close as you're gonna find in a 2013 production.

0440246318|3.0|I'm a disappointed Lee Child fan with this one. It's a good story with about 150 pages too many. The story is drowning in statistics which do little more than make a late night reader like myself cross-eyed and impatient. Child could have stripped most of that away without losing the thread of an interesting and compelling plot. The bonus short story at the end of the novel is a good example of how to say a lot without filling pages with extraneous details. I'll keep reading his books, but I'm somewhat miffed about this one, as you can tell..
B003B02PEU|5.0|WOW!!!This was a heartfelt, wonderful, and exciting book. It is another awesome John Grisham Novel !!! I would recommend this book to my friends and my enemies !!!

061891868X|4.0|Smolin's critique of String theory is well thought out. It is not that he denies the possibility of string it is just that he sees that there is no way to prove it , there is no good evidence, though very elegent it is really not possible to create an experiment on it.

B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I had this game for over a year and had a lot of rare dragons.<br />To name a few I had a bone Dragon, three clover dragons, two Celtic dragons, and many other tricky to breed dragons.<br /><br />I spent some actual money towards this game.<br /><br />The graphics are great. The activities are easy and fun. The dragons can go between adorable to fierce in a single feeding. And you can customize their names too. Great for new players.<br /><br />But now I have to start over from scratch. The update made me lose EVERYTHING.<br /><br />So while I personally don't plan on playing this game anymore unless they can reactivate my account to its former glory, I do recommend it to all new players. But to old owners Beware. DON'T UPDATE. YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Really cute app.  I don't normally like these kind of apps but once I got going I just kept on.

B004EPYZSK|4.0|It's not the first time these two genres have been put together (think Westworld, or - yeach - Wild Wild West the movie), and the western is the better of the two intermixed genres (we've seen these kinds of aliens before, done better).  But this is still a good mixing of the two.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is pretty awesome. I like playing this game by myself or with my daughter's. I give it five stars.
B005L38QHA|1.0|After over a week of waiting for support, for a mouse that states it is compatible with Windows 8, I can tell you its not compatible with 8.1  After trying everything I can think of, the program for this mouse still says none are installed.  After writing support for over a week, I have received only 1 reply, which when followed to the letter resulted in no improvement and this is on a new computer built for windows 8.  It may be billed as a new mouse, but its not new, its an old mouse still being sold and still not working  I have gone back to Logitech, this mouse just sucks and their support is even worse.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This novel is pure John Grisham, at the top of his game. Better than most writers, Grisham can whipsaw his readers from one emotion to the next, from the comic, to the ludicrous, to the tragic -- all in a twinkling, and you never saw it coming!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a mystery written in an unusual way that holds the reader's interest until the very end of the story.<br />Some of the plot follows the expected if there is such a thing but really takes the vengeance of a woman scorned to a whole new level.  A very entertaining read.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have loads of fun playing this game. I could play this game all night with my girls<br />Or even by myself.

B008QE9XD2|5.0|I LIKE JOHNNY DEPP MOVIES THE MOVIE WAS FUNNY  & GOOD I WATCHED DARK SHADOWS ALL THE TIME WHEN IT WAS ON TV AS A SOAP OPERA
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I like it. It is a lot of fun to play, and my son and his girlfriend really enjoys playing it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham is a good writer. His books are interesting and informative.  Sometimes books can drag. This one doesn't. Has a great twist at the end.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again Khaled has pulled me into a story where the people are developed in a manner you.cant help but love some and despise the shortcomings of others.  A place where the true frailty of people are shown as is the strength of the heart and the power of belief.

B002HFP0QU|4.0|I love the BeeGees!  I love all of the songs on this CD but its missing a couple of them that I like. But all in all I love it!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This is Showtime at its finest.  This show is written sharper than a Tom Clancy novel with the same &#34;how did they know that?&#34; detail for facts, history, and locations.  Clarie Danes is just amazing in the role as Carrie, and you wonder if she is really a bipolar nut in real life because she is so accurate in her portrayal.  If you are in to intrigue on an international scale place in current events (attack on key US facilities) this will hook you.  Mandy Patinkin is very believable as a senior CIA department chief.  Damien Lewis plays a character as Markus Brody that evokes both sympathy for having been turned as a POW and hatred for his continued support of Abu Nazir.<br /><br />Oh, got a great price and prompt delivery.
B003XU02QG|4.0|This isnt a 3 star movie but not quite 4 either. Its pretty good but not outstanding. Acting was pretty good, story decent enough, characters fairly developed and memorable. Im not disappointed I watched it. If you have Prime its great for a free movie; perhaps worth a 3$ rental if you like the genre.
B000669GAI|5.0|Bought this item for myself because I've always been a huge fan.  It was in great condition and I have enjoyed listening to it!!!
B009RH973I|5.0|Awesome! This protects my Kindle, as well as looks good when taking it out!  The price was very good and it was shipped quickly; thank you for providing such outstanding service!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Great Katy Perry album.  Of course, Roar is a great song.  This album shows a much happier and empowered Katy after losing 160 lbs (Russell Brand) .
B0008ENICU|5.0|Great story line.  Most of these women were something else.  At the end of the movie I would love to have seen her in her husbands arms, so it left me wanting.  I would have to give this movie a 4 1/2.  I more than liked it so I gave it a 5 star because there is nothing inbetween to rate it like that.  All in all a very good movie.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Bought this for a Christmas gift for my father in law who is a huge fan of the series. Although it's not that time yet, I'm sure there will be no problem with it as I've ordered many dvd's before and were satsified!!

B00GINENG0|5.0|I really really like the size effect and the signs that tom holds sometimes and<br />The skins and the store. (this review is by my 8 yr old son : )
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|only chrome can be shown on the tv, it would have been perfected if everything on my device could be seen on the tv. that's why i returned it.

B000KNE0Y4|5.0|Very pretty watch. Given to a senior in high school as a birthday gift and she really liked the vintage look.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|I ordered a new one and I received a used full of scratches case.<br /><br />I talked to the amazon rep. they were dump enough they couldn't understand what I said.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone Survivor is a true story of selflessness, honor, dedication and perseverance.  Marcus has a thousand reasons to be proud of himself. But instead, his book focuses on his honor in hanging known and served and met great men.  This book honors them.  And I doing so I will be forever humbled by the valor of Marcus and his Military brothers.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was a good book, but definitely fell short of the first two.  I know the whole story is far-fetched, but her explanation of the experiments and such were even more far fetched.  Regardless of the fact I didn't love the conclusion, overall, the trilogy is great.
1569242739|5.0|Easy delicious. Everything I have made from this book has been very good. The chocolate cupcake recipe is now my standard, and I am not a vegan or vegetarian. It's just an excellent cupcake
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fun game to play. Keeps you occupied when your upset and don't want to start yelling. Good game.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Sometimes series suffer from middle book syndrome, but not this one. Ally Condie's thoughtful, poetic voice returns in this sequel as the characters are forced apart. Sometimes plots like this can drive me crazy, but Condie doesn't drag anything out beyond what the story needs. This second book is probably the most exciting of the series as far as action and new developments are concerned.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book!  Cried like a baby through its entirety, but loved it nonetheless.  This is the first John Green book I've read and will happily be on the search for others!

0449011909|5.0|Yes, this was a seriously long audiobook. Thirty-nine discs that took me over a month to finish. Obviously, I do not drive enough :) I could write a 20 page essay on this book and I've probably managed to forget some of the details that took place 15 discs ago so let me highlight my favorites: Arya- I wanted her and Jon to be reunited (that did not happen) but what I'm most devastated by is that Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid broke up (that's what I call Arya & The Hound) and after what must be one of the best bar fight scenes. Ygritte- her saying &#34;you know nothing Jon Snow&#34; grinded on my last nerve. Now Ygritte, you know nothing, good riddance. Hodor- you got a little crazy with the &#34;Hodor&#34; in this book. Please take it down a notch in bk 4. Davos-  a lot of this book focused on you. I know not why because being first a fan of the TV show, you're not that big of a character. Tyrion & Jamie- your sense of humor throughout it all (the good & the bad) I love. Keep it up. To all the characters who died in this book- sorry, not sorry. Everyone of you deserved to die and my favorite characters are still alive so, oh well. A few of you still need to die, here's to crossing my fingers for bk 4. George RR Martin and Roy Dotrice- you have my respect and forever thankful for keeping me entertained for more hours than I could count.
B004G600A4|4.0|It seems a little strange that it took Disney this long to adapt \\"Rapunzel\\" for the big screen, for it seems the natural sequel to the myraid of other fairytale movies that they've released over the years. Apparently Walt Disney himself was exploring the possibilities that the story afforded way back in the 1940s, but it's only now that the company has put their own spin on the tale and released it under the title of \\"Tangled\\" - apparently so as not to alienate a young male audience. I'm not sure why they bothered since every child I've come across, boy or girl, invariably calls this movie \\"Rapunzel\\".<br /><br />The original fairytale is rife with symbolism and unanswered questions. There, the infant girl is spirited away from her parents as part of a deal her father made after he was caught stealing rampion from a witch's garden to sate his wife's cravings. In that version, the grieving parents never see their daughter again, and the stolen child is called Rapunzel by the witch, whose names her after the edible plant that led the child's father into her garden in the first place.<br /><br />But the witch cares for Rapunzel until her twelfth birthday, at which time she moves her foster-daughter into a tower deep in the forest, seen and heard by no one besides herself. So isolated is the girl that the only way in and out of the tower is for the witch to use her impossibly long hair as a ladder - a security measure that is thwarted when a passing prince hears Rapunzel's singing voice and discovers the way up into her rooms...<br /><br />The Disney version plays out a little differently. Here Rapunzel is called as such by her birth parents, not poor cottagers but the king and queen of a prosperous kingdom. When the queen sickens prior to her daughter's birth, the citizens of the kingdom go in search of a flower that is said to have grown from a drop of sunlight, imbued with mystical healing properties. This they find and administer to the queen - but unbeknownst to them a sorceress by the name of Gothel was using the flower to keep herself youthful.<br /><br />She therefore slips into the palace under the cover of darkness and steals the baby away, the flower's magic having transferred to Rapunzel's beautiful golden hair. It is to keep Rapunzel secret, not safe, that Mother Gothel keeps her locked away in a tower, visiting periodically in order to glean magical youth from her \\"daughter's\\" hair.<br /><br />The original fairytale offers little in the way of why the witch might want to steal away a child, but you can see the potential for crafting a powerful and potent villain from the source material. The archetype of the Malevolent Mother is a compelling figure, all the more so because her power does not come from strength or sorcery, but from emotional manipulation and psychological control. It's actually quite harrowing to watch as Disney's spin on the character expertly handles Rapunzel with a series of put-downs, passive-aggressive comments, condescending pats on the head, and subtle insults that always end with the phrase \\"just teasing!\\"<br /><br />After the lengthy introduction, the story starts proper when Rapunzel is eighteen years old. Her hair is impossibly long and beautifully golden, imbibed with healing powers and apparently elastic in quality given her ability to swing, lasso, whip and climb it, apparently with no harmful effects to her scalp. But the teenager is tired of her monotonous lifestyle, and begins dropping hints to her mother that she's ready to leave the nest - but Mother Gothel will hear none of it.<br /><br />The chance for escape comes in the form of Flynn Rider, a thief that has just stolen a tiara from the palace and stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower as he makes his escape. She knocks him out with her frying pan, hides the tiara, ties him to a chair, and makes a deal with him: in exchange for taking her to see the lanterns that appear every night of her birthday, she'll return his stolen treasure. Though reluctant, Flynn agrees and the adventure begins...<br /><br />The colour scheme of the film is beautiful. It's like a series of oil paintings done in luminous pastel shades, and there's a subtle but lovely use of the colour palette and various symbols to connect Rapunzel's longing for the outside world with her instinctual awareness of her true parents. Things such as the Chinese lanterns, a stylized sun, the colour purple and the tiara all guide Rapunzel to her true home, and the film uses these repeating images, motifs and colours to paint a richly animated world of beauty and magic.<br /><br />The climatic scene does end with a rather shameless \\"deus ex machina\\" lifted straight from the fairytale (it works there, but just feels a bit random here) and Rapunzel's requisite \\"cute animal sidekick\\" feels a little superfluous, but \\"Tangled\\" is an interesting take on an old fairytale, giving it the Disney treatment by infusing it with backstory, songs, gags and romance. Perhaps it doesn't *quite* recapture the magic of the Disney Renaissance, but it's sweet and charming and beautiful to look at.h reluctant, Flynn agrees and the adventure begins...<br /><br />The colour scheme of the film is beautiful.

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|What a remarkable young girl! You can tell her parent “especially her father” have a great influence on her beliefs. It is also wonderful to see how much they love her and stand behind her. Even though they feared for her life. In this great country we take for granted how very lucky we are, to have the right to go to school no matter who or what we are. Reading this book has also helped me understand a lot more about her people and culture. I think she is meant to do great things in this world.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I bought this book while I was on jury duty. I'd been wanting to read it, but whenever I flipped through to reassess my interest, I wasn't that impressed. This extremely boring week drove me to buy it. I don't watch SNL or 30 Rock, but I do like Tina Fey. I did like Mean Girls and appreciate her women's empowerment POV in the book. Also, her hometown is right down the street from my hometown! So there's that. Having finished the book, I laughed out loud here and there, and I appreciated the nuggets of wisdom, but I definitely wouldn't call it a must-read or recommend it. I wouldn't tell anyone not to read it, but I wouldn't tell them they should.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book for the very first time and it was a lot better than I thought. It is definitely the best book I have ever read!!!
B009NNMB70|5.0|I honestly believe that even if you're not a One Direction fan that this documentary is worth the time. I believe it shows the boys in their real light. They are young men, who have had to deal with fame, and tour schedules and staying up all night (pun only partially intended) to work hard on their singles. And yet they still laugh, and joke, and have fun. They've not gotten pigheaded (yet), and they're still just five regular boys. I think one of the best things about this documentary is that you can see a lot of their guards going down, and you can see that they're just people, like anyone else.<br /><br />Honestly, I hope this documentary helped some of the more intense fangirls to realize that they're just boys who deserve their privacy and their lives to be their own, just like anyone else. They are abnosome, and they deserve to be respected, regardless of how you feel about their music. I think this documentary captures that well.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I do not know what to say , Tris is my role model! The last 20 something pages brought me to tears. So freaking sad. I love the last sentence. It's so true. I cannot say that I was absolutely fine with the ending , that wouldn't be very candor of me now, would it? Despite the ending , I still think it's a fantastic series worth reading. Hunger Games fans will enjoy it ( I know because I am one of them) . Really great , but sad. Do not expect a super happy ending, because you will not get it. But take a chance and read the book , be brave...
0307352153|4.0|This book seems based in a lot of research and history, which I enjoyed. There were times, though, when I felt like it was &#34;introverts vs. extroverts,&#34; and pointing out flaws in the other type. I didn't really like that. Actually, it made me put the book down towards the end. I am an introvert, but I don't need to see flaws in extroverts to know that introversion is okay.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|After some years, this game is just as good as the original. Some of the most fun I've had with any game.<br /><br />Worth the money for me. One of your US dollars is 6 of mine. And I'm not complaining at all.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We watch it again and again.  So sad the series didn't last.  The movie's great too.  Once you get the flavor of the characters it's just a lot of fun.

B00CATSONE|5.0|Very insightful. I like how the author poses more philosophical questions instead of just giving facts and opinion. By actually posing the question, it makes one ask it for themselves.  I highly recommend this book, if only for the \\"superfluous\\" it will give your mind if you let it.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I think my rating could go either way but I'll have to get back to you all next year because that about how long I estimate the time it will take to figue this elephant out!

B00004R99F|5.0|I got this for my son because it was one of my favorites he's a little too young so it's mostly for me right now!! It's a great disney movie more humor than the other classics. I think it will always be a fav. When I received it I bought with three other movies and they were packaged very safely I was very happy about that. It was also received earlier than I thought!

B00EIL7E9C|1.0|None of these &#34;reviewers&#34; should have anything to say about a product that HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED YET?!! Yes, I know that all of you are watching the show on HBO; but that means nothing to anyone trying to find out information about DVDs & Blu-rays. No one is searching for your half-assed opinions about the acting and dialogue. Sheesh! You're posting 4 & 5-star ratings, and what if, when the discs ARE released, the quality of the pressings is crap? Would you come back here to change your reviews to acknowledge that? What if HBO decided to bare-bones the package: would your current &#34;review&#34; address that?<br /><br />Your reviews are MEANINGLESS unless you're including something about the image & sound quality on the disc, whether there are extras that make it worth the money, how well Amazon.com handles the shipping, etc.  The title of the submission page reads, &#34;REVIEW YOUR PURCHASES&#34;, not &#34;give us your opinion of the TV-show&#34;. You all are posers and liars!!!!<br /><br />You people would probably even &#34;review&#34; the quality of a big-screen TV by ranting on about the guests on Leno's couch!

B0082Z447U|5.0|For being an avid reader of mysteries, I can't believe I didn't read this book until last week. Even though it was first published in 1860, it still holds up today.  A must-read for every mystery reader.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|Testosterone filled adventure that brings us back to the days when Reacher was still an army MP.<br />I enjoyed it enough to think it was one of the better Reacher books all of which I thought were good to great and very worth reading.<br />For those new to the series I highly recommend this one be read first since it is his earliest days and does explain some things that come later.<br />For you long time Reacher fans like myself I suggest you read this to find out where he came from and how he got there.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Love the book - learned a lot  It was difficult to put down!  After I finished reading it , I bought the audible version so I could listen to it as I worked around the house.  And I'm enjoying that just as much.

B00BWYX2MG|2.0|After reading the raving reviews of this product I thought it would be neat to make my favorite pair of leather winter gloves work with my phone and Kindle Fire HD.  Unfortunately this product didn't work as well with my gloves as others claim.  I followed the instructions exactly putting on one coat, drying it completely with a hair dryer, added a second coat and dried it.  My phone barely recognized it and it took several tries to unlock the phone and then it would only register a tap after several attempts.  Two days later I added a 3rd coat and exactly the same results and my Kindle Fire HD doesn't recognize it at all.  My pair of e-gloves which have the thread in it work well with both devices.  My nice pair of leather gloves instead of being soft supple leather now have a stiff finger where I applied the AnyGlove.  The gloves I have are more like the leather on a jacket while work gloves or motorcycle gloves such as the ones shown in their video are more porous, so I don't think the AnyGlove formula was able to penetrate them as well.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|There are not near enough words to describe this movie.  Henry Cavill is the Man Of Steel and has done what few have tried to do.  He fills Christopher Reeve's boots and Cavill is definitely the new Superman for the ages.  I look forward to seeing him with Ben Afflect in the new Batman Superman movie, and in the coming Justice Leage.  My hat is off to Henry and I say Very Well Done !!!

B00EDLP6O2|2.0|The controls can be so much better. Can't even move my fighter. Got to guess when to throw a punch. One weave button can't even throw a proper double jab. No Ireland flag wtf! Disappointed with all the hype behind this game. Land like 10 punches a round. Its a joke to compare this game to fight night rd 3. Step ur game up vivid! Quit bakin cakes and come up with better controls!
0761119752|4.0|This book, a collection of rhymes and pictures about pajamas and going to bed has quickly become a favorite at bedtime.  Both mommy and daddy enjoy singing it and our twin girls enjoy listening.<br /><br />The book itself is a sturdy board book that stands up to the occasional mishandling or chewing from our 9-month olds.
0596005903|4.0|Having never written device drivers before, I found this book very informative and straightforward. Anything that ended up being out of date can be found online. I really wish the authors would make an up-to-date version.<br />As an addendum:<br />1. A group of developers on github (martinezjavier/ldd3) have taken the time to update the example code for modern kernels.<br />2. The book is free([...] but the physical copy is nice to have<br />3. The book's site on O'Reily has a very thorough errata section covering mistakes found in the text and the original sample code
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It's a classic... and it's free!  This story never gets old.  I've read it several times and I still LOVE it!
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|I was WOWED! when I first heard the Born This Way album.  Upon first listening to the Artpop album I was not wowed nor drawn in.  Born This Way was so mature and greatly revealed the true talent of Lady Gaga.  I feel that Artpop was kind of thrown together.  The lyrics are predictable, the content of the lyrics is kind of goofy & and the choruses just don't grab me like the other albums.  I absolutely adore Lady Gaga, and admire her as a performer and an individual.  I just wish this album portrayed what she's really capable of.<br /><br />I feel terrible for giving a lack-luster review on such a fabulous artist.  I just don't get this one.
B0007LPLME|1.0|the movie is great, but this DVD is terrible because it was made for a different country code and will not play on a US DVD player--and that was not disclosed on the ad anywhere I could find.

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I am a long time player on Facebook, so I'm thrilled to have Castleville on my Kindle Fire!  Thank you so much.

B0063M22QO|4.0|It was easy to learn and a challenge to master. A great step up from solitaire and dominoes. For those times when I want to unwind and quiet my mind. When I'm playing my mind has a reprieve from bills and meals and soccer schedules and to-do-lists.
159413586X|1.0|First like to say the first two books are hands down great, like most people I could not stop reading it.  When I got to the third and final book to the series my expecations ran very high to have a good ending.  But I found the ending to have ruined what had created before it.<br /><br />I found two very important parts to the end to illocal even for the book itself.<br /><br />1) Peeta ending up with Kat - Yes, I feel how the author handled Gale and disposed of him was pretty bad and mis-use of the character.  But what gets me is to have a psycopathic brain washed killer only conditioned to kill Katniss, whom they admitt would never be completely healed be with her was way to far fetched.<br />2) Killing of Prim - Katniss had advanced so far ahead of the fighting just to have Prim randomly show up and be killed.  I felt this was more in a rush to kill the charcter to prove some point the author had, but the point really was lost on me.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Not my cup of tea.  Don't care for the bad language and nudity.  Should have paid more attention to the R rating.  In this case it was beyond correct.

B004RJMUJO|4.0|There is no question that when it has came down to video games for the tablets, they have been mainly about gameplay, and the return of trying to get to the high score, just like in the old days when everyone was addictive to Pac-Man and Pinball. There are a lot of games that really deliver based on fun and skill of the swipe of the hand. Angry Birds has definitely been the clear example, and Fruit Ninja follows in suite. It is a challenging game that is fun and easy to play. I like it because it is one of those tablet games that remains classic and simple to play. It is a great game to play. that is definitely worth its while, because it is one of those games worth the money with percision and simplicity. I definitely recommend this as a great add-on for your tablet and Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Graphics: B+<br /><br />Sound: B<br /><br />Control: B 1/2+<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
0151003084|5.0|This is a cute little tiny book and I love the artwork and writing.  I got this for a birthday present for my friend who has a sense of humor who would appreciate Edward Gorey.  She had never heard of these books but she loved it!
B00DONF9SS|5.0|Item is in excellent condition. But I am mostly stunned as to how quickly it arrived. I wasn't expecting it at all until tomorrow (Thursday, November 21) but it came incredibly rapidly. I am incredibly impressed with it. I will take good care of this. Sailor Mercury is an excellent addition to my collection!
0449011909|5.0|Love this author and love the series. Read, listen and watch.  You know you are hooked if you do all 3
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Awesome CD! I listen to this when walking or biking around the neighborhood. I am a big Train fan, and this CD definitely has been added to my favorites collection. My favorite song in this is the 2nd one (I can't remember what it is, but it came around in May 2012 and is the 2nd track in the CD). A great deal for only $10! Very happy.
0143113100|5.0|This book is an excellent introduction to a more current understanding of how the brain works, and how it responds to impediments and injuries. You will learn about pioneers in neuroplasticity, people like Paul Bach-y-Rita. Bach-y-Rita's treatments restored senses to people who would be written off under the old paradigm of neuroscience. A wide range of case studies illustrates the significance of neuroplasticity and sensory substitution, showing how a few insights about the brain open up worlds of options for researchers, medical doctors, and even transhumanists.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|A good movie with exciting surges of awe.  At times, you do not know who is hunting whom??? Get it you will love it.

B00E7SFAAG|3.0|I found this game to be fairly fun and unique to the other offerings I have on my phone.  I don't feel compelled to play it and have only made it through a few levels.  The kids think it's pretty hard, but I think they just need to get used to it in order to like it (not that I'm going to push them on it or anything).  I got it as the FAOTD and I would recommend it at that price.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Wasn't a Green Lantern Fan as a kid and though this move was a bit silly at times as Super Hero movies go this one is pretty good.
076115728X|5.0|Fabulous book - great illustrations. Wonderful message. We have this book - and I have given it as a gift many times! Speaking of which, I need to order a couple more copies...
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Fun game.  I play this all the time,whenever I can get friends or family together.  I even play online with friends who live far away. Only criticism is that for the price of the overall game (base set plus expansion), they should use sturdier or longer lasting materials than the cardboard they use. The board can get a little warped when it is hot and humid day.  Otherwise the gameplay is a lot of fun.
B008EL25LE|3.0|I found myself playing this game for much longer periods of time than I had ever intended because it's one of those games that you &#34;just want to play 1 more level&#34; and you keep doing that over and over.  As you progress to each new stage, there is some new &#34;power up&#34; that you can use to change the experience slightly.  The good news is (at least for me) once I finished the game, I didn't feel compelled to continue playing.<br />I did find 1 bug--after playing for some time, I created a new profile for my wife to try it.  Then, when switching back to my profile, the game got into this weird state where the story started all over, but I still had all my power ups from before.  Not a huge deal, but a little irritating.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|Lady Antebellum is one of my favorite current Music Vocal Groups. This is the third CD I have of them and they are all great this Group just can not make a bad song.
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|Just awful! Predictable, failed to entertain me.<br /><br />I like Will Smith, I think he is a very talented man. He did not sell this character though.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|Tangled was a really different read for me and I'm glad I read it but I couldn't read books like this one often. Clever and brilliant at times and I fully recommend the novel.
030759565X|5.0|Great cookbook.Easy to follow recipes well illustrated. great gift for people starting out together. Will use as a gift again.
1937053571|5.0|When I say I love this series, I truly mean it. From the very first page of Daimon to the very last page of Sentinel, I have been firmly enthralled, riveted, and glued to this story and cast of characters. The Covenant series is truly a legend among books in my opinion. Not only is the story genuine and engaging, the characters are easily some of my favorite YA characters of all time. Jen sparked my intrigue with Half-Blood, had me torn in Pure, captured my heart in Deity, (got me all emotional in Elixir), blew me away with Apollyon, and she gave one hell of an amazing conclusion with Sentinel. Sentinel stands out among its predecessors by really drawing out your emotions and sensibility. You've watched these characters go through so much and when you finally live the epic conclusion, you're definitely left with a feeling of completion and satisfaction. At least, I did.<br /><br />Alex has grown so much as a female character throughout this series, it just amazes me. She'll always have that inner snark and humor that I love and adore, but she's also become more responsible, sensible, and mature; especially considering all that she's been through and what she faces in Sentinel. She's still my favorite YA heroine, that's for sure. I loved how real Jen kept Alex, especially after what happened with Ares in Apollyon. I got to see various sides of Alex I never thought I would and I loved it. The ending really got me all kinds of choked up and just seeing Alex handle it all just really made me want to hug her.<br /><br />Aiden. Oh, Aiden. I can never say his name without a loving sigh afterwards. That man is just pure perfection. You all know how much I love him, and he doesn't disappoint in this book. The love, care, consideration, and respect he has for Alex simply radiates off the pages and I can't say enough how I wish this guy were real. Finally embracing their relationship after what happens in Deity and Apollyon, I loved how open and affectionate he was to Alex and how much he valued their love. You get to see a different side of Aiden here and I actually really liked it. I think it made him seem more real and really, if you ever doubted just how much he loves Alex, by the end, you'll understand. This guy?! Ugh, I swear, I'm forever and always, a St. Delphi girl!<br /><br />While I will say I live and breathe the romance between Alex and Aiden, I also loved Jen's take on the mythology and how that aspect was a strong theme throughout all her books, but especially becoming more and more prominent as the books progressed. You definitely get your fair share of Gods and other mythical creatures in Sentinel and I like how Jen breathed new life into these age-old beings. I loved Apollo. Every time I read one of these books, I want to dive into Greek mythology, re-reading the ones I know and love, and reading those that I have yet to discover.<br /><br />Let me also say that Seth truly won me over. I was hoping that Seth would redeem himself after all he did in the previous books and I can safely say he did that and so much more. He really surprised me quite a bit in Sentinel. In the other books, we got a playful, sexy, arrogant, and sometimes challenging Seth, but I always knew, deep down, he was a good guy. How good, is still yet to be seen, but he I liked the direction Jen took his character and his relationship with Alex takes on a whole new level after all is said and done. Honestly though, by the end of the book, I just wanted to hug the guy. I love that we've only barely scratched the surface of Seth, yet I care for him so much as a character. I can't wait to know more about him.<br /><br />I truly never wanted this series to end, (any chance to read more Alex & Aiden scenes is fine by me) but I am very happy with the way Jen ended it. Just thinking about this book and this series is getting me all emotional and making me want to re-read the series even though I literally just did that not too long ago. I tried really hard tosavor every word and page, yet also wanting to fly through it so I could see what would happen next. Sentinel is everything you've come to expect from Jen and the Covenant series, and so much more. You get love, action, drama, friendship, all the crazy supernatural stuff, a touch of bittersweetness and tons of humor and entertainment. I can't recommend this book, and this series, enough.savor every word and page, yet also wanting to fly through it so I could see what would happen next.

B00DJWV11I|5.0|Too funny!  Loved it - great love story with plenty of interesting comments from the guys point of view.  Truly enjoyable read.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|An entertaining, funny movie That will not appeal to every age but most probably to the mature, English loving comedy audiences.<br />I recommend it for the day when you really need a lighthearted uplift!
140006922X|1.0|I would not go to a dentist for heart surgery, nor would I turn to a Muslim for Christian Theology. The book is grudgingly bent with a vain attempt at disproving Yeshua. It fails, it is poor research, and is nothing that has not been addressed in apologetics up to date. Poorly written, poorly cited, poorly researched I would give it zero stars if it were an option.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love Love Love these little yellow creatures. so full of character and charm. The hidden charms of the Big Guy is pretty impressive, also. The children are cute as expected.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have now read this book twice. Once on my honeymoon in Mexico and again when I heard the movie was being released. Amazing story of brotherhood and selflessness.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it is ok i guess. i do not like that you have lives an once you use all of them it is over until you get them back on a time scale.  a lot of hard levels.
0061928356|5.0|Our Book Club read both THE SHOEMAKER'S WIFE and SECRET DAUGHTER.  They were wonderful stories and provided our<br />group with a wonderful, lively discussion.<br /><br />As a retired first grade teacher and a resident of a town very close to Newtown, CT, SNOWFLAKES FALLING was a beautiful story and very touching!!
B002LFPAUC|3.0|Not as funny as I remember when seeing it years ago. Too much like real lifes frustrations to be that funny. The younger set should find it hilarious.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had heard a bit about the HBO series, but didn't  think much about it. I'm not one for sword and sorcery titles, but the writing and plot twists in this book are wonderful.<br />I'm glad I took a chance on this, but now I have to buy the next book in the series, not to mention see the TV show.<br /><br />Update: I am now a third the way through book 5 and I'm no closer to the resolution of this story. I feel like I'm being jerked along to buy more books. Seriously, I knew that there were 5 books in this series, but I assumed that would be the end of it. Besides books 4 & 5 are not up to standards of books 1 & 3.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Really good movie, We seem it like 6 time and never get tired of it. My family enjoy Will Smith movies
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Lots of action and suspense. I would watch again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for eye, hand, mind exercise. I like that it is just a tap to move the cards instead of dragging to position. No problem with delivery, the game, or playing.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|First, I think the Sony MDR7506 are really good sounding headphones. Make sure to purchase a hardcase if you plan to do any run and gun video work, or a mobile DJ. They are accurate, comfortable and fold up nice.<br /><br />But that is not why I purchased two pair. I've found that buying the standard equipment used by most professionals is the easiest and best way to have your audio sound accurate when it will be listened to in various forms, on various formats, and various crew. That's what these headphones are.<br /><br />Grab a DVD, go to the special features and view the behind the scenes docs. I dont care if it's a low budget film, or the most expensive blockbuster of the summer, ... 8 out of 10 times the headphones you will see the director and sound people wear are these particular headphones.<br /><br />So you might as well hear it how everyoone else will hear it, and make adjustments that fall in line with the majority of others out there.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|The music is OK, but the video is dreadful - standard definition in low light, unimaginative cinematography, 4:3 aspect ratio. I have not been able to watch the whole cycle in this set.<br /><br />I thought this version was (and remains) hateful to watch.<br /><br />I have since bought a downloaded version without any video but with superb sonics (exceptional recording and editing), so I can listen to The Ring without the detraction of the awful video.<br /><br />Your mileage, of course, will vary
0767919408|5.0|Great sampler of 1927 history.  Makes one want to learn more about subjects mentioned in book..  I liked it so much a sent a another copy to my brother!!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Love this book!  Love Donna Tartt! I need to write fourteen more words, but I believe I said it all.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this appnis so cool I have my own famlialy and u should get this<br />so that is shay u should get this app I am Lvov 900
B00FEHXISA|2.0|I liked the movie for the fact that it was iron man but I found myself really disappointed at the ending.  I just expected something else.  I have to say that Gwenneth Paltrow looked really hot near the end.  I do hope that they make more of these I just didn't like this one.  I would say more but I don't want to spoil it for someone who has not seen it yet
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Inspiring read. Interesting stories. Too much ego on the part of the author. This book gave me the push I needed to start my own business, and also I found the read a bit annoying.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|A nice way to know how to spell things. My girl friend  loves this Dictionary it helps so very much!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I LOVE historical drama series, and this is the BEST I have ever seen! I only wish there was more!!! I plan to purchase one for a Christmas gift for a family member in addition to my own. Mine arrived a couple of weeks ago and I have watched it several times and have to hold myself off to watch it again!! If you like historical drama you will NOT be disappointed. McKidd and Stevenson have a wonderful rapport as Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pollo. The writing is superb and additional cast as well.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I found myself really getting into this series.  Maybe because I am getting old.  I have already downloaded the next one onto my kindle and am reading it now
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|It was slow and boring.  It went on and on about the same thing.  I was very disappointed.  What a let down
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Nice graphics,easy to play. Would like that I don't have to like to FB. But it's very fun. I enjoy that it is more stand alone and you do not have to rely on others for most everything you need.
B005PZ857K|5.0|I love this show and it streams to my ipad or TV perfectly.  No problems at all with Amazon streaming.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|This was a good movie.  I found myself watching it all the way through.  The acting and special effects were good.  I don't think that you will be dissapointed
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|The graphics are nice, gameplay is easy to follow.  Simple and enjoyable game to play when you just need something to occupy your mind
B0089LOG02|5.0|Story about the train in the early twentieth century.  Covers one girl's life from why she was sent and the hardships she encountered until she finally found the right couple.  A nice easy read with joy and a boatload of sorrow.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I love this movie and it streamed to my DVD player perfectly.  It is a great movie and the audio was wonderful.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|I did like this movie.  If you like zombies at all you will definitely like this one.  Plenty of action and the story isn't bad either.  I don't think you will be dissapointed
B005LAII80|5.0|---&#34;YOUR CALL ROOKIE&#34;---<br />Watched it 5 times now and see something different every time. The energy level is on par with classics like &#34;Road Warrior&#34; /DieHard&#34;. More Insane as it rolls along. Lean and Mean, Unlike the bloated, Never ending recent &#34;Batman&#34; slog. DREDD is the real deal
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This collection offers every single episode plus bonus discs. Quite the value for the price. I do wish there was a DVD version or better yet, iTunes.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Boring movie and I did not like it at all.  I love Matthew McConaughey but this was a waste of his time and mine.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This is a great series. It is on netflix now I would recommend watching it for free on netflix save some money!
B003H4I4JU|3.0|It's readable and it's interesting, just not what I expected and I have to wonder if it really brought anything to Ender's story and I could have been just as happy not reading it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My favorite book of all time. If you've seen the movie - which was okay - the book is phenomenal. Especially the sequences in the Battle Room, which are some of the best action scenes ever written (and which the movie blazed right past). The battles just build and build in emotional intensity. The movie was basically constructed out of highlights and key plot points, but to me, the filmmakers left out the heart and the soul of the book. I didn't care for Part 2 (Speaker For The Dead) and haven't read the other books, but ENDER'S GAME is an absolute masterpiece.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Hated this movie even though two of my favorite actors are in it.  Just was not my type of movie at all
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|This is a great movie for the history books! I enjoyed the book and the movie is good. I would recommend this book over the movie.
0425266060|5.0|Completely mesmerizing and sizzling HOT!! If you liked 50 Shades of Gray you will LOVE the Crossfire Series even more!!
B00COGY2P2|3.0|It's not so much that I didn't like this movie, as it is I was left feeling indifferent upon its conclusion.  The action was well choreographed and the story itself was well laid out, but did I find myself thinking about it after watching?  No.  Did I want to discuss it with a friend?  No.  Would I want to watch it again?  Probably not.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Love this book and I downloaded it to my Ipad and have read it over and over.  The download was quick and easy.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is HBO's best series! I would recommend this to anyone! Follows the real story of EZ company.  Winters is a dynamic character. I enjoy the stories of the veterans at the beginning of each episode
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|It's not one of those albums you can press play and make it all the way through. I like &#34;venus&#34; &#34;sexx dreams&#34; &#34;swine&#34;<br />I LOVE &#34;Do WHat You Want&#34; w/ R. Kelly. Thats my jam.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Did not order this product, please check your records.  Please deduct this from my charges if it shows up. This is the reason I am afraid of one click shopping.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|Good movie but a bit gory.  I love Anthony Hopkins and he does a superb job in this film.  He scares the daylights out of me.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Sometimes life is like a box of chocolate...you never know what you are going to get! But you do with this movie. It is a classic I would stand by this rating!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really enjoy This game it is something I can get lost in and it is enjoyable... I have yet to have any issues with this game
B006P96PAO|4.0|My entire family enjoyed this movie.The only complaint I would have is that some of the dialogue seemed a bit contrived. Overall it was a great film with some laughter and some drama. In my opinion, this film is a gem compared to other faith-based films. The acting and the scenery, etc. were better than most. It's a good story of how men's decisions to lead can and often do make a difference in the family and community structure.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|I love Denzel, but this movie until the end disappointed me.  I did not like all the language in it.  He is a wonderful actor and the ending surprised me a lot so that is why it I gave it three stars.  If there had not been as much language and the nude scenes which I did not think were necessary it would have been just as good.
B001EO748M|5.0|This is a great series. It is on netflix now I would recommend watching it for free on netflix save some money!
B00G32OER4|4.0|These days I don't bother with 99% of horror films unless more than one person tells me it's good.  This is the 1% that is worthwhile.  The opening credits insist all this is based on documented testimony.  The fact that it takes place in 1971 helps you forget obvious comparisons with the &#34;Poltergeist&#34; and &#34;Exorcist&#34; films.  None of the characters could have watched them yet in real life.  Though few will scream out loud, there are dozens of scenes that make the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  Best of all, the creepiest moments happen all the way through it instead of just the last 15 minutes.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|It take  to long to send it ship and get it back it should be less time to make things and no-one wants to have to leave the game to kill time it makes it boring
B006IGZX0C|5.0|I streamed this to my DVD player and it worked flawlessly.  The movie was great and there were no hitches in the streaming.
1439153663|1.0|Worst book I have &#34;listened&#34; to in years.  I checked out the audio book and would not have finished it had I not needed it for a long road trip.  The plot was predictable.  The female characters were stupid and weak except for &#34;Mama&#34;.  Misunderstandings were never made clear due to just in time interruptions.  I was left feeling dirty and frustrated.
1250012570|5.0|It's been a while since I could say - I LOVE THIS BOOK.  Seriously.  High rated books I have read recently left me saying, &#34;It was good, but ... &#34;  This book was different - I love the music references, 80s nostalgia, and the memory of that first heart fluttering/consuming/breaking love.  I could NOT put it down, and I was sad when it ended.  I want to know what happens with Eleanor & Park in their 20s... 30s... and beyond, but I will be happy with what was written now.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|It is one of mu favorite apps<br /><br />I can listen to thousands of radio stations from all over the world<br /><br />It also lets me record music that I can play when not connected
B004IADCO4|2.0|Interesting movie, streamed well but a bit graphic for me.  Most people would like it  and so my opinion is not really important but the streaming was flawless.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|I don't like stories about self destructive people in Leaving Las Vegas style.  I liked it up until the plane crash then, meh.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Didn't care for it. The free app wasn't anything more than a short matching game, and then, you were supposed to buy something. I removed it from my device.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It took me a while to get into this book, but now I think I need to read it for a second time. A very unusual account of WWII.
B005ZI306S|5.0|Superstitiously fun. You don't need to cross your fingers and hope to enjoy this book, just read it. More great fun from the master of rhyming children's books Peter Collier.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm having trouble getting sound from the TV to the stereo but that's not Chromecast's fault.  I love casing a tab from Chrome, going full screen and alt-tabing back to my browser to continue surfing the web with no hard to read in the dark remote to deal with.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|This is fun, but you have to be awake to play. It's a little small on the Kindle Fire HD, or my fingers are just a little too big for it!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun, frustrating and very addictive game. The levels are confusing sometimes but it's great when you figure it out and finish the level. You may not get the highest score but you can always go back and try again later to f so better.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|One of the better Marvel comic hero movies. Enjoyed the movie very much. Would like to have seen it in 3D.
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|Very formulaic with almost no imagination or character development.  Entertaining I suppose but not worth the money.  Would be a great free Prime movie.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I think that this game is pretty good,and while I don't play it every single day,it's something fun to do when I get bored.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Tom Cruise, what can I say, I am not reviewing the movie but he is a hell of an action hero.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This book left me wishing I never read the first two! The hole ending felt like she was in a rush just to b finished!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|full of action and drama. this is one of the best television shows out there. crossbow samuri governor woodbury end of the world
B003O86FMW|5.0|Better than the first! Brings so many questions answered and brings many more to be answered in the third.  Buying the third now.  Kept me guessing the whole time I read!
0425263916|5.0|Love this series better than Fifty Shades.  Can't wait for the fourth and fifth books in the series to come out.
B00D8H3Q2G|5.0|Great soundtrack and very good recording! A journey into the soul of the film. Everytime I listen to is a thrilling experience.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved \\" Wool.\\" It is an amazingly plausible story that brings home the problem that existed through the ages.....man's ability to survive and adapt inspite of himself. Courage and truth will prevail.  I hope this will be made into a film as the story is inspiring and show us the journey before us if we cannot change the course we are on.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Slow moving. While the graphics and concept are good, like most Zynga games, the only way you progress at a fast pace is if you spend money on in app purchases. Nice to kill a little time if I'm on the plane or sitting in a waiting room... but that's about the extent of it for me.
0802136834|5.0|This was just a great book. Weir's writing is very engaging. It does a great job of communicating the information, but in a way that really brings to life what was going on in the Tudor court at the time of Henry's reign. She is sympathetic to her historical characters, but not in a way that blinds her or her reader to any of their faults or mistakes.<br /><br />She finds the possible reasoning behind these larger than life actions that ended up shaping world history. She brings to life the women of Henry's life in a way that makes her reader sympathise with what they were dealing with in a world where his word was law and could mean their lives.<br /><br />It was very engaging, and really connected some historical dots for me. I would have loved even more photos and possibly some footnotes, however, overall its a great book to really get a taste of that time period.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was easy to anticipate what would come next.  The back and forth at times surprised me more than I cared for.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a wonderful book. Brilliantly written! Incredible story of a young girls life in Germany during WWII. Haunting and poignant...
0399161287|5.0|This book is just unbelievably great. I couldn't stop reading it after I started.<br />It faces the reader with all kinds of emotions and does not gets you bored a single time.<br /><br />Best book I probably ever read!
B002ZG99G8|4.0|This is the story of a group of CIA special forces who have to pretend they are dead after being betrayed. It follows them from the betrayal through an adventure to try and clear their names. It leaves things well wrapped up but open enough for a sequel (which I would love to see, because this really was fun to watch).<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching this movie. Its just a really fun popcorn flick. Lots of action and humor, just enough depth to the characters to really keep you interested. It is also a really fun cast.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan does a really good job of being the anchor of the team, both as the character's role and as an actor. Idris Elba is fantastic as Roque, the darker side of Morgan's Clay. Watching the two of them interplay is just fantastic.  Chris Evans is fantastic as Jensen (who is probably the best uncle ever--watch it and you will see what I mean). He just nails the character's wise cracking attitude (I have a certain fondness both for him and for wisecracking characters)<br /><br />The plot rolls along at a pretty nice clip. There is plenty of action, but not to the point where it is only action, there is some really fun dialogue and some really great scenes that actually don't involve explosions. Chris Evans has a wonderful scene in an elevator that involves some quipping and an outfit change.<br /><br />I enjoyed Zoe Saldana in this role as well, I prefer her with a bit more spunk, and she has it in spades here. I'm not entirely sure she and Jeffrey Dean Morgan were well matched though.
B00BUVPIRS|2.0|ONE SENTENCE: DON'T BUY IT.<br /><br />This game marvels in many wonderful aspects: great gameplay, gorgeous details to scenery, a music masterpiece that you'll truly enjoy playing to, a unique array of skills, ability to ride 2 types of steeds, etc.<br /><br />However<br />The game takes 20 hours to finish. It's as if the developers stopped working on the game 1/4 the way through.<br /><br />If this is how they expect the evolution in gaming<br />It's BS , don't support their cheap knockoffs. I've played much more interactive games that were free. I dont expect this quick, cheap rendition of a RPG when I spend money on it; no matter the price.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The product works as promised but I wish it support more apps or allow you to stream everything on your PC as extended monitor, but works perfect with YouTube and Netflix.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I played the original on Facebook and i loved it, this one is just as good.. i like the fact that you don't have to keep asking other players for items.
B00CDTSFF8|4.0|I love the blend of history and myth that this show has. It does a great job of making the vikings more than just a set of goofy horned helmets.<br /><br />The writing is really strong, the direction and set locations are a-maz-ing. The action is just spot on too.  The last time I watched Travis Fimmel was in his Tarzan series, he was good in that, but he seems to have really progressed since then. Ragnar has a certain unpredictable wiliness that  Fimmel just does a great job of portraying. Gabriel Byrne is always good, and does a great job being the Earl who must make certain decisions to protect his position.<br /><br />We see Ragnar at first as a bit of a dreamer, but slowly that dream takes a greater hold on him. It is how this dream he has that he infects others with that the story is based around. It is the fallout for how he acts to achieve this dream that creates the tension in this first season of the show.<br /><br />It really reminded me of watching 'Rome' years ago. It does a great job of creating the feeling a a time long ago, when people were still getting to know each other and this world.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|Just give this guy an Oscar already!!!!<br />He deserves at least two.<br /><br />Eastwood should get one also.<br /><br />Hollywood did you hear me?
B0083Z614S|5.0|I would recommend this book to fantasy lovers and all other fiction lovers. I can't believe what happened in the end.
1451666179|5.0|From the fantastic mind of Allie Brosh comes her internet-famous blog in dead tree format, and it's just as funny if not funnier this way because there's no load time or waiting on pins and needles for the next update [well, other than waiting for a sequel]! Some of her best stories, including Allie's sad yet uplifting accounts of dealing with crippling depression, are recreated faithfully in all their glorious MS Paint goodness, with a few bonus stories that don't appear on the blog. If you haven't read Hyperbole and a Half [hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com], you're missing out, but thankfully that's easy to remedy--and you'll be glad you did! About my only complaint is that Allie redrew a few of the pictures from how they originally appeared on the site, including \\"Clean ALL the things?\\" (one I particularly liked as-was), but as an artist myself, I can't exactly blame her for wanting to spruce things up a bit.
0805086846|5.0|Wow. This is an amazing book. It is at times very hard to read, both because of its subject matter and how much information is crammed into one page.<br /><br />This covers the dealings between the Native Americans who originally inhabited the Western United States and the United States government, its military and officers. It is ultimately the story of betrayed trust and battered people. It is very depressing and eye opening to read. The near annihilation of the native peoples of the United States is what is documented here.<br /><br />There are of course, moments and flashes of good. Some of the white Americans were able to step up to the plate and defend the natives, some wanted to but were out maneuvered or powerless. However, not nearly as powerless or betrayed as the various Native tribes. They were forced into hunting each other. Various tribesmen were pitted against one another.<br /><br />It is the same story, in many ways, told again and again of slivers of hope being doled out to the natives in order to maneuver them away from whatever piece of land the white Americans were coveting at the time. And that hope never quite playing out the way it was promised. The natives essentially becoming captive chattel.<br /><br />It is a really powerful and important narrative that Dee Brown has crafted. It is something that anyone living in the United States should be aware of. Our past is bloodier than the Civil War or American Revolution. This story is the equally dark twin sister to the slavery that so dominates the history of the American South.

B000AP04OM|5.0|A gift for my husband.  His favorite movie from his past.  Nice to watch the DVD that gives more insight into the characters & the making of the show.
1476747016|5.0|Pusheen [of pusheen.com] is the story of a round little kitty illustrated in adorable animated gifs, which--sadly--do not animate in dead tree format. However, she is still adorable enough that even the still versions are too cute. The book feels a bit short, but given that a &#34;story&#34; runs about three to five pages of pictures, that's understandable. This book would make an excellent gift for any cat lover who by some mysterious circumstance does not already have it.
B008PNBU30|5.0|Just an all around great CD from beginning to end. They really did a great job with this one. .
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Just a great story, great action, and a lot of laughs.<br /><br />You'll find yourself staying up too late and waking up too early to find out what kind of trouble Locke gets into next.

1451695187|5.0|Good book. I couldn't put the book down. Like true stories. Not just about the afterlife but about the neurosurgeon's life.  Prompt service.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I used the free one for a long time so I decided to buy it. But it will not work. Says the app has unexpectedly stopped when I pick a station. Also the free one doesn't work as it has the same error. The error is: &#34;The appilcation TuneIn Radio Pro (process tunein.player.pro) has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again.&#34;<br /><br />Still no word as to why this isn't working. Ten dollars lost for a app that doesn't work on Kindle Fire.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Wonderful book.  The characters were alive on the pages!! Such an interesting portrayal of love, learning and mores of days gone by.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is so fun to play love that I can play on my kindle fire I give it 5 stars
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a very addictive game. I only downloaded this game for the coin, but I started to play and got hooked.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like being able to use different sounds (music or other) to use to wake up to.  Math problems will help you wake up, especially f you have to wake up enough to input the right answer and you keep messing up (typos).  I use it to program different wake up times for my various work start times and my days off.
1439156816|5.0|Book in great condition, priced right and delivery as promised.  Even if you don't like King's horror stories this is about writing---one of his few non-fiction works.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Love this movie, the movie is very good, and the Blu-ray is excellent.  It has the iTunes &#34;Digital Copy&#34; not to be confused with digital copy/uv/Flixster.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Very moving story with true understanding of inner<br />struggles of an adopted young woman.  Good character<br />development.  I have already recommended it and will<br />give copies to my adopted nieces.
B004I9CR5K|5.0|I bought this album and Overgrown after  listening to a few of his songs, Limit to you Love, Retrograde, I love minimalist music such as Low, but this is one of my new favorite albums because of the absence of sound in the pauses between notes, That is really what makes Blake's music fantastic, while other musicians would add drums, etc in the moments of silence, Blake respects absence of sound.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love this guy. Just started it and love it so far! I love that there are multiple rooms and floors. I am still at the beginning of the game but looking forward to it.
1476733953|5.0|This was a fabulous book.  Interesting story and characters, plus being written in a way that makes the story seem very feasible.  I would read another of Howey's books.  Definitely recommend.
B006SV2LWA|3.0|The beginning and middle of this movie was good, but where is the ending? After finishing the movie, I felt cheated and as if the director or writer waisted a good story by not finishing it.
B001BANK32|5.0|a wonderful tale. i enjoyed the drunk father being torn apart as his duty between his son nd alcohol collided.  the battle of the overlook for their soul
B00136S0NE|5.0|I simply never get tired of this album.  I could listen to it all day, every day.  It still moves me the way it did when I saw the movie.
0307120007|1.0|This is such a sweet, simple book. But the plastic comb binding is a nightmare!! Going against other reviewers' advice, I purchased it anyway and it's been falling apart since day three. The pages are like a thick cardstock (NOT thick like a board book), and the spine is almost completely falling apart already. Worst idea ever. Don't waste your money.
B000H5TH1Q|4.0|Body Double is a DVD of the 1984 sensual crime thriller directed by Brian DePalma(Casualties Of War). Starring Melanie Griffith(Working Girl, Milk Money), this film tells the story of an out of work actor was chosen to look after a friend's house in the upscale Los Angeles neighbourhood. Soon, he is starts to leer into another woman's home and her sexual trysts with several men, until one of them kills her. So the actor must find the killer that will lead him into the sultry underbelly of L.A.'s sex-driven world, and to a very pretty hooker/porn star named Holly Body(Griffith). Look for an appearance by 1980's British Pop band Frankie Goes To Hollywood. the special features includes interviews with Griffith, DePalma and other cast members and crew, as well as trailers of other Sony Pictures DVD movies. Body Double is the perfect film for those who love erotic film noir.

B00BEIYMAG|5.0|In this day and age where gore and cgi have replaced tension and effective storytelling im happy to say i consider the conjuring a tremendous success. While many movies have forgotten that sometimes what is so terryfying is what the mind creates and not how much gore can be thrown on the screen the conjuring remembered. There are some cheap scares but not enough to ruin things. And although the narrative is based on a true story i still think it would be effective regardless. The acting was very well done as well. If your looking for a movie full of blood and gore then you will probally be dissapointed with the conjuring but if you enjoy a well told story that evokes that feeling of terror of what lies in the shadows then you will probally enjoy the conjuring.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't want to believe the hype. I thought the world had gone nuts over another brainless book. But then I decided to read The Hunger Games from the Kindle lender's library. Oh my goodness. What an amazing story! The tragedy, the drama, the betrayal, the love, the WHOLE thing. I am immediately going to read the next book in the series. I'm hooked.

Harry has a whole laundry list of problems and so do his associates, but wow what an investigator. This is the first in the series and is set in Australia so its a great book to start with. (Not as many of those pesky names.) Twists and turns galore but Harry won't leave Australia until he gets the perp.

B006IYG5HE|4.0|This was my first Harry Hole book and I had a terrible time keeping the Norwegian names straight. It definitely wasn't the book I should have started with, but the story was so good I couldn't put it down. It may have been my first Jo Nesbo book, but it certainly won't be my last.

B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Beautiful. This is my first Monster High doll, so I had no idea what to expect. I didn't buy her to use as a toy, or to play with; I wanted her as a visual figurine, because that's how attractive this doll is in person. I bought her with the intention of displaying her, so with that in mind...<br /><br />Pros: Gorgeous design, a high amount of detail, and with the flowing dress and tall boots she has a striking silhouette. Definitely one of the most eye-catching MH dolls I've seen. Seems you either like her style or you don't - and I love it. She has her own personality, and the booklet she comes with (a faux journal of diary entries) is surprisingly endearing, even for a cynical grown-up like me. She comes with a stand to display her; it has a transparent bar that seems to vanish, which is perfect for such a colorful doll. She doesn't look picture-perfect when she comes out of the box, but save for a few tangled strands of hair (her long hair gets a little messy at the bottom), I was surprised with how display-ready she was.<br /><br />Cons: For such a visually striking figure, I'm not thrilled with my options for displaying her. She can make dramatic and fun poses, but there's no way (straight from the box, that is) to display her in any position except for standing straight up. Her stand isn't very strong and it can't support much weight, so if she's tilted or leaning she'll fall over. Her feet can't touch the bottom of it, which would've helped a lot with stability. I've managed to pose her with one leg slightly bent for a little bit of style, but I can't do much else without feeling like she'll tip over, which is disappointing for a 'rock star'.<br /><br />Also, the packaging. Can we talk about the packaging? I can't imagine a small kid being able to pull her out of the box without ripping her hair and tearing her dress, or who knows what else. I understand that it's important to keep her looking presentable in the box, but the way they go about this feels unnecessary. It took me roughly 20 minutes to remove her from her box, with small-tip scissors to carefully extract her from the several ties binding her to it - including tape that caught a few strands of her hair. There are better ways to do this, Mattel. I collect figures, and I've never seen such a puzzling series of small ties and strings everywhere.<br /><br />Besides my gripes, I was very impressed with Catty. So impressed I just bought another Monster High doll.

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|While I don't agree with the many 5 star reviews this book has garnered, it IS pretty good, and was a fun read overall.  I am a fan of novels that have numerous points of view and that, along with some good pacing, kept the story interesting for me.  I guessed the secret pretty early on but that didn't spoil things,  even though I didn't particularly care for any of the characters.  I think it is a tribute to pretty good writing that despite this, I wanted to know what happened and how the characters would deal with the problems they faced.  There was a bit too much dependence on coincidence but the story was believable.  I didn't feel the emotional impact others seem to have and after I'd read the last page I felt a bit disappointed.  I guess that is the danger of hype:  it is hard to live up to it.  I doubt I will look for other books by this author but I'm not sorry I read The Husband's Secret.

A real person says the phrases so you can get an idea of the correct pronunciation and you can repeat it over and over or at a slow pace if you're having difficulty articulating the phrase. It also gives you the opportunity to spell the words and phrases which is great because it gives a sense of wholeness to the learning experience.

B002IVLH60|5.0|As a HUGE fan of Pearl Jam, it's tough to rank and rate their albums because even the ones that are my least favorite still have a number of songs I enjoy.  However, I can easily say that Yield is my favorite and Backspacer is my favorite album that has been released since Yield, including Lightning Bolt.  I'm not sure why I didn't post a review when it first came out, guess I'm playing catch up!<br /><br />The way this album opens up with 4 straight-ahead rockers is awesome; it's a fun album that's very \\"up\\" in comparison to the last few that preceded it.  All four openers are great, I love the punky bassline from \\"Got Some\\" and the throwback style of \\"Johnny Guitar\\".  Things slow down a little with \\"Just Breathe\\", which may sound familiar as it's nearly identical to \\"Tuolumne\\" from Eddie Vedder's \\"Into The Wild\\" soundtrack.  Up next is one of my favorite PJ tracks, \\"Amongst The Waves\\", which reminds me of \\"Given To Fly\\" as it builds and levels out, much like actual waves.  After that comes \\"Unthought Known\\", another track that builds in the same way, and then the volume goes up to 11 with \\"Supersonic\\", a fast, frantic rocker with a rowdy jam in the middle.  The only two tracks on this album I'm not entirely fond of are \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"The End\\", but the song that breaks up the pair is a great track, \\"Force Of Nature\\", which to me sounds unlike anything they've done before.  I love the buzzing of Mike's guitar in the intro and the pacing and style of the song overall reminds me of Steve Winwood's \\"While You See A Chance\\".<br /><br />I think this is a great Pearl Jam album, more focused and less conceptual than others.<br />I'd have to say is it's in my top 3 (with Yield, and an undecided 3rd) from them.think this is a great Pearl Jam album, more focused and less conceptual than others.

B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This was a delightful novel about two people who should be polar opposites finding love together. The author does a wonderful job describing Don's peculiarities and the way he functions, and how he works to overcome some of his social issues. The characters are both flawed, yet very believable, and the humor throughout is delightful. Highly recommended.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love the ease of being able to watch The Walking Dead without having to wait for commercials! And I can watch it anywhere I want to.
B0045DO8LK|5.0|Yield is not only my favorite album by Pearl Jam, but also stands as my first choice in the proverbial \\"deserted island\\" scenario for a number of reasons which I'll share in this review (while trying to be as unbiased as possible).<br /><br />First, in comparing Yield with albums like \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs\\" (which many people tend to compare every album to) it's almost like listening to two different bands, which is why I call this a landmark album.  Yield represents a significant change in the tone and style of the band and the level of input everyone has, as if the volume knob for every instrument got turned up so you're hearing more of everyone all at once.  Guitarist Stone Gossard touched on that in \\"Single Video Theory\\" which is a behind the scenes look at the Yield recording sessions, in which he said \\"everyone got to be a part of this one in a new kind of way\\", and it shows!  Every time I listen to Yield, which is quite often, there is one word that keeps coming to mind to describe what I love about it, and that word is \\"atmosphere\\".  There's something about the structure or the playing on every song on this album that seems very unique to me, and each song has a bit of an aura surrounding it, most notably on \\"Faithful\\", \\"No Way\\", \\"Wishlist\\", \\"In Hiding\\" and the last moments of \\"All Those Yesterdays\\".  This feeling I get from the songs on Yield is not something I get from the albums that came before, or really after either, although some of it carried into Binaural in sections.<br /><br />Beyond the musical aspect of this album that I find particularly pleasing, the lyrical content is among the best I've heard from Pearl Jam.  I find myself quoting this album a lot, and love so many of the themes and concepts mentioned across many of the songs.  Without sounding too \\"mushy\\", for the first time in their career it seems that Eddie found a happy place or perhaps had begun settling in nicely and feeling good about the direction of the band.  I particularly like the segment from Wishlist that says \\"I wish I was a messenger, and all the news was good...I wish I was the full moon shining off a Camaro's hood\\", and the interesting twist in the line \\"I've stopped trying to make a difference...no way\\" from the song No Way.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of breaking an album down by song (as many do in their \\"track by track\\" summaries), certainly not an album like this that I consider virtually flawless.  Besides, for those wondering what each song is like, that's what the audio samples are for.  The art of recording ALBUMS (not just a collection of songs to be picked from the bunch for an iPod) seems to be a dying approach, which is a shame.  I think this is an outstanding album and should be listened to as a whole.  Every other Pearl Jam album has a few songs that really stand out to me, but this album seems to be the one I just can't do that with.  I've learned over time that this album has had a similar impact on many other people as every time I've mentioned it I've gotten replies from others saying how it's their favorite too.  It seems that the vibe on the album struck the right chord (pun intended) with many Pearl Jam fans.<br /><br />I know that \\"Ten\\" will always be considered their best, understandably, but I feel like Yield deserves that level of admiration and respect.  I highly recommend this album for anyone who wants to hear what it sounds like when a band starts to truly evolve into something that is greater than the sum of its parts.nt from Wishlist that says \\"I wish I was a messenger, and all the news was good...I wish I was the full moon shining off a Camaro's hood\\", and the interesting twist in the line \\"I've stopped trying to make a difference...no way\\" from the song No Way.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of breaking an album down by song (as many do in their \\"track by track\\" summaries), certainly not an album like this that I consider virtually flawless.

B008JFUNHI|2.0|The movie was slow and boring and... stupid. I am fan of sci-fi including the standard alien invasion genre but nothing here made sense. The few scenes with the aliens provide no clues to their society or motives. Somehow we are supposed to believe that hive-living colonial insects can build spaceships, and yet in the few scenes where we see the alien world there is no sign of technology- other than the spacecraft.  The authors don't seem to realize that in colonial insects genera the Queen does not &#34;rule&#34; (i.e. command) a society of essentially zombie drones. Instead each caste and each cast and each stage of each caste has functions-the adult Queen's function is to lay eggs, and that's about it- and the colony functions through the exchange of information ,generally in the form of chemicals and tactile communications,  and the colony functions in a very information DECENTRALIZED fashion. There is NO leader. As far as action scenes go, watch the trailer on You Tube- that's about all there it.  Even the final battle made no sense. Huge disappointment.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|First of all, I LOVED the ending.  If I didn't, that would've been all it took to give this book a one star rating.  The only reason I gave it a four star rating was because I love when books make me feel any strong emotion, even sadness and depression.<br /><br />There are several reasons this book wasn't five stars.  Mostly, if you're going to write a book from the point of view of two people, those two people's views need to be different enough so that the reader can easily differentiate between them two characters without having to get confused and think about it first.  There were several times when I got confused because I thought that I was still reading from Tris's point of view, but was really reading from Four's and vice versa.<br /><br />Another reason is that some of the characters, especially Evelyn, had ridiculous, nonsensical change of heart that just didn't make sense.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book, but the ending was what made this book for me.

The mystery and suspense keeps you wanting more!

But it is vintage King and totally sucked me into the story. Loved catching up with Danny too!

B000209ZAE|4.0|Got this to add more utility to my rotary tool. It does the job, but it is a little finicky about what brands of tools it holds more securely than others. Never a fear that it would slip or fall out, but the non-dremel brand I have was a little loose and needed a foam spacer added to get a good grip.<br />The results are decent. Not the level you would get with a full fledged drill press, but for small jobs it is very good.

B008JFUNJQ|4.0|As many others have stated, I have also read the book and it is one of my favorite all time science fiction stories.  So I will do my best not to do the old &#34;book better than movie&#34; schtick because before I even went to see it I believed it would be impossible to condense the qualities of the book into a feature length movie.  And I was right.<br /><br />That being said, the movie WAS quite satisfying.  I wouldn't call it great as the movie failed to fully encapsulate the true genius of Ender and his extraordinary ability to socially and intellectually outmaneuver his rivals...which is really what this movie is all about.  But it was close enough for me to enjoy it.  To really get to the core of what the book was about I believe Ender's Game would have been far better off as an HBO-type 12 episode series.  As it is, this movie tended to remind me a bit of Dune.  Not that it was badly done (Dune was not exactly a great movie), it's just that it seemed like 20 pages of book went by every minute which necessarily required the movie to move too quickly for its own good.  Had I not read the book first I think I might have been confused during some parts of it (Ender's relationships with his siblings, with Bernard, why Bean's input was critical to Ender, etc).<br /><br />Harrison Ford did a great job as Colonel Graff and Asa Butterfield was a believable Ender, although he is too old by the books' standard.  Dang it...I did it again.  Ok, I just decided I simply cannot keep from comparing it to the book.  Sorry.  But I took my wife and three kids (ages 10, 15, and 17) and they all thought it was great (and they didn't read it).  I hope that helps.  They even started a discussion after the movie to ask questions about why Ender made certain decisions as a leader so I think that qualifies the movie as somewhat thought provoking.<br /><br />One thing you may think about if you haven't read the book is this, &#34;Why am I watching a movie about a kid who seems to be playing video games?&#34; or more directly, &#34;Why am I paying money to watch a kid PLAY video games?&#34;  This story is more about his development into a leader and decision-making process so try to prepare for it that way and you should derive a good amount of enjoyment from it.

B00712Y28Q|4.0|This is a very neat Samus Aran action figure - but the emphasis is definitely on the posing and static display of Samus rather than having her in the hands of a 10-year old chasing down bad guys on the family room floor.  The Samus I received only had one minor paint blemish but the rest of the figure shined and looked great.  The included posing stand is very helpful for putting her in all sorts of action-y positions.  The figure is a little small in my opinion, considering the cost.  The box states that this is not for those under 15, and they mean it.  I accidentally popped a leg off myself - but putting it back on was easy.  However, a child would destroy Samus in a way that Ridley and the Space Pirates never could.

B00B7FOQCK|4.0|Exactly as described. With the ultrabook that I have, having minimal I/O ports, this hub has become essential to seamless hot-swapping and attachment of external HDD's and flash drives. USB 3.0 can operate at 5GB's compared to USB 2.0 at 480MB's. With a hub however, one 5GB port is split amongst the USB devices plugged in and therefore bottleneck the actual speed. Still a huge upgrade from USB 2.0

Gary Taubes explains the science of the body's natural fat-burning mechanisms and why humans did not evolve to eat grains and sugars. It's a real wake-up call to the staggering costs in money and lives caused by the failed low-fat strategy that was prematurely touted beginning in the 60's.

B005CGI4EG|5.0|Cheaper packing can get annoying if your in a hurry but besides that, what more could you ask for? I mean 11 seasons for $30 and in decent quality for an older show (pre- HD). I was expecting the price to be more around $70 at least. Great show, great price, this is truly a win win!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy the game a great deal, but some elements of the game remain unexplained. What is the wheel, and why are there extras that can only be purchased? Of course, it is free.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This app allows me to input subjects of my choice to view and, after I see the ones I like most, I can download them to my Tablet.  Video image and sound quality, are really very good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Graphics are great and there are many different levels and locations so it never gets boring. Well worth the download!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I don't give five stars often, but this one had everything. Dan's ongoing battle with his own demons while saving a young girl is compelling. I stayed up late reading each new section and thought about the characters throughout the day. This is a compelling sequel and a shining star in the King constellation.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Good story.A lot of information on the diamond business and mineing most of us know nothing about.A lot of fun to read.A good story.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|my daughter loves this game but the new update is not working right please fix and I'll give a higher star
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is awesome I totally recommend it!! But I have 2 say my friends that have it on Apple products get an update before me...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got my Chromecast yesterday -- it's just as advertised.<br /><br />Now, installation, for me, was a bit difficult but did ultimately succeed.  The first problem I encountered was that the installation program for Chromecast which I'd downloaded inelegantly refused to run.  A Google search for the error, though, showed me to right-click [Windows 7] and run as administrator.  Worked!<br /><br />And then, the device refused to join my Wi-Fi network.  I worked on this for an hour or so, changing router settings to no avail and searching online for specific recommendations for my situation.  In the midst of that, I noticed that the TV screen was displaying a message to the effect that &#34;I deserved the latest and Chromecast was being updated&#34;.  The update went on for five minutes or so and after the device rebooted itself -- Voila! -- it was ready to go.<br /><br />It's very easy to use, installation on my iPhone and iPad were painless, and it sure is fun to be able to put a Youtube video on the TV rather than running the laptop over to Grandma so she can see, too.<br /><br />I recommend it.<br /><br />One point:  the listing on Amazon showed that a power adapter would be required and was not included if your TV doesn't have a USB port.  Mine doesn't, so I ordered a separate adapter.  My Chromecast device, however, came packaged with one.  Go figure.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it &amp; so will u it's sooo fun.. anyway best game ever.<br />I also want 2 say they also have awesome limmeted time offers thx 4 reading my review
B009HUB40Y|2.0|I reached a certain level and can't go any farther until i buy something..I dont do facenook on kindle. I will immediately delete this app.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|You guys will love this game 4 all u slendy lovers!! When I got this game and started playing the first thing I saw was him. I'm so glad I'm not one of those ppl who throw their electronic anyway get this game 4 the fun of a scare!! :)
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Still watching this show.  Can't believe one of my favorites would be watching dead people walking around lol.  Story is good as well as the characters.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It is a zynga game. If you play one you know how to play the others. Rinse and repeat just with a different story
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I'm not much of a Tom Cruise fan anymore.  This one was quite surprisingly good.  I would say some of his movies are ok and some are really good.  This one is a keeper.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Takes too long to build energy so you get bored easily so I delete the games. This has happened with several games
B0053FANRC|3.0|The main character was terrible... but the car action was interesting just not as great as its predecessor.  I think the only interesting character was the Japanese guy who loaned the car.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Best alarm ever... So many options... Gets me out of bed even on the most tired of days! Highly recommended!
B00ARAO720|5.0|Entertaining show.  Though got to question ones insanity about racing a bicycle in a city.  Still nice little suspense and adventure.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|A beautifully moving and inspirational movie on how a man didn't let his physical limitations from being afflicted by Polio as a child, prevent him from living life to the fullest. More than that, how the various people in his life could see beyond his bodily restrictions to his heart, character, his unvarnished truth, and respect for living. It was through his poetry that he touched peoples souls and he was loved deeply as a result.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Still following the show pretty well.  Still surprised by the character development and story twist that pull me into the show.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|Very good, suspenseful, and action packed. I loved the funny parts, the scary parts, and even the very few non action parts
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Enjoyed this movie.  Argo definitely makes interesting story.  A true story about people stuck in a no win situation and managed to survive.
B003D513TQ|5.0|VERY GOOD MOVIE...Well done...Prince Albert really is the star in this movie..sadly he died to young, had only he lived perhaps the Victorian age would have been greater than what history records it to be or not to be..we watch a young Queen become a mature thinking thoughtful Queen and fully aware of her power and influence through the guidance of her husband..
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I so impressed with the story and characters that is just a show that can be watched again and again.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|I didn't get a chance to see this movie in 3D, but seeing it in HD was sufficient.  Some sort of human like life evolved before we did.  But why? There are no real answers, just some fascinating ideas of the future of space travel and what we might find. The acting is acceptable and the characters fascinating. I don't want to post any spoilers. Just see it and make your own judgement. I thought it was superb work by Ridley Scott.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Honestly can't believe how good this show is.  My first thought.  Hmm undead well you can only go so far with that story, fortunately I was wrong.  Very entertaining.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Damian Stevenson's Solstice is a riveting, suspenseful tale of loss and redemption.<br /><br />Bi-polar Dana, fresh from a week of rehab, leaves L.A. and heads east to Oklahoma to visit her sister Zoe. Dana and her boyfriend Tyler are caught in a dust storm and are forced to spend the night in the Motel Americana. When Dana wakes up the next morning, Tyler has vanished. His disappearance begins Dana's journey down the rabbit hole that is the Rainbow Collective.<br /><br />Dana's journey twists and turns as she attempts to make sense of her new unsettled world while trying to find the missing Tyler. What is real and what could she be imagining?<br /><br />This is a great story that leaves you wanting more from this author. Pick up your copy today.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|I'm still sucked into the show.  Surprised how the story is progressing as well as the character keeps growing threw the show.
B008F5Y7UQ|1.0|Nice movie until they over-complicated it with unnecessary sub-plot about her love life. My suspension of dis-belief got suspended when she started jumping from bed to bed...
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Well uh ok.  This was a strange action film.  Sort of reminded me of kill bill in its odd since of direction with the characters.
B0002EXH5O|1.0|the vocals on this remaster are atrocious.  i cant even stand listening to this CD.  I am a fan of the band and this album, just not this version.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Surprised how the show continues to make turns and still build on the character growth and story.  Sill very entertaining
B00ARF92HK|5.0|I was very surprised.  Love the character and the show was very good.  A lot of action and a strong support for character story.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is the perfect book to embody resilience and courage. It takes a lot of both to survive the ordeal she went through and make it out strong and still curious to know herself and what the future holds. My hat goes off for this remarkable young woman and I pray that she knows how grateful I am, at least, for her to share her story.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|Surprised writers have manage to keep this show growing.  Still very entertaining and watch Dexter change from the people around him.
B00FAIPDAE|3.0|The game is fun but it just takes to long to upgrade and cost to many tokens to get builders.
B000VNMMR0|1.0|Holy crap this is terrible.  Very terrible.  This doesn't even follow how the character was.  The first 3 shows followed a certain way the character is.  This one is about explosion and action but does not really follow the personality of its predecessors.  It seems like a die hard but its a cheep version of the original character.  What brought die hard audience was the situation of a character who is just a normal cop stuck in an impossible situation where as this character.  It's like ya I'm superman I'll do things that impossible and I don't have to worry about it.  Ill blow it up.  Wow I would say B rate but I've seen better B rate movies and character write not even close to the originals.  Shockingly Terrible Bruce have you gotten lazy or what?
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great! Imaginative, challenging and a fun way to spend time. Great that it's free too! I play it all the time.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Another true story.  Surprised about how well done this was.  I was surprised how far the character went to hide the truth and how he finally had to come to terms with what he done.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This app has such awesome graphics and even has a plot built into it as you figure out your friend's puzzles he left behind while doing his strange and mysterious research. The puzzles are challenging, yet not immensely so, and if you truly get stuck there is a hint button (but it's so much more fun if you don't use the hints). I absolutely LOVED this game and can't wait for the next one to come out!
B00BESJYAY|3.0|True story about a surfer and the life of a surfer.  Interesting story to follow.  It's not a movie I would care to watch again.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I liked this book. I love trying to figure out how everyone plays into a story and this book definitely had a story. There were a lot of major coincidences it is pretty out there but a fun easy read.  There is language and the characters definitely lack some moral judgement. Kind of reminded me of a Crazy soap opera!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Very good show cannot believe how well written it is and how well the character growth has progressed threw the show.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It kept my interest up and I the game was fun. Looking forward y the next episode.
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|Uhmm well ok.  It's a show that is easily forgettable.  Reason I say that is I know I seen this show and it took a while of looking threw the trailer to tell me about a show I seen.  That's pretty sad.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|100 pages in I didn't care for it but once you got used to the British feel it was an amazing book.  The ending was one of the cleverest I've ever read. Highly recommend to anyone.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Very enjoyable.  A bit dark so its not what I would call for kids.  Though animated its can be pretty rough.  Good show though.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|At first I didn't think I would enjoy it but my sister put me on to the game and I am enjoying myself.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Entertaining for family.  Me and mom enjoyed it.  Though it was a full 5 stars it was worth watching at least once.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I'm not a pro, just a guy who likes to take photos of his family, travel and nature photos.  I have been using a holster bag.  But it does not offer space for anything else other than the camera and a couple of very small/thin accessories.  It is also not so easy to get your camera out of the holster bag.  I saw several folks with this type of bag and found this one on Amazon.  It has so much room inside that I actually bought some new accessories.  I don't have to wonder where things are now other than tripods or light tripods.  There are almost too many pockets and I still don't use them all.  I can easily strap my monopod to the outside and have everything I need.<br /><br />Since it is only a month old, I'm giving it 4 stars and I almost never, ever give anything a 5.
B000O77SRC|5.0|Love the character and his way of making a bad situation less painful haha.  If you love action and adventure with a fun character to follow this would be it.
B00127RAJY|4.0|My wife is a big fan of Jillian Michaels. She uses this video to stay in shape. As with most videos, you get board after a few months and want something else.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Honestly was surprised how watching a serial killer who kills other serial killers sucks a person into the show so easily.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I rate this series as high as it goes because, ITS DOCTOR WHO! One of the best science fiction tv showes ever made. Buy it, and you will love it!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Interesting and some education.  Not a family movie.  It's more for couples that been married for a while.  Some interesting and funny things that come up.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Love this movie, watch it every time there is a new one out there, not for everyone to enjoy but I do.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Enjoyed the series.  Grew up watching the movie series and have to say there wasn't anything I could complain about.  I would say it be a great family movie but it be more like teenagers and above.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|The streaming is awesome but so far this season is boring compared to 1-3. something needs to happen soon in this season
B005D63ICI|5.0|The show continues to surprises me with the turns and twist of the characters life as he tries to struggle within to be normal.
B00FHB7398|5.0|loveit! love it! love it!  awesome hidden adventure game!  I would recommend this to all.  make more games like this one...  I will definately. play.
B005G4TJUC|3.0|Sadly the story is a ok.  Mostly the characters are mostly go no where.  The transformers on the other hand are great to watch.  Nice action just the continuity of the characters and the direction written for them is pretty lousy.
B0026P3G12|5.0|fabulous singer - all good songs  I play the CD often.  She is a wonderful artist with much feeling in her delivery
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I was introduced to this show threw my mom.  Its an interesting show.  But sadly its forgettable.  Nice show just not anything great.
B00DCRE83S|5.0|IS A GIFT TO A METALLICA FANS COULD NOT LISTEN FOR THE MOMENT AS YOU GIVE ME I WILL DO THE SAME COMMENT.
B001NZP6QO|5.0|This is the real Red Man. This is the time he was really hungry. I really met my expectation. I gives you the hardcore redman you want to hear
B005SAP45I|5.0|The second in the Cars franchise, This one is more centered around Mater, the rusty tow truck with a carburetor of gold.<br />This is a nice departure from the world of Stock Car Racing and includes some of the other disciplines of auto racing while also adding some international flavor.<br />A great (vocal) performance by Michael Caine who plays a British super-spy.<br />This is a fun movie and a must-see for anyone who saw the first one.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Old school scare without any 'over the top' effect. Soundtrack was in tune with the story. Based on a true story, it does well for itself.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|This is a fun little puzzle game with nice little sounds and animations. It keeps my toddler entertained. Once you solve a puzzle, it applauds and you get to pop balloons or tires, or something like that.<br />It would be nice it there were more included in the free version, but what do you expect for free?
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|True to Disney, a sure family favorite. Keeping with tradition the antics and story offer wonderful insight into the back story between Sully and Mike. My spouse and I watched it before the kids did.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|When I first heard Disney was going to make a movie about cars, I was skeptical. When I first saw it I was a little ambivalent about it, but once I had a son (who loves cars and trains and all kinds of vehicles) who instantly loved it, I began to get it.<br />Now, after countless viewings, I love it. It is a good story with great characters, who despite being cars, you can sympathize and empathize with.<br />Way to go Disney!
B008JFUQZ2|2.0|Movie story line was lame to put it bluntly. Story line seems to be 'borrowed' from other series (including Escaflowne), and revenege, boy-meets-girl. The effects were a blend from Transformers, and Avatar. The 'one-liners' were standard and typical. Not a movie for to add to a collection. Rent it, rather than buy it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game a lot. it is so addictive. I like the graphics and the candy themes.  I get really wrapped up in it.
B00GMONG90|5.0|Brilliant performance. Great variety of style.  Very, very good album. I love a cappella singing.  I recommend.  If you haven't heard the group before, they are an amazing one on a part vocal ensemble with a truly great beat boxer.  Very worth your time.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Neil Gaiman is a popular author, but this is the first book I have ever read from the author. I am not sure why I chose to read this one first. I have had American Gods on my “To Be Read” list for a while now.<br />The book was interesting enough while I was reading it, but I quickly forgot almost everything about it after putting it down.  Don’t get me wrong, I remember the plot just fine, but I do not remember anything that I just loved and thought about after putting it down.<br />I read reviews that called this book a adult novel, and an adult fairy tale. I did not see this at all in this book. It felt very much like a young adult novel. I will give another of the authors books a try, but this did not grab me.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I bought this in Jan 2012, to go with a Gigabyte 970A-UD3 motherboard, and it has been serving me well since then. I'd suggest that mobo or a newer model, because it comes with OC controls in BIOS, and you're going to want to take this CPU out for a spin. The heatsink it comes with looks nice, but seriously underperforms. It is fine for stock speeds, but if you want to take this CPU off the rails you'll need something better. I'd suggest a cheap self-contained liquid unit.<br /><br />The FX series was born to overclock, so take that into account when choosing one... # of cores and cache memory is what's important, since you can overclock an FX to any speed if you can keep it cool enough. Someone set a worlds record by getting an FX up to 8.8 GHz using liquid helium! But realistically, you can expect a limit of 5 GHz if you're an OCing pro, and 4 GHz if you don't change any settings except FSB multiplier. I cranked mine up to 4.2 GHz, and it has been rock solid and the only setting I had to change was +0.1v to the CPU. With a cheap liquid cooler, it rarely goes over 110F, and only 130F under load in the summer when the room was already 90F.<br /><br />This applies for the whole FX range, so you may want to look around and see if a 6 or 8 core is in your price range, or even a 4xxx with more cache memory. But if you're stuck with a low budget, and have to get a cheapish 4 core, this one is absolute dynamite. Team it up with an OC-ready AM3+ mobo, a 55 dollar liquid cooler, and a 450w power supply and you can have a little rocket of a system for a little over 300 bucks.<br /><br />Now that the prices for the FX line have dropped, this may not be the best value, because the price can only go so low. But it was once the champ, and if you can get one on sale (or afford an FX with more cores) you won't be disappointed. I've never had a problem with it, I am getting an FX-8350 but I'm selling the FX-4100 because it even has value second-hand.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I bought this as a gift and he absolutely loved it and wears it daily. The yellow hands are strikingly gorgeous and masculine at the same time.  The band seems a bit thinner than it appears in the photos- but if you look closely at the where the band attaches to the face- the photo looks just like it does in person.  This watch gets noticed and complimented, and it has a unique look to it!  Love that it can be worn casually or dressed up.  I haven't noticed any scratches on it after constant use.  Another plus- if this is a gift, the box is neat looking!
B000001FV1|5.0|Since you cannot buy \\"Roll Right Stone\\" by itself, you have to purchase the entire album. Buying the CD, which gets you MP3s immediately for free, is cheaper than buying the MP3 album alone. It's a no-brainer.<br /><br />If you like Traffic - and who wouldn't - this album is a must have. It was recorded at the old casket factory at 3614 Jackson Highway near Muscle Shoals Alabama.
B00GSEDTIM|4.0|oh man!  love this series.  I have to admit to being a little worried that I wasn't appreciating this episode as much as I could since I haven't seen the new Thor yet.  But I found it so engaging!  I'm really getting into all the backstories.  The characters are starting to develop.  I still feel like something is missing though.  There's a depth to the show that I just don't see yet.  But the potential is there.  These actors could do a LOT more than they're given now.  I hope the writing turns up as the season progresses.  I feel like it's moving in the right direction and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game for my first grader, and instead I'm totally addicted. I love all the challenges. I reccommend this game for all ages.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is really amazing. I bawled and bawled through half of it. The Fault in Our Stars is lovable and a very moving story that takes you through a teenage girl's life who has cancer and falls in love with a boy who had cancer. I love this story, I love it so much!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game has awesome graphics and cute little characters.<br />The story line is interesting and appropriate for all ages. It can, also be quite addictive. So consider yourself warned.
B00006JQU1|5.0|This is simply superb. If you want a rendition of these Bach compositions, you can't wrong with Rachel Podger's take. Also I play CDs through an excellent vintage \\"signal chain\\" (Pioneer PD-65 CD player, into the latest TC-7533 Beresford DAC, into a Crown IC-150 preamp, then into the Crown CD-300A amp, and finally into Rectilinear III \\"Highboys\\") so I can testify that the sound engineering is pretty terrific here. As they used to say in the old Rectilinear ads: \\"You can hear the violinist breathing.\\" You should not hesitate.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I just had the stock fan connected to an athalon 64 x2. This instantly dropped my cpu temp by 10-12°F. I'm now running at idle in the low 30's and high 40's at peak. A much more stable system and I've overclocked it.
B0041VB8BO|4.0|good album.  in my opinion it's better than they're more popular album &#34;some nights&#34;  not perfect,  but good listening none the less
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game help makes time past by when bored . It is your basic non stop running game like temple run.
006112429X|5.0|I gave the book five stars not because the book is so enjoyable to read but because it is well written and if you know a troubled child similar to Kevin it gives you some insight.  Similarities to the child we know are startling and the Dad is so similar to the dad we know.  It does show the troubles some families go through and not because they are bad people but there is mental illness.  We need to be careful not to judge parents.  Most parents are doing the best they can.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Outstanding. Fabulous. I didn't think I would/could love book 2 as much as book 1 but I think I loved it more. Highly addicting and ends on a cliff hanger. Thank goodness I waited for the entire trilogy to be completed before I decided to read. If I had to stop and wait for book 3, I'd be screaming right now.
B008P9M614|5.0|It's House! What can I say? I especially enjoy the episodes with Edi Gathegi, partly because I know his Dad, John (great family), but I also like the Mormon inspection-injection (having been a Mormon). To enjoy this movie you have to have a great ability for belief suspension and an open mind (to all things that can be criticized). Coming from a family of doctors and doctor lawyers -it really gets on the other side of those perspectives in an odd but satisfying way :-).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really really sad ending.....but really so inspiring....to fight till the end and not lose out is something which only some can achieve...and Katniss's not one of them.
B00DQN6DMW|5.0|Masashi Hamauzu never disappoints. He brings a plethora of old and new Final Fantasy XIII themes to the soundtrack. Accompanied by other composers that have done FFXIII-2. This is one soundtrack you will like.<br /><br />Will you be the savior who leads the people? Or will you succumb to the pressures, knowing that the world will end in 13 days?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Enjoyable reading.  Fun and different . Story keeps you interested in what will happen next.  Characters are likeable and interesting.
B00011F5DK|4.0|This was recommended from a friend and I could not find it in the stores. My daughter and I have played it many times.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|Great movie. It was so funny. John Wayne didn't make to many funny movies, but this is one of the movies that had me laughing the whole time watching it.
B009M2T7K6|5.0|I was not expecting to think so mych of this Barbie doll.  I got it for my 5 year old and she loves it.  Very happy with the quality and it has become her favorite bath toy.
0767827791|5.0|This movie I saw when I was a little girl. I always loved it and I still was it when ever I see it on tv. I always wanted to be Kim Novak , because of William Holden falling in love with her.
B009K45Y62|5.0|This is unique, this is the Dark Knight rises limited edition, the mask looks great, quite an icon,  i use it like a decorative item over my blu ray
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|El Dorado is a movie I saw sometime ago. It had a lot of major stars in it. Its another good old time movie that I would tell anyone to watch.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I guess Kiss made more changes than david bowie, so this is the another gift and remarkable come back of one the best bands over the planet
160774273X|5.0|I was rather weary about this book after reading some of the not-so-favorable reviews. I tried a few of the recipes (only the basic breads, no starter required), I must say this book is totally a hidden gem and you should try it. Oh, did I mention that there is no mixer required? It really isn't that hard at all.<br /><br />First of all, let me be clear, this is a book that requires some homework and studying - an understanding of the bakers formula (taught by the author) and a calculator to convert the batch size to desired amount.<br /><br />There are several pre-requisites to falling in love with this book. It is not a book for absolute beginners, you must first learn the techniques necessary for the success of artisan bread making. I will give you a very useful tip, search the author on youtube, he has quite a few tutorial/demonstration videos online, and they're very well done. They have been tremendously helpful for me to understand some of the terms mentioned in the book, as well as picking up some tips during bread making.<br /><br />Also, you need to go with the weight method instead of the volume (measuring by cups) method, and must be open to doing some maths. There is a common theme for a lot of the not-so-favorable reviews: the batch sizes are ridiculous. Well, except that if you own a scale, all you need to do is half the entire recipe, and everything will be fine. The author tried to teach the method used by professionals (bakers formula) which is done by weight ratios. Once you figure the maths out, everything is actually relatively easy. I sometimes will make 400g batches (standard recipes are 1000g), just do conversions on a post-it and stick it on my cabinet door during the process. It's simple and easy, and takes a lot of frustrations out of the volume method (I should also mention that, you'd end up with less dirty dishes since you just need to tare the scale and weigh everything in the same bowl)<br /><br />So, study the formula, pull out a calculator to do some math, watch tutorial video when in doubt, and you should be on you way to some fantastic home-made country bread!culator to do some math, watch tutorial video when in doubt, and you should be on you way to some fantastic home-made country bread!
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|The Price was excellent, clean box set to make the nightmares even better and real, I had in all the possible formats, but this is the thing.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Its ok.  I'm used to the game from Pogo.com.  This one doesn't have options and definite # of. games per level so you can track your progress.  Its also not as challenging as Pogo's. It could use upgrades.
B00008O89K|5.0|I love the soundtracks, especially when they have the main intro, made it with steel and heart, play it load
B005YDLJ76|5.0|This was great to see Beyonce in a light never been seen before. Although, she shows us what she wants us to see, it was good.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|One of the best ever solitaire games out there. I have this on my kindle and my Iphone 4S. The gopher and the comentators are super funny. Highly addictive game though.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This is an all-time favorite movie. I had to purchase this movie. This movie is a must see for everyone.
B000I9WWCM|5.0|A feel good movie. Makes you reevaluate your relationships with friends and family. My husband enjoyed it also. A must see
B001BANK32|4.0|Re-reading before I dive in to Dr. Sleep. I remember loving it as a teenager, and it's still good the second time around. But now, I think it takes a good third of the book to pick up speed; the editor in me wanted to get the action started earlier. Still, a fun scary read.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I constantly use this app when dealing with my pictures. It's has many great features. You can make different collages. With 3 boxes, 9 boxes,  even a Facebook cover picture. You can also change the filter with many different options. You can even add a speech text. Trust me,it's a great app! One of the best.
B0050DIWHU|5.0|Although I am not a linkeIn big time fan, the book is exceptionally good. Shapes clearly what is the wave alreadya round.
B00FOWX6NM|2.0|I was shocked when I received the product. The color is super weird. I regret buying this case because it doesn't look good in real.
B00DJYJPLO|5.0|In a film market dominated by big commercial releases and the usual formulaic approach, Linklater et al have done an excellent job in presenting an alternative to the 'romantic comedy' formula.<br /><br />Instead of the airbrushed depiction of romance, here we have what feels like a real relationship with its very real hurdles.  Jesse and Celine are now in their 40's, navigating the hassles of dealing with a blended family and ex-spouses, conflicts between pursuing one's career and spending time with the children.  It's a more mature film than the last two of the series, and definitely 'darker'.<br /><br />Like the previous two films before it, the main focus is on the relationship between the two leads.  Most of the scenes are long, and made to seem like a natural dialogue with its many digressions and irrelevancies.  You may be forgiven to think the scenes were improvised.  On closer examination, all the little dialogue digressions do have a point.<br /><br />Without giving the plot away, I can divide the film into 4 main parts.  Followed by the opening airport scene where Jesse farewells his son (from his previous marriage) who is going back to his mother's, we have Jesse, Celine, and their twin daughters in a long scene (which was taken almost in one shot) in a car - travelling on vacation in Greece to meet friends.  We are dropped right into their lives, and the scene basically serves as background to allow us to catch up on what's been happening to them since we last met them 9 years ago.  This was followed by a couple of scenes around a Greek house where we meet other characters - a young couple much like Jesse and Celine might have been years ago; another couple in their 40's; and an older widow and widower who were dealing with their losses in different ways.  This was a departure from the previous two films in that there are interesting characters beyond the lead couple.  The long lunchtable scene was particularly memorable for the spontaneous conversations, always leading back to the topic of relationships.  After that a long stroll with just Jesse and Celine talking/philosophising takes the audience right back to their similar interactions in the first film Before Sunrise.  As they arrived at the hotel (for a romantic night organised by their friends), this led up to the climax of the film where the tension in the relationship culminates in what I think to be the most realistic depiction of a couple's fighting.<br /><br />The cinematography is adequate and the scenic backdrop is gorgeous even though that's not the point of the film.  An original soundtrack was used for the first time in this set of films - it's very sparingly used but effective.  It is the writing and the acting, as would be expected, that matters most in this exploration of a relationship.  The minor characters are all likeable and believable, but it is Delpy and Hawke's acting (without making it look like acting) that really makes this film.  (The leads also share the credits for the writing with Linklater.)  What's equally impressive is the matching between the chronology of the three films and real life - the actors aged fairly closely to the films.  This film achieves the best intention of 'reality TV/documentary' using totally fictitious characters.<br /><br />Reading some online reviews, I think this film polarises audience - you either love it or hate it.  There would be a few who watched this film without knowing anything about the previous two - and if you did that you will not enjoy this film to its potential.  Then there are those who do not enjoy the intense conversations.  Yes the film is a 'talkfest'.  If you don't like this sort of thing, then steer clear from it.  And then, there are reviewers who disliked the film's depiction of a relationship - finding the realism too stark - these reviewers tend to like the first two films (or at least the first one).  To this I will only say that this is not your usual rom-com, and the audienceneeds to be prepared for possibly confronting themes (despite the idyllic setting!)<br /><br />I didn't fully explore the special DVD features but the commentary by Linklater, Hawke and Delpy was fascinating - a must for anyone who enjoyed the film and wants to find out about the writing process.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Book and movie combine their talent in this epic fresco that leaves me breathless. Love both and can't wait for more.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and was so happy to have access to the entire Season 2.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!

B005HSL626|5.0|Fun game for all, we have great fun with this and enjoy the time we spend together, fun, fun, nfun and more fun.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|there are 3 problemes<br />one slow download on kindle<br />two hard to get in game tokents/coins<br />three it is limeted on what u can get as in robot only 1 free per locatio so its ok
B0086700CM|5.0|So much pressure with this one but very enjoyble as you move on the bigger things, we all enjoy this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It doesn't seem like the kind of game that could be addictive, but once you start you just can' stop. :)
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|This game is just OK.  The puzzles or good, but it is really a HO game with some puzzles thrown in.  The graphics are quite good and the music is fine.  On my Kindle fire HD it does have a &#34;skip dialog&#34; option but it is OFF and I cannot turn it on ( I like dialog).
B0086700CM|3.0|They change the characters up, but not the setting. The setting is pretty cool (jungle), but they need to change it up, otherwise it gets boring fast.
B005LAIH54|3.0|I like Clash of the Titans better. This is okay but it doesn't have the verve and flow of the first. Interesting take on the twilight of the gods, but I wanted better. Okay, you won't totally waste your money, but stick with the first one, and get this one used.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|The graphics are very nice. The kindle screen is really too small to play with other players, even with the larger kindle. The computer player is quite good and will challenge you. I'd rate it 3.5/5 stars.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great with computer, tablet and phone.  Easier to set up on my tablet than on my computer, but working great.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Really an excellent free version of this classic. I couldn't be happier with those that provided this book for us. This is basically a horror novel, for those who don't know. So if you like the horror genre you should like this.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|Good, solid heavy record.  John's rhythm playing on this album is heavier and probably his best in years.  I love this band, and they're great. But Portnoy is a huge missing piece. I'm a Berklee grad, so I support Mangini having landed the gig - but... whether I think Portnoy is a better drummer or not is insignificant.  His spirit is missing, and it shows.  It prevents the band from reaching a certain wow factor, present on many of their past records.<br /><br />Two annoying things I need to call Dream Theater out on - I don't mean to pick on Jordan, because he's beyond human... But - I never have liked that &#34;Carnival type Evil Clown&#34; Sounding keyboard interlude that's present on at least every album he's been on for DT.  I would say - find a cooler patch, that is less Mr. Bungle and more of your own.<br /><br />Also - some of the sound textures sound as if I'm watching scenes from Avitar.  i.e. birds, water falls, ect.  Kitaro and the new age cats use those sound samples to appease our grand parents.  I suggest going back to your classical roots and sound your notes as if... you're playing a normal piano...
B003VDY7XE|3.0|I thought the first few episodes were good but the seem to have trailed off. The chemistry between the actors doesn't seem to be there. I'll watch a few more and see if it gets better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|There are not very many games that I like but this one is actually pretty fun! You can play without having to make in app purchases and I would buy this game instead of making any in app purchases. I just won't make in app purchases because I feel like I will keep being charged, not saying this is what happens,  its just how I feel about it. So the developer should instead have an option to possibly pay for the app that would cover the in app purchases or have the choice to make in app purchases while playing the free version. But it is a great game! Try it out! I see a lot of reviews saying it is a takeoff of Temple Run,  I believe I tried Temple Run awhile back but didn't care for it so I deleted it. I won't be deleting this one for awhile! I downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire the other day and it is hard to put down,  you just want to keep trying to get farther everytime that darn inspector and his yapping dog catch you!!
B00G4ZACLC|1.0|Just another mahjong game! The edges are hard to see as the coloring is light on the tiles. I do not care for games that use a lot of the Chinese characters.  Other than a few snowmen and other Christmas tiles it is similar to other games.  Save your money.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I really enjoy this book and how it flows through the first world war. I am excited to read the other books in the trilogy.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|Adorable game! I think it's great to entertain my kids in a cute little way! Even I like it sort of.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this book.  Mr King is still the King of story telling. Anyone who likes a good scare should read this story. I adore you Mr  King
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Another book that examines dystopian societies. A fun read from beginning to end. Likeable characters and exciting twist make this a fun, exciting book.
B005NNUKF4|5.0|Nothing much to say but I love anything Pink Floyd.  Not sure about all this remastering but have to live with it.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|A great story about a nation that has separated itself from the world. Take a look at what it's like behind the curtain through the eyes of a young woman that defected years ago. It's amazing that an entire country was plunged into poverty and darkness by a single man and his military. A true story that tells you what it's like to live in a world without power, news and everything else we take so much for granted. Millions are starving right now and it's against the law to steal grass to boil up and eat for your family. A real eye opening story of what the North Koreans are going through this very second!
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I paid for the game and I only able to play the epilog and game 1.  All other games in The Room &#34;Lock up&#34; when I try to play them on my Kindle.  What a waste of money.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|I love her and want to marry her so we can have at least a dozen children. Oh yeah, she's also a fantastic singer! How can you not like this woman? She has songs for all types and occasions and she is just a brilliant talent! I'm always amazed by people that have that gift to make the world a much better place!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun puzzle game.  Good design and nice visuals.  Not too hard to beat levels, but you have to be perfect to get 3 skulls.
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book after my priest made a reference to it in her homily.  After reading it, I gav e it to my 5th grade grandaughter who also loved it.  The point of view is from fifth graders...and every one should read it for inspiration to always choose kindness....something hard to teach in school.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have often wondered how, and when exactly did the war of the roses ended. Reading this book explained even if it's mythological some things for me. Now I know why the Tudor line ended the way it did! Not a great love story, but good to read.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|Super speedy delivery, arrived in perfect condition. Had to have it after seeing the movie. I would highly reccomend this to anyone liking this genra.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|Could not put it down. Great book loved every second of it. Can't wait to read the sequel to this!
B00G922EA2|4.0|This is an interesting game plenty of different tasks and useful hints no two tasks are the same on each level
B008D28HYS|5.0|This has been my all t time favorite for the past two years. But I must say that using this app on my kindle is top dog! Kudos to the makers, it is perfect for me and my family. Easy levels my kids can enjoy and learn problem solving, thinking ahead, process of elimination, and keeping Me on my toes with the higher levels, but the beautiful pics are worth the end result.
B000000XB9|4.0|This is a good CD all older recordings but are good, if on a LP it would sound better. I would get this again.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love the game it has good graphics and it has the megalodon I mean what more could you want and then 3d the best and the giant crab sweet
B00722ZIBA|5.0|Without fail, every Incognito fan can tell you when and where it was that he first heard this band's music--sort of like a life-changing experience.  There's an old saying that good artists borrow music and great artists steal it.  If master artists transform music into something bigger than the sum of its parts, into something more important than what's come before, then Incognito is truly masterful.  Here's a group of musical alchemists, long led by the charismatic writer/founder Jean-Paul Maunick, who, year after year, transform the basic building blocks of funk, R&B, jazz, and electronica into musical silver, gold, and platinum.  Whether you struggle to describe it as fusion or progressive or just plain old acid jazz, it remains a sound that defies labels and exceeds all expectations.  For the uninitiated, Positivity is required.  Transatlantic RPM is absolutely astonishing, inspired, sounds that just keep coming at you, a relentless pursuit of your musical soul, song after song.  Also check out 100 Degrees and Rising, Beneath the Surface, Tales From the Beach, and Adventures in Black Sunshine.  For a DVD, the outstanding 30th Anniversary Concert is as good a place to start as any.  Their musical arsenal is a cornucopia of artistic blessings.  And by the way, Surreal is also exceptional.  Jean-Paul has dug deep into his bag of musical ideas.  And though the instrumentalism is top-notch as always, the CD is truly a vocalist's dream--one stellar performance after another.  \\"My goodness, will Incognito ever lose their touch?  I hope not,\\" writes one amazon reviewer.  Writes another, \\"This music makes you believe again.\\"  When you read through reviews of Incognito over the many years, what jumps out at you--above and beyond the high accolades for the beautiful sounds--is the affection fans have for the group and the gratitude they express for the joyous music that's been so important in their lives.  Though it's the group that's invested so much hard work into the artistry over the years, it is the fans who have reaped such a large share of the rewards.  The band has taught its fans many life lessons and to understand the word Incognito to mean love of music, love of people, love of diversity, and love of life, and we're all--I'm so--deeply grateful to them for that.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|Terrible, don't waste your time or money. I usually enjoy his books, but King must of needed a boat payment.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|The movie was far good than expected. This is the best Hansel & Gretel movie I have ever seen. The director really did catch and was able to show on the big screen what the story was really about and keep it interested to be watch from start to end. Great movie!
B0041CGOZS|4.0|I am not a big Bon Jovi fan but I enjoy the Band's music when I here it on the radio or tv.<br />I didn't give a 5 star since I don't know all of the Band's songs to compare this CD with but it had all the songs I was familiar with and wanted to hear.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|Are books edited anymore? No subtlety, no buildup, no surprises.  That this book could be nominated for any award is baffling.
0670024856|3.0|Excellent writing for sure that grabs you & takes you into this big yarn. I just didn't love the story, found it ponderous at times, and didn't believe in all the characters and the extent of the plot line. But that's me; I can definitely see others enjoying this tale.
0786958731|4.0|This is my first full episode of D&D (upgraded from the training wheels version) and my 9 y/o son and I are still learning the rules but we have lot of fun playing it.  Good family time.
B008JFUNHI|5.0|MINI-REVIEW: the story is close to brilliant if we are focusing upon the A story of the novel but being that it's only a two hour movie I find it peculiar online reviews are complaining certain B and C stories were left out. That's called an HBO series, people. The focus upon the bugs, the training of children (with moral dilemmas of what our society has become), the special effects and the relations between the children were finely portrayed. While everyone did a very good job in their roles special kudos to the actors who played Ender Wiggin, Petra Arkanian, Valentine Wiggin and Bonzo Madrid.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: A minus.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I enjoyed this film because it presents us with a complicated problem and shows all the different angles, and how the characters interact and how each one deals with the problem. The film is extremely well written, and the acting is superb.<br /><br />One tends to think speaking is all about articulation and voice projection, but these are only the mechanics; when there is a problem such as stuttering, the causes are sometimes in the subconscious. It is important to give the student confidence in himself. Does Logue manage to do this and how?<br /><br />Having worked as a teacher , I know it is important to think:<br />What kind of people are in he audience and what would interest them?<br />How can I best get their attention and keep it?<br /><br />Sometimes there is a message you have to convey to a people who come from the most varied backgrounds. That is a challenge in itself. After seeing the film, ask yourself: Did the King meet this challenge?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read the kindle version on my phone and had a hard time putting it down at night.  A lot of tension and expectation that constantly gets turned on its head.  Tough moral decisions and human psychology at play.  Check it out.
0393976149|3.0|This is a good account of the lives of three teenage girls at the time of the Civil War, but it should be read by people the same age as the people in the story. It is not relevant to present-day life.
B004D24SZ4|4.0|Always liked this kind of movies, and this one is good Japanese classic. Plus, wanted to see this one before &#34;Beyond Outrage&#34;
0385339704|5.0|I enjoyed this book because I found it easy to read and full of action. Besides, it talks about interesting cities and about the importance of conserving this planet's fragile ecosystems. It also shows how unscrupulous men sometimes damage wildlife preserves because of their own greed.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I have really come to enjoy Sanderson. He is one of the best writers I the genre, and gratefully by far the most prolific. I will continue to follow all his series.
0307472590|3.0|I loved this book until I got stuck and was unable to finish it. It is uncanny how the same people keep cropping up, and everybody in the book knows everybody else. Sometimes it is like that in real life.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Not exactly a feel-good movie, but scary stuff that will keep me from going to Sea World again until they make some drastic changes. I went to Sea World within months of one of the incidents and had no idea.
0060935464|5.0|I liked this book because it does not tell us &#34;this is good and this is bad&#34;. Rather, it lets us draw our own conclusion by showing us the facts. It talks about  relations not only within the family but within the community and the social system of the South at the time it was written.  It also shows how &#34;justice&#34; can be interpreted and applied -- or perhaps, how they could be interpreted and applied in that day and age.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Very fast shipment! Love this cd! Stephen Stills still sounds great!!!! Kenny Wayne Shepherd is amazing. Love this album!!!! Hope they do more!
006202406X|5.0|I think that we are forgetting the true point of this book and that is to highlight the human condition as well as relating to one another's strengths and weaknesses. We are all damaged, some more than others, and we all search to mend those broken pieces. Some want an easy way out, or to be accepted for who and what they are without ever trying to change because they do not believe they are worthy of change. Others want to help change people because they see the good in them and what suffering has done to them. And some hide behind masks of strength with kind intentions although they are still broken and unsure of themselves in the inside. Sometimes, we are so wrapped up in ourselves and our own suffering that we forget there are others who are hurting. This book teaches us that in order to make our world a better place we need to remind ourselves that we are all human, we are all capable of change, and we should work towards mending each other. People are far from perfect, they will never be pure and they will always make mistakes. Every day we encounter individuals that have different strengths some are intelligent, some are honest, some are brave, some are selfless, and some are kind. We should hold on to these people and admire their strengths and let the thought of them heal our wounds. Do not be afraid to change the world and make it a better place to live even if that means letting go and learning to forgive.  Tris' death was not in vein, and the book was not meant to circle solely around her, Tobias is a part of each of us, we are all scared, we all fall apart, we sometime wear masks of strength and want to run a way to start anew. Tris made Tobias realize that he can be fixed, we should all strive to be like Tris and understand that we are a reflection of Tobias. I might be wrong, but this is how I felt after reading it. We all interpret things differently, personally, I thought the ending and entire series was beautiful.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|great game, but on the kindle fire it didn't give me the light and dark dragons until the day it was over everybody on apple got it right when it started
B00005QGAT|5.0|this is my favorite MJ album, before he gold all skin bleached, plastic surgery, face mask kind of situation. which is not to take away from his later works (like Thriller). But this one reminds me of my youth and innocence.

0307352153|4.0|If you understand the summary on the back cover of the book, then you understand the whole book. Cain does what the summary says she'll do:  show the hidden power of introversion and how to be all the introvert you can/should be. As an introvert myself, I found most of the revelations to be common sense based on decades of personal experience, but there's still a lot of helpful insights here, even if they're not new or earth-shattering. Introversion has its benefits, so does extraversion. Introverts process and relate to the world differently than do extraverts. Therefore we should interact differently with introverts than with extraverts. Bottom line: if you want tons of research and interviews and psychological analysis on introversion, as well as scientific permission to be an introvert, then read Quiet.
B00821OX98|5.0|One of the best produced (Spielburg) and acted SF series in years. An instant &#34;Classic&#34;. Special Effects are first class.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have this app installed on all my devices, and my whole library travels with me. Whenever i need to study something, or even reference something for work, I have the answer right there with me in my pocket or bag. The interface is very easy to understand and learn, downloading books is easy with the one-click option, and I can change the way i read the text. All the tools are right there and are easy to use. This is probably the best tool I've worked with in a long time, and I can't imagine not working with it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Always been a Trekkie and this movie is awesome! I loved it from beginning to end and would watch it repeatedly if I could get away with it!
B003B02PFO|3.0|A great story for the holidays. It is a quick read and heart warming. My book club chose  this story for December  and we all loved it.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This is a perfect little Lego bag. My son has a hard time with the zipper, but as long as most of it is closed, he figures it out just fine. Great item!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great story, and brings back characters from the past.  As usual, John Grisham kept me interested, caring, and wondering how everything was going to work out.  The ending is beautiful.  Wrap up the story with a bow, and enjoy a good cup of tea while pondering the story.  Loved it!
B000UUF69A|5.0|My boys are TMNT fanatics. I think thats all they want for Christmas! They love everything about this series, and I will admit....they get you hooked all over again!
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|Great light but my only concern is a LED light that stays on and blinks when this light is off. All the time? To locate it easily I guess. There is some logic to it. I wonder if and how much battery is wasted for that.
B00COHIFQS|5.0|Talk about a crazy movie!!! Love it and was thoroughly suspended the entire time!!! We probably shouldn't have watched in on a flight, but my husband and I loved it! Great movie.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids are addicted to this game! I will admit, it's a lot of fun and they get a kick out of the minions! Great fun for everyone.
B004132HZS|4.0|While this is a different Holmes and Watson the BBC does a good job with the characters.  They are believable with very real, very modern problems.  Sherlock's interactions with society is one of the most compelling part of this drama.
B00E0SX118|5.0|The kids loved it, as well as us adults, so I knew I had just had to own it for ourselves. Great movie on family night!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I like that the inside compartments are adjustable. The backpack needs to be a little bigger or have a  roomy compartment for non-camera supplies (light jacket and umbrella for example).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love to hate this game .... ;-)  Very addicting and entertaining game. Frustrating at times, especially when you get stuck on a level for a while . But still can't put it down.  Love it!!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a great game to play if you are a type of person that likes to upgrade you game
B005H0IW6W|5.0|What a wonderful guy. hIS MUSIC IS SO SOFT AND COMFORTING. HE'S AN OLD SOUL OF MUSIC. easy listening too
0385508417|5.0|GREAT read!! I am surprise  at all the negative comments I thought this was good and different...I really enjoyed it I love books with different storylines and this one had it!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the puzzles and the challenge. You don't HAVE to spend any money. Of course it's designed to try to sell you something and convince you to buy boosters and such. But if you have the patience, you don't need them. And if I ever do have to wait for tickets to the next levels, I just replay old games to bring up the star points while I wait. I play this at work while I hold the baby. (I have to hold her upright bc of reflux) so when my eyes are tired of reading, I can relax and still keep my mind engaged.
0316322407|5.0|I greatly enjoyed reading the story behind the public figure we have come to know and the opportunity to learn more about the culture in Pakistan and about the beautiful valley of SWAT.  Reading it brought to mind accounts I have read about the launch of the cultural revolution in China and the human dilemma of choosing whether to remain silent or to give voice to wrongs that happen when strong/violent leaders start shifting one's country toward intolerance.  I hope that one day Malala will be able to return to her country and help to expand education for girls and those in poverty.
B003RT0NK8|4.0|Very entertaining and suspensful with a few unexpected twists. The CG scenes were very realistic and HD quality was outstanding.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Pros: The bag is light, spacious, and durable. It is very water resistant and the wide range of pockets is awesome. The laptop slot comfortable fits my 17&#34; laptop.<br /><br />Cons: The seem along the bottom of the back of the bag has started to fray. Purely cosmetic but annoying none the less. Also after about 4 months of heavy, everyday use the seem at the bottom of the side pocket split. Warranty claim was beyond easy; after emailing Thule I got a reply in under an hour. Best customer service I have ever worked with.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|The songs grow on you and i love the piano playing, it's very relaxing to listen too.<br />I do listen to it every day when I am in my car. I especially like the song &#34;If I could Go Back Home&#34;
B003G4W49C|5.0|A little different than the movie, as in more harsh and life-applicable. A classic read that. I give my recommendation.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Enjoyable and motivational - a must read! A great story carrying a meaningful message for anyone interested in running (or who wants to get into it)
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I wanted to watch a &#34;feel good&#34; movie while my children were napping. I thought this was going to be along the lines of &#34;Bridesmaids&#34; - funny with potty humor. Well, perhaps a little potty humor (let's face it, they're pregnant) but no vulgarity. I was pleasantly surprised at how funny and spot on this movie is. It made me laugh out loud at the reality of pregnancy, the humor of the dads and then cry at the sorrow and joy that this movie reveals through these women. I think it's actually good enough to show to my husband, and I expect him to enjoy it too.
B004Q3SGWG|3.0|Good movie. It kind of dragged on but all in all it was an okay movie. It wouldn't be one I would buy nesscicarly but I would watch it again at least one more time.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Had fun it's much better than castleville.  I will play this version much more.  I would ask my friends to play also.

1452101248|5.0|Beautiful photos.  Good results from recipes.  Nice to handle. This is the second Ottolenghi book we have purchased and loved both.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played Castleville on Facebook and am loving this game on my Kindle. Game moves along quickly and goals/missions are attainable within a reasonable amount of time. Thank you Zynga for this application. If anyone is interested in this game, I say download it and give I it a whirl...you will be happy you did (except when you.realize how much time playing, .lol.... believe me, time just flies by).
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My 5 year old  Great Grandson will sit for Hours and play this game. The only thing he wants to go to the next level and I will not pay for it.So if they are happy with the first level it is ok.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I loved the original release and I love this one even more!  It's wonderful to see Peter Jackson's total vision when watching the extended edition of this part of the Hobbit Trilogy.  I purchased mine in Blu Ray and it's awesome to watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The new update is so cool.<br />On creative mode is awesome the water bucket and the fire are cool<br />I like it when you can spawn animals.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|I have only a limited knowledge of autism, but as I read this book, I could clearly envision the one individual that I know fairly well with autism.  Brilliant is some areas but completely incapable of understanding and reacting to human emotions.  Of course, this novel is told from the viewpoint of the autistic son.  What touched me the most, however, was the trials, weaknesses, and strengths of the parents.  Clearly, being the parent to a special needs child is not an easy road.  Regardless of effort, mistakes are made and relationships are strained.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|My 7 year old enjoys this game. Reaching next level doesn't' take long. Very easy to play  and very addictive!
B00FX8EY60|2.0|This album is total JUNK. I don't like the direction she is taking her music at all. It is simply boring.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Good reading. I liked that it was a follow-up to his previous work. Could hardly put it down. Will recommend to my friends.
B0092MKFIY|3.0|I like the album but the songs are just not consistent  with one another. Radioactive is the best song hands down.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Vacant pointless tedious. How could this be? I read every Harry Potter - twice - what happened JK? Her next one is quite a bit better.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Loved this book one of the best stories I have read in a while a little bit if mystery and romance.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The story is a good one to be sure, though it has been told many times. How this author tells it, however, is wholly unique and beautiful!  He takes ordinary, inanimate things and gives them life in a way that carves out definite space in one's imagination.  And even in one's soul.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates the exquisite craftsmanship of words.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|This is a good game I like how the background goes with each season but you have to buy certain birds with real money

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great as usual.  I recommend this book. A definite page turner and keeps the reader spellbound with great twists and surprises.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|Mirrors of Albion is a lot like  Mystery Manor. Other than that I like it. It is a bit addictive but  other than that I like it. It's fun .
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I've never reviewed a book before, and I may never again, but this was worth it.  I started reading this series 20 years ago and was honestly afraid that no ending could do it justice, but this did.  I Don't know if I've ever been so satisfied with a series resolution as this.  Truly, we have awakened from the dream, and it was good.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|This will surely be a polarizing volume, since it mostly concentrates on the dark and little known parts of American history, i.e. what you get when you scratch the surface.  For learning about that one use to have to wade through a lot of Howard Zinn, which is good, but  can get a bit tedious.  However, Oliver Stone with the help of Peter Kuznick with a knack for being to the point and entertaining have created one of the best history books I've ever had the please to read.  This book will open up and show you what the real American history is all about.<br /><br />I got the book, which is for detail and backstory, and the DVD which has the most amazing footage hardly seen or talked about on the news.  Cannot recommend these volumes high enough.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great story.  I had gotten it from the library and enjoyed it so much that it was my first purchase when I got a Kindle.  Definitely looking forward to more from this author.
B002I88BK8|2.0|This is one of the very few books I have ever read where I could say that the movie was MUCH better than the book. The movie is great.  The book isn't.  Most books I keep.  This one went straight into the giveaway box as soon as I finished reading it. Warning.  The ending in the book stinks.  Absolutely stinks. It wasn't so much that it was sad, which it was, that it was just plain bad  Left me feeling infuriated at the author for wasting my time. My advice?  Watch the movie and skip the book.
0152465030|5.0|This is a story with a lot of levels. The book is in good condition, with just enough evidence of age to make it charming.
0316322407|5.0|Heartfelt reading.  I was interested in reading this autobiography.  Malala is a brave young lady and she presents herself as a role model not only for Muslim young women but for all young women everywhere.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was a fantastic book. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoy some history, love story, espionage and life during World War 2. Fast reading and very enjoyable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive and very hard to put down took a while to finally download the game but when I did I couldn't put it down
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I am a little surprised I like this game a I generally don't. That said, there are things that I do find very annoying - though I am not the only one to point these out. For instance, it takes forever to earn crowns, some items you craft take way to long (unless you use said crowns,) and the constant space limit walls are a huge pain(the material cost to make the upgrade is outlandish and the crown cost is ok, but you need crowns in order to build the buildings to make the materials anyway at some point in your journey so you'd be spending crowns twice if you went that route.)<br /><br />If you are just looking for a game to push a few buttons here and there every so often and let it live, build, and breath then this game could be fun for you. If you are looking for something with instant gratification and lots of quick play and the like, you may be disappointed with this one.

B00006IR5S|5.0|Again, John Williams - who scored 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' - returns to bring us a great score for the next chapter in the adventures of the boy wizard & his friends at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. This time, the score contains a lot of the original themes from the first film, but also includes a substantial amount of new material.<br /><br />The opening track, 'Prologue: Book II & Escape from the Dursleys', is music of the first kind, focusing largely on Harry's & Hedwig's themes as Harry, locked in his room to be kept away from his arrogant uncle, aunt & cousin, soon finds himself at the mercy of Dobby the house elf, then escapes with help from Ron in a flying car as his obnoxious uncle tries to keep him from doing so, and ends up falling headfirst into a bush. 'The Chamber of Secrets' is a much more bombastic piece featuring significant influence of brass & percussion, while 'Gilderoy Lockhart' has a melody & pace very similar to that of another Williams recording, 'No Ticket', from 'Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade' (this one is heard as Indiana Jones punches out S.S. Col. Vogel, who had been trying to arrest his father on the zeppelin). People familiar with Williams' music will likely recognize the similarity. 'Knockturn Alley' is a track featuring a lively flute melody; it appears in the Wii Lego Harry Potter video games in more than one place. 'Moaning Myrtle' is a very mysterious-sounding melody, heard as the ghost of the title name appears in a Hogwarts' lavatory. 'Dueling the Basilisk' is a bellicose piece of heavy brass & percussion as Harry duels the snake-like monster. 'Reunion of Friends' relies heavily again on the existing themes of Harry, Ron & Hermione, as the 3 classmates conclude another year at Hogwarts. 'Harry's Wondrous World', the end title track heard as the end credits roll, incorporates both new & old themes heard in the film - as was Williams' style with the 'Star Wars' and 'Indiana Jones' scores - into the score's final track.<br /><br />Liner notes are short but include a track listing and a little commentary from director Chris Columbus. This score is one of my favorite Harry Potter scores. Well worth it for any fan of the series or of John Williams' music.ore's final track.<br /><br />Liner notes are short but include a track listing and a little commentary from director Chris Columbus.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Tell me, can anyone say they don't like facebook?  Aside from the upgrades that change all of your settings so that you have to reset them, I thoroughly love Facebook.  I have made unbelievable family connections, I have made great friends even though we may never meet in person, and I have reconnected with folks from my school days.<br /><br />Of course, I am a game addict too.  I enjoy many of the games and being able to play these games with my friends and family makes it all the more sweeter.<br /><br />I would recommend Facebook to anyone as they will be just as happy as I am.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. it is very entertaining,  fun for everyone even my grand kids play. warning may become addictive.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|As a fan of horror films, the conversation of &#34;They just don't make scary horror movies anymore,&#34; comes up often. This movie is a throwback to when horror movies were scary. It will keep you jumping through the entire run time. It is a modern classic of horror, that should be on a top ten list of best horror films.
006228648X|5.0|I loved this book, not at first..... but after I thought about it and let it simmer. Everything started to make sense. This book was not purely written to entertain. This is where many people are having issues with the ending. It was written to make you  think, to possibly look inside your self. This series explains many of lifes subjective concepts in a manner that makes sense to many readers.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I loved this moive when I saw it in high school, so exctied it's on blu ray so I can share it with my kids now.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It has everything I need in an easy to use package.  I highly recommend for any and all calculating purposes!
B00D2JDNQ4|3.0|After reading We Need New Names, by NoViolet Bulawayo and A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki, I expected something stunning by Eleanor Catton, winner of the Booker Prize 2013. And stunning it is...but not the way I hoped for.<br />Her technical, virtuoso ability is extraordinary. The structure of the text, reminiscent of Nabokov´s Ada with its diminishing chapters, the tale told from the Rashomon-like prespective of the twelve participants, reenforced by the viewpoint of each, and her use of 19th century novel format is interesting, as is the astrological chart to organize the text. But what does each technique really add to the story? It  actually makes the book too long and tedious, meandering and drawn out. I felt I was in the hands of a superb formalist, who did not have much of a content. I found myself in the universe of a master puzzle maker, who had assembled thousands of pieces, that, when pieced together, did not portray a riveting panorama. Cui bono?<br />The story per se is a whodunnit. We finally figure it out (if we hang in there for the duration, alas). But it does appear that we are subjected to a formalistic mania, and that it is paramount in the telling of the tale, which in contrast, is not much.<br />The characters are wooden, elusive, and stereotypical, especially the two luminaries, Anna Wetherell and Emery Staines. The tale makes you wonder rather often, if our main protagonists are not both weak-minded. They, and the other actors, do not achieve the status of memorable characters that pique your interest or curiosity.<br />The language is intentionally 19th century novelistic, with words such as &#34;gaol&#34;,  &#34;euchred&#34; or &#34;whoring&#34;, as is the introductory description in each chapter heading. But what does it contribute to the text?<br />In novels such as Joyce´s Ulysses, you understand how the form and structure are indissolubly linked to the content, and make the content what it is. So it is when you read Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf. It is more than justified, and the innovation is revealing, showing us a new way to see the world, to understand human complexity. In The Death of Artemio Cruz, another milimetrically organized novel, you deduce that the form illuminates the reality of the Mexico Carlos Fuentes depicts, and offers a profound commentary regarding the country and  protagonists such as his Artemio Cruz. The same is true of Mario Vargas Llosa´s volumetric Conversation in the Cathedral, an interpretation of Manuel Odría´s appalling dictatorship through the filter of Zavalita, whose anti-Bildungsroman the novel becomes. In Jonathan Littell´s The Kindly Ones, another ponderously extensive novel, it is easier to excuse why the text is so long and complex, because of what the author is able to elucidate and reevaluate regarding the Holocaust. Hilary Mantel´s Bring Up the Bodies is a brilliant tour-de-force which illuminates the personality of Thomas Cromwell, and life and times in the England of Henry VIII. But in the case of The Luminaries, I am perplexed, and conclude the author sacrificed sense for the sake of  rigid formalistic prescription.<br />I did find a chapter where I felt the joy that always entices me into reading, but two-thirds  of the way into the book. But the joy was not repeated after that.

B009UX2YAC|1.0|I had heard about this game from many friends at which they all have great, positive reviews. I even played it many times on their phones, so I downloaded the app.at first or worked fine but a few months into it, the app store working.when the Halloween update came out shows the pictures for new Orleans bus is was stuck on Beijing. I had to reload the app which deleted all of my previous data, including buying coco the mime. Very dissatisfied fix the bugs!!!
B00E1SM5UA|2.0|Al DiMeola could have done better with these songs. He is a brilliant guitarist but this  disc has too much of a Michael Hedges kind of vibe to it. Some of the songs are barely recognizable and the rest have a tendency to sound alike. No real highlights here and not even a hint of the chops he is notorious for. This would have benefitted from appearances by some of the stellar people he is usually associated with and a producer with the ability to say NO.

B008645YXA|5.0|I have never heard a bad Alice cooper disc! This was his first solo effort after leaving the original lineup and his band is comprised of the cream of the crop of working studio musicians at the time. His lyrical strength is still displayed and the musical still packs the punch and diversity of the original A.C lineup. The production and recording are both crisp--providing a highly listenable disc that still sounds as relevant as it did when it was released. A must have for your Alice Cooper collection.

B00F8OV4HQ|5.0|This is a superb box of Ry Cooder's first eleven studio albums (excluding the film soundtracks). As there isn't a tracklisting, I've pasted one at the end of this review It is a fantastic body of work from one of the finest guitarists and musicians of the last 40 years. They don't need individual reviews from me, but I will say that I first came across Ry Cooder with Bop Till You Drop in 1979 and have been a fan ever since. I bought these individually either on vinyl or CD and have never regretted a single penny spent on any of them (although I think BTYD remains my overall favourite). The guitar work is simply magical. It is smooth, beautiful, unflashy and full of sincerity, and played with such skill that it sounds easy - until you try to do it yourself. The bands he plays with and the production are all excellent and there is a wealth of great stuff here.<br /><br />Ry Cooder is a true artist who has made plenty of really fine and immensely enjoyable albums, and this box gives you some of the best of them. Each disc is in a cardboard reproduction of the original sleeve and there are full track lists on the back of the box. The absence of the score to Paris, Texas in particular is a loss, but at this price for a nicely-packaged set of 11 discs I'm not going to carp.<br /><br />Don't hesitate - this is a gem of a box.<br /><br />The Albums:<br />1.

B00169N0BK|5.0|Easy to use & it makes a difference.<br />The ColorMunki Photo is easy to use, right out of the box.  It walks you through calibrating your monitor & your printer.<br />I am no longer wasting good photo paper and ink/dye because of discrepancies between my old MacBook (2007) and my new Canon printer.  After a thorough calibration my system is more WYSIWIG when printing high quality images.<br />It also made quick and easy work of calibrating a new monitor on our other computer. I am very pleased and I can't get over how much time I wasted, and supplies sent to the bin, before this handy device entered my life.<br /><br />My only suggestion is that you make sure you are not on the verge of needing new ink cartridges as the pages you have to print are not light on the ink.
B00BEIYL6G|4.0|I'm surprised I liked JOBS as much as I did, considering that the reviews surrounding the film were mediocre at best, not to mention that Ashton Kutcher is one of my least favourite actors EVER. Much to my surprise, Kutcher was actually astonishingly good in the title role.<br /><br />Take him out, and you are left with a limp, unfocused, poorly paced, and incredibly boring biopic. Put him back in, and you are still left with the above, but with a daring and riveting performance at its centre.<br /><br />Now, this is isn't saying much, but this is Kutcher's best performance by about 300%. He absolutely *nails* Steve Jobs's mannerisms - his stooped walk, the way he held his hands in front of him, the way he pursed his lips, etc. He holds surprising gravitas and charisma, and holds up excellently in scenery-chewing moments. The scenes where he brutally rejects the woman he impregnated, and gives Bill Gates a piece of his mind (\\"And I will make sure you NEVER earn a dollar again, that I don't get 90 cents from!\\") show a different, extremely competent side of the actor. The material surrounding him might be rote and unfeeling, but Kutcher has steel in his gaze and power in his presence.<br /><br />It's a pity then, that JOBS is unfocused in it's storytelling, in need of a damn good edit, uninformative, and rather dull. No really, at times this was one of the most boring films I've ever seen. The scene where Wozniak leaves Apple should have been emotional and heartrending, but nearly put me to sleep. I would rather have had more fun reading up on infections of the large intestine.<br /><br />Jobs had scenes that had no impact whatsoever on the film - extraneous, useless scenes that do nothing that bore the audience. 90% of the movie are actors talking quietly (or loudly) to each-other - just talking. Talking WELL, yes, but still talking. And lastly, JOBS is incredibly uninformative. We get nothing about WHY Apple became big, how it sustained losses through tough times, really WHY Steve Jobs was fired, subsequently rehired, and how Apple recovered.<br /><br />JOBS is not without it's positives, however. The first I went over above - the performance of Ashton Kutcher. The rest of the cast is rather excellent as well. Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak is enjoyable, and JK Simmons chews scenery as Arthur Rock. The costumes and wigs are excellent. The period design is incredible - from the terrible hairdos to the tacky suits to the giant computers. I never felt that I was anywhere else but in the 70's and 80's. Kudos to the the production designer.<br /><br />In conclusion, I don't think Steve Jobs would have been very happy with JOBS. It's not daring enough. It never strives for something edgy or dangerous. It is content to roll along at documentary pace, with poor editing and dull pacing.<br /><br />But I still think you should see this movie. See it for an extraordinary performance from Ashton Kutcher, a fine cast, and excellent production values. See it to remember a great man. A difficult man; a daring, edgy, cruel, prickly, brilliant man: Steve Jobs. 3.5/5 Stars, rounded up to 4.<br /><br />Here's to the Crazy Ones.<br /><br />PS: Remember that the like/dislike buttons are not for saying whether you agree or disagree with the reviewer, but whether the review helped you make a decision to use the product or not.

0385528787|5.0|MaddAddam provides explanations to previously unknown stories of the main characters as well as introducing us to the Crackers and other animal creatures more. This third book in the trilogy is much more passive and discursive in nature and instead of relying on action to create drama, the drama is contained in the past before the flood.<br /><br />Now, what intrigues me more than anything else is the possibility that this isn't the end of the story. Certainly there is more in store from Atwood about this world of cross-breeding between humans and human hybrids?  Only time will tell.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great film, Amazon quality is exceptional, ease of use and great customer service. I had a small, immediately resolved issue and I appreciate the response and resolution!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Not only is this book a fun read, it also has a ton of fun history to reminisce about. I loved the characters and am happy to say they were interesting and easy to care about. The events of the book kept me going from chapter to chapter.
B005VMSATA|3.0|its a good action thriller id guess you could call it ryan reynolds is a good actor with lots to learn he wasnt my first choice in the lead role but he barely pulls it off and doesnt hurt the movie he needs a lil bit more believability
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I love this author's writing.  I plan to get more of his works.  That is the end of my review, okay?
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I loved The Selection. Like I wrote in my other review, it was playful and fun, like a modern fairy tale that left me wanting more. As a result, I ripped out my kindle upon finishing Selection and immediately bought and devoured Elite in anticipation.<br /><br />Must say, though, my reaction was kinda &#34;Enh.&#34; America Singer has started to shape her personality to fit the competitive environment, and instead of seeing that fierce, Katniss Everdeen-like persona, all I can feel now is her getting shallower. America has become annoyingly fickle about her love interests, so much that you just want to shake her repeatedly until she  makes up her mind. And unlike most female protagonists in dystopian YA novels, she really isn't doing any fighting or anything really substantial to help her surroundings. Weirdly enough, I felt she was more outspoken in the first book, but she doesn't get acknowledged for it until here. (*QUICK MINOR SPOILER HERE* I did respect her greatly for how she tried to defend Marlee, though.  That was the highlight of the whole book.)<br /><br />This is a bit off-topic, but I also found the title rather boring. Did anyone else feel the ordinance of it? It has no mystery to it whatsoever. For me personally, part of the fun of waiting for books to come out is the release of the title and book cover. The title &#34;Elite&#34; sparks no curiosity at ALL. Especially because it has already been stated that the top ten(six) would be called The Elite. How mysterious of Ms. Cass to tell name the next book Elite.<br /><br />The Elite definitely wasn't as delightful as The Selection. After reading The Selection, I had fallen completely in love with Illea and was desperate to live in that world again as soon as possible. Thus I picked up Elite. But after I finished Elite, I wasn't quite as addicted to the series anymore. That was a rather disappointing revelation. So all I can say is... brace yourself, fans of The Selection. The Elite isn't a guaranteed great addition to the series. If you're a particularly strong supporter of America S., write your own sequel. The Elite may not provide you with all the answers you are looking for.eat addition to the series. If you're a particularly strong supporter of America S., write your own sequel.

B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Was reading this for my black women writers class.<br />I laughed, cried. It warmed me up because I identify with the protagonist. Now I'm going to read the other books by this author. I loved it.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|Best to listen from beginning to end to hear the story as it plays out. One of the best albums by 30 Seconds to Mars to date.
B000AQJPQE|3.0|This was in the lamp shade department, so in my haste didn't realize it is an actual light itself. For some reason I assumed it was a very cool shade for a ceiling light. Also it's a bit noisy when it's turned on.<br />However, it's still a great addition to a child's room, and I'd still have purchased it but without the expectation for it's assumed function.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|Have listened to this CD every day since purchased. Excellent soundtrack.  Enjoying listening to on a daily basis. Bonus is the audio rip so I didn't have to do it myself.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|I am a huge Korn fan from the beginning, and I can say that this is one of the best Korn albums for sure.<br />Pretty much all the songs are good.<br />I can listen to the whole album straight-through, with only skipping 1 or 2 songs I don’t like that much.<br />That is commendable, given that I am not even a dub-step fan, and that even with the classic Korn albums like “Life is Peachy”, I cannot listen to the whole album straight-through.<br /><br />I think it is amazing that they were able to integrate dub-step so seamlessly with their own style.<br />The album still sounds like Korn.<br />No wonder Revolver Magazine gave them Album of the Year in that year.<br /><br />I think most the haters are just people that don’t like change and progression in their personal lives, nor in their music.<br />How boring would it be if Korn put out albums that have the same sound as their earlier successful albums?
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|My favorite soundtrack. Beautiful music from an excellent film. Touches the heart and soul is so many ways. Great back story in the liner notes.
0802798225|5.0|If you are into high school good girl bad boy type of thing you will love this book! So hard to put down when start reading. I would recommend this book to all of my friends!
031624662X|2.0|I am going to have to go against the consensus on this one and say that I found this book to be very disappointing.  The prose and stream-of-consciousness writing style was very hard to follow, the story dragged and dragged for dozens of pages, and out of all the characters (including the main character) the only one that was likeable in my opinion was Lt. Awn.  I made it about half way through before giving up.  Based on all the reviews I have read, I really cannot reconcile how this has gotten so many 5 star reviews and so much hype on sites like io9.<br /><br />The book is written in the 1st person perspective of a fragment of a fragment of a shipmind AI inhabiting the body of a \\"corpse soldier\\" (similar to the thrall technology in Neal Asher's Polity books).  The perspective is constantly changing between the corpse-soldier fragment, a higher order fragment, and the shipmind itself and is very difficult to follow.  Another REALLY annoying idea is that the fragment does not distinguish between genders (refers to everyone as her), but other characters do use gender pronouns, and the kicker is the fragment tries to use them when speaking to normal humans.  Trying to keep all this straight is really more work than I'm willing to put into a book like this, especially when none of the characters are described any any sort of detail.<br /><br />I also didn't find the story very interesting, it spends way too filling in seemingly uninteresting background information and not enough time explaining the actual plot, when it does, the continuous perspective shifts and misuses of gender pronouns makes it all the more difficult to follow.  Also it seemed to me like there were some major editing errors, because even despite sorting this all out, some paragraphs just flat out didn't make sense.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The story being told in the stream-of-consciousness style is just way to hard to follow in my opinion and not worth the payoff. The deliberate misuse of gender pronouns makes it difficult to read, and the story isn't very enjoyable, at least in the couple hundred pages I made it through. I have read many other stories told believably from the perspective of an AI or a fragment thereof (\\"Alone\\" by Robert Reed comes to mind) that were much easier to follow and much more enjoyable.  I don't think I am going to be able to force myself to finish this one, it is going to the used book store.
B00B5HQL50|1.0|If you're inclined to watch this movie, PLEASE go to the Amazon site for it and read the one-star reviews.  This movie was awful.  In so many ways, it was awful.  It wasn't stylish, the dialog was terrible, the action sequences were boring (yes, boring) and the characters unbelieveable.  I loved Craig in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace was OK but this movie was awful.  The overriding  theme was noise and more noise.  Don't bother with this one.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I think it is OK it's that I like subway suffers better because it dose<br /> not glitch unlike minion rush

B00FLDG5BE|5.0|My son joined me for a trip to New York to experience the Guitar Festival first hand. We sat on the side of the Garden near Stage Right on Friday night, and couldn't believe our good fortune as we enjoyed over 5 hours of stellar performances. Saturday night we were down on the floor about 10 rows out from Stage Left. Two unique perspectives that led to a wonderful 11 hours of celebratory music on both nights.<br />We have been looking forward to this Blu-ray coming out since we walked back to our hotel on Friday night, knowing that this would be filmed and turned into a world-class Blu-ray. Well, it was worth the wait, to say the least. The editing is superb, with very little distraction from the songs and the performances. Plenty of great shots to allow us to witness the virtuoso playing of the assembled throng of musical geniuses also. The selection of songs was better than we hoped for. The high points of each night were mostly captured, (how do you edit 11 hours of music down to 3-4 hours when the talent is this epic, and the performances are this brilliant?) and while some will quibble with the choices, I think the blu-ray captures the essence of what we experienced on those two magical nights at the Garden. It was a concert for the ages. The highlights are many, but pay close attention to Time is Tight, Cry, Don't Let Me Down, Damn Right, I've Got the Blues, on the first night, incredible! On the second night, highlights were Change It, The Needle and the Damage Done, Tumbling Dice, When My Train Pulls In, Key To the Highway, and Clapton's closing suite.  I cannot wait for 2016! If you are a fan of the blues, or a fan of the axe, you need to own this blu-ray!
B00FITRTQ6|5.0|This is a terrific read a mystery with so much depth so well written can't wait for the next book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Get ready to be reeled in, hook, line and sinker. One of the best games ever. If you are willing to hang in there between level 36 and wait out the 24 hours for the next quest for 3 days, you don't have to pay a dime and you can continue for the next 36? Only on level 43 but think that's how it works. Definitely recommend this game!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Love it!  Sexxx Dreams, ARTPOP, Gypsy, Dope are my favorite tracks.  Don't understand some of the negativity around this album.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just think the plot for this story is awesome. This is my second time reading it as I wanted to recap before the movie. It's better than part 1 of the series. I highly recommend reading it.
B0081336FO|5.0|We loved the nuances of the relationship between Sherlock and Watson, the moments of true camaraderie against the usual disdain and disbelief.  Great stuff.
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|Science fiction is supposed to make us think. &#34;Into Darkness&#34; doesn't deliver. The original series explored ideas like love, humanity, intelligence, the Gods. I didn't get anything like that out of this movie. To be honest, &#34;Southpark&#34; and &#34;Idiocracy&#34; made me think more. I think the creators wanted to get some more mileage out of the epic characters from the original series. That is probably the only redeeming part of the movie and worth 2 stars. Still, the character exploration is mostly two dimensional. The original Captain Kirk was the product of advanced training and years of study, hard work and creative thinking. He was the best of the best, culled out of the Federation Academy. The new Kirk doesn't even want to join the Federation. Then, somehow, he just happens to save the world again and again and we never really find out why he is so great. I guess he was just born great. Scotty is an alcoholic genius who spends the movie running away from some unseen foe while saving Kirk and the gang. Uhura has a crush on Spock whatever that is supposed to mean. They never really explore the idea further. Essentially, &#34;Into Darkness&#34; is a two dimensional action flick. Terrorists bomb London, we question the morality of using a secret superweapon (drone) to kill people on other planets (sound familiar?) You get the picture. The movie is okay, but don't expect very much in the way of high standards. It is the Brittany Spears version of Star Trek
B00FHATBGW|5.0|This was an awesome game. I was so into the game that there was a part that got me. I wasn't expecting it to jump out like it did. Very good graphics and story line. Big Fish needs to make more of these kind of games.
B00000J2PH|5.0|It is an oldie but goodie and I sing along with it daily.  thanks for making that possible. I love Carol King!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The best 3D movie ever! We just purchased a 60 inch 3D TV. Our 3D collection wouldn't be complete without this movie.
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|I'm the type of collector who keeps his pieces in mint condition including the package they come in however this particular figurine was so incredibly awesome that I couldn't take it anymore. I took him out the box and placed him right on top of my computer desk. The details are mind blowing, the colors are nice and vibrant, and in my honest opinion;  the price is highway robbery(For the seller). If the price was double of what it is now I still wouldn't hesitate to buy this piece.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie! I enjoyed the Las Vegas scenes. It kept you guessing. A great cast of new and veteran talent
0007466064|5.0|I don't know about this book. I bought it for my nephew, he loves the series and wanted the last book in this series.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game. I found it on the schoolbus and fell in love with it. Get this app if you want a fun time.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game I am addicted to it. This game keeps you wanting g to go further. I would recommend!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a dramatic departure from the typical Grisham legal drama.  Frankly I thought it was better than many of his other books.  The characters were clever and well-written.  The whole concept was far afield from mainline detective stories.  The hero wins in the end but you wonder if his win was legitimate?
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The 5 ft USB cable that came with a previous purchase of the Kindle PowerFast International Charging Kit, I decided I must add this cables (got 5) to my travel kit.  Well made and no issues seen.
0385743564|4.0|Sanderson has been one of my favorite writers of epic fantasy for some time, so I was excited to give this a try, as I had not read anything from him geared towards a younger audience. Steelheart is a sound addition to the novel. It benefits from Sanderson's excellent writing. The characters are multidimensional and engaging, the world is enthralling. I look forward to reading more.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Saw this movie in 3D on the big screen and I can't express enough how superb the 3D effects and sounds were.  Have not opened the case to watch on my 80&#34; LCD TV yet but I can bet it is going to be just a good. One of the best Star Trek movies made to-date.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We started playing right away and it was really fun!  It is challenging for every age.  Would recommend as a gift for 10 and up.
B006OFN0SE|1.0|A horrible movie, a huge disappointment considering it's Eastwood directing and DiCaprio in the lead role.  Most egregious is the liberties the film takes with guessing Hoover's psychosexual history, portraying him as a homosexual who didn't let himself know he was a homosexual.  No one really knows what Hoover was.  But many men of his age and many still today that are full-on heterosexual choose not to marry for a variety of reasons.  Portraying Hoover so without evidence and in a way he would likely find abhorrent seems like a hatchet job, surprising for Eastwood, who is rather conservative, to say the least.  Neither is DiCaprio on his game.  The film has a cheesy, soap-operatic texture.<br /><br />I bought it, hated the movie, and gave it away.<br /><br />Don't confuse this bio-pic with the most excellent \\"The Aviator\\" with DiCaprio and directed by Scorcese.  What a difference a director makes.  And a script.  Buy \\"The Aviator,\\" not this stinker.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use it for to do lists, type up things to be emailed when I don't have a wireless connection, type and save all my medical information and can lock certain lists, instead of the entire app. Highly recommend, can even be used as a locked journal.

0071771263|5.0|This book is from the makers of the TOEFL test, very helpfull, I should have it a long time ago. The two books from ETS Official TOEFL IBT  tests and The official Guide to the TOEFL test are the best books for preparation for TOEFL  Test. I suggest them to everyone who will take the TOEFL.
B00005JGAB|5.0|I couldn't pass up an offer of purchasing the mp3 and getting a CD for an ideal price. I now have cool tunes on my iPhone5 and a CD for my vehicle's old player. We're a happy family!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it is literary fiction that keeps you turning the pages to see what happens next to the foster child in Nazi Germany. The characters stay with you, and you really care about their fates. I think this is the first book I've ever read that made me understand what it might have been like to have been a regular citizen of Germany during WWII.  Even if you aren't interested in the historical aspect, it is just a good story.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|Better than expected. I think Channing Tatum is a D-Bag but he did quite well in this movie. Its worth renting, not buying.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I really like this little dongle. I got this as soon as it came out so it was a no brainer with 3 months free netflix. I was gonna renew my xbox live gold, which i only  use for Netflix now, but this was a better deal. I have mainly used this with netflix and it works great with my iphone. I have also used my laptop and chrome browser to stream some shows that my dvr skipped. Playback isn't as smooth that way due to limitation of my laptop and wifi connection but it was in HD and definitely watchable. I'm looking forward to more apps as it seems a lot of stuff is in development. I think this is a way better deal than a roku or apple tv. The other thing is this is so portable from one tv to another in my house.
B00BE5U7P8|5.0|Great starter for those who need to learn fast! Though it leaves some questions unanswered, I at least then knew what questions to ask and found help online.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another good page turner by one of the greatest teller of yawns.  Like most of his books, this one was tough to put down.
B00FHB7398|5.0|Big Fish Games rarely disappoints, but this fan surpassed my high expectations! The puzzles are challenging, the hidden object portions make sense, and the storyline is a tribute to entomology. Add to is all, the live action interaction is so vivid, it compelled me to stream this game from my Kindle Fire (amazing experience in itself) to my flat screen. Get this game if you enjoy adventure, challenging puzzles wrapped up with HOG.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I have never cared for movies dealing with space, but when Avatar came out I said wait a minute... it's got romance and a story behind it. A good story helps and one man who starts out as someone working for someone who has no compassion for the tree people and turns around and saves them, a great story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game but some of the clues make no sense. A help option would be great.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I used to think these movies were just for kids... I have changed my mind over the yrs. I Never cared for Ray Romano in every body loves Raymond but his voice is great for Manny.
B00514HDNW|4.0|As per usual..the book is always always better than the movie.<br />Chose this one to see if that was  different...not so...book was much much better
B000EF5NAS|5.0|This is another movie I have watched over and over, the right people the right script, can't ask for any thing better.It's another movie that ranks up there as one of the best.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This is so much fun. You can feed, pet, play, take it to the bathroom, and put it asleep. Please get this game I swear you will like it. You can even buy him accessories and change the style of his rooms. THE BEST EVER!!!

B000OVLINI|5.0|Very well written, excellent plot and engaging from start to finish. I will buy this as a hardcover for my friend's birthday!
B0002DB52M|5.0|Long film, but it doesn't matter.<br /><br />3 hours of pure genius, wrapped into a film such as this...<br /><br />This film explores the saying &#34;opportunity knocks&#34;.  Nicole Kidman's character &#34;Grace&#34; brings a dark secret to a depressing setting we call &#34;Dogville&#34;.<br /><br />Let me say this... I was certainly blown away by the end, and the acting is superb.<br /><br />5 star rating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game and the app works great. I'm really enjoying it and glad they only give 5 lives at a time. I'd never get anything done if there were more!
B00F2362IE|2.0|Mixed bag.  Game is entertaining when it works.  I am deleting it cause it makes my son upset cause the load time is over 20 seconds, it freezes or gets choppy and then freezes which requires a hard reset, more than half the time after you complete a &#34;Turtle time&#34; sequence the program crashes.<br /><br />I am not sure if it is cause I am running an original Kindle Fire or I am just unlucky.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, storyline and characters. . I saw the movie before I read the book, and I have to say the book is so much better. I am a fan.
B0035YDM4Y|4.0|I first bought this book a few months ago on Kindle. I read the first chapter and gave up. I just could not read a book about special operations so filled with Jesus and Bush loving dribble. I also got dishearted when I read some of the reviewes.<br /><br />A week ago I got interessed again in this book because of the good reviwes the movie got, and also because of what I had read about 'Op. Red Wings'.<br /><br />This time I could not put the book away. The Jesus talk was still there, but as the book progressed I found it to be honest and not just some dripple from a corny American. The storytelling is good and the reader gets a good feel for what it is like to be a part of such a close knit team. The story of Markus's survival after the mission is astounding, and It warmed my heart to read about the Afgans who put them selves in harms way to save his life and about the support his family got when he was MIA.<br /><br />So after my initiall doubts this book ended up being one of the best spec ops recollections I have read and I reccomend this book to everyone interessed in the spec ops community, and the unique bonds between men at arms.<br /><br />(Should be noted that I come from a community that is not very religious, and religious matters are very private, so perhaps tha varped my view)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. Plug in my headphones and fall soundly asleep. The sounds are very relaxing. If you need sounds to fall asleep this app is great.
B003GK2216|4.0|Some research went into this book but it's not a learned tome.  It's not in-depth - don't expect the detail you get from Simon Sebag Montefiori or Richard Massey. it's a kind of updated Anya Seton story.  It's a great page-turning Ken Follett novel complete with pulse-racing violence. corruption, glinting pubic hairs and all.  it does lend some insight into medieval life but the basic formula is not dependent on period. Needless to say, like any Ken Follett novel, its hard to put down.  Don't expect a highbrow read  If you have any inkling of medieval life, you'll know about the context.  It's worth reading as a novel anyway
0141394811|5.0|Well writen, cant put it out of my hands. Morrissey can tell a story and not only in songs. a must-buy for the fans
0142501123|1.0|Love this product. I cannot tell you what a great book this is and my daughter loves it along with her daycare provider. I purchase a lot of stuff for daycare from Amazon. However, I can purchase this book for way cheaper price at Barnes and nobles by directly going into the store. It doesn't make sense to me to pay shipping of $3.99 which adds to the cost of book and wait few days to receive the book. I will be looking at other stores for items that I regularly used to purchase from Amazon just because of cost value associated with it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is the best book ever!!!!!!! This is almost better than the Harry potter series. I like how the books start where it ends!!!!!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great time killer. Takes a while to upgrade guns, and you have to spend actual money to get some of them. Gets a little choppy sometimes (may be my Kindle fire, 1st gen). Overall a great free game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the price you cannot beat this thing. Just the ability to play Youtube and Netflix is worth it for me, especially with kids. Hopefully they continue to add more supported apps to make it even more valuable.
B00005JL96|5.0|My granddaughter and I have watched this movie many times.  It never gets old.  It's cute and funny and has a moral to the<br />story about family.  We love it.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|A true story well told.  Helen Hunt is a fine actress and a beautiful woman!  John Hawkes handled a difficult role very well.
B0012GMW7A|4.0|love anything by leonard cohen- always a unique meaning or story in his lyrics. if you like any of his songs you will like this.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Love it great series!!!! Looking forward to many more to come. Great packing came very quickly. No just wasting words to make it to the end
B000JMKTLO|2.0|This book was good but too dark in my opinion. I prefer Gone Girl... it kept me interested the entire time
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this book a lot I thought that Susan did a really nice job of putting this together. I had no idea of how this would be put together, but she did a nice job. I am excited about the next movie and I am excited for Divergent to come out! It's is so much better than the hunger games!
B001BANK32|5.0|No one writes horror like Stephen King. Creepy imagery, compelling plot. He writes about a man slowly going insane so well you'd almost believe he (Stephen) was the one losing his marbles.
0425263916|5.0|Great Read, I loved the Crossfire Books, could not put it down, If you like Fifty Shades of Gray, You will love this one too
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|good game. just wish it didn't always ask for money<br />I like that your time playing is limited by lives remaining. makes you take a break.
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|This movie will make you laugh out loud if you like physical comedy, and I do. No one did it better than Chaplin and your family will be amazed at how truly funny this movie is.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This is a very chilling and suspenseful crime thriller which keeps you in fully occupied all throughout the story throwing little twists and turns at you keeping you on edge and wanting to find out more.<br /><br />Usually I am not big into crime thrillers too much and lean more towards scifi but this story about a once time killer returning again after a 10 year absence with two detectives trying to solve the crimes had me engrossed in the story.<br /><br />The author has done a good job portraying the characters and I would not be surprised if this was a movie one day.
B001I45UFC|3.0|Some of the pages are missing.  Some of the paragraphs do not line up with the next page.  So that makes it difficult to follow the story line.  Publisher should fix this.
B00136JOF2|5.0|Beautiful all around, a must-have in every home. Very talented artist. Highly recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Phenomenal, setup is a breeze, it does precisely what it says on the 'tin' and I recommend it to absolutely everyone I meet.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved it. It being equality to me. Ender was a fanaminal character he brought the moral and life of the story to it. If you have not read it yet u advise it if you love science fiction.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|this book gave me information that really helped me to better understand several issues that arose and are now history. this young woman is nothing short of miraculous. i only wish there was a way folks in the USA to have knowledge of what is really like to have no opportunity for education and be hungry every day of your life. this should be a mandatory read our President, Senators and Congressmen. an excellent read!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This might be the best game I ever played. The graphics are good and so are the controls that are smoother than a G.I. haircut.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Is  very addictive , love playing it I wish we can get more free lives, but I probably would not get anything done.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|One of the best products I've ever bought on Amazon. Set up was super simple. You must have google play to download the app, so I could not do it from my kindle fire, but I was able to do it on my phone and once it was set up on my phone it allowed me to use my kindle. This is seriously worth the $35 you will spend. Allows you to stream Pandora as well as everything they listed. You can also use your device as usual, accessing web and apps without any disruption to your videos or music.
B00E9P959O|5.0|This is an incredible album.  I remember when I downloaded the original, I wondered if their was a &#34;problem&#34; with the download, because it was a bit &#34;muddled.&#34; Then I read other reviews and realized that it was the mix.  I still loved it, and the mix &#34;grew on me.&#34;  With this new remix, the tracks sound crisper....clearer.  It's the same album, just &#34;cleaned up&#34; a bit!  It was a very well spent 9 bucks in my mind, and the cd came with a cool case with pics...most people spend that much on smokes or booze, but I don't smoke or drink....so boo-yah.
1587143879|5.0|The package arrive in perfect conditions.<br />The product inside it's really good.<br />The books are so good as the Cisco appliances.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Highly addictive and lots of fun to play. I don't know how many hours I have spend playing this simple and fun game.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Beautifully written piece of literature. An incredible read for everyone. Highly recommending; &#34;Magic is in 'you'&#34; and you will discover it through this book.
B00F08ADX6|4.0|I just like to watch it.  Makes a good time waster for the kids when necessary and I am not above playing it either.  Simple jumping game.
B005GI2O3M|1.0|I love Bonnie Tyler, her performances, and her voice is nothing less than special. However this DVD was sent in a format that none of my DVD, CD, or Blue Ray including my new Quad computer will not recognize... What good is it. Up to know I have loved buying DVD performances Via Amazon, no question, however I paid for this with anticipation of hours of enjoyment, what I received was total disappointment. Some one should have posted that it was a odd ball format that can't be fixed. Don't buy for use in America...
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF ALAN BEST. EVRY SONG TAKES YOU BACK TO THE BLUEGRASS ERA, WITHOUT A DOUBT. REALLY GREAT
B00CATSONE|4.0|I loved the book and learning details about a very smart man.<br />Feels was way ahead of his time.awesome book
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|kevin spacey is magnificent and so is Robin Wright. I thought the BBC series would be impossible to better but they've done it<br />with gorgeous sets and costumes and a riveting script.<br />Cant wait for the next season!
B0001Z37HM|4.0|Classic 80's Schwarzenegger with Brigitte Nielsen to boot!  While not technically a sequel to Conan, it feels like one.  I think it is a great party movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! Better than all the other temple-run-ish games I have gotten and it is FREE!! Incredible graphics and lots of locations and adorable minions to choose from. Applause for this app :-)
B00005KB9W|5.0|This was the first reggae album I ever bought back in the day, and it really knocked me out. As many reviewers have said, this is truly one of the best live albums ever recorded. Both the performances and the sound quality are perfect. Pure energy and emotion burst from every song. The audience's enthusiasm also adds a great deal to the overall sound. The female backup singers more than make up for the erstwhile Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.
B004XZR63M|5.0|They told you education is the key to success, and more education brings more success.  Okay, then, why aren't all PhD's millionaires?  Why do A students work for B students, in companies owned by D students?<br /><br />It wasn't a total lie, but there is so much more to it.  Robert Kiyosaki, son of a professional educator, hereafter referred to as &#34;Poor Dad&#34;, just has to teach what they don't teach in schools.  Here is a book which could radically improve the education system, as could Napoleon Hill's THINK AND GROW RICH.  It is short, it is easy reading, and should be required reading for everyone.  Personally, I read it devotionally, in a rotation with Mr. Hill's opus, cited above, and a couple of others.<br /><br />This book has my highest recommendation.
B00A88FLI0|4.0|The only reason I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is that I have a personal bias against &#34;building&#34; kits (that is, kits where you construct a house or a tower or other type of building structure; not against structures that you build, which of course, is all Lego kits). I don't mind buildings, but I find the construction to be relatively simple and unchallenging - there aren't a lot of interesting construction techniques where you are doing angles, hinges, pivots, axles, etc. Plus, once you're done, buildings just kind of sit there. But that being said, my Ninjago fan loves this set.<br /><br />In the meantime, on a more general note: we have tried a lot of different Lego kits (Harry Potter, Lego, Lego City, TMNT) and the Ninjago remain my favorite among the licensed lines. I was actually quite surprised to find differences in the areas that I found them, but they're there.<br /><br />The first area is in instructions. The Ninjago instructions are EXTREMELY clear. It's very clear what parts you need and where they go. Though it's hard to explain, some of the other Lego sets are not quite so clear. My 6-year-old has done over a dozen of these sets alone and he almost never has had to ask for instructions/clarification/fixes. On others, we have had issues with subassemblies attached to the wrong part of the main structure, or I have had to look at the instructions 2-3x to understand for myself how the thing fits together.<br /><br />The second area is in durability of structure. One challenge with the licensed Lego kits is &#34;after the kid has built it, then what?&#34; If your child is willing, you can take it apart and build it again (sometimes I can convince mine to, though rarely), you can disassemble it and use the pieces to build other stuff (great for creativity, but an expensive way to acquire cool Lego pieces), the finished kit can sit on a shelf and gather dust, or you can try to play with it.<br /><br />I LOVE the fact that our Ninjago structures arealmost always strong enough to endure some imaginative play. My son and his friends can enact stories and the jets and mechs can endure some flying and walking (wouldn't recommend an all-out battle) and survive. OTOH, if you look cross-eyed at our Star Wars X-wing, the wings fall off. Within the first week I lost track of the number of times I had to put the wings back on.
B00BEJ5O6Q|3.0|A little disappointed in this cd.  Only two good songs.  I love Blake but this was a flop for me.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|My little Lego fiend received this as a gift. It is far, far better than Lego Champions, but is still somewhat limited by the organizing categories and the available bricks.<br /><br />As the product description says, you build from &#34;one of four exciting building categories: vehicles, buildings, nature or things.&#34; The problem is, even with a very creative Lego builder, it is hard to distinguish between a produce stand, newsstand, house, and a shed. Or alternatively, between a hotel, office building or hospital. Or between a sandcastle and a real castle. Or a glider, pontoon plane, crop duster, and a military cargo plane. You get the idea.<br /><br />We have purchased several large lots of loose, used Lego via eBay which helps a lot in providing creative detail, but it's very hard to make some of these things even remotely recognizable when you only have a few dozen bricks in any color, never mind in a needed size.<br /><br />On an amusing note, my little guy got the Sydney Opera House as one of his designs. He thought it was a creature (like a porcupine or something ) and came up with a really cool (but completely unrecognizable) design! :)
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome you should totally get it AWESOME<br />It's kind of hard sometimes though but is really fun<br />Get it
B005NPLXJ4|3.0|Not the best album, but it's part of my collection. Even with Metallica, voice doesn't fit to them. Good music.
B008602KQI|5.0|My wife and I both love sci-fi action adventure movies and this one really has a lot of suspense as long as you've not read the book or allowed anyone to spoil it before you see it.
B00F522C7C|1.0|I pre-ordered this version because it came with a digital download.  We thought it would be great to have a hard copy dvd and a digital copy for apple products.  It did not specify anywhere in the description that this would not include a digital download that was not compatible or for usage with apple hardware or itunes.  It works with google play, vudu, and amazon.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Love the story but WAY too much sex and BDSM nonsense.  I skipped over a lot of that just to get to the story hidden within.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Although I enjoyed reading this book, it was somewhat obvious from the start that the eighty acres were the crux of the matter. A little disappointing that the hero somehow missed that and it remained overlooked until the grand finally.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Love these guys and their sound. I didn't want to have to wait to hear them on the radio all the time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Never ready anything from this author before but I'm going to read more now! I loved this entire book and found each perspective engaging!
0385350864|1.0|Fielding has lost her writing edge, I feel.  I adored the original books in this series.  However, where they flowed and were utterly believable and spontaneous, Fielding's current book is unconvincing, silly in places, even badly written (in my opinion) at times ... and, while Bridget was the girl that everyone could relate to, how many can relate to the current Bridget (who is wealthy, seems to do very little work but still manages to pull of a screenplay, has a toyboy 22 years her junior ...).  This is a book I wish I'd taken out of the library rather than bought.  I found the attempt at humour contrived (and verging on really silly at times), whereas the original books had me laughing from start to finish (when I wasn't crying along with Bridget).<br /><br />The start of the book was so bad, so awfully constructed, so like verbal diarrhea gushing at you, and confusing, that, had I not eagerly awaited this book, there is no way I would have continued with it.  Oh, and I got thoroughly sick of the constant references to vomit, \\"sick\\" (as in vomit), nits and farts.  And also her constant twittering when with publishers.
0785814531|4.0|He has been my favorite author since i first read The Raven back in middle school. This book puts you in his mindset; how he thought. I love this book!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|One of the funniest books I have ever read! A real feel good romance. The one liners, the come backs are brilliant. Highly, highly recommended for anyone who wants and needs a good laugh.
B00DYFCZ2Y|5.0|I love the entire CD. Very easy to listen to and enjoyed all authentically driven for a real message.My first time I loved every song.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing, even better than the first, in my opinion. A must read for sure! Awesome, suspenseful, engaging... I couldn't put it down!
B00632HWOG|2.0|Really wish you could access the group I have set up in the desktop version from the mobile version.  I use this for work (church secretary) and frequently need to send out group emails.  It's very tedious to do that from this version.
0618918248|5.0|Wow, I believe this needs to be required reading for every high school student! Ignoring your own personal belief, we must look at this book as the blue print on how to argue your point. He has compiled a comprehensive list of every point believers use to argue that god exists, and destroyed them.<br /><br />His views on religion and, more importantly, god have really opened my eyes and helped give me the fuel I need to question beliefs. True to the point, I am not blindly following Richards beliefs, but this book really gives one the tools to pose the questions and see the truth for themselves.<br /><br />Some of his views (especially on Islam) are very forcefull, but overall a well thought out and presented piece of work.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This guy was so natural in this role...each time we watch, it's like a new show.<br />We also like seeing all the actors who couldn't wait to be in that show as criminals, like Shatner, and Dick Vandyke...
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it. It's a groundbreaking film, something that had never been done. Incredible story development and outstanding special effects. Shame I couldn't buy the collector's edition. If you're a 70s or 80s kid that always dreamt of watching giant monsters and robots fight in a film, you're going to love this one.
B00E0W8RE0|3.0|It was ok songs but the quality of recording could have been better.I have most of the songs on other records in better sound quality.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|What if ? What if all the world was seen and understood through the lens of an &#34;omniscient&#34; Internet entity which had total control of knowledge through total survelience? Would individualism continue to exist? The Circle is gg
B00915G6MG|5.0|GREAT SERIES! GREAT CHARACTERS!  GREAT WRITERS! Recommend highly.  always wonderful to view shows without commercials!  easy and fast dealing with amazon.
B00EQE6BPY|5.0|This album doesn't disappoint as something that I can push play on Track 1 and enjoy it until the end. Different from their albums in the past, but I still love it! It is nice to hear a band that can grow and not go in a bad direction.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|My granddaughter asked for this for Christmas she will be so happy getting it, I have bought many Demi Lovato things for her and she will love them all since she picked them out
B007EC27QM|5.0|This calculator is very clean looking. Easy to read and use. Much better than the stock calculator and the other one I had been using. Highly recommended.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|great cd for my granddaughter for Christmas, she picked out 2 cds, so I am sure she will be very happy with them when she gets them. great order and delivery thanks again
B004G600A4|5.0|Love the movie! Is a good movie for the whole family to watch especially the horse. My sons and brother just love it.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Thank you for the book I read it in 5th grade, I really enjoyed it. I would read it again.
