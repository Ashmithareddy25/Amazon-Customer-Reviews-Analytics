B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book lays out very good details on how a Kindle Book should be formatted. The book will not teach you how to be a sucess as a writer or teach you how to have an imagination- that is up to you.
B0015UKX7Y|5.0|In a time where almost all song played on the radio are heavily formula based, it's nice to see a group break the norm and produce an album that is creative; at least for today's standards.  Anyone who comes looking for the new Lennon and McCartney will be slightly disappointed however compared to what else has been released in the last decade, this record has to be ranked as one of the best.  The harmonies turner and Kane create are gorgeous and the songs are fun. I highly recommend to any music enthusiast.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The only thing I don't like is that many people and places are omitted but I have not yet read to the end.  I'm looking forward to the next one!  How can one not like these books?  Very exciting and imaginative.
B00873GRU4|2.0|Everyone seemed to rave about the book. Great premise but didn't go anywhere.<br />Can't believe there are two more  books to come
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|The kids watch it 2-3 times a day and run around the house singing all the song. Very cute movie
B00EF460ME|3.0|I'll say what I said about bass booster pro on my review of bass booster to get a boom cube or something but the difference. is bass booster is a better deal then this bass booster app.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of the best and most honest coming of age stories ever written. Couldn't put it down for a second. This book should be required reading for all ages. Kindness and love should be a rule in every home and every heart :)
B004YCKJSS|1.0|The movie was good on what portions I could view. This is the third off beat movie I ordered that had parts of it defective. All major movies and series I have not had a problem with.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|O, Martin, your technique in this series is beyond belief.  The good characters or good deeds tend to finish last.  I do anxiously await the next books.
B00B5D32XS|5.0|American Horror Story season 2 was outstanding!!  The story line was so well written, the casting was dead on, and of course Ms. Jessica Lange had another performance of a lifetime!!  She gives it 1000% in every scene, like she always has in every movie she has ever done.  Ryan Murphy is a genius and i'm on the edge of my seat waiting for season 3!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got the Netflix deal so this was a great bargain. It has exceeded expectations.I will look to get another.
B008RJFRTK|3.0|This was a waste of money.  Finding how to use this is not easy. Needed a more user friendly ap
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love my Chromecast.  When my Android PC stick on another TV died, I purchased a second Chromecast for it instead of a Roku.  While Roku currently has more &#34;channels&#34; at the moment, I expect that to change soon.  And with KoushCast on the horizon and the ability to cast *anything* from an Android running CyanogenMod, the capabilities of this little device will not be limited to approved &#34;channels&#34; like the Roku.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Gonna be good for streaming during Football season! Wish this had been out a few years ago. Would'a saved hooking up another computer to the tv (in different room from higher speed office computers using Chromecast).
140006922X|4.0|I thought that this book was very well written.  It does not go into so much detail that a lay reader would be overwhelmed by the source material, but his notes in the back are incredibly thorough.  He has a very nice annotated bibliography so that you can continue to read more about the things you found interesting.  I found his writing style to be pleasant to read, and never once did I find myself bored.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a decent game. It is easy to figure out and can give you hours of playing time. Would recommend.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun time killer that isn't quite as challenging as the computer versions I used to play as a kid. Still a good recommendation.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I love Eva as a character and I'm glad she gets out of her own way...  but other than hotter sex the plot is lacking. Great sex scenes though.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is one of the best weather apps out there.  Easy to use and best of all free.  Extended forecast and radar a plus.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a must read for kids! It would be a great read aloud. Auggie is one very inspiring young man.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Short, but a puzzle game that is well  worth it.  Looking forward to move installment.  I almost wish they didn't give you hints, as I was so tempted to use them :p
B005HSL626|4.0|Every time I play it says &quot;Fruit Ninja is not responding. What would you like to do?&quot; And then I try again then about 10 minutes later it comes up with the same message again. So if anyone else is having this problem please help.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works smooth and easy to install, not only can u stream web pages to your HD tv you can also drag a movie into the browser and just stream it from there if u dont want to use flash drive or anything else.
B00CJGP116|5.0|You're going to love it! It's been a while but it is definitely a great album to buy! You will enjoy it!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I thought this was the last book ! Now we have to wait for the 4th, hope Sylvia saved her best for last .
B008PZZV8S|5.0|Had seen in the theater and forgot the plot etc. Watched again and really enjoyed it. Intriguing story line, so much so that I am going to read the book. I was trying to figure if this guy was intentionally or buy circumstance able to guile all these people.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|It was on Facebook so I didn't think it was available for Kindle, but much to my surprise there it was! I like this game.
B001PPLKI0|5.0|Great gospel music by one of our great singers. A must have for those who enjoy gospel music and can use a little inspiration.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Great movie and great effects. I had no idea it was a prequel but just a good stand alone movie
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I think the show is popular because you can see something of yourself and anyone you know in at least one of the characters.  Yes, they are over-the-top ... no one is this extreme in real life ... but that is why it is entertaining!
B003AIEOCY|5.0|The Stones swagger with unexpected sophistication and depth on this one, layers of meaning and guitar swirling with wonderful abandon through tunes that are some of their best. And with 2 discs there's plenty of them.
0689877692|5.0|You can't actually get away with only getting this book... eventually, you'll have to get all of David Carter's books. Each one is unique, incredibly fun, and amazingly put together. For those with a tactile sense, or maybe even more for those without... this is where you start!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|something new and fresh. it sounds a bit like david bowie. lady gaga always seems to come up with something new.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just works.  Looking for additional apps to support casting.  Can't wait for what else is coming.  $35 Is a steal for this device.  Streaming netflix from the ps3 Is no longer our choice.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Sensitive and funny and sweet and insightful and sad and thoughtful -- and fabulous!!  I read it on my kindle but bought the hardcover so I'd have it to read bits and pieces of whenever I want to which seems to be often.  It may be a Young Adult book but I don't know an Old Adult who's read it who hasn't loved it.
006113127X|2.0|I gave it 2 stars only because I watched the movie and am familiar with the author. This is the only book I ever read so completely outdone in cinema. The best of the  movie was the narrating of thoughts as he relentlessly wrote. The book made him appear a worthless drunk. The movie version was an inspiration to lowlifes. So there I must be.
B00BJA2VFW|1.0|Unable to locate the game on my iPad!  Can you provide assistance?  ............. Anxious to check this game out!  I have looked everywhere for it to download!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a fun game you cannot stop playing. It is a game that will keep you interested by not having to wait for things to finish like similar games
0312330537|5.0|I am going to India later next month and was told to read this book instead of any travel book.  It was amazing and I highly recommend this novel.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|Batman rules. Love the movie. Joker ws ruthless. Jason was a good villian. I enjyed watching it. A good watch for batman viewers.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Don't waste your time or money. Planet of the Apes without the apes. Tatooin without Luke. Arabia without Lawrence. Walden Pond without Thoreau.  It's all of that and less.
B003ES61EE|3.0|It works for physical dust and things like this, but it won't take a smudge or fingerprint off in my experience. A silk camera cloth is better.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Fast moving page turner.  Double crosses every where you turn.  There was no guessing the out come on this book not even in the last chapter.  David is excellent at twists and turns and so vivid in your mind as you read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. It was difficult enough to make it interesting, but not too taxing. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a distraction to relax, or anyone wanting to exercise their memory skills. I really enjoyed it! So did my husband. Sometimes we worked on the clues together. It is good to know that if you get stuck or frustrated there are walk-throughs to be found.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun little phone game that I enjoyed . The difficult is kinda up and down but its still not a huge problem
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This app is a amazing thing, I'm so amazed by all the things I can do.<br />I always choose pirate and I always get banned from all the planet's that are<br />Controlled by the great houses, but I don't mind because it's so fun.<br />This game is perfect for hardcore players and casual players alike.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Fun game. Cant so any combo moves or anything like that,  but its entertaining.<br />Not sure i would want to pay for the app but i got it on faotd.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Amazing book--mind blowing even! Now it is time to research further all the secrets just unveiled! Full of intrigue and knowledge.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins does it again. The story line keeps you intrigued and on the edge of your seat until the end. The ending could have been expanded a bit but all and all still a great read.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Have watched it three times in a row, story line great, special effects great, acting pretty good.  Establishing the bond between Kirk and Spock...needs more chemistry.  I'd still give it an A.  Looking for more character development.  Go Sulu!
0743437497|5.0|The movie was good, but the book is much better. There is a lot more detail and a very good read for anyone that enjoys Steven Kings style of writing.
B007I5QNRE|2.0|The book contained very limited teaching in the craft of drawing, but rather had nice drawing by some &#34;masters&#34; with little explanation of the purpose of the example.  Very little explanation of the principle she was trying to put forward in her book.<br />It was a well put together book, but very much a wast of time and money to learn the craft of drawing.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Got this one for the kids since they really like the original one. I have found much to my amazement that I really love spending time playing this one as well.
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|These make life easy if you have complicated audio equipment. They also eliminate the &#34;mysteriously dead speaker&#34; I'm not certain they improved the sound of the components, but they make connections much easier. Heavy and well built.
B006512BFU|5.0|This movie is so good. It shows almost everything in the sex scenes. Very powerful movie over all. Also if you get  region2 dvd if you don't have a blue ray dvd player it might not play.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good calculator! Does everything I need it to do. Easy to use. I used mine to calculate how much I get paid a month and tuition calculations.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|I would not reccommend to families something that burps to your kids if you are trying to teach them manners
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Which it with the lady on date night this was ok for her cause it had dead people walking around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best horse game ever! It is a must-have game. You can do everything from feed to groom from ride to pet and you can even get More horses .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing story!  I fell in love the characters.  The story is beautifully written and makes you cheer the characters on in their journey.  Love love love this book!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|easy to use and the kids can even use it with much ease. Fast search results also good to know!
B000000W5H|5.0|So great.  I got this to replace one I'd lended to someone and never got back.  A classic.  Never sounds dated.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Forbidden love, supernatural creatures, and a lot of action. I love the series so far. Can't wait to read the next book!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|not usable for ios today<br />i though that i will works with google chrome for ios<br />now its not usable
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Forget all the negativity you hear and read about Nickelback and just enjoy a fabulous band. &#34;Burn It To The Ground&#34; alone is worth the purchase.
0394800184|5.0|i got this for my niece's baby boy.  I wanted him to enjoy it like I did when I was a child.
B007SGM084|5.0|Amazing love story and spicy enough to keep you interested. I could not put it down. Read all three in about a week.
B005M5PENG|5.0|Love the relationships between characters!!  This is a great re-make of the original show, with an update feel to it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great game,  it reminds me of the great games of the past.  I could set and play this game forever.<br />I. highly recommend it.
B001AFF25W|5.0|In Eat That Frog, Brian Tracy reminded me how to put on my blinkers, focus, get organized and get the job at hand done. In his no nonsense approach, he shows you how to rein in your power and to apply it to your goals,  following these timeless lessons puts you on the fast track to a successful life.<br /><br />Ellen Findlay<br />Interior Designer.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It's great it's not easy and its not hard it's just right. I hope players who played longer or with higher level get a bonus/rewards
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'm absolutely in love with this author's style and ability for compelling character development. Anyone who diminishes the value by calling this &#34;chick lit&#34; is just a down and out mysoginist!
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Saw this movie many times years ago and just had to have a copy of it so I could watch it time and again.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Great fun. Would recommend this to others. Enjoy trying to beat my score at each level. Like the various sounds. Will continue to play the game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing wonderfull just like justin bieber it has amazing feautures its just the right game for you to play because theres always a bit of challenge
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|this is a nice little device. mainly because it is pretty inexpensive. the only flaw is that there is not much support for it yet, meaning that the gallery app and video player etc. on an android device do not have a cast button so you cannot cast random videos and photos that you took on your device directly to your tv. on the upside there is a lot of hype about this and with it beind a product of google I expect there to be updates and increasing support for it pretty soon.
B00338QENI|5.0|I think this book should be read by students, adults, teenagers in or out of the medical field because it also deals with ethical matters regarding our bodies. It will open your eyes to things going on you were never aware of. And these battles over tissue & research are ongoing.  Knowledge is power.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is very good and easy to read. Great vocabulary, cool story line. I am on to City of Ashes now!
B0053ZOQMK|2.0|This whole story line was at best ok.  My 7 year old was not interested after the first five minutes.  I usually enjoy watching good animated movies with her but I found myself extremely bored with this movie.  I did finish watching it just to give it full credit in my mind.  My daughter did not finish watching it.  Technical was great.  Story line and production not so much.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I really like the app and it gets your brain thinking and its fun and i would definitely recommend it!!!
1451629192|5.0|Great book but I felt kind of :/ when it came with the price tag of one dollar on the cover and I obviously bought it for more than that.
B0082Z447U|5.0|This book was on a list of must read books before you die and it was worth it!  And, it was free!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I highly recommend this app if u want to start a career in being a dj even if u don't it is still really fun so u should totally have this app
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|great action packed movie that did a well job of captivating the beginning of the first avenger. Can't wait to see the sequel.
B000007SPU|5.0|Oh,  what wonderful music.  I have listened to this CD for hours and hours.  It takes me out of the world of chaos and puts me in a world of calmness.  I absolutely love this music.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered one of these as soon as I heard about them on day 1. I liked at the time that they offered the Netflix deal as well. However, even without this deal (Google took it away), this little device is totally worth the very small price. I would get another one if my second TV could receive Wi-Fi where it is. So at some point if the price is the same i'll by another.<br />The added benefit is that it does work with Android and iPhone (probably any i-device). It also works with the PC with a Chrome browser. The apps have the built in icon that lets you stream the content to the TV, so once the source is playing, your device is OK to use again. Basically it works by telling the Chromecast where the source is so it does not come from your phone/tablet.<br />At this time, Netflix, YouTube, Google Music and Chrome browser are supported. I have not tried watching Amazon or Hulu through the browser.
B00785P2QC|5.0|[[ASIN:B00785P2QC Virtual City Playground]]<br />I grabbed this game because I love build-it-up & quest games and was already playing one from the same company.  In this one, you build a city starting with a garage full of trucks.  Quests guide you to build farms and a mill which eventually leads to a bakery.  You buy trucks to connect it all, ending at a mall.  Garbage trucks, buses, and assorted cargo trucks buzz around on the roads while helicopters fight fires and send out medical personnel.  It is great fun to watch all the little people and soon I will even have Big Ben on the bus route.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Hey, it works, it's lasted a couple months so far without a hitch... what more can a Dad ask?<br /><br />If there is a downside it is that now he wants some of the other Doctor's screwdrivers...
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I would've given 4.5 if there was a choice. Only thing that I don't like is that with the chrome browser there is a lag for example other streaming videos like on private websites besides youtube and netflix are slower.  However, it is in beta phase so it should get better..Amazing how you can stream from your smartphone perfectly!
1449408656|5.0|I smiled and giggled at almost every page! So true =) This one is definitely for cat lovers everywhere, and the pictures are so cute. Also, the book arrived in good condition
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Very predictable except for one little twist that's not used very well.  I felt it was worth the rental price but would have felt better if it had been free through prime.
B009CG955Y|5.0|We bought the electronic version, which means we didn't receive a physical DVD. We watch it via Amazon Instant Video on our PS3. Of course, the movie ended up being available on Netflix a month or two after we bought it; but our grandson loves this movie, so it's nice to be able to stream it whenever we want regardless of whether Netflix is carrying it at the time. This is my first time buying a movie in &#34;stream only&#34; format. So far I like it!
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|As a fan of the original Star Trek series with L. Nimoy and W. Shatner, I was hardly entertained at the thought of being subjected to yet again a new spin on an old series which seems to be the in thing theses days.  It isn't often (in my opinion) that you can out do the old classics so although I had watched the 2009 Star Trek when it came to television (which was enjoyable enough) when my sci fi mad child asked me to take her to see Into Darkness I really didn't feel compelled to want to sit through 2hrs and 12 mins of the sequel.  That being said I took her and I have to say I was thoroughly entertained, for 3/4 s of the movie I was on the edge of my seat.  So much did I enjoy it that three days later we went back to watch the 3D version, which I would highly recommend given the special effects.  The beginning of the movie was visually stunning, the location of the Enterprise was a little odd, but hey let's not get too picky.  All the characters were believable, doing justice to the original cast and I loved seeing Nimoy back in his role of Spock even if it was for just a few fleeting moments, it was cleverly woven into the storyline.  The storyline itself was a little predictable in parts and sometimes a little unbelievable, lets face it jumping from one moving aircraft to another at high speeds is questionable, be it in outer space or within the earths atmosphere (in space they at least had a suit, so why not put Spock in some form of wing suit for the last few scenes fighting with khan to add that little bit more realism) and it is for that reason alone I took off a star.  Overall, I really really enjoyed this movie and will admit to being glued to my seat for almost all of it.  It is so action packed that taking a toilet break during the movie would be sinful.  We will be getting the DVD, and no doubt we will sit down again with my soft drink and nibbles for round three of the movie.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A wonderfully readable deconstruction of the contradictory mess of fables that is the New Testament.  My Sunday School knowledge was sufficient prereq to absorb the action and enjoy speculating what Jesus of Nazareth would think of the Vatican...but a couple of detail maps would have enhanced the experience.  As noted above, this book is best read in solitary confinement as the temptation to inform the poor chap in the coach seat next to you what Jesus' little brother thought of Saint Paul overwhelmed my better judgement.
B003NX75B8|4.0|I started off not wanting to like this.  This book was recommended to me by a person to give this book a chance.  I did not like his newest one (I am the only one).  This book was really good and I actually makes me want to read more books by him.  This book was really great in the storytelling and I had a great time reading it.  I loved ll the characters!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Beautiful performances by the kids. I think this film wanted to be a bit more than the content warrants -- but, it was fun to watch if only for those two remarkable boys.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Batman Begins is an amazing film because of one reason... The Scarecrow--Dr. Crane was perfect in this movie. The knew suit was perfect, and looks exetremely well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 9 year old son just laughs and giggles the whole time he is playing it. A fun game to play.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|This album took me back to when I received it many years ago, but with a bonus. I should add that this is not the original album. Several songs that I had always wanted were added that were on non-Capital albums, earlier albums or indeed later albums (I'll be Back, for example, was on Beatles 65, a later album). In my opinion, the original album is overlooked as one of the Beatles best albums. The original album was the first I received and there is not a dud on it. There is no filler, unlike just about every later Beatle album. And there is a freshness and a joy that no later album truly has.<br /><br />I put it in the Bose stereo in my car and found myself singing along with it. At stoplights, people could make out what I was listening to and waved and smiled. Listening to it is a blast.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love these books. I had planned on reading the whole trilogy before I watched the movie. I am still only on the second book, but it is an absolutely amazing series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I it is really fun I loved it I we'll always play the game .thank you for the game is really fun and I love it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book was well written and kept me interested.  There are some twists so that I didn't know which direction the story would go.  Very good book!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|but they are ruining it with each update. There's no way to stop the updates. They need to stop acting like Apple and let the indie devs get in on the action.
B00C2IPB66|4.0|This is not the best bluray transfer of an older movie that I've seen but it is in no way so flawed that its not worth it or enjoyable. Nothing about it was jarring or wrong, it just wasn't as crystal as some (such as Braveheart) The ability to watch either the theatrical or extended additions is great, and I loved all of the special features and that came with it.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|I love this app! It will auto reroute you to avoid traffic jams. It notifies you of upcoming events along your route, like accidents, disabled cars, speed traps. This is way better than a radar detector. Some of the advanced features need work. The \\"add a stop\\" feature never worked well for me. I'd like to have more views of my route - like a full end to end view for long trips, rather than just the few miles in front of me. I'd also like to be able to record my trip and easily add photos along the way.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hooked from the beginning.  Excellent story telling of the lives upstairs and down in an English estate in the early 1900s.  Worth your time.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|I am a magic player from way back in the day when you could legally play a black lotus. What I like about this app is the game mechanics. I took the time to run through the tutorial and thought it was evident that a lot of thought was put into walking a new player through the game. I couldn't get into the deck building with just the free version so I can't say anything about it. Five stars for implementation of the game mechanics.<br /><br />The control however leaves a lot to be desired. It's pretty obvious this app was designed with large tablets in mind. On my phone (Samsung galaxy 3) the font is tiny to the point of unreadability. The cards are equally small so it is hard to actually tap on them. Combined with a bit of lag it makes actually playing quite frustrating. I missed a lot of blocks just trying to select cards. Three stars overall.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Considering how old the movies are I really thought a bluray transfer would make them come off as harshly cartoony but since I didn't get the unchanged dvd versions when available (endless regret) I needed a set I could watch with my new HD tv.<br />However I was blown away by the sound and clarity and the amount of clean-up in the special effects. All creative changes aside these films look absolutely fantastic and I was literally giddy as I re-watched them again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest but not enlighten to marry it. It is a great app and has great rainy day ideas my whole family loves it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun, not to hard. great for passing time. also easy that the kid's can play. I think I plays for about 2 hours straight.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun and addictive. Only lost one star because you have to wait so long between earning free plays. Great way to meet people all over the world. It is fun to see people world-wide comment on the weather or just say hello.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really liked the Kite Runner and this book as well. Made me want to pick it up and keep reading.
0425218929|4.0|I am a Cornwell fan and have been for years.  Cornwell almost always gets the medical details right.  Full disclosure:  I am a retired physician and am fascinated by her detailed accounts of the morbid and macabre.  I have seen many things in my time, but never a limbless and headless torso with pustules on its derrière.<br /><br />Unnatural Exposure was especially fun for me because:  1) one of my medical school classmates spent his career with the CDC and was a player in the eradication of smallpox; 2) a nephew was in the Peace Corps in Africa and published on monkeypox; 3) another classmate was a distinguished forensic pathologist whom I understand has been a consultant to Ms. Cornwell.  The discussion of whether or not to completely destroy pathogens like the smallpox virus is ongoing, and a deadly serious question that deserves broad and debate.<br /><br />Then there's the subtext of Ms. Cornwell's personal challenges and the rich autobiographical parallels in her narratives.  She is an enigma, since her politics seem so discordant with her personal history.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer who indicated that the character of the main \\"perp\\" was introduced awfully late and should have been developed more fully.  She let Ring get off much too easily.  I would have had him punished and humiliated, shamed, brought up on charges, and publicly disgraced; maybe even \\"outed\\" for a few sexual misdemeanors of his own!  That wouldn't have precluded his coming back in a sequel.<br /><br />A little more reassurance that Lucy's future will be secure would have helped me feel better at the end.  Maybe not.  There's very little of the \\" lived happily ever after . . . \\" in Cornwell's world view.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I had no quibbles with her story or its resolution and felt this was a great read from an accomplished author.  Recommended.
B00A285OOW|5.0|i love the way this author writes.  very detailed and historical  easy reading<br />oh those tudors!  enjoyable fun read for all
0767919408|3.0|I have read almost everything that Bill Bryson has written and am a great fan of his works. However, recently, including this book, he has diverted from his humorous roots to a more straight-laced view of the world.<br />This book documents the summer of 1927 and the lasting effect it had on the United States of America. All of the passages are interesting but to say that they have the zing, flash and humor of the past works would not be truthful. Bryson seems to have let the humorous observer fall to the wayside and has become a straight sociologist.<br />If you are interested in this time frame or the topics covered, I would recommend this book as a comprehensive review of an important time in the history of the USA. If you are looking for the humor of past works, it just isn't here.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a very challenging game.  I have only tried the two suits option and find it very good.  I would challenge you to try it.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Lots of puzzles finding objects by shape or description, occasional ad hoc puzzles spot the differences etc. Do have help if you get stuck and the time period to find things in is generous.Good fun!
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|Oh my ---I am so sick of the song Worldwide I could scream~~and I'm only the Grandma(Nana). So, she loves it!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game...No, I'm addicted to it.  A few problems with getting booted out of rooms, but overall it's a good, fun game.  I wouldn't suggest spending money buying credits.  Just be patient and wait for daily credits.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I read all of his books.  Again another great one.  His series is fantastic.  Mitch Rapp is a great character.  If you like cia/seal type books than this is for you.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is so much fun! I played for hours and still didn't want it to end!  I hope there are more puzzles like this one
B003HKN52A|1.0|I am upset because the DVD would not play saying it was the &#34;wrong region&#34;. I purchased it in good faith, for my partner's birthday and we cannot watch it because it is BLANK. Not happy.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|when u get a good game going with a good group..it would be nice if it would be easy to replay with them and stop taking my coins and putting me back at level 1 :)
B009OYSFDM|5.0|My niece made me rent this.  I was hooked half way thru the first episode.  Great story line and character development.  Can't wait to watch more.
B005VPRETE|4.0|I helped my five year old put together the tree house.  We had fun taking turns putting the pieces together.  When it was completed, my daughter played with the characters.  I was afraid that this toy would not be age appropriate, but I'm glad to say she enjoys this toy very much.  I am a fan of Lego. This is a great toy for little girls (or boys - my son likes the animals and the fact that his sister built a tree house) who are ready to transition from the large Lego pieces to the little Legos.
B000QUUD60|1.0|You've sent me a DVD that won't play and so I've wasted my money. I bought it for my partner's birthday and we couldn't watch it because it said &#34;wrong region&#34;....this is very unfortunate and I have wasted my money. The other DVD I purchased from you was the same - would not play.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked reading a NDE from a professional in the medical community and from a person with credible science credentials. It was an impressive experience, well documented and well written.
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|I really liked the first movie so I was excited for this.  It is an ok movie but lags the original.  I wish they had used more of the original cast.  It didn't hold my attention.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is awesome it's kind of like temple run but way cooler I love the jetpack and I also like how you can compete agents facebook friends.
B0098460O4|5.0|Wonderful singing from both of them, they are outstanding and will go on to make many albums no doubt, love them
0394826817|5.0|My son loves this book, he is almost 4 and recognizes many of the behaviors described in the book, so we talk about them and try to correct in a fun way.
B00BGIC170|3.0|I like both the leads a lot.  This movie could have been so much better.  It was ok but the laughs were to far apart and not hard enough.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|In this album, Mayer continues his legacy as a nuanced songwriter, lyricist, and producer. The tracks portray a bluesy + country + rock + folk personality that reveal some introspective navel-gazing, perhaps expected of an artist onto his sixth studio album. I also appreciate how he assembled the album, with an elegant song-to-song cohesion and some sense of an emotional storyline. Dear Marie, Paper Doll, and You're No One 'Til Someone Lets You Down are particularly evocative, while tracks like Wildfire and Call Me The Breeze will get your foot tapping. Overall, this album is an instant classic, and I expect many of these songs that didn't hit the singles charts from the get-go to be &#34;sleeper&#34; hits later on.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever!!!! You have got to get this game because it's so cool for being free and even if you bought it!!!!:D
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminds me of years ago when I played this game in high school. Great. Game. Get it. Play it. It is fun<br />I
B009CGR416|5.0|This is a classic - we all love it.  Everything we hoped it would be and more.  I wish we had known about this sooner.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is and awesome game so fun and so cute it is great for little kids and fer easy to play I just love the little minions they are so cute
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|The first few levels were easy. Then I hit a hard level and had to use some hints. No big deal right? That's not entirely true. The hints are a lot of coins, and if you exit out of the game just once, the hints don't stay. They make you have to remember what hints they gave you. I don't know about you but I have better things to do than remember what hints a game gave me. Plus there's no way to get more coins unless you purchase them for real money. Otherwise it's a pretty fun game.
B00D0QSZHG|5.0|Made me really aware of my &#34;two minds&#34;!  I've bought it for friends and hope it helps improve their world.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome. Worth 35 bucks for YouTube alone. Tons of potential. More apps coming soon (Pandora and Hulu). Control from my phone or iPad. Cool.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|I barely made it through this silly movie trying to be more than the children's fantasy that it is. \\"Crouching Tiger\\" is one of my favorite movies so I had to give this Ang Lee movie a chance. There's nothing worse for me than a movie that's \\"trying\\" (and trying hard) to be deep or metaphorical.  The special effects were over the top and mostly not believable to me. I became so tired of seeing the same scenes over and over with the boy and the tiger in the boat with the ocean, and the ocean, and the ocean...where's my Dramamine!
B008HK3XOU|2.0|Needs a place to put stylus and a groove in cover to keep K F HD from slipping down and virtually laying flat
B000PXUA5W|5.0|We bought this for our grandson's 7th birthday as he is into Legos and has thousands..... but he doesn't have a Lego watch! This watch is a great price and has extra pieces he can interchange to make it different colors & even comes with a little lego guy to put together to use with his many Lego creations. Great value toy/watch!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|It was a comedy action movie. I pretty much enjoyed it as I like Bruce Willis. I am looking forward to seeing Red 2.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It will not work with my router.  It was not clear when I ordered it what the requirements were for the router.
B009G41CG2|2.0|It does not have a go back button or hint button. Have played one on e-games that is much better.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|The usual shoot em up, with a few cameos from Ahnold and Bruce to spice it up.<br />Good use of the Hemsworth kid. Gave them a good reason for their efforts to get<br />Van Damme who was a super baddie. And made for a good ending where they<br />anonymously gave his French nurse girlfriend a big box of cash. Satisfying.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|this is a very fun game. I have recommended to all my family and friends.and they are hooked as well. I refer everyone to try it.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|I wasn't sure what to think when I first heard about Equestria Girls, and was very hesitant about the whole thing, but I went to see EG at the theater, and I ended up really enjoying it! =) It's very cute to see Twilight try to figure out being a human. And the movie has some very funny and cute parts in it, as well! And it has lots of references to the show (My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic). By the way, to fully enjoy Equestria Girls, you must at least have seen a few episodes of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (if not all of them). Some aspects of the plot would be hard to figure out for someone who hasn't seen the show, and doesn't know what the Elements of Harmony are, among other things. I'd recommend this movie for people who are already fans of the show, and if you want to watch this without first seeing the show, I really recommend reading up on the show.<br /><br />*spoilers start here* My only real problem with this movie was that some aspects of the plot seemed far-fetched to me, such as Sunset Shimmer's transformation (which was creepy and sudden), and the counterparts of Twilight's friends readily and easily accepting the fact that Twilight was really a pony princess and not a human. Also, I do wonder why Twilight got a crush on a boy in this movie, only for him to be confirmed to not appear in Season 4. Why get a crush to only never see him again? (Though, I thought her crush was cute, and her boyfriend seemed really nice) *spoilers end here* The plot did seem a little bit harder to believe than plots in Friendship is Magic, but I think that the writer, Meghan McCarthy, still did a very good job with the plot (considering the big changes that came in when Twilight went to the human world), and carried Twilight and her friends over extremely well to the human world (with the exception of Snips, Snails, and Miss Cheerliee, whose personalities seemed different from the show.)<br /><br />LONG STORY SHORT- This movie is very enjoyable, and carries over the spirit and friendship of the show very well! =) (Just to let you know, a certain scene may scare sensitive kids, so if your kid is very sensitive, I'd prewatch the movie for them to determine if it would bother them.) I overall recommend this movie for Friendship is Magic fans! =)<br /><br />Also, I wasn't sure what to rate it out of five, so I rated it 4. On the scale of 1-10 I'd give it 7 or 8/10. :)
1423141997|5.0|This book.was a very good-looking using the story of Percy. I love the series and I can't wait for the story to continue!
B008XG1X18|4.0|New at it, but can already see that I'll be spending a lot of time here and finding new things daily.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'd heard about this book, but it sounded like it would have too much violence for my taste, so I put off reading it. Strong recommendations from family members, convinced me to give it a try... After I started it, I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read book two2! The violence was not the main focus - just a gripping story.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Nowadays we take computer graphics for granted. When someone watches Tron today, the animation is so good that many might be surprised that scenes that look like CGI were actually very labor intensive works of art. Computers were used only for creating guidelines - then the animators took over. All that color and shading was added after, frame by frame. Younger audiences might not appreciate the references to old styles, as seen when components are symbolized by faces of old men in facades, as might be done in plays for centuries. I just loved the whole thing!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|great movie, awesome box set, It's not blu ray but it looks great on dvd and even better When I play it in my blu ray player because my player up converts it to 1080p plenty of extras
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was thrilling and addictive! I never wanted to put it down! The characters were well-developed and there was the perfect balance of romance and action/adventure. I just... LOVED it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game while I was waiting for the movie to start. This game is so so much fun!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Totally enjoyed.  Had a hard time putting it down.  Can hardly wait to read the next one.  Hope the movie is as good as the book.
6305075492|4.0|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is widely considered one of the most important films of all-time. It is the first horror film and is one of the most influential films in German Expressionist. This 1997 Image Entertainment Special Collector's Edition of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is widely considered the best DVD release of the film. A few bonus features are provided. It would be great to get a deluxe Blu-ray with 4 hours of documentaries and bonus material.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google blew away market. Great price. User friendly. Compact. Best product i've bought in long time! Google defiantly made the 2013 tech product of the year!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Just downloaded it! My son already loves it! Great graphics too!  Now I have to fight to get my kindle back from him!
B00CFA222M|5.0|Strictly modern entertainment with a storybook slant.  I really loved it and I'm glad to add it to my library of movies that I can watch when I want.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|Very, very colorful; with a great soundtrack.  Voice acting was well done.  In my opinion,  the story line was a little weak.  But all in all very enjoyable and family friendly.
0802130208|5.0|Love this book. It is such a loss that John Kennedy Toole didn't live to write more. He was a gifted author.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Like other posts its a good game.  However way  TOO MUCH DIALOG to tap through.  I love hidden picture games and so do my kids.  However its not fun when you spend more time tapping though the dialog then you do the actual game.  Very bad for the makers.  Good story however.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Grisham has written a great courtroom drama book with lots of twists and turns. The ending is not predictable until the end.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game with classic components. Any middle aged man has played this classic and this is really fun to play on the pooper!!! Makes the time fly and a poop more pleasant of an activity!!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|The plot summary might lead you to believe Sweet Tooth is an espionage thriller, but it's not.  It's a fascinating tale about the Cold War and how both sides used artists, sometimes without their knowledge, for propaganda purposes.  It's about the early '70s political and social upheaval in England with IRA bombings, crippling strikes, and 3-day  work weeks.  It's about writers and the literary world.  Most of all, it's about relationships between men and women.<br /><br />The story develops somewhat slowly, but don't give up on it.  There were details that caught my attention along the way, but I didn't realize their full importance until the end.  The ending was amazing, and I never guessed the way things would play out.  I don't want to give it away, but believe me, the last 20 pages or so are riveting.  Things that I interpreted one way took on a completely different meaning at the end.  It's an amazing and wonderful book that I wanted to reread as soon as I finished it.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />After you've read \\"Sweet Tooth\\", read the review Katie Roiphe wrote for Slate.  She does a terrific job of analyzing the most important aspects of the book.  After I read her analysis, I wantd to jump up and shout \\"Yes!  That's it exactly!\\"  But it's filled with spoilers, so don't read it until after you've read the book.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very nice update of a classic video game. I also like the ability to get upgrades and rebuild damaged buildings.
B009AY04A8|2.0|Got bored after about 5 minutes. Too repetitive. Just tap tap through the boring chit chat and do the same thing over and over.boring.luckily it was free. lm going to find something else to play.
B002POMHVE|5.0|I know that I am a male in my forties but I downloaded this when it came out three years ago and still to this day listen to it much more than anyone would suspect. I also have her third album. But this first one in particular is very engaging and very energetic. Her band doesn't get the credit they deserve but they make the album with the hyper speed drumming and the crunchy guitar and bass riffs. Also lots of sonically pleasing 80's style synth fills. Most of the lyrics are about not being taking advantage of by wiley boys and girl power but I am not really interested in lyrics half the time anyway. I like the music and the feisty attitude of the music. Her voice is a bit thin and at times enters the Chipmunks territory but she has a slight rasp to her voice that seems almost smokey at times. She wouldn't be the first singer to more of a stylist than a virtuoso. For me this album is a prescription in fun pop.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I have always been a person who liked to have lists of the things I need to do and this app makes that so easy for me. By Friday I can see that I have completes all the work I needed to do or if there are things left to do. Would recommend for anyone who wants to stay organized
B00000F6LQ|5.0|This gift pack came with a film cell and a copy of the script as well as the DVD.  My nephew and his dad used the script to follow along and find ad libs, etc.  And they love owning a piece of the film.  I got lots of kudos as an aunt for picking this gift for him.  If you really love this film and find yourself saying &#34;a duck floats!&#34; or &#34;who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?&#34;, then this collectors box is for you!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was great for my nine year old.but was.not as engaging for.my 5 year old.  So I gave it 4 stars.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We enjoyed this so much we bought it to send to our daughter serving in Afghanistan. All the soldiers love this soapy drama.
0938045768|5.0|I like the routines presented in this book.  It starts with the simple versions of the exercises and works through to the more difficult &#34;mastery level&#34; versions.  For someone who has never trained before, or who hasn't trained for some time, the entry level routines presented are a good starting place.
1608871045|4.0|After seeing the Spanish version in a bookstore, I decided to get this one from Amazon (Costed me a lot less). I *love* the scrapbook/case file format, written for Bruce Wayne's perspective, it's almost like you had snuck into the Batcave and looked through the files (I dare you to try that tough!). It's not actually the most comprehensive book on the Batman trilogy out there, that would be The Art and Making of the Dark Knight Trilogy), but as a great \\"novelty\\" item it works beautifully. The book's cover is very sturdy with a nice embossed Batman emblem / the quality of the printing and finish is very good, many pics have a nice semi-gloss coating / the case files, blueprints, sticky notes look very authentic and you can see a lot of thought has been put into the making of the book.<br />The only cons I could find: Some of the picturers are a bit dark / at least one sticker sheet was stuck onto a page it shouldn't (and sadly I damaged the page trying to unglue it) / The hidden CD behind the Gotham map on the back cover was rather disappointing, with only a few images in medium resolution (also, the CD itself is a bit hard to take out without ungluing the envelope for the map).<br />All in all, for under 30 dollars this book was a steal, and the pros largely outweigh the cons in my opinion. Get it!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It kept the attention of both my grandkids during our vacation.  As they are veteran users of this stuff and they said it was really good (high praise from them), I rated it  excellent.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game!  Cant wait for more!  Some levels were pretty hard and make think.  I like the ones that you have to remember patterns as you go.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Great cast.  It had some slow moments but I enjoyed it.  The action scenes kept me watching and the dialogue was funnier than I expected.  I wanted to watch Red before seeing Red 2 which looked equally as funny and entertaining.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I had to order more of these CDs for friends who attended the Luau.<br />I think it is Israel's best CD.  Truly beautiful.  Definately a keeper!  Really - a treasure!
B000FBJHT4|4.0|Corso is credible and provides sufficient detail that you know he did what he claims.  It made sense of a lot insane policies by the government during the Cold War.  It also dove-tails nicely with other accounts leaked from Roswell.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Book read very much like a diary.  I expected more in the way of writing about group dynamics.  Book does not glamorize prison life, but I have to think it must be worse that the life portrayed in this book.  Good, easy read.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|Back is labeled &#34;Water Resistant&#34;.  According to Seiko, that means &#34;your watch is designed and manufactured to withstand up to 3 bar, such as accidental contact with splashes of water or rain, but is not designed for wearing while swimming or diving.&#34;  Quote from the owner manual.  The back on my watch is labeled &#34;Water Resistant&#34;.  I know, because I'm looking at it.<br /><br />The description here is misleading.  It is not ok to go 90 feet under water with this watch, or even take a shower with it on.  To wear it in the shower, it would have to be labeled &#34;Water Resistant 5 BAR&#34;.  It's not, of course.<br /><br />It's a nice watch, though and seems to work well.  It's comfortable, but the strap is very tedious to put on.  The end of the flexible cloth strap is a nuisance to get through the metal loops.  It's ok once on, but just takes a little extra time to mess with when putting on.  I may get a leather strap for this watch.  I prefer metal bands.<br /><br />It's nice for casual dress, but I would like to be able to clean a band with soap and water, and this will be unlikely to clean up easily.  If one's daily life does not involve perspiration and dirt, this may not be important.  Something to keep in mind;  chemical, grease, smelly things, and blood and other icky stuff will not easily clean/disinfect off of this band.<br /><br />I like the size.  Not too small, but won't get in the way of clothing either.  Plenty big to read the time.  The teeny setting knob is finicky to get your fingernails behind and pull it out to set the time, for me anyway.<br /><br />It's a good buy for the money if used within it's design limits, just don't get it in the water.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This video series will kick your butt.  Beginners, don't be intimidated.  She starts off with modified versions of all of the exercises.  All you need to get started is a mat and a set of hand weights.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|My wife and I (27 & 30 respectively) watched this movie for our weekly 'movie night', and we enjoyed it. It wasn't Amazing, but definitely was worth watching. The wit and writing really shined, with Billy Connely playing my favorite character.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|The Withings Pulse is definately one of, if not The, most advanced step counters on the market at the moment. One of the obvious strong points is that it is connected to the withings cloud, so you can access your personal dashboard with Pulse readings as well as weight and blood presure readings, if you have other Withings devices.<br /><br />What makes it good:<br />1) It just works! And it synchronizes seamlessly with your phone (Iphone, Android)<br />2) It offers the best sleep monitor on the market as well<br />3) It can measure you pulse, just my putting your finger on it<br /><br />What's not good:<br />1) You cannot pause it! This is a BIG flaw that has to be corrected by Withings. I ride my bike to work for example, and since I cannot pause it, it screws up the readings for the entire day. Also if you travel, etc. and you do not want it to count, is no way you can \\"turn it off\\". I think this is a 'show stopper' flaw for many that want this device, so I hope Withings will issue a software/firmware update for it asap.<br /><br />2) The sleep monitor is great, and I can see a complete history in my Withings dashboard. But what does it all mean? if 40% of my sleep is 'Deep sleep' is that good or bad? Since Withings does not offer any information or guidance this feature becomes irrelevant unless you start to do your own research.<br /><br />3) The applications that can connect with Withings does not import your steps (yet). At least not Endomondo and MyFitnessPal.<br /><br />Conslusion:<br />If you want or need one of the most advanced step counters on the market, the Withings Pulse is a good choice - but only if you can live with the obvious flaw, that you cannot \\"pause\\" the counter. I would have given this device 5 stars if they had thought of this issue before sending it to market, but then again, hopefully they will fix it soon and issue an update. If you already have the Withings WiFi scale like me, this is also an obvious choice, since I can see all the heath data in one dashboard and I do not need to login to different services.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Ever since I stumbled onto this game, I've always loved it. This version is really nice. Love the sound effects and the brilliant colours.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I refrained from ordering these movies seperately until the series was complete.<br />Delighted with the packaging and extra features on the blu ray edition.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a fun and somewhat addicting game. If you aren't on facebook it can be difficult to get investment points.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a compelling story that is extraordinarily written.  While there are many characters and it is sometimes hard to follow, I am completely hooked with the story. The reader becomes a part of the lives of the main characters and the way in which the lives of the characters are so intermingled makes for an intriguing story. The friend who introduced me to this series is now on his 4th reading of all the books in the series and is anxiously awaiting the release of the next book.  Excellent reading!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is like Subway Surer I love it a lot cool, amazing, alsom, wow, outstanding<br />I relly like my sister likes it to.!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|when I got this app I thought it was a piece of crap  but then I realized it was the best game I ever played .
B007MDB71O|5.0|I bought this without seeing it because it was selling for insanely cheap... I never buy movies before I've seen them. I joked and joked that it was the poorly crafted sequel to Prince of Persia after watching all the terrible marketing this film had to offer. BUT I had seen some private footage at the Disney Convention and thought I had seen something that may be worth watching. This Bluray has probably been worn thin now from how many times Ive watched it. THIS IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE! A must see for sci-fi lovers and cinematic adventure lovers. I was shocked by how much I love this film.<br />I don't want to give away any of the plot; so if you like movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones, this film harkens back to that style of adventure storytelling. I can't get over how great it is. Since discovering this movie I have read all of Edgar Rice Burroughs original novels, and I am DESPERATELY hoping a sequel will find it's way to theaters. So, if you can get beyond the crappy title, poor marketing strategy, and the stigma that plagued this movie when it first came out... you will find a great film.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I love this since I am a huge Star Trek fan.  Great quality and complete episodes. What more can you ask for?  I would recommend this to a friend.
B005F2BBLK|5.0|Family movie with many lessons love Johnny Depp. Children will love the chamelion adults will love the story and the moral
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It was easy to connect, though I'll admit muddling around for a half hour because I didn't follow instructions.  I'm able to show almost any web content at the screen resolution of my laptop, and for Netflix and Youtube it's even better. I look forward to more sites providing the direct link for chromecasting, such as Netflix has.<br /><br />Sound quality also comes through well.<br /><br />One drawback: In fullscreen mode off other than Netflix and Youtube, one can't use the laptop for other purposes.
0062059963|4.0|This sequel does not disappoint. It has all the intrigue, romance, and fun of the first book. America has made her way to the Elite and boy am I thankful. There are less girls still competing, so we get to know each of them pretty well. Some we learn to hate more. Others made me wonder if America really was right for Prince Maxon.<br /><br />The love triangle is still an integral part of the story. I think I am Team Maxon, but there were points in this novel when I was Team No One. Maxon did some pretty extreme things in this novel, but by the end I understood. America on the other hand was a little annoying. She never thinks before she does. I liked her ideas behind a lot of things, but she never thought about what would come next.<br /><br />As well as getting to know the other potential princesses more, we get to learn more about the King and Queen. Queen Amberly is a likable character. I want to know more about her life before and during her Selection. America's father also intrigues me. Cass did an excellent job at revealing more in this sequel, while still making me want more. The small bits about the history of this interesting world left me wanting more! I loved the part about Halloween, And the rebels really interest me, as well. More!<br /><br />Overall, this was a really fun read. It's nothing mind bending, but it is definitely entertaining. This sequel provided answers to some of my questions from the first book, but even more it made me want MORE! I am so ready for the third book in this trilogy. I'm going to make sure I read all the short stories, too! I give The Elite a 4/5.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game would go a lot faster if I had lots of money to spend on the game, but it's still interesting.  It's a good game and not just a hidden picture game, it has various minigames.
B0094M2ITG|5.0|Very good movie. Children can see this one.A very good moral that parents dont always exagerate what parts of thier life they tell you about.
B004I744AS|5.0|I really love this app. As a Spanish teacher I have been looking for an easy to use, comprehensive, and free dictionary for my students to use. I am glad I can also zoom in  and the page readjusts automatically. I definitely recommend this to any foreign language teacher or student. Also as a personal preference, I would mention that it is a lot easier to use if you remove everything from the home page.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|The complete lack of political correctness in this series is welcome in this age of watch out what you say and who you might offend.  Cleeses's expressions of existential angst and frustration that begin as an almost invisible puff of smoke and end in a volcanic eruption of cosmic despair precipitated by such mundane catalysts as a fire extinguisher that will not work can be watched over and over again for their matchless hilarity.  Buy this series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome! I recommend it for all ages! The little minions always have me laughing and now they're in running form!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is one of the most engaging, well-written books I have read in a long time. Entertaining, thought provoking, and addictive. Enjoy!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show is great. I can watch it over and over and it just keeps getting better and better. The DVD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Can't say any thing negative.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Addictive.  I particularly like the 'shuffle' option when there are 'No More Moves'.<br />Faults?  I wish I could choose a darker background; if I hit the wrong tile when pairing, please don't highlight all the remaining available tiles.<br />I would recommend this game to a friend.
B00C2VIA52|2.0|I should not have spent any money on this.  I would not recommend this game to others.  There are better games out there.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|It recounts an episode early in the narrator's life and has a trick ending. Not much drama in the unfolding of the story. He's done much better.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This show is great. I can watch it over and over and it just keeps getting better and better. The DVD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Can't say any thing negative.
B009E3EY38|4.0|Great show!  Not 100% on SQ but still worth owning.  Jason Bonham is every bit the drummer his dad was, if not better, and Plant, Page & Jones still have it.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Good show -- worth my time to watch.  Characters are interesting and irritating at times, as they are meant to be.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|got through the levels quickly then deleted it. Only need to go through it once, that's all I have to say.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This show is great. I can watch it over and over and it just keeps getting better and better. The DVD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Can't say any thing negative.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|It's the most heartbreaking movie I've seen by far.<br /><br />Harry and Ty are drug-dealers. But they are also good kids, one bought new TV for lonely mom once he got money, and one always thought about his happy moments with mama. They might have made a step wrong sometime in middle school, then their life slowly slips from delinquency into abyss. Harry wanted a normal business with his girl Marion. Harry is not the sick drug-dealer in many movies. He is just a kid lacking guidance, a kid who has chosen a wrong way...<br /><br />Marion. She starts as a rebellious girl and ambitious designer-to-be, but ends up selling body for drugs. Her father did not ignore her. She could have made her dream. But it did not turn out well.<br /><br />What's wrong with these young people? What's wrong with their dreams? and what's wrong with our society allowing this mess to happen? They have weakness and they make mistakes, but it's too severe punishments for them, almost pointless, considering the chance their life eventually make a turn-back.<br /><br />Finally Sara the mom, a weak person on whom life has cruelly joked. She is a victim of herself and the cold environment. She loves her boy, has not bad neighbours... She is an average empty-nest mom. She is tricked into drugs, but is lost furthest.<br /><br />The heart-breaking part is not how bad things happen to people. It's how fallible persons like us can fall. Life is just crueler on them, and it is hard to blame anyone.<br /><br />Dark as life may be, but we still need to steer through it, fighting our own weakness and addictions.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|These movies are in their original theatrical release.  The quality is superb, both video and audio.  Special features are wonderful as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Careful because this is addictive! Love the minions even more. Vector is a bit difficult to get past. Abit more space is needed.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Love the big bang theory. The season arrived fast and I was so happy to get it in the mail. It is great for road  trips because it keeps you entertained for days!
B007THA4FI|1.0|So many characters who I care nothing about. Boring, lifeless, self serving. One star is one star too many. So disappointing
B001DHXT6G|5.0|This is a great collection of Star Trek: The Original Series.  I have enjoyed watching the series, with both my sons.  Fun for the whole family.
0345529057|5.0|This is the &#34;must read&#34; book (series) of the decade(s).  Given the pace at which he writes, I hope George sticks around for the final chapters.  Well, considering the way he kills off sympathetic characters ....
B006JPML7K|5.0|Great Movie for the whole family, Loved it! Worth buying, they've watched it over and over, It's paid for already.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Unique playing style, great variety of upgrades, easily burn several hours playing! A great game to play when you have a nice spot to chill
B0091REZMW|5.0|The game is very good and enjoyable, I love playing it.  I wish the lights were on in all of the rooms.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So far I'm very happy with the product.  It's been easy to purchase and read on my Android.  The pages turn quickly which is a plus.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I am hooked. My daughter and her friends watch Pretty Little Liars so I wanted to see what the fuss is all about.  Got me hooked.
B005KXU83G|4.0|These tracks are all time favorite songs from Bob Segar,  Price was fantastic.  Since songs are from  live concerts, there is a at a live concert tone to them all.  Enjoying this on my Kindle Fire HD, was easy to buy and download.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was full of twists.  It started a little slow, but I couldn't put it down once I hit the halfway point.  Found myself going back to it every chance I could.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Wasn't quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as I expected it to be, but I thoroughly enjoyed Fey's humorous stories about her career and the challenges she has faced as a successful woman. I hear the audiobook is funnier.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's pretty jumpy until you use an android app, if your using a chrome browser to look at video, the browser is going to transcode (compress and degrade the quality)the file and then send it over the wifi back to the chromecast, and that makes it very jumpy. Using an app to watch netfilx and youtube is very easy, but they need the iPhone app soon! I personally would not have launched with out it, but google probably turned the lack of an iOS app into an advantage, might of sold some additional Android based things doing so. It was easy to setup and it is easy to use esp from the proper app, but without it, it's jumpy even of an 802.11-N wifi network.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|The game is simple, very easy and promote attacking weaker opponents. If any thing, if thing happened more quickly would be the only improvement I could suggest.
B008220C38|1.0|So I just watched the movie Anna Karenina, starring Keria Knightly and I got to say this movie was over dramatize, stylist, artistic piece of poop! I have seen some pretty bad movies of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, but this was the worst! Most of the cast was English! The English are not very good at playing people from other countries or culture and this turned a very Russian story to very English one. Only the Russian people who were the extras in the background spoke Russian.<br /><br />None of the actors went through culture training, because it made the story flat and strange. I would prefer this movie be played by Russian actors. Actor's mannerism just made it strange. None of the actors had Russian accents, so like any other movie played in Europe, European people speak with English accent.<br /><br />Another thing, this movie was totally confusing and not clear, and one of the reasons why the movie was confusing beyond confusing, was it was too artistic, don't know why the director wanted to make this film artistic and beautiful, but it did no good for the story. Another thing that cause the movie to be confusing was:<br /><br />First when you begin to watch this movie, you think \\"oh going to be theatrical\\" Then it shifts into Belle. There are many scenes that set on the stage, but then it moves off stage goes into more film-like structure. For example: Anna's lover enters a horse race, the horse race is on stage and the on-lookers are the audience and as the race begins the horse falls off stage. Which did NOTHING for the movie! It was like going to play and the actors on stage can't make up their minds if they speaking to you or their scene partner. There was a lot of back and forth.<br /><br />Relationships in the story were not developed. You did not know that Anna fell in love with this other man, until the character told you they were in love. Or Kitty fall in love with Anna's lover. So you are sitting there wondering \\"Oh, you two love each other?\\" And the love scene did nothing for the story, it was more of up close dance of moving your hands this way and that way with Anna moaning over again \\"Murdering\\". If you want to turn on your lover, I guess saying murdering gets them pretty hot and heavy. Then there was this one scene where I thought it was going to turn into up close porno. No, seriously! Anna is outside with her lover and she straddles him and the camera moves closely on some French kissing. All these dumb things did not help the movie!<br /><br />Acting was ok, I was sorely disappointed in Knightly's performance, because she did so good in A Dangerous Method, but her acting was ok. And there were scenes where I just wanted to feed her a burger, because in some, she looked like she was going to snap or break and there's nothing appealing seeing someone's bones on their back and in one scene she looked like she had 16 inch waist. She could have done better in her dance scene, she seem not smooth and not graceful, when the people in the background move better than you and they are not the lead there is a problem.<br /><br />Now, Jude Law did a great job in the movie, he connected and even though he had an English accent he acted more Russian than a lot of the other actors, because he understood what he was talking about and connected. And his parts made more sense than other thing that was going on this film.<br /><br />Anna's lover in this movie annoyed the hell out of me, he was over the top flamboyant in his movements, everything he did  had a feminine flare, he looked like woman with a mustache. Everything he did from lighting a cigarette had to look beautiful and every time he took off his coat he had to spin around before taking it off. I just wanted to slap him.<br /><br />Every day people do not act like this, certainly not Russians back in Imperial Russia! It made the movie hard to understand!<br /><br />And I really hate to say this too, knowing my Russian history, all the rich people were so elegant looking and there clothes look like it cost an arm and leg and I couldn't help wondering how many Russians were staving outside in the fidget cold, so the rich people can look all pretty with their stupid parties. And some of the costumes did not fit with the time.<br /><br />Anna really annoy me in this film, wonder if she really like this in the book. She falls in love with another man, her husband finds out, tells her she can't do what she doing, she doesn't stop, when her husband shuns her and she has her lover's baby, I guess she dying in bed and she begs for her husband's forgiveness. Her husband finally forgives her, then in second she is cruel to him. You would think once she had her lover and in the middle of getting divorce she would be happy? NOOOOOOOO! She wants to go out and see a play, and her lover is concern how people will think and say, she tells him \\"I don't care. Well, it bites her in the ass and the people ostracize her and she feels horrible. Later she burst into tears and says to her lover \\"If you really did love me, you wouldn't let me go!\\" This woman has issues with a capital I. One moment she is happy and in the next totally sad and upset She kills herself at the end by throwing her self on the tracks of an upcoming train. Best thing in the film! If you are so miserable with yourself, you should do the whole world a favor just throw yourself off a cliff! When she throws herself onto the tracks she says \\"forgive me!\\" This woman cause her own misery.<br /><br />Only thing the movie got right, is showing how many rich Russians live a screw up lives and how many did with Tolstov did and live out in the country to have a more simple life.<br /><br />This movie would have been a lot better, if the actors went through culture training, if the movie was just simple. But this movie sucks. When doing Tolstoy do not think you can do a better story than him. Watch the Russian version from the 60's.egant looking and there clothes look like it cost an arm and leg and I couldn't help wondering how many Russians were staving outside in the fidget cold, so the rich people can look all pretty with their stupid parties.

B00B6QXN56|5.0|Acoustic Joe Bonamassa is better than highly amplified instruments.<br />Also, I don't like live performances but rather studio.<br />However, the audience in this recording did not detract at all.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This app is so cool. If you want to get it you should totally get it. In this app you get to complete levels that are so fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great!I couldn't put it down, I read it in a day..can't wait to read the next two.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|An excellent story of the 1930s  and  the years1940 and 1941. There were many heroes and President Roosevelt was not one of them. His stalling and playing to the American Public prolonged what the United States could have done to prevent the WW2 from becoming such a disaster for the 10-20 million victims. I see much of what is happening in our country in the last 15 to 20 years  being a replica of that era. History continues to repeat ,we never learn.  happily there were  realistic leaders, Democratic and Republican who forced the Administration to finally  lead  our Country.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Bogart, Bergman, all the great cast of actors were superb. It is the best picture<br />Watching it on TCM gives me a better picture quality, however. Maybe blueray<br />would be better.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|Very competently directed and acted drama that happens to have powers involved.  Exactly how any XMen movie should be done.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Although not my favorite from Khaled Hosseini, it was still poignant and well written a great story teller, the author weaves a tale worth reading.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works flawlessly through my phone and tablet. I don't turn on my ps3 anymore to watch netflix. I hope soon more apps will supoort it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great ALMOST copy of the computer version of minecraft. And to the people saying they should add things that are in computer minecraft (like the nether), SHUT UP. You're just spamming up the reviews. Notch is already working on making it a copy of computer minecraft. They're actually doing it very quickly, and I'm impressed. If you want to know what Notch is working on right now, you can google it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game that doesn't take any skills. Just shoot the falling targets and enjoy the fun. The upgrades makes this game addictive.
B0031R5K68|5.0|found the constant descriptions of historic locations too drawn out and it became quite painful. in the end i just skipped over them<br />aside from that, dan brown didnt let us down. it was till a good yarn.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging, yet fun puzzles to complete .  The key to remember is that you have to complete each puzzle in a certain order before you can move on to the next level.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Good sci-fi flick. Ending could of used a little more fleshing out. Recommend watching to anyone who likes sci-fi or action.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The price is great and it works as advertised for Netflix and YouTube.  No issues there.<br />Putting other webpages on your tv is sometimes hit or miss but should only get better as more companies get the software and work with Google.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I really love this series - good story lines and characters - kept me going until I watched the whole thing. Truly enjoyed!
B006I1OB0U|1.0|It is unnecessary if you have purchased the Chistmas episode which I believe is in the second season. It would be nice if this fact was revealed in the discription so customers knew and could then make an informed discussion to purchase or not instead of being mislead.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of instutions at begning I like how the levels go fast.,it is such a great horse game and I jst got it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids love this game.  It does freeze up . Twice already. I am not sure if it's my phone or the game. I even play it sometimes this is a game for all ages
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The story is unusual - magical surrealism. This is what I liked about it. It not great writing, but the story makes up for it.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|So engaging it draws you into their world of old England and their life and lives under the weight of history. Excellent casting set in the perfect environment this is a must see show.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I got this for my Tenth Doctor cosplay and I am very happy with it. It looks just like the original and is fun to have. Plus the invisible ink end with the UV light is fun!<br /><br />Definitely a must-have for any fan of Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, or Doctor Who in general!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Like the subject says, at a small cost I can stream my favorite shows and movies at Netflix.  Watching my family's videos via youtube on the big screen is great.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I can never get past the loading screen. I tried reinstalling on my Kindle Fire with no luck. very sad because this looks right up my alley.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The device is easy to install, easy to configure, and easy to use. If your looking for an easy way to get media onto your tv.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes that sort of dark, twisted drama. It is certainly gruesome at times, but if you don't mind a bit of gore, you'll love it! The storyline is compelling and keeps you wanting more. The character development and psychological aspect of the show are absolutely fantastic.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Loved the style and humour intertwined throughout Altucher's book. The way he used himself as example of colossal failure helps you to not only identify with him but to empathize and cheer for his ultimate success. The lesson of learning to embrace failure is foreign to so many in today's focus on all the winners in our society. There is not enough focus on the hard work, persistence and dedication needed to achieve one's dreams. And with his reimbursement offer what do you have to loose? Open your horizon of thought and \\"Choose Yourself\\"!,
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Like middle command but better. Nice old school Atari game with a modern feel. If you like meddle command this game will give you more options. You not limited with how many middles you have and you can repair buildings with money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has been super addictive and fun.  I couldn't get myself to stop playing.  I just wanted to make to the next level. It is really fun.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This movie was very well done and the story is very touching. Definitely recommended for fans of the drama genre!
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|This is probably the most fast-paced book I've read all year.<br /><br />It's really easy to read and also really enjoyable.<br /><br />Teens will absolutely love the book. I'm actually in my mid-twenties and I still loved it.<br /><br />Watch out Harry Potter, you've finally got some real competition!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.I think it is a very good love story within the hunger games.So if you are looking for a good romance,you found it.
B001NA6096|5.0|A soft understated story of a 24-hour love affair in Vienna. They talk, and talk and talk...and connect.<br /><br />Romance at its most realistic, without fabricated melodrama or tragedy.<br /><br />Lovely. The first chapter in a fine trilogy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have had the KIndle app for my actual kindle, for my Mac, and my iPod. The Kindle app works great on all of them. I have had no problem with downloading or reading.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very cool rendition of the original game!<br /><br />It is made a little easier due to the user interface but cool nevertheless.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Great movie, Hope they make a second one ! I just wish the movie was longer and would love to find out if the little doggie is okay.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|My husband loved it and received it very quickly...one of the best purchases I've made in a long time ...ty
B004LWZW7E|5.0|a really good movie with Justin , he is a great actor and this is great action movie . Great movie
B008NMT684|5.0|Our 2 grandchildren and nephew love this puzzle.  They are really into puzzles at are 3 and 4. Great for  eye and hand coordnation skills
B009R54MGW|5.0|I am a big fan of Phillipa Gregory's historical novels and this one did not disappoint.  Anything I am trying to read after this leaves me a bit.......mmmmm.....unfulfilled?!?
B008LXZEYU|1.0|I really don't understand the love. It's just a bad movie that has the the worst sin - it's terribly boring. It isn't particularly funny. It has it's moments, but I just don't get the love.
B0036FYO12|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and felt the underlying plot is still relevant even if the technology used today is more advanced.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Our grandchildren love puzzles and this is a hit with them.  Easy for their little hands to pieces around, colorful. Would recommend to anyone with little ones.
B00024I2Z4|3.0|I like the quality of this movie ; however, the case was promised to me to be in good condition with minor wear which was not the case. Most of the side of the case was broken off and the cover doesn't even close. The picture of Mulan on the cover is faded dark and there are a few scratches on it.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|I've been waiting for all the 3 movies to come out on Blu Ray. I'm only a little upset that Beyond Thunderdome didn't have much extras and behind the scene features, but other than that I'm happy.
B000FC13E0|5.0|Although I didn't understand the science behind it, I have to say this was an excellent novel & quite frightening! Who knows who's experimenting with what out there? Stuff like this could be happening in our world - scares the crap out of me.<br /><br />Don't start unless you have the time to read it all! Very fast paced from start to finish!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Our grandson loves minecraft, we have bought the upgrade app and the game for the xbox.  He likes that he can make all kinds of homes, buildings.  I love the different things he comes up with.

B00CS74W0C|5.0|Great book series  Bought them on my kindle and thought they were better than the 50 Shades of Grey Series by a ton.
0156027321|2.0|To me the critical weakness in \\"Life of Pi\\" is the faith in zoos as superior to healthy/natural habitats. Am I just too dull to think that God's Garden was, & is still, mainly, though damaged by humans, vastly healthier than the concentration camps/prisons we [fallen] humans call \\"zoos\\"?<br /><br />  Richard Parker said it all when he did not look back but went directly into the tropical forest--even an alien continent beats a boat. Of course Richard Parker would not have wanted to have earlier tried to escape his zoo cell in India because he would have to go days in an unknown direction to find a relatively livable environment in today's[or 1970s] India.<br /><br />So, read \\"Pi\\" with care. \\"Pi's\\" author though, is in \\"good\\" company: Darwin was full of often poorly thought out & misleading ideas about the lessons to be learned from enslaved pigeons, dogs, etc.<br /><br />Bless you Mr. Richard Parker & bless you too Mr/s. God, The Universal Parent/Origin
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I liked the movie but had to watch it twice to get the movies better points.  The movie was rated with four stars only because I had to watch it .twice.  The idea of the clones was great and the docking with the mother ship was a great moment with all the clones that were available and a great ending with the destruction of the mother ship
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun for kids and adults alike.  My only complaint is that it freezes up some on my kindle. But besides that I love it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I am thoroughly impressed with this game. I knew what to expect, as im sure most people have played some version of this game, but this is a very good version. Great graphics and quick responses. Fun upgrades.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|ever since the latest update I can no longer open the game. i get stuck st the loading screen every time. fix it now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Got this app, didn't think it was going to be that great because I play pc. I am very impressed, but they need to add a hunger bar, sprinting, infinite worlds, and get rid of the chest glitches. 4'5/5
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|Shane has long been my all time favorite western.  I have had a VHS tape for years, but the Blue Ray version is just so much sharper that more details can be enjoyed.  It is unforunate that the Teton Mountains were hazy during most of the fllming, so that their beauty could not be fully appreciated.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|The story itself was very good, but it was so full of proofing errors as to be laughable at times.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A sweet reminder to use your brain, angry birds is fun,  this really makes you think!  I love it! Try it you'll like it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is an amazing series, I wish I could come up with my a better but no words comes to mind. I wish I could right a better review but the book was amazing like I said and hard to describe.
B003CH9PTU|4.0|good story, good acting.  As in any good tv show or movie,  you forget they are acting.  We're catching up on the whole series.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As usual, Tom Clancy comes through again.  It was a great read for both my husband and for me.  Loved it!
B00CTSVE3S|5.0|\\"Philadelphia\\" isn't just about AIDS or homophobia. It's a story of all the biases and prejudices today. And how wrong they all are. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington bring life and emotion to this film  that draws in the viewer. One can see the viewpoint from both characters' sides. The supporting parts are all strong commanding performances from Mary Steenbergen, Jason Robards, Antonio Banderas and Joanne Woodward. Although today AIDS isn't the automatic death sentence that it was at the time that the movie was made, the movie is still timeless in its portrayal of the importance of family love, the hatred and fears of those who are 'different', and the ways some people try to camouflage their bigotry (he was fired because \\"he didn't do his job well\\", not because he was gay with AIDS.) The Blu-ray disc is flawless with some scenes so clear they look like a live performance. The audio commentary by the director and screen writer is very informative and they answer to several critics of the film as to why certain scenes were done and certain dialogue used. I'm very pleased with this disc.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I had thought that this would be a short game I could beat in a week. I was soo wrong. This game is not only addicting but also fun. But the game is only free if you're patient. You can buy in-game currency and diamonds to speed up processes. This is great for kids and adults alike.
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|I really expected something special since there are so many 5 star reviews.  Mind you we are huge Star Trek Fans - both of us.  However (SPOILER ALERT HERE) when we have the death scene from the Wrath of Kahn in reverse--we looked at each other, rolled our eyes and said almost at the same time---you have got to be kidding!  Not to mention an old flame of Captain Kirk's that gets herself on board under an assumed name.  Does she get dressed down?  She is in Star Fleet, certainly there would be a reprimand.  Heck no!  She makes big eyes at Kirk and everything is OK.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, it just fell far short of 5 stars.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is up to his usual standards.  I've read almost everything he's written. and will keep on doing so.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|i always love ken follett books..... this one was mesmerizing ... could not put it down.---<br />a history lesson too. ...<br />i learned alot about world war 1 and the reasons behind it.<br /><br />recommended very highly
B007AL48UK|2.0|Symbols are not recognizable to play this game.  It's frustrating.  I have other Mahjong games on Kindle that are MUCH better.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The book is like twilight, but with less love story. Not a bad read though. the plots were easy to spot, but the last big reveal surprised me.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was as good as all of Follett's works. Filler:  all work and no play make Jack a dull boy;  redrum, redrum; here's Johnny.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great tool for killing apps and clearing up space. I use it for my kindle and, so far, it works very well.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|This is really cool.  Easy to play and has hints for when you can't see the matches.  I really like it.
174316498X|4.0|While I found this book to have a slow start, once I got into the heart of the story-within-a-story, I could hardly put it down.  I found the chapters dealing with the present day, in which a middle-aged woman and her siblings get together to celebrate their dying mother's birthday, to be somewhat less interesting than the flashbacks to the era in which their mother had come of age.  The mysteries and secrets embedded in the past had me hooked, however, and I found myself hardly able to stop thinking about the mother's story as piece after piece of the puzzle are slowly put together.  I definitely recommend this book, and don't be discouraged if you can't get into it at the start; the flashbacks that make up the meat of the story are worth the slower-paced, present-day opening.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Love this game.  A lot of different card arrangements to keep you playing.  I gave it a 4 Because after you have played through the courses, you come upon the ones that require golf bucks.  If you haven't saved all you earned (and it is a lot,) and purchased clubs when needed, you only have enough to play a few of them.  I solved this problem by removing it from my device and reinstalling it for hour and hours of fun again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Is A Really Really Really Really Good App Application Take Your Pick I Don't Mind Watching Simpson's Bart Just Said Geek Leek Oh Yes The App (That's My Favourite) It's A Good App Buy It Or Just Get It Cose It's Free
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I love the game but when I first got it I only could play on two planets and because I wanted to play more I paid 2 bucks for the planet.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Its fun and quick for wasting time. Great for sitting n a waiting room. Would recomend it to my friends
B004DLPXAO|5.0|works great on every type of device that I have.  no problems.  It syncs great no matter where I am.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I din't know which one to choose, I never played Solitaire before so I thought I would try this. It is fun now that I am getting it.
B009AY04A8|3.0|but this one....I have NEVER been so annoyed at a game in my life! The docking of 20 seconds for random taps is fine IF my taps had all been random which they weren't. They were used to zoom in and out and to move the screen around. I finally figured out that I could just leave the stylus on the screen and slide it off toward the edges after the screen stopped moving and get repositioned that way instead of tapping. But even THAT'S not what's causing the 3 star review - it's the fact that on a couple of screens they had more than one of an item, I.e. dice and the sharper looking dice weren't right. So I wasted taps on them trying to pick them up only to finally find ONE die all alone that was the right one. It said DICE not DIE. So between the 20 second docks (I know I can turn them off) and the multiple items on the same screen was just enough to make me blow a gasket and I have never been that irritated by a game in a long time and never since I've owned a Fire and Fire HD. The only reason this isn't getting one star is because Nevosoft has always been a good company for me and I own most of their games. They must have been stoned or something to put out that much dialogue and make so many errors in the choices and have typos all before I've even gotten done with trying to figure out why I'm being given the danged box! I haven't even gotten done with chapter 1 and I'm so annoyed with it I can't stand the thought of going back to it until I settle down.<br /><br />I sure hope they see this review and check their game because if I buy one that's this bad, they've lost a customer.
0345528581|5.0|bought it for my son who is a lot younger & tougher than me.  I tried some of the exercises in the newspaper article about the book.  I was exhusted.
B009WUBERW|1.0|Don't waste your time, even free on Prime.  Zero plot.  Zero character development.  Lousy attempts at humor/recalling old lines from better movies.  Sitting through this is like watching a baseball card.  Sorry, governator.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|The game itself has a great plot. It's as nice hidden objects game mixed with detective work. My only complaint is how dark everything is. You can't see some of the objects you have to find unless you use a hint.
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|The crime solving part of the novel was OK. The focus on the main character who struggle with alcoholism was difficult for me to read.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|Very addicting game. I love it. I find myself playing it for hours at a time. You will not regret buying it.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|1: If you are a Trekky (like myself); Be sure to KNOW this movie veers slightly off the well-beaten path.<br /><br />2: So long as you keep #1 in mind, you will LOVE this movie!<br /><br />3: For people new to this movie that are fond of articulate and well thought out plots covered by the most epic action and pillow tossing moments: This movie is your dream come true!<br /><br />In hindsight, I can recall every gripping detail of how myself, and my daughter reacted when watching this movie together... I mentioned \\"pillow\\" in #3 because you will find yourself grabbing and wrenching on the closest pillow while the action scenes bring you so close to the fight, you'll find it almost impossible NOT to react with flinching, twisting, turning and a whole bunch of \\"OHHHHHHH MY GOOOODDD! WHAAAATT!!!AHHHHH!!!\\".. Then things settle down only time enough for you to realize that you are not in the movie ONLY to be sucked into the vortex of \\"HOLY S\\"*liding door!* [Misspell intentional]<br /><br />Seriously, this movie will give your entire body a workout and you won't know until the end when you can feel your muscles pulsating and your fingers still a snow white from the heart-pounding, in-your-face action!<br /><br />The storyline and the characters are a buzz and make the movie THAT much more believable! If anything, this movie makes Star Trek more real than ever before!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|The game is okay. It was fun to play with for awhile. Very entertaining when hour bored and have absolutely NOTHING else to do.
B000R3NNDQ|2.0|This is much more about coping with change than driving it. It provides tools to nurse an organization through externally drive change, but does little to help you develop your staff to become change agents. In effect, the hero of fable is in fact the melting iceberg.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I so enjoy these books.  A bit of history and a a great story you can't go wrong there . . . . .
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|Downloaded the game last night,i checked my kindle this morning to play it but it wont open the game...so disappointed,needs money back :(
B0084AXZK0|4.0|This book was an amazing look into the beautiful and its connection to good and evil. It's idea of redemption intense. I recommend it to all
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Brilliant, original story. Lead actress is stunning, totally believable in each role. Watched it back to back over 2 nights. Can't wait for season 2
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I loved this book. It was fantastically amazing and great. These are only a few words to describe this book.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It seems like East of Eden written for another time and audience. The author places vignettes that seem to have no connection, but as the vignettes become full fledged pictures, the connections are clear.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Great card game I really enjoy the game play,each of the four races offers something different.really easy to pick up.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Although the show lasted for 5 seasons, which would classify the show a success, I think it ended too soon! I would love for the show to have gone on a few more seasons. I was really sorry to see Dr. Weir get written out of the show and Dr. Carson too- what WERE they thinking???? In any event, Joe Flanigan really carried this show very, very well. He was the glue that held the other characters together. I like him better than the SG-1 guy....MacGuyver?? I forget his name....oh yes, Dean Anderson. Anyway....good show for escapist entertainment.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the minions. They're. such cute little guys!  Lots of fun running and jumping to get around obstacles. Like Temple Run for minions. All ages will like this game!
B002ELIXCA|4.0|glad i waited,am engrossed,watching episode after another i cannot imagine waiting week after week patience has it's vertue or at least that is what normal people say i am just doing things the Harry way my way the only way I can!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very nice time passer I recommend highly. The objective is rather simple but nevertheless it's a five star app, very fun.
0385523394|3.0|Orange is the new Black is about a middle class white woman, with money, an extensive support network, and a fiance, spending a year in a minimum federal prison. That alone should tell you a lot about the story she's about to write. Sadly Piper doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what it's like for women in federal prison. Everything is glossed over in this book, and she spends more time discussing how her life and her family were affected, than what it was really like inside, and how the prison system treats women and inmates. You could swap &#34;prison&#34; for &#34;summer camp&#34; in this book and largely have the same story.<br /><br />What's worse is that because this book only glosses over the penal system in America, they went on to make a Netflix show that completely and utterly misses the point. While the book may hint that federal prison for women is all family, love, lesbians, and nasty guards, the tv show turned the book into the L Word Behind Bars.<br /><br />Bottom line: Piper's experience was unlike 99% of women in prison, and her experience after prison is completely unlike 99% of women getting out of prison. While the book presents one, small, narrow view of what it's like for a woman in prison, it completely leaves out the truth. If you're looking for something to tell you more about life for women in prison then this is not the book. If you're looking for white, middle class, lesbians behind bars, then this is probably more for you. The more you learn the truth the more this book will disappoint..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|not so hard that its frustrating and its also not so easy that it not entertaining. I just wish there were more levels!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Hosseini captures the life in Afghanistan through the complex lives of all of his well-nuanced characters in the book.  Touching as well as educational.

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I am so glad they made the plot intertwine like this.  Life is choices and living with the consequences of that choice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is perfect! So much fun and ultra addictive:) it is challenging without being frustrating. The slow build in speed allows a person to get adjusted and progress more each time. My husband and I both live it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read the whole thing in a day. This is high praise from me being that I have dyslexia and read kinda slowly.<br />It was touching and I haven't cried this much since reading the final Harry Potter book. It's beautifully written and I fell in love with the characters, they feel so real and wonderful.<br />I knew John Green was awesome from watching youtube but I think now he is my hero. He has inspired me to read and write more for sure.<br />DFTBA!!! <3 <3
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Not sure why Anthony Bourdain fascinates me so much, but this look at the inside of the Resteraunt business is funny, gross, and honest. If you are a fan of his shows, you should read this because you'll get a lot more about what's in his head.
B0091REZMW|5.0|FUN and keeps your mind alert. 11 year old loves it. Worth the purchase. Need to have a big screen instead of a kindle screen. Easier to find items.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Im still reading it but enjoying my new lifestyle. This is a great book if you want some advise and help getting started.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It is a good, easy, fun game at least for a little while. I have not found any problems yet.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent product. Easy to setup.<br />Good quality picture.<br />Good prices.<br />I'm going to buy my second one.<br />I recommend to everyone with android os
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Another classic under my belt. It was a wonderful book that everyone must read. Entangling was a horrible person. Enjoyed it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is fantastic game for kids to play when they are bored and don't want to go out side and its boring inside
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app, always works &amp; is right on. All my family uses my tablet to checked the weather now. I deffinately reccomend to all.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Like the game it is really fun. One of the best games I have. Like how the pictures are the clue.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This a simple game that you'll spend hours playing.  Unlike most classic tower defence type games, this one also requires some aim and timing skill from you.  This adds an extra layer of excitement that keeps you playing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Extremely easy to set up and use. Streaming videos from all my devices is simple and easy, Best purchase I've made in decades. I've recommended it to all my friends.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I heard part of this song on the radio in my car and loved it. Upon returning home I googled using some of the words and eventuly found the correct name of the song and the singer which is Enrique and the song Hero.An older song originally sung by Maria Carey.His version of the song is just simply beautiful.The other songs on the CD are also very good but the best is Hero. Maggie Abens
0345525558|5.0|It takes great skill to make a reader connect and empathize with a character as flawed and angry as Victoria. I was hooked from the first chapter. I was completely enthralled by the story, but the bonus of learning a little about the \\"language of flowers\\" was just delightful. Amazing story that left me wanting to know what happens next!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great cast, especially Gabrial M-something, the uber lawyer, and the kid who plays Mike Ross, the protoge, who accidentally becomes a lawyer. Great premise, intriguing stories, one of my fave shows of all time.
B000063UR1|5.0|I have actually looked forward to writing a review of this movie since I ordered it from Amazon, as it has thrilled me since the first time I saw it on a black-and-white TV set on network TV almost 30 years ago. When I first saw it, I was STUNNED that the same actor who played the horrific &#34;bad guy&#34; in the John Wayne film &#34;The Cowboys&#34; was able to portray a sensationally terrific &#34;good guy&#34; in &#34;Silent Running&#34;, demonstrating Bruce Dern's obvious talent. Bruce Dern's artistic talent aside, &#34;Silent Running&#34; is classic sci-fi, and I only wish I'd had the opportunity to see it on the big screen when it first came out in 1971. By the way, the DVD I received also has some pretty cool special features (as usual these days), one of which is an interview with Bruce Dern. I enjoyed his interview almost as much as I did the movie! Good goin' Bruce! (by the way, Bruce Dern is also one of the hired gunslingers who falls to the guns of John Wayne and Kirk Douglas in the classic western &#34;The War Wagon&#34;, one of my favorites).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is really an e-book / audio book that lets you choose what version you prefer.  I find that to be a huge advantage as most different Christian churches split hairs on a few interpretations.  In this app you can choose your favorite.<br />The ability to interact with bookmarks, notes, highlights, reading plans, and having it read like an audio book impressed me. Best app I found for the Bible. Great Job YouVersion!
B000002L80|5.0|I love this album of Talking Heads songs.  Albeit, at the time, they seem to have made the leap into the serious mainstream....kudos to them, if you are more interested in Alternative Rock, you may be disappointed if you don't already know the songs.  Still, it is a great addition to the collection.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|Bad acting and very predictable not worth a purchase let alone even renting. Wait for tv to see how bad it is
B008P1EWIM|5.0|The look is great and easy to use.  The application is easy to use and everything is presented in an easy to understand way.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This type of game is fun and good way to spend some down time. Keeps you coming back Sat after day.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|my grandchildren like it, although they seem to have gotten bored with it pretty quickly.  maybe they'll come back to it after a break.  graphics are very good.
B002LVVCQM|4.0|A masterful collage of scientific evolutionary proofs. A little heavy on the nay sayers though. The evolution of religion<br />itelf could have put the arguement for biological evolution in a less confrontational context.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The book provided all I needed to know about this eating plan, and after following the diet for three weeks, find that the book was really complete and accurate in the information provided. I've lost 5 lbs. so far (my goal) in three weeks, and feel great! I plan on continuing to follow this eating plan, as it's the easiest plan I've ever encountered that provides great results. I currently take a low dose of a statin for elevated cholesterol, so am also looking forward to my next blood test to see how my cholesterol has improved also.
B006M4F67A|4.0|typical mahjong game but satisfying.  haven't had it long so i can't really say how much i'll continue to like it--i may get bored.
B003XE1DR4|5.0|I bought these for summer and they changed my life. Although the first week I did I get a blister, within 8 days they fit without any rubbing. These shoes are amazing. I have worn them every single day from May- August. I can walk briskly in them, take them to the beach, get them wet and sandy, and wear them to work the next day. My feet which sweat never smell in these shoes-ever.  They can be dressed up or worn to the beach, you can even shower in them. Considering that they were only $26 they have gone above and beyond my expectations. I just ordered 2 more pairs.
B0074V3712|5.0|Anyone interested in the influence of genetics on animal and human behavior should read this book slowly and very thoughtfully.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Finding yourself takes courage, fearlessness, and drive. This book encompasses all of these and more. It felt like I was there with her.
B004GYY714|4.0|I have used TuneIn and TuneIn Pro for years on my droid and iPhone....good variety and minimal dropping out of stream
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Easy to learn. Great waste of time. Challenging game that tests your ability to plot where things will be. Get it now.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Didn't use it because I had to get a new Kindle Fire instead. When I first tried to return it, I was advised to just keep it as I was a good customer.  When I  found my account was not credited, I tried to return it again a couple of days ago and was told it was a day too late.  I'm unhappy about the whole thing since I tried to return it with the charger that I had ordered at the same time.  It was never even taken out of its box when I found out the problem was the Kindle Fire itself and I replaced that.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The game is very good. I really need to get used to zoom into the search pictures, but other than that, it is very good.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|it is fun and easy to use I remember the old middle command and this is close enough to the other to be fun
B003G4W49C|3.0|I enjoyed this book and the premise was intriguing, but I gave it only three stars because I didn't find it as captivating as I wanted to.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|This video is very interesting, and video streaming is seamless.<br />However, if I could use subtitles for this video, I would give this five stars.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|really easy game and fun to pass time, I play it when waiting  for the bus or even a tv commercial to be over
B009CYCF5I|5.0|Not a long time fan... In fact came across you first during a weird relationship in which u shed a lot of light on for me #funhouse album<br /><br />Then this album hit and I couldn't believe how much you understood me, (and others), how my experiences were not my own only but another's as well and the hardships endured were challenging but rewarding. You are a star my beautiful lady and I enjoy your voice, your performance, but most of all the song lyrics as you carefully share with us your experiences love you and your music. :)
B004XZR63M|5.0|Recommended to me by my grandson who is majoring in business in his senior year of college. I enjoyed it reading it through his eyes and  his situation..
B00062PN6I|4.0|The sound quality for the price is great. I would hate to pay a ton of money for studio quality headphones. I felt comfortable buying these and found that they deliver a broad spectrum of crisp sound.
B005IF7HNA|1.0|Another reviewer has already reported the same issue - the 4 discs for Miracle Day don't work for some reason.  I contacted Amazon and they very helpfully offered to issue a return label and refund my cost if I chose to return all discs.  Of course, I could always then re-order the collection but I'm a bit leery of this seller now.  Anyway, Amazon is willing to work with you if you contact them.  Too bad, Torchwood is a great series and I was looking forward to seeing MD.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Ok nothing spectacular but does ok use it but use yahoo weather on phone more often. Yahoo has better interface and is free also
B00B2166BS|5.0|Great product in every way this should come as the original charging cable. I am very happy with it delivery was a little slow.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very nice game. Its reminds me of storm the keep which I loved. I Spent all on explosive radius for easier time hittingin the beginning which is a must.. :3
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|This movie kept you on the edge of your seats.  The plot could've been a little tighter.  Mark Walberg was phenomenal!
B009AY04A8|5.0|I love the graphics and the storyline. Definitely a game to download and enjoy. I am looking forward to trying some of their other games.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The world is very imaginative.  They have 4 seasons, but each can last for years.  Once you get that concept, you realize that this world is a feudal sort of monarchy where it's all about politics and murder.  Justice?  Not much.  The strong, the dishonorable, the manipulative and stealthy survive.  I'm looking forward to watching the series if only to see how different it is from what I envision.  I'm continuing to read even though book 5 got some pretty bad reviews.  I'm enjoying it and I do see the story behind the characters.  It's not Pern or Darkover, but it's good.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book takes you on an emotional journey through the perspective of man's best friend.  A great read, couldn't put it down!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This book is hard to read because it's filled with so much sadness.  It's easy to become attached to the characters.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|This Is It is to MJ fans what Let It Be is to Beatles' fans. it was the final curtain for MJ. Great to see him working 'behind the scenes' Nobody will ever dance like that. R.I.P MJ
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|I loved this book!  I already loved Grumpy Cat, and this book is just an excuse to see a few more photos of her grumpiness.  Pretty funny, worth the price.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This has got to be one of the BEST TV series to come in a good-long while.  Suspense, drama, action, love and the &#34;guy gets the girl&#34; is all in here. I say it is best to watch from season 1. You'll pick your favorite character(s) as well as your not so nice characters and watch them and the rest of the show with a LOT of interest. May not be for the younger generation. I say 12 and under probably won't like it too much but it should entertain those 13+!!!  I hope you will enjoy it as much as my family and I have.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This will change the way media is consumed off of the internet.<br /><br />Great as an addition to a bedroom or family room.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|happy with it<br />good game. keeps me occupied. I'm only on level 8 though, I still have a ways to go before I am finished with it.
B0002S947K|5.0|I love this CD, even more then the other CD I have by him- beg, steal or borrow? Actually, I should not say that because I really do love both. This one is a solo CD-Beg, borrow or steal he sings with another band. I play the heck out of them both but am leaning towards Trouble as a personal favorite. It's folksy, bluesy, alternative and Ray has such a unique voice-you either love him or you hate him. I love him. My husband really hates him unfortunately-but we have different tastes in music he loves Lady Gaga while i do not. I love deep gravel blues tunes. This CD Rocks!!! Buy it, right away, right now-you will not regret it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great variety, good sound and very customizable; can adjust the volume of various noises combined to suit yourself. Worked great during my vacation!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Can't wait for more of the classics.Great graphics.Remember when I had to pay to play this.have to try it on my kids.
B008G12ERC|5.0|This is my first and only CD from Muse. I love the song &#34;madness.&#34; Several of the other songs are interesting as well-but I am a newbie when it comes to electronic types of music. Still it is nice to listen to, on an upbeat sort of day. Well worth the investment-it seems to have mass appeal. Muse has a very unique sound. If this appeals to you, i suggest you buy this CD-I do not regret it for even one hot minute!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very additive, simple yet exciting at the same time; great for brain exercise.<br /><br />Also this game doesn't access user's private info, which is a plus.
B003VANOFY|2.0|Bought this headset to replace my H760. H760 is ok, but it's not very durable, at all, and the mic sucks. So when I spent more than twice the amount of money, I thought it would be an awesome buy. I also thought that the connection between the USB dongle and the headset would at least be AS good as the H760.<br /><br />It's not.<br /><br />At least 3-5 times a day while using this headset, whether I am sitting less than 2 feet from the dongle or am 10 feet away across the room just listening to music or watching Hulu, the headset/dongle connection will just drop for no apparent reason. It doesn't warn you, it doesn't do anything except the sounds coming in from your lappy or desktop are interrupted for about 3-5 seconds. Even when the Logitech headset agent says I have 10 hours of battery life left, it doesn't seem to make a difference. This is not so bad if you are listening to music, but if you using this headset for voice input (recordings, voice calls, etc) it totally blows because the person on the other end just hears you cut out and you don't even know that you cut out until your hear them going \\"hello? are you still there?\\"<br /><br />I even went as far as to replace this item thinking \\"well, maybe just the one I have is not that great.\\" Well, the second one had the same issues.<br /><br />Only reason this is not a 1 Star is because when the stupid thing DOES have a connection to your PC/Lappy, the sound is great and the mic is pretty awesome also.<br /><br />But that doesn't matter when the connection is as unreliable as with this one.<br /><br />If you are looking to drop $100 on a headset, don't drop it on this one.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The dialog is fantastic.  I missed Season #1.  Finally saw the pilot and became instant fan.  I watch Season #1 and Season #2 over and over again.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I can not begin to express how awesome this book was.  The end did disappoint a little bit, but the plot twists are amazing. It was a great read.  Very filled with action and a page turner. Great book will totally recommend it for people looking for an entertaining read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it! You get to interact with your horse and other people!The information that is give is very correct and up to date.My daughter says that she could play it all day!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Best way to relax and exercise your brain at the same time.  Games are challenging, fun and move quickly.  Great way to escape the pressures of the day.
B005I7G3EM|3.0|Animal scenes and country scenes were good-story and acting very average. It was worth the time it took to watch it.
1881273377|3.0|Informative, recommended reading.  Fast read.  Will donate to good will when I have completed the class.<br /><br />Glad I can purchase books like this online and have delivered to the door.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|So far so good. The game is fun and runs well.  I haven't played it a great deal yet but it's got my attention.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really makes you think! It has nice graphics and lets you play without the music. Very challenging. I hope New levels come out soon.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Installation is an easy, short process.  Using the iPad or smartphone to control Netflix selection and volume makes a simplication on number of remote controls laying around.  Light weight to carry around on travel - like a memory stick.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I liked this because the protagonist is  less than perfect and the book had a realistic ending, not a fairy tail ending. I've been wanting to read  &#34;GONE GIRL&#34;, but I  like to read an author's books in order in case there is a reference to something that happened in the past.  &#34;SHARP OBJECTS&#34;  was a good beginning with a new author
159562015X|3.0|Not all that impressed with this book.  It offers a few charts and graphs to describe several different leadership personalities.  The book felt like the same message over and over again.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|All things considered, this is a decent game. Pretty brainless. Just gets faster and faster until you can't keep up.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an amazing game but addictive... :D I personally love it!!!Really good irate it a 4 because it is a bit too addictive....
B0043UB0EI|4.0|I love the language and the the women. Storyline is intriguing. Actor who play Spartacus is superb. Too bad he had to come to an untimely end.
1931559317|3.0|I wish I knew how to read it not really impressed with it.  I think I will keep it for use by another or sell it myself.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|The Kindle Fire handles this app very well. Nice way to spend time while in the mall, waiting, or in the Dr. Office waiting or at home just vegging. I search for key words and it works well for me.  Free app, and I recommend it for the Kindle Fire.
B009FB3WQ4|3.0|Who invited this clown? His \\"comedy\\" material was totally inappropriate for the occasion. Sarah Palin jokes? Really? He definitely brought the room down.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was excited to get this product.  I've used it once (the night I opened the box) and it's sat idle ever since.  It just doesn't provide any advantage over my PS3, which I use to stream video.  It's  not a bad product, it's just not terribly useful.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show has moved from the simple zombie eats everyone with one hero left standing to a true human drama about survival.  I do not suggest it for the faint of heart with regards to blood and guts. But if you are past that, then the character development and the depth of the human relationships then this is truly for you.  Zombies are cool, but this is about survival, rebuilding civilization, and the importance of leadership that comes with consequences.
0345472640|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and my brother recommended reading the book.  You can feel the respect and devotion that Col. Moore had for his men really come through in the writing.  At times it was a bit hard to follow the action, but well worth sticking it out and getting to the end of some of the more chaotic battle descriptions.  I felt obligated to read the follow up status paragraphs of the soldiers in Col. Moore's battalion at the end of the book even though it was written 20 years ago.  This book only increased the respect and reverence I personally hold for the soldiers who volunteer to serve the USA in the armed forces.  I feel very fortunate that others have served so I haven't had to.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It keeps my mind working with all the different ways to find items and open the door.
B000000OPQ|5.0|Awesome soundtrack from the 80's! If you're an 80's fan or even if you're not, you will love this soundtrack. From beginning to end, every song is great.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|First saw Nathan Fillion on Firefly so I knew I'd have to get around to watching Castle.  My wife and I got the first season on dvd and had to order the 2nd season with a few episodes left to watch so we wouldn't have interruption.  The show holds up great in season two and I think Fillion was made for this role, kind of like Robert Downey Jr was made for the Iron Man role.  The plot lines aren't the most original but the show really shines with the dialog and Fillion's performance.  Just a whole lot of fun!
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Was absolutely fantastic. Love it! I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies. It's a love story but not cheesy
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It is such a nice cam gear bag. I used it when travelling on an international flight. I packed my gear quite comfortably: 1 SLR, 4 lenses, extra batteries and host of other accessories. All sat in quite comfortably. I particularly liked the fact I could re-arrange the bag to suit my gear;removing the strap and paddings to make space for an extra-large or irregular sized gear. Slots too for manuals and the like. The side pockets could hold my mobile phone too. Nice
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I bought this book because Dr. Wayne Dyer recommended it in one of his Facebook posts. I haven't finished it yet but so far the results have been amazing. I have been doing the exercises and not one hasn't proved true so far, including manifesting &#34;blessings.&#34; The best takeaway has been my shift from thinking God offers us gifts based on how much we deserve, to God is like electricity...we can plug in or not plug in, based on our choice. The author asks us to consider if we believe we are deserving or not when we flip the switch to turn on a light. For some reason, this analogy resonated with me in a very profound way.<br /><br />Like I said, I haven't finished yet but already believe the small price I paid for the download was well worth it. I would have rated it higher but I sometimes find the author's reference to her own work and general sense of humor slightly off-putting, but that is a very subjective opinion.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Fun little time killer. I haven't figured out how you gain repair points yet, but I just started playing the game today. I aced the first five levels, so it's not very difficult YET.
0385737955|5.0|\\"He began his new life standing up, surrounded by cold darkness and stale, dusty air.\\" This is the first sentence of James Dashner's, Maze Runner. This is how we are introduced to the book's main character, Thomas. He ascends in a metal elevator where the ceiling eventually opens to a group of boys staring down at him. The only thing he can remember is his name--Thomas. From there, he begins his new life in a community stuck inside gray stoned walls hundreds of feet high. No one knows why they are there. They grow food, raise livestock, and do what's necessary to survive. Outside the huge walls, exists the only hope of a way out--a maze. But it's not safe out there in the maze. Things lurk, kill. The huge walls close at night to protect them. But during the day, they go outside the walls, running the maze, looking for a way out.<br /><br />This book had so much creativity.  From the dystopian world, Dashner created, to the eclectic group of boys that formed the \\"Glade\\".  The characters were interesting, funny, and unpredictable at times. I've seen a few reviewers complain about the made-up slang that Dashner uses in his book. Personally,I loved it. By using the slang, Dashner was able to create a place that was different, interesting, entertaining. Without it, the book would've lost its \\"We're not in Kansas anymore\\" feel.<br /><br />This is one of the best dystopian fiction novels I've read in a while. If you haven't read it yet, you're considered a \\"Greenie\\".  So...if you want to know what a \\"Greenie\\" is...
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Angry  Birds Friends is a very fun game. Its some shooting but I like the rainbows and the big pretty blue sky.
B00C5WR6JE|3.0|I hoped to feel more connected to my youth in California, than this offered. It is a mixed bag of sentimental and<br />atmospheric music that may, or may not, really connect to &#34;Big Sur.&#34;
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a great read, as well as posing important moral questions.  I loved the book and would recommend it highly.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It's a great game and people should get this app it makes you think more' learn more and It's a great game.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|I cant tell much difference in truth.  It is louder but also it is less sharp.Less well defined. I like it but I dont love it.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|A class production worth watching.  It is a very compelling storyline and well acted.<br />Interesting period of history as well.
B00C2C637I|5.0|Five stars. This book is written in quite a difficult style for me as a foreigner. The story has caught me anyway due to its great idea and characters. Similar book by Karel Čapek, The Makropulos Thing, is also about the age and the way we deal with it and you may also find it good.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This  movie  is  realistic  and  believable.  Maggie  Smith,  playing  the part of  an  old  diva  joins  a  home  for  retired  musicians.  She  encounters  Reggie,  her  first  husband  and  they  work  out  their  lost  relationship  in  very  believable  ways..  The  plot  revolves  around  persuading  Maggie's  character  to  reprise  the  Quartet  from  Rigoletto  for  the  annual  fund-raiser  concert.  Woven  in  are  some  amazing  vignettes of  Chamber  Music,  jazz,  vaudeville,  choral  works.  The  old  people  are  totally  believable  (I  am  81).  Have  Kleenex  handy.  Though  &#34;losing  it&#34; ,  they  all  struggle  to  maintain  their  dignity.
1781162646|4.0|Good story - especially about a mother and her care for her handicapped son.  Also an interesting description of &#34;circus people&#34;.
B0094KTA4Y|5.0|Love the movie. Works easy from all devices. My kids love it and it really doesn't have any mature jokes for the parents.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As far as Netflix streaming goes, this is a great product. Picture quality is great. But when streaming the chrome tab browser there is a noticeable delay, but this is expected since the information is not received from the cloud. Hopefully they come out with more video service support such as hulu, and other companies, but for now it does what it is suppose to.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Awesome game. One of those games that I don't want to put down. I like that even though you find dome of the same objects, they are never in the same place and look different in each picture.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|A superior show which brings the past to life with realistic intensity! I would recommend this show to ppl who are not squemish about blood!
B009AY04A8|3.0|The game is decently done. I got carried away with the name. It's just plain old finding objects game with a decent storyline. I am in chapter 2 &amp; think the game itself is not tough (so far). Sometimes between levels of a chapter the objects change places ensuring that finding them is not straight forward.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|worst game that was ever created.  it made me pule when I saw how trashy it was. it was the worst experience of my life.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was by far his best novel!  It's so sad that this is the end of a great writer....he will be deeply missed!
B000GFLE1S|5.0|We had to get this movie even though we 1 st.watched it years ago. Love all the outfits and of course the music. Great story line of overcoming some things in life.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I'm serious. It has been a suggested purchase on my amazon account for quite a while. But I figured if it was that big of a deal that I would have heard of it!! I never heard of it!! Besides Carradine I'd never heard of any of the actors and HE'S been known to show up in some real stinkers.<br />So why DID I buy it? I admit to finally wiki'ing it and decided I'd giver a go.  FIVE star special effects, FIVE star fighting scenes. The dancer story pulls it all together but otherwise that parts pretty boring and I usually just FF through them. The ending is also surprising since the only girl who survives and gets away is the one you least care about. That I guess is the &#34;sucker punch' part. Its a sucker punch aimed at the audience who all expect Brownings character to survive.<br />Still I'll watch this movie again and again. With my finger on the FWDF button.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|A little slow at times but lovely story. It gets you in and just have to keep watching.  Acting is ok
B002ZG9846|5.0|I could fill reams of paper says whats wrong with this picture. From an amazing shift of the main characters beliefs from the beginning to the end. Attempts by the writer/directer to spoof the batman TV series, (I guess to be silly/funny) ending up lame. And a world thats supposed to be based on reality having one of the most 'comic book' type villain (daddy) I've ever seen in an action movie (MR. Karate/Judo/Killem all) daddy. I could go on and on and on.<br />You really have to suspend reality to accept this world and the characters within it. But once you do.<br />High kicking, Music blaring, Fast moving action from beginning to end. You gotta see it more than once. Every blink means you missed something.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|All about life.<br />Funny,sad and giving someone a chance in life.<br />All in French but not to worry as such a great story
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game really helps me improve my long term memory,and contraction skilled.I could play it for hours. I love games that have a story in them,as it seem to help hold my ration.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|When used with native apps, such as Netflix or YouTube, it performs flawlessly. Even the screen share option - although a bit laggy, is still great for wireless presentations or class work. Streaming video outside of the native apps is not recommended.<br /><br />Definitely a great buy, too at only $35!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This is a good book to read about cause it funny and it instead and talks about middle school bye
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot it has been very enjoyable to watch , had a good story , good plot , and kept my attention .
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I keep pressing the thing and it doesn't work. I know it's not my kindle that's not working its the game.
B007IWG3WC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot it has been very enjoyable to watch , had a good story , good plot , and kept my attention .
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is fun because it changes the objective for every scene. Sometimes you have to find 12 of the same kind of object, like all the candles or all the bottles. Sometimes you have to find the object with the word for a clue, and other times with the shadow of the object as the clue. There are also times when the screen is divided in half and you have to find the differences between the two. It keeps it from getting boring. It could do without the story though, but just a tap on the text clears it quickly enough.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot it has been very enjoyable to watch , had a good story , good plot , and kept my attention .
B0045IPOPE|5.0|This is a good movie with some of Hollywoods best actors and is a good script. You will love this movie, but you will notice several different things each time you watch it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I read this book to see what happened and in the hope that it was better written. It wasn't. Much ado about nothing!
B008K7WCJM|5.0|Seller and product is honest and trustworthy!  I'd buy anything from either!  SWANS help me survive and the best band that ever existed.  SWANS are my GOD and this is the best album ever committed to vinyl or disc.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|A new take on the classic sonic games. It's fun to play, and challenging all the same. You jump up through the level, tilt the screen, and you're ultimate goal is to defeat Robotnik (as always). It's a lot of fun and I really enjoyed playing it.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|An excellent view into our near future. One of those books you start and you can't put down until finished. Great reading!
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|Lots of fun, controls can be a bit difficult if you're not used to playing on a tablet. Graphics are pretty good for a tablet also.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really gets you into the characters and pulls back layers of the onion slowly so you can savor the plot
B00932A4XE|1.0|The movie was awful.  The acting and story line was forced and the premise of the movie was detached and flatline.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This one has be around for a long time but I have always enjoyed it.  Story of a love and a love lost.  If  you have a heart you will enjoy this film with great actors!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|All it took was one moment for Will Traynor to become the victim of a horrific accident which  drastically changed his life.  This successful, affluent, fiercely independent and adventurous man became a paraplegic who was now dependent on others for almost everything. Two years later, the same moment would impact Louisa Clark's life as well.  Me Before You, by Jojo Moyes,  is their thoughtfully told story.<br />Louisa has lost her job and after her options become limited she agrees to interview for the position of companion to Will.  Even though she has no training or experience in this area, Will's mother hires her.  Louisa is told there is a six month contract.  From the beginning, Will and Louisa's relationship does not go well. He is difficult to be around and Louisa is not sure as to what is actually expected of her with one exception- Will is not to be left alone for more than fifteen minutes.  Over time, the situation becomes tolerable as they find a way to coexist, but then, unexpectedly, Louisa discovers the reason for the six month contract.  From that point on their lives change again.  With sensitivity and great skill, the author allows the reader to see through the characters eyes and we become part of their world.  Keeping in mind that had there not been the accident it is not likely Will and Louisa would have ever met.  They lived in different worlds.  Will was a child of privilege.  Louisa came from a working class family who depended on her income.  Her love-hate relationship with her sister was exhausting and frustrating.  Her relationship with long term boyfriend was not exactly satisfying.  The one thing they all agreed on was that Louisa should accept the position.  But this, too, would change.<br />This is an exquisitely written novel.  The story has the right blend of  hope, sadness, wit and disappointment.  It is a love story as well as a story about love.  We may or may not agree with the actions and choices the characters make. However, wewill not forget them.<br /><br />I received this book free of charge from Net Galley and I give this review of my own free will.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I can't give half stars, so I rated it four stars, because it IS better than three stars....<br /><br />This is a hidden object game. The complaints in the reveiws here are that there is too much talking and the same scene repeats over and over again. I think those are legitimate complaints. They are the same scenes over and over again within a chapter, and there is a lot of talking.  At least you don't have to tap to make the conversation advance, though if you do, you can make it move faster. You can also choose &#34;Skip dialog&#34; from the menu to skip the whole conversation.<br /><br />I think that if you have a smaller screen device, it could be very hard to find objects. In fact, I think that if you have a smaller device, some of them can be quite difficult.  You can't zoom in on locations on my Kindle Fire HD8.9; perhaps on smaller devices you can.  It does look like every chapter is a different location.  (I've done two chapters so far.)  And there are mini games.  If you like hidden object games, this one isn't perfect, but it is free! And it has a bit more variety than some of the reviews might indicate.<br /><br />Though you do replay the same scene, sometimes you search by silhouette, sometimes by item name.  Sometimes you have to get all the instances of a similar item, such as candles or dice.  There are also &#34;find the differences.&#34;  It is timed, and clicking randomly incurrs a 20 second time penalty.  There is a rechargable hint meter.<br /><br />I'm enjoying it so far....
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I love motley crue so to get some back ground on them iwas cool and nikki sixx has some good stories
B0038AUY96|4.0|I am sorry - but it has been given a  rating which I consider to be more than adequate at this time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loads of fun. We all loved it.  Very short game...but then, it was free. You have to try it.  Enjoy!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a true American Hero  in every aspect of his service provided to this country. The infrequent musings of his wife gave the family story line some dimension. I felt like I was with him in Fallujah, Ramadi and Sadr City. The young Marines and Army soldiers that had the chance to learn at the knee of this specially trained individual should consider themselves very lucky indeed. Many of them got the chance to go home to their loved ones as a result. Highly recommend this read for anyone that wants the inside story of the Seals mission in Iraq. God Bless Chris, his family and all the forces doing their duty for America and the world.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|could not put this book down...very insightful really makes you think and see the situation from many angles...would definitely recommend
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|So far I have loved every album from Five Finger Death Punch and this one is no different. Catchy and heavily emotional songs of sorrow and anger.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A sad tale of the worst and best of humanity. I found this oddly evocative of the sad state of our current world.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really enjoy the game.  wish you could play with other players.  I love the adventures and the puzzles you have to do.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. It's fun and you can take care of your own virtual horse. If you get enough medals then you can have a black horse. The graphics are great too. I took one star away because of the ads, but it's still a really awesome game!
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|A really interesting and thoughtful book about IT management, the executive level  and the often dysfunctional relationship between Dev and Ops. Really enjoyed!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Wish there was radar map link. More descriptive of weather data. It would be nice to change weather data location. Simple weather app.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|This 40th Anniversary Edition is exactly any Bruce Lee fan would want. I includes additional documentaries I have seen before as well as new special I have not with athletes like Sugar Ray Leonard speaking on the influence Bruce Lee had on them. And of course I get to watch the movie I have seen maybe 100s of times
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|TV near router - it works great.  exactly like you would expect.<br /><br />TV two rooms away from router- it doesn't get a good wi-fi signal.  The ROKU box hooked up to that same TV does great.  Laptops, Android phones, and other wireless devices work great in that room also.  I couldn't stream anything.  Even casting a picasa web slide show from chrome on a wired pc, it would only display every 7th or 8th picture.<br /><br />It's great, assuming you use it near your router.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|Thought it was going to be like a torch, not a coloured screen! Was quite the disappointment really. Might scrap it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book mad me laugh and cry and made my heart flutter. I wish there was part for julian though
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game is a lot of fun and can take up a lot of time. Simple concept, yet so much fun.
0307476073|5.0|To think that someone actually did this is so inspiring! The spirit of people is truly awesome. What an outstanding story.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|I always enjoy John Grisham's books.. They're always a smooth and interesting read for me. I would recommend this book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great way to watch the web on my TV. It is a truly innovative product! Google has done it again
B009LMTDL0|5.0|After receiving a great job offer that I hesitated to accept, I created a list of pros & cons then stopped to read this book. From the opening question \\"What would you do if you weren't afraid?\\" (take the job), this book carried me through my list of cons and explained how I was holding myself back in some unfortunately common ways. This book has changed me for the better.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Just what we all enjoy. The truth is out!!<br />Life behind the curtains for all of us needs a bit of spice - this gives us the confidence needed.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I like the Will Robbie character.  He is rather dark, but is interesting in the way he approached his life and work.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I cannot get any of the icons on the installed application to open despite my clicking on the downloaded file from the downloaded section
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you're a fan of music that spans multiple genres and over the past few decades then you'll enjoy this movie.  It moves along at a nice pace and never gets boring.  Highly recommend.
B00DZVKQGY|4.0|Although seemingly to be based on a typical family disaster, \\"Finding Her Feet\\" is an emotional rollercoaster for the young character Amanda. I found the writer's style a little too 'story-telling' and I felt an observer of the story rather than involved but this is still a good well-written example of its genre, a YA emotional drama. I hope to read more from this author.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Good story, well written and acted.  The movie moves along at a good pace and the story never gets stale.
1594203334|5.0|Love the perspective. Completely changed our family dynamic for the better. WE ALL SLEPT!! And 4 children later it's still workin like a charm.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|I saw the Avengers first, so seeing this afterwards was slightly disappointing especially since it was very predictable. Overall not the worst super hero movie I have seen.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|In traditional Google style, Chromecast is an unfinished product but without the the Beta label this time. It works but is buggy. For example, one day it would not get discovered by the devices so I had to reset the Wifi router and the Chromecast. I use it for Netflix and from iphone/ipad its &#34;remote&#34; responds only half the time. I am hoping these issues can be fixed by new firmware.<br />The lack of a dedicated remote is a usability issue. I prefer a remote to using my iphone/ipad (coz I have to unlock it, find the netflix or youtube app, activate the app and then play/pause). This cannot be fixed by new software though.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was very enjoyable and easy read.  You can identify yourself in all the characters. Multiparty is gifted storyteller.
B000002KBU|5.0|Such a beautiful album.  In my opinion, one of Joni's best.  It's perfect for periods of introspection, life transitions, mid-to-late summers, quiet drives, or getting back to yourself after a breakup.
B002S43V3Y|5.0|An all time favorite a must see and great soundtrack!!!!!!! Watch it you will love it like I said all time favorite
B00BHMF578|5.0|Edge of your seat suspense and perhaps even more intense as it is based on a true story! A must see!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good enjoyable game, even for an adult. Would recommend it for someone that has patience though. Have to keep visiting to improve.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, tons of fun. Not hard to get. It is good for brainless fun and hours of happiness. I would recommend it to everyone.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|3 different stories intertwine in shocking and powerfully written novel. I will definitely read another title by this author. This story was emotionally relevant and realistic.
B00ALCBTWU|5.0|Great reading and pleased with the packaging and information that I received.  Will get more books like this, Thank you
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|seems to be a pretty descent game but is to sensitive to the click and likes taking money<br />I play for enjoyment and don't like being raided by others that are stronger when you're not available to defend yourself.
B00155GDXC|2.0|Unique first person structure. Unique (non)ending. Reader left with contradictory conclusions. e.g., which one is the assassin? Really great writing.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Wasn't sure not a big fan of MMA, that being said Tom Hardy is wonderful in this. Nick Nolte really plays this part to a high. Five minutes in and I was hooked couldn't take my eyes from the screen I loved every minute of it and cried at the end.....truly a love story about two brothers lost from a family of abuse, dysfunction and violence! A must see!
B000SEGEKI|5.0|This book isn't so much about a specific programming language as much as it is about programming practices.  It's got great advice that was immediately helpful to me.  If you're having trouble setting expectations with managers who are not developers or programmers,  then you should get this book.
B005ETANC2|5.0|The DVD was exactly like I remembered when I first saw it.  I would recomend this DVD to anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi.
B003OUXECE|5.0|Solid read for all Bioshock fans. Not always as descriptive as one would expect but definitely puts a bright light on the whole story.
B00AW8UK0K|1.0|Eat what you want on non-fasting days, BUT you won't want to...Think about it people.  If you are cutting out more than 2200-2500 calories a week, total, on fasting days but eating whatever you want to ( as in adding over 4,000-5,000 calories ) the rest of the week, that doesn't make sense for weight loss.  The HOPE is that you won't want to overeat on the non-fasting days, but that just won't be the case...after all we are talking about Americans who don't take lightly denying themselves food two days a week.  And it doesn't add up if you WANT to eat what you want on non-fasting days.  It makes more sense to know your equilibrium weight and keep several hundred calories under that, everyday.  It won't be quick but it will be more honest and make more sense for taking it off permanently.  I don't like liars or &#34;professionals&#34; who sell a quick fix but always add a disclaimer.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Started out as just a simple little time consumer . Now I find myself looking to play for a little while every time I get back from work .
B008OOYALE|5.0|great game for kids and adults. we fight over who's turn it is. one of the best games we found on kindle
0425266060|5.0|I found the book exciting. Can not wait for the next book. It left a lot to wonder - left me hanging and wanting more. When will Part 4 come out?
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like it but I wish it offered hints. It can get very frustrating at points but at the same time I still continued to play.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so fun to play. I enjoyed it very much. Everyone at home should play this game yay.
B0096YBEIS|5.0|music is some of the best that Four Play does.  Beautiful music.....great jazz. Never listened to a bad album since they started.
B003G94BZC|4.0|Imaginative. Still prefer David Tennant, but Matt Smith is decent in the role.  I like that it is on streaming, so can catch up on the series.
B009AY04A8|3.0|It was fun and the graphics were pretty good.  I finished the whole series of chapters and just waiting to  get the next set of chapters.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Missile Defender is a very close clone of the old Atari game Missile Command.  The big difference with the app vice the original game is that you no longer need a pointer to mark the place to shoot your missiles, you simply tap on the screen.<br /><br />It is slightly annoying that you must go back to the main menu and then back to the game after each completed screen but I guess this is there way of trying to get you to upgrade and pay for the app.<br /><br />For a free app, I found this to be a fun game to while away any hour or two.
0062014536|3.0|Delirium(4hours to read)Pandemonium(1day)Requiem(6hours)Total: less than a day.Ok I feel really bad about this because Lauren Oliver is a great author and I know she probably knows this but i have to let my opinion out there. I too think that Requiem answered nothing, nada of my rightfull questions.And I am upset that didn't include Julian's charater more. I also think the trilogy is a little predictable.I mean of corse Alex isn't dead! Only a bad writer would kill of one of the main characters without later under some circumstance bring them back to life! Also i think these types of books are following a trend: Maximum ride series-fights something big, falls in love with two guys picks one of them:The Hunger Games-fights something big, falls in love with two guys picks one of them:Twilight-fights something big, falls in love with two guys picks one of them. I'm finding a big pattern! I'm writing a book and that's how it goes also. BURNING RAIN. Keep your eyes open in the next couple of years. Overall The Delirium series is mediocre!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|The games name says it all. To get thru all the levels it will take a lot of coins.because of this I give this game two stars. With that said I will still play this game to the end that's how I like to play but not so often.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a lovely glimpse of the lives within the aristocracy, continued from season 1.  The setting, the costumes, the characters have kept my rapt attention.  Each episode is a gift I give myself when it is most needed.  Season 3 awaits my viewing!
B000E1JOSE|5.0|I saw the Black and White Night concert on PBS several years ago and loved it. When I learned that a CD was available, I snatched it up.<br /><br />My wife is probably sick of hearing it but it gets a lot of play time in my Jeep.
B00881VLCE|5.0|The app does exactly what it was created to do. I really enjoy this app when I am traveling because it keeps me entertained for hours -especially on long flights. I've never purchased any of the puzzle packs so I can't agree with or deny other reviewers sentiments.
B003YT5TGE|5.0|What can I say? I love this movie! If you haven't seen it you should have your head examined. :P
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|...but too much nudity in this film for my taste. Had to skip much of the story. But Denzel is a powerful actor.
B00DU74U74|2.0|I like the concept but did not appreciate the flow of the movie. This movie had a lot of potential but the &#34;Host&#34; personality was not fully developed.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Its a light romance. Not really sure who the story was supposed to be about. I found the characters a bit one dimensional.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|This movie have a lot of potential but was no focus enough on the main character and her powers and abilities
0307476073|3.0|Given the reviews I had read, my expectations were high. Yes, I enjoyed the book, but thought it had been over-hyped. A good adventure book, and I liked the modern let-it-all-hand-out style with the feminist edge,  but as a tale of self-discovery &#34;alone in the wilds&#34; it left something to be desired.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|I thought the movie was cute and refreshing. Check it out. You will not be wasting your time. It's cute and fun.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very fun game, i got it for free but it is definitely worth purchasing. I like the upgrade system the in the game.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis on steroids....Now with his clone.....his son!!!  I am a Bruce Willis &#34;Die Hard&#34; fan so I absolutely love the movie. It did not disappoint me with the senseless gun shooting and the comic segments and the 1000 of bullets flying everywhere and Bruce and his son are not shot once.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Awesome Movie. Best Out of the Whole Trilogy. Tyrannosaurus Made a Good Addition. I Cryed in the Third One When Spinosaurus Killed T-Rex
B009AY04A8|3.0|This game is fun but it hurts my eyes. It also takes forever to go through the story part. Some of the things are extremely hard to find as well. All in all not my favorite. Then again I don't enjoy games that you have to seek hidden objects. You may like it. I sure didn't.
B00005UWPQ|2.0|I Can Not Believe They Gave it to Joe Johnston. If Speilberg Directed it Again This Would Have Been Awesome.I Cryed When Spinosaurus Killed Tyrannosaurus.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|These new star treks are getting better and better!  I hope they can spin off a new series!!  All in all 5/5!
B0087ZG7NO|3.0|It is Good But Not as Good as the First One. But at Least it is Good Enough to Be Good
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|I have missed this series since it went off the air.  I could just watch these over and over again.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I'm a happy with her yet again! I'm a huge fan of Demi's and this album is just another great one to add to the collection!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|enjoyed  this eposide,looking forward to another and to season 4..............loved seasons 1/2.also enjoyed  McClouds Daughters series filmed in Australia...................enjoy masterpiece threaters series.........
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|In two months,  I am going on a trip to the Holy Land.  This book has opened many new doors,  in my quest for he real Jesus.<br />Aslan has written thoughtfully and his research is impeccable.  I've red the book with map and itinerary at my side.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I'm 35 and a little younger than many of the hardened Goonies fans. I will say this, it's my favorite movie and has a lot of meaning to me. I almost bought the house the movie was filmed in, in 2002. The house was sold and turned into a bed and breakfast for a little while. I go to Astoria, Oregon for all of the movie get togethers. I'm about as hardcore of a Gonnie fan as you can get. I find it very sad that so many of the cast that made this a childhood classic, have passed away. Sloth, Mama Fratelli, Mickey's dad and recently the maid are the main characters that have passed on. Yes, I do know everyones real name, but, for the sake of the movie, I won't list them. On a final note, I'm the absolute worst person to watch this movie with, because I have to say all of the lines right before the actors do. Yes, I'm a Goonies fan boy, and proud of it!!!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Movie has great comedic & tear jerk moments yet it has lessons that prove to be important to the theme. Moving stays true to the title and the story that was being brought across to the viewer.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I like it, simple, similar to the original, fun. Easy enough for my little nephew and challenging enough for me.in the latter levels anyway.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is awesome!! i play it all the time it is so addictive, i love breeding to make awesome new dragons!! thank you backflip sudios!!!! its awesome get this game!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Use with my iPad…<br />Stream YouTube…<br />Superb…<br />.<br />Short coming…<br />Need more content partners…<br /><br />My AppleTV…<br />an order of magnitude<br />of choices<br />not yet available with Chromecast…
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I find the content presented by Austin, enlightening. A good light read not only describing the theoretical aspects but providing a practical approach to \\"Stealing like an Artist!\\"
0385349947|3.0|As a well-educated, professional woman and mother, I didn't find this book particularly useful.  Common sense strategies we're given to speak up, be assertive while still being feminine/nice, and 'finding' a mentor by working hard. At the end of the book I wasn't sure what the book endorsed.  Was it to get as many women out there to become successful by becoming a CEO (because Sandberg mentions not worrying about the rank of your position, just go in with bravado and have the company's interests in mind first)? Is that the meaning of success? Was it to ignore your personal goals (like having children) while working on your professional ones (cause Sandberg dropped an opportunity in her mid-twenties simply because it was in the same city as an ex)? How does this work for women in so many other careers and organizations where there is no social ladder to climb or who aren't privileged enough to swing to a different 'jungle gym'? Is that the point of trying to make more female leaders/CEOs- to make these opportunities for other women? Or would this just widen the gap between the haves and have-nots? Increasing demand for lower child care- wouldn't this further take away from a predominantly female position? Should we marry men with less professional goals so that they can take over more household tasks? This book is written with privileges women in mind who have choices to make.  This book also treats all women as if they were introverts and males as loud, obnoxious counterparts. The book left me asking many questions but with few solutions to work-life balance. It was a quick read, but I'm ashamed to have purchased this book.
0486237664|5.0|This book has great animal illustrations---hundreds of ideas for my art students....very well done...recommend it highly ...<br />good book for the price
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some levels are harder than others. Really interesting puzzles. Do not like that it did not always save my place when I exited. Would  like more games like this.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy playing Bingo Blitz.  It is a fun thing  to do when I just want to unwind for a bit.  I enjoy the social part of this game its fun playing Bingo with people from all over this world.<br /><br />There has been times you will be playing having a good time and the game will freeze or you will see you have powerups left and it will say need to buy more and you cant use them. . Or when your number is called and you would have a bingo it starts to fad and you can't get the bingo that can be frustrating.<br /><br />But saying all that I still come back daily to play this game.  It delivers overall what I want a fun game.
6304711905|5.0|I love this movie! Val Kilmer was terrific as Doc Holliday, as was Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp! Great action and intense acting!
B004Q3RKH8|5.0|i got the package in excellent condition and it works very well ....LOVING IT preal jam music is ment to be hread in vinyl.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have never played this type of game before and glad I tried this one.  The graphics are great.  It really makes you think.  The hints really come in handy.  Glad I bought it.<br />We
B00003CXWV|5.0|This movie is fantastic! This movie is an emotional roller coaster. Johnny Depp is fantastic as always! It's worth seeing.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I opened the app after purchasing it and it a little box  just keeps popping up stating that i dont own the app and im not entitled to its contents, rendering the app i paid $2.99 for useless.... how and why? This really needs to be fixed.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|A classic story of alien invasion and human transcendence from Arthur C. Clarke. The story this is based on is better than the final novel, but it's still a fun read and a look back to how we viewed the world back in the 50s and 60s. Like much of Clarke's work, it mixes science with mysticism in strange and sometimes uncomfortable ways.
B009SQOGZ2|4.0|This movie will be one to watch any time because it was fun and good for kids to watch anywhere
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Loving this album.  BTW, the Boys Round Here 'radio' version comment in a review is incorrect.<br /><br />The CD is the real thing, so don't take no Sh#@  LOL.  Enjoy!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can stay connected to family and friends , one that close and far in or out of the country
B008OOYALE|5.0|Very cute with lots of characters and activities for the characters and nice music. It is a good game for children
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Play bingo as a kid now I can play it anywhere that I can get connected to the internet on my kindle
B007PTJOV0|3.0|for the young at heart this is the game for you, it is a challenging game and you need to be really quick to finish.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The minion run catchy and hours of good time because it was down to the way that the minions run down the track is fun
B009KS4XRO|3.0|this game is not what I thought it would be, I don't play it much. not something I would recommend to my friends.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Well, I feel warmed. This book is, well, amazing! I mean the only downs were when he would go with these random girls every night and when he talked about it with the guys... But the rest of it. The way he treated her after. When he wanted to be with her and all. I loved how devoted he was. 5 stars*****.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I think the singing is great and the staging is great and as true as possible to the stage show.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun and clever game. It's like a slot machine that has many levels to achieve. I would definitely recommend playing this game. Just give it a try.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|First of all I'm a parent not a 'brony' or whatever these guys call themselves. I'm a father. My daughter (4.5 years old) has been a huge MLP fan for at least a year. She can tell you the names of even the tertiary characters what they do what their cutie mark is, etc... so needless to say I get a lot of exposure to this particular franchise. I sit and watch it with her and think the show is cute and certainly makes me chuckle. But the way her face lights up when her ponies are on is what I truly love.<br /><br />Anyways, onto the movie. She loved it and we've watched it several times since it arrived. She loves that they turn into humans and she loves the songs and sings along and dances with them. As her dad the movie is cute. Even I, after being subjected to the series episodes so many times noticed little similarities and references to the series.<br /><br />By that standard I give it a five. I'm rating it for her because I know that's what she'd give it and I'm sure your MLP fan will, too.
0399165274|5.0|Over this summer, I've read some other thriller / espionage books, but none of them even came close to Frederick Forsyth, who once again proves that he is the master of thrillers.  This book may not be as good as Day of the Jackal or Odessa File, but it's still the best thriller of 2013.  Forsyth manages to keep you riveted throughout the book, and his use of explaining how various spy offices are set up, and how he weaves in real people, is fantastic.  When reading this book, you can tell that he is meticulous in his research, and the story keeps you reading until late hours of the night.  It involves the hunt for a radical Islamist \\"preacher\\" and the action shifts between the US, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia, the UK, and several other locales.  Forsyth describes everything supremely well -- the locations, the equipment being used, how people communicate, etc.  I love his style, and if you like any of Forsyth's previous books, you should definitely like this book.  I love having the details in the book -- I don't work in espionage, so explaining how a particular office came into existence, or how a communication device works, is very helpful.<br /><br />My only complaint is that once you finish, you know it'll be a few more years until Forsyth comes out with his next book.  I already can't wait.<br /><br />Download this book to your Kindle ASAP.  You won't be disappointed.  Just make sure you've got no pressing commitments.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait until the 4th season begins - this is one of the very best dramas that has ever been televised
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this game. Based on negative virus reviews I downloaded lookout antivirus software. Downloaded virus free and enjoying the game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|2nd season - interesting and as good as the first - it's a great British soap but with better actors than in the US and accents.<br />Maggie Smith is hilarious
B007LGPSX0|4.0|I loved watching this.  It was a nice throw-back to simpler times.  I only wish ALL seasons were available!  I would watch them all.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Compelling and intense drama! I was fascinated to learn more about the inner sanctum of British aristocracy, along with its service class in the early 20th Century.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|So much fun to play! Missile Defender is addictive, getting increasingly difficult as you go through nights/levels. Requires some resource management, and getting 'in the zone' as it gets harder. Great fun!
B009AY04A8|4.0|Although the ho part is pretty good, and the graphics are pretty good as well, I agree with the people who say there is too much SLOW commentary...it wouldn't be as bad if the text bubbles were larger so that the comments could be read more quickly!!<br /><br />The bigger issue that I found on my kindle fire is the&quot;over-sensitivity&quot;of the screen. I know that it's not a kindle issue, but rather, an issue within the game as this is the only game I've had this issue with. I got around it by playing without the timer...this allowed me to continue playing without getting penalized every time I touched the screen. To clarify, on my kindle, whenever I zoomed in on the picture in order to find the requested objects, if I touched the screen to move around onit,it registered as a tap and would penalize me for&quot;random&quot;tapping.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|A fun game that challenges the brain. Easy to pick up and great for all ages. Gets progressively more challenging, too!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Great movie with the greatest actors of all time.  Sly you're the man regardless of who's sharing the action with you!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. Always hillarious, could watch it over and over again. Chevy Chase is always funny. I gave this to my husband for Christmas.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Awesome Bingo game.  Daily free credits and free bingo play in tournament Room.  You do need to add friends to make completed rooms. However it helps so you can receive and send daily gifts.  The added slots is Super fun too if you like to play them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an amazing app for kids and adults anyone can play its so fun but there are a few hard parts i cant get past and i feel like when you pick up a minion you get bigger is that true??? :)
B000JQU1VS|1.0|Maybe I just couldn't get into it but it was boring to me some one else might like it alot
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This app is great for the kids that are new to games... very easy to play and lots of fun
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I think the game is pretty good but a little to easy for me though, it is still a very fun game to play when I'm board
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Iphone compatibility is awful. No app yet for iphone? I want to return this as of right now it's a total waste of time and money.
B0049NMMJQ|5.0|A Great Movie, Now On Blue-Ray, Even Better Then Before, And Now It's Shown Uncut, Makes It Even More Exciting To Watch!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun and easy to play also with the different story clips in it makes it even more interesting
B00499NHLC|5.0|My only complaint with Sherlock Season 1 would be that it was far too short. Brilliant, witty, perfectly paced and always at least a little surprising, this is in my estimation the best remake of the classic literary series to date.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I enjoy this game quite a bit. I think it's easy without being childish and is good for long trips. The only reason I didn't give it give stars is that sometimes when you go to move the screen it says you've clicked too many times.
B0081336FO|5.0|Ordinarily if one were to say &#34;more of the same&#34; it wouldn't be a good thing; in this case, more of the same is more brilliance and entertainment from Moffat and his team for this Sherlock series.  It isn't uncommon for a second and successive season to feel the pressure of the first's success and get bigger, and all too often that translates to more explosions, car chases, serial killers and unnecessary flash. Here we have simply, if that adjective can be used to describe Sherlock, more of the wit and perfect pacing that we fell in love with in the first series.  In the case of Sherlock, more of the same is a very good thing indeed.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am not a reader of fantasy novels; however, I am looking forward to the entire series. It reminds me of how excited I was to get the next book in the Potter series...definitely grittier...but just as addicting.
0345803493|2.0|These trilogy was a major disappointment to me...I heard everyone raving about them and saying the sexual content was spectacular...Nothing all that amazing to me I guess.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game!! I just can't seem to get enough lol. When I am stressed this game takes it all away ;). Must try is what I think.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and maybe just a little addictive. I keep telling myself, \\"just one more room.\\"
B00B7VZN76|5.0|This is the absolute best transfer of The Next Gen we are likely to ever see. I've watched the show for years on tv and notice so many new details it was like a new modern show. The picture clarity is top notch HD, gone is the blurry vaseline vision you remember. Not only that but this is the season they turned the show around after two seasons which were..... high minded but flawed would be the easiest way to put it. Add onto that all the past DVD special features plus new Bluray content and a price well below the old DVD season sets and they just got it right all around this time.... only would have like more commentaries. But really just a phenomenal job, if you own the DVD sets, replace them now. This really is worth it.
B000ID3KU6|1.0|Watched for a little while and it didn't move along to be worth my time.  After twenty minutes I gave up on the thing.
B008ALAHA4|3.0|still frustrated Apple decided to change up the chargers on the new MBPr's; this adapter works with the old charges but it's tiny; will probably get lost...
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|This movie was Ok. Not the best action movie I have ever seen but it was entertaining. Arnold is getting old
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a great book for women. It is an easy read and leaves you wanting more. I never expected to be into romance novels with descriptive love scenes but it was definitely  a plus in this story of fantasy. Would recommend to all my friends!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Easy read and had great intensity. You'll love the details and if you've only seen the movie, this is great background.
0446555002|3.0|This was not my favorite book in the series _the first half was too derivative of SH and the second half was too much over - the - top action. I liked the older crime solving /mystery /a touch of spookiness versions. I skimmed a good bit of the second half out of boredom.  The two side stories were superficial and out of place and added nothing to the overall story.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|It was a great documentary with a shocking end. It has been awhile since I've seen such an entertaining documentary.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|My v tube app is just creepy or something. It started playing this weird music when I excited the app, and so I deleted the app and turned off my kindle but the music was still playing... don't know I  it was  hacked but you probably do not want to buy this app.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld is an awesome series that never gets old. I love watching the episodes over and over. They are always funny!
B00CO52NLI|5.0|I love this game because it has animals and its awesome! there's only one thing that I don't like about it .........................................  NOTHING!!!!!
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|But it doesn't quiet make it. The movie has some beautiful scenery but the acting and plot are disappointing.  A bit more cheese and some worse line would make this hilariously bad and funny. But no. Just kinda mediocre and boring.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It cost too much though. Even the so called games you have to play to level up your ponies cost at the very least a hundred coins a game just for simply normal scoring
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|OK so I wanted to make sure that I started collecting my Breaking Bad action figures (or in this case a statue) as they became available one by one. I was ecstatic when I found out that this toy was going to be available before the series came to a conclusion so after weeks of waiting for this product to be available for Amazon Prime, it was finally eligible and I took the opportunity to get it. Now, unlike some other reviewers, I was well aware that this toy had no articulation and therefore that wasn't much of a disappointment when I received the toy.<br /><br /> The good thing about it: It looks great! The toy is very well detailed and has a removable hat and glasses. You can't remove the gun that he's carrying but you can take off the bag of cash that he comes with. He also comes with a little squared blue thing. I know it's supposed to be a blue meth bag but let's just say it's not up to par with the rest of the toy.<br /><br />The cons: The packaging on this was terrible. I had no plans on opening the toy and was going to keep it in the box and put it behind a glass with the rest of my action figures but when I received it I noticed that the bottom of the package where the plastic and the paper meet was taped down. Once I removed the tape the bottom part of the toy was open. Then I realized that it was also the side of the package that had tape. So the bottom and left side of the package was obviously open. This bugged me quite a bit since I had plans to keep it in great condition but it seems that Amazon had other plans. I made the best out of the situation and decided that to remove that tape and carefully slide out the Heisenberg action figure to check it out. I was pleased that it was in great condition and had no signs of wear. everything was there and all the plastic was accounted for. What I did after that was to remove the old tape and put my own once I had Heisenberg back in his box. I don't plan on ever selling this toy so it didn't really make it a deal breaker that it was already open but I do wish that I would've received the package in better condition. Beside the packaging issue there is also the fact that this is not a very sturdy toy. It took me a couple tries to get it to stand without tipping over.<br /><br />Overall I really like this toy and while some articulation would've been nice, the details that the figure has and the fact that you can remove things like the glasses and the hat made it a great collectable for me. If you plan on keeping this toy forever then you shouldn't mind the condition of the packaging as much but if you plan on letting the resale value of this become a profit for you ( it's going to happen like with The Walking Dead action figures) then I would strongly suggest that you Tread Lightly if you don't really know what shipping can really do to your purchases.deal breaker that it was already open but I do wish that I would've received the package in better condition.

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun game to play to pass the time.  Am happy with this app<br />  Hope to see more like this app.thanks
B003KJF2WE|5.0|Poor Hulk, always the loner and unable to connect emotionally to anyone...  And it's so hard to make a proper movie about that without going completely emo.  But this one is good!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This Sim is a lot of fun, easy to use but accurate weapons functioning. I really enjoyed firing the Luger, a rare gun with an interesting action.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|I really was not expecting much from this movie, I didn't know the story behind whiplash and was pleasantly surprised.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I was super entertained. Did wonders on the broken x-box! One time use and its been better than long before.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Revived his career?  And it's justly deserved. Robert Downey Jr owns this role with such aplomb that I don't think they will ever be able to find a replacement.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|We went to see it at the theater twice.  The casting was great and the story lines were amazing. Can't wait to buy the DVD.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|good game. easy. fun . very classic, but better. plus very small app. and the kids can play and actually like.
1616614609|2.0|This is a fun and challenging game for two players. My only complaint is that the directions are unnecessarily complicated. The game is simple - but the way it is explained is incredibly stupid! And despite the booklet being incredibly lengthy, it still left several key things out. That is very disappointing but not surprising coming from Fantasy Flight Games (simplicity is just not their thing)!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Best cover for the KF I found.  Still in great shape a year later.  Survived a few drops to boot.
B00499NHLC|4.0|This show is witty and entertaining, and manages to put a fresh spin on what is surely the 1,000,000th addition to the Sherlock Holmes catalog. Also, Cumberbatch!! That is all.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Quality, all around solid flick. Good acting, good story. Matthew McConaughey should make more movies like this. Also I think the lead child actor has a bright future.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Great romance movie. I loved how the director put romance and drama all in one with the murder mystery plot. It was a perfect combination. I love the movies this director has also made like The Notebook. I recommend them all.
159463176X|3.0|Having read the first two novels I couldn't wait to read this one and have to say it did not live up to expectations. The stories in themselves were very good but I was expecting the characters to all come together in some way. As I continued reading I realized that wasn't going to happen. Instead we were treated to the anti-climax of Pari seeing her brother again after many decades and who by that time had descended into dementia. There were also vast swathes of missing detail in Pari's life. The author concentrates instead on characters who have very little to do with the actual story and we don't find out what happens to them.<br /><br />The second novel - A Thousand Splendid Suns was an amazing book which stayed with me for a long time. This was a disappointment.
B003QSMCKO|4.0|My daughter loved this Disney movie. We are preparing her for our trip to Disney world by watching movies she has not seen yet. We have watched multiple ones like Peter Pan, etc already. Great kids movie.
B00EI6E0QM|3.0|My problem with this song is that it's hard to follow her lyrics - they are not very audible b/c the song is over-produced.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Each level gets increasingly difficult<br />A nice little way to waste time<br />I highly recommend this game<br />I give it four of five stars
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The final chapter of the Wheel of Time series is well written and addictive. The story threads gathered from each of the earlier books are brought together and woven into a fabric that is both compelling and complete. This &#34;never ending&#34; series has reached it's climax in this final work which features non-stop action, logical story development and finality in plot resolution.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed it!
B000063V8S|5.0|Continuing to build my library and plan on getting the fifth, sixth and seventh season as well, and others to follow
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Aslan's scholarship in chronicling Jesus' life and the writings of his devotees that have formed the basis for Christian belief appears sound and thorough.  His writing can be a bit convoluted, but his findings are, to this reader, considered and plausible.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I bought the used version for a much cheaper price and was still very pleased. It was in great shape and plays well!
B00005J79J|3.0|This particular CD is not quite as expected from Sarah, but still enjoy music, However when she sings,<br />you can almost feel her emotions right in your living room......S.G.,  CA
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Will keep your brain at work. Level 10 is a tough one that will take brains and common sense. I really like this game.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Not like every Woody Allen movie.  Very interesting and really held our interest.  Can't say more about it right now.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|Just plain love the movie and music - had an old vhs copy copied from TV and the DVD is so much better.
B0054SMID0|4.0|I enjoyed the film but it was not the Best film that was made. Dirty lawyer has been played out. the film could have used more action and a better plot.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Almost like I spy very fun and easily to lose track of time because it's so interesting I recommend this game to all ages.
B00646Z09K|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed watching this series very much. The style of the show changes slightly from season to season so the episodes never seem repetitive.
B005PK56TA|5.0|When I saw the very first episode, I thought there was a lot of potential but the producers had to put things in their proper order.<br /><br />So I decided to watch the second episode, and after that I was hooked.<br /><br />The nuances of the show make it sooo entertaining!
1878424319|3.0|The Four Agreements presented by Don Miguel Ruiz are solid and should be followed by society. However, at times his dream perception and other ideas become to far fetched for the reader to identify with. I did find it interesting, but at times I really had to work had to stay with it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This film is Marvel storytelling at its best. Great cast, great story, and spectacle from start to finish. One of my favorite comic book movies of all time.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|I bought it looking for a bigger portable wipe container, and after reading good reviews I didn't hesitate. Big waste of money, the red button does come out quite often and regardless of been properly sealed the wipes dried in a matter of days! I literally went to get wipes after 3-5 days of putting them in and they were dry! You live and you learn, stick to the one that comes with your Huggies wipes, they might be smaller but they keep the wipes moist and their easy to get to.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I found this app to work quickly to clean my cache  and free up memory on my HTC Incredible  2
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Thought at first it was &#34;airy/fairy/mystical&#34; kind of book, but the more you read the more you understand what we've become and what needs to be done to find true happiness. So simple yet each time I read it again I find new meaning. The world would be a better place if everybody followed the agreements.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really really liked it but i think that the big bad white bird should be a part of it too.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|The moment we opened the box my daughter was in love... Beautiful doll, smells great and its perfect for her little hands (12 months)
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Everything 5 stars.  Writing.  Acting.  A science fiction series that did not rely on special effects to keep the audience interested.  A cast of well-written and well-portrayed characters, not just a central character with background people.  I highly recommend it.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It goes to fast to help you! It's not helpful And overall I do not like it at all!!<br />No good
B001J1K5IG|1.0|Ordered this by mistake, I was looking for Tombstone and this popped up. My bad for being half awake. THIS IS ONE of THE TWO WORST movies I have ever seen. Don't watch this even if it is on Prime for free.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Movie was fine.  Had to restart several times as well as (1) reboot.  This has been hapening too often.  Especially when ordering $ movies.  I'm sure it's not my roku box, because I'm still streaming from Netflix.  I went for help with support a couple of times but wasn't satisfied with what I was told to do and had no success.?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
B004P1JDJO|4.0|Very interesting and informative. A disproportionate amount of the book concerns management/corporate topics, but if that's what you're looking for, it's great.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|i found it to be entertaining and chilling.  it kept me guessing and the plot stayed tight throughout.  I really enjoyed it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great game that remind me of the very simple version of missile command from back in the day. it keeps you playing.
B00CHILW64|4.0|I liked this movie - it is a remarkable story.  I did feel it sort of had a unbelievable ending but that is the point of the story - it seems impossible.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome! I love how it's like taking care of a real horse. I highly recommend this game to all horse lovers!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|The zombie dialogue is hysterical.  I thought it was a great compliment to the walking dead and the other zombie movies we've seen in recent years.  there is a little Hollywood formula to the story but it works.  love the main zombie and his &#34;friends&#34;  -hilarious!
B00881VLCE|4.0|My granddaughter loves to play this and can for hours on end.  I even play with this puzzle game, good for the brain
0812993845|4.0|Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella. I own all of the Shopaholic series, and all of her independent novels. I usually love to crack open a Kinsella and look forward to getting lost in the world of humor, love, and misfortune she typically creates. This time I wasn't pulled in as much. I didn't care for the setting and the ultimate plot, but that is just me. I was expecting more from her, based on her previous novels.
B003G94BZC|5.0|If I could I would give this many more stars than just five. Doctor Who is the best show on TV. No matter what actor plays the Doctor it is a great show. In season five Matt Smith is playing the Doctor. He plays a fun, funny Doctor, but that doesn't mean he can't get tough when an evil enemy shows up.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|With a powerhouse actor(s) like Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise, I expected more.  I fell asleep twice and I am a Sci-Fi fan.  Do not recommend.
B00AQO1VYY|4.0|The music easily rates 5 stars, but I docked a 1/2 star for the lousy slip cover housing that the CDs and DVDs come in, which leaves scratches every time you pull a disc, wincing, out. Also docked another half star for some of the bonus material, in particular the Mark Lamegan songs. Quite simply, they blow. This wasn't Mark Lamegan's band back then, with good reason--one of the songs he originally guested on, &#34;long gone day&#34; is easily the worst song on the original release.<br /><br />As for the rest of the bonus material: The live CD is fantastic. The DVD likewise. The band looks like theiy're having a good time, and it's a shame Layne couldn't get it together enough to tour behind it to promote the music. Tphis album should've been a monster hit. Layne's vanishing act was the final nail in the grunge movement's coffin.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I started playing this game today and its one of the best ways I pass time. Really fun and lots of ginger work. Maybe more than temple run or sub. surfers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and really simple to use that is all so thank you for reading this review.  As stated good clean fun
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|One of the best books ever thrilling ,erotic, clever and I've read the 2 book 3 times as well can't wait tell the 3 rd book
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is very engaging and a great way to satisfy the &quot;General&quot; in you!  I can't stop playing it. Good job, guys!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This Game is the best so far there is three stages and you can change your character to any minion you like you should really get this game
B000002JSN|5.0|I was very happy w the quality and price was only a few bucks.  I will buy again in the near future
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent read.... draws you in and doesn't let go!!!  I couldn't put it down until it was finished and closed!!
0425267695|5.0|One of the best if not the best book I have ever read. Great writing style and concepts. Do yourself a favour and read Blood Song by Anthony Ryan.
0740797719|2.0|I wish I hadn't spent the money on this book. I thought I couldn't go wrong with all the great reviews, but I found it full of technical color and light theory that is of no practical use to me. It is difficult to read and understand.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Compared to other apps this one is easier and gives more in depth definitions when you follow the links offered! I'm still learning how to advance to the next link so it should be easier for computer savvy people!
B00006LFGD|5.0|This album surprised me with the sound quality of the recordings and the (mostly) great music it contained. There were some selections I would have left out, but this is always going to be true of any compilation CD. Would unreservedly recommend it for anyone who is a Barbra Streisand fan.
B004DTLK62|5.0|This video was wonderful.  If you are somewhat curious about the life of Charlie Chaplin, then this is something that you will definitely enjoy watching.  The actor, Robert Downey, Jr., literally becomes Chaplin!  You won't be disappointed.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie actually improves upon the original story with the inclusion of a piece of backstory that gives good reasoning as to why John Carter is the fighter that he grows to be. He truly deserves the happiest life imaginable with this one hell of a woman!<br /><br />Looking forward to a sequel!
B007AL48UK|2.0|mahjong is mahjong--pretty typical game.  tiles are cute and imaginative, but difficult to differentiate.  Game notifies you right away if you try the wrong combination by showing active tiles on board--which is handy.  I can play this game, but my husband would not find this version enjoyable as the tiles are not easy to read.
0061150142|3.0|I keep a book in my car to read while waiting for someone, or while letting my dog run in the fields.  This one was read in bits as time dictated.  It got off to a slow start, and had me musing within the first 100 pages that it sounded like a Lifetime Channel movie.  The characters did finally begin to build, but not especially well.  The characters Chris encounters in jail seem to have the most life to them, but still not to where you would respond.  The book resolved the original legal question, but it left a lot of things unresolved, and not in a \\"wait until the sequel\\" kind of way.  I have another of her books - I think I'll wait on it for awhile...
1416595236|5.0|I surprised my husband with this book and he just can't put it down.  He is enjoying this read very much.  He says that this author writes very well and it was a great surprise gift.  He will be ordering more books.  Thanks, Nancy Krol
B00CWV8X04|2.0|Depressing, dreary movie. Actors were shallow and I didn't feel empathy for any of them. Didn't even finish watching it. Promos made it look more interesting.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Thoughtful and interesting. I could not put it down.  I enjoy the way he investigates the human spirit from the perspective of a totally new  and foreign environment
0345529057|5.0|Brand new in shrink wrap.  price was good.  Cost less than if purchased separately.  The third book seems harder to get through versus the first two books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best game ever!! Super challenging ( I love a good challenge :) ) Graphics are amazing. You have to be a very good thinker for this game.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The first season was very good -- maybe the best season of all.  It's an interesting look at politics behind the scenes.
B001TKKAUK|5.0|An immaculate performance of all His signature hits. The Roundheads are rocking! They're delivering the new magnificent beat to these fabulous tunes. And Ringo feels first-class with such a back-up. Amazing rock n' roll sound! Highly recommend to all who recognize the Starr's name.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's cool and a fun game but after a long time it's kinda boring great for kids though, very nice overall.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works like a charm, the bee's knees, cat's meow, and now for something completely different: everything should work this easy
B00DB31Y3U|5.0|Very cool game. Once you get the controls figured out its a lot of fun. Free app of the day is the best thing ever!
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Previews were where all the action was. The plot was decent, the explanation was cyrptic and left me scratching my head. Wait for cable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app has very good animation and is very well set up. I would recommend this app for any horse lover :)
B0052BZ6X8|1.0|This was terrible. Had so much potential. Familiar tale of alien kids making it to Earth, but the story stops there
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Enjoyed figuring the puzzles out. Good graphics. Sometimes clicked everywhere to find clue &amp; something would pop up out of nowhere. A little frustrating but not a bad game to kill time.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I liked the movie. It was a good thriller with just the right touch of suspense, comic relief, action, and the improbable. It was entertaining as a film and story. Could it have been better? Probably not. It is what it is and it works.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Very good very very good. Unreal. Really good.  Not just good. Great. Great as in awesome. Really good.  Loved it!
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|John McClain's latest in Russia was way over the top. Didn't make sense in any sense of the word. Totally out of his element and he was more like a bumbling detective who lucks into a lot of situations over his more seasoned agent son whom I would think would be more versed in the Russian culture and would have some &#34;street&#34; smarts if he was chosen as an undercover operative.
B009AY04A8|5.0|A great game and very fun to play. Has puzzles other than hidden object. I strongly recommend this game if you enjoy adventure and puzzles.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|Not often that you know the ending of the character and they can do a convincing &#34;prequel&#34;. Unlike if a person never heard of Hannibal Lecture, you know from the beginning of what he's capable of. The actor who portrays him does a magnificent portrayal. The story line thus far is far fetched knowing what we already know, but watching it unravel and how it is woven with this character is a riveting game of cat and mouse leaving the veiwer wondering what the end game is for Hannibal and how his character goes from the television show to the Silence of the Lambs back in the 90's
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I love how the one boy believes that love exists and he works hard to bring a couple back together.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Must see!  Acting is subperb and storyline is intriguing yet very identifiable. I highly recommend this film!  Kudos to Dame Maggie Smith!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love the graphics with the twists and turns.  Makes you think out the box.  Graphics on the Kindle are very realistic.  Love this game.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Every English teacher can tell you that the film is never as good as the book.  That is not the case with this movie.  Gregory Peck's Oscar-winning performance, wonderful child actors, and a cameo from young Robert Duvall make this film a don't miss.  Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay was well-deserved, for it's a rare movie that stands up to a sensational novel like Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird.  This film is on many critic's Top 100 Movie lists, and it would be on mine.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What moew can you say about Dounton Abbey?  It's television the way I want to watch.  Elegant, beautifully acted and written.  Breathtaking to view.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Really loved this novel. An entertaining combination of history and humor.  I would definitely read more by this author! X
078062582X|5.0|Got this and was very skeptical. Enjoyed it. Thought it was funny an did not drag. So give it a shot.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|This is an old time favorite for me! It's a great love movie! This is a movie based on love, where the saying &#34; if it's meant to be it will be&#34; is part of the movie. Really great chick flick!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I don't think that you should have to submit a review just to be able to advance in the levels. but this is a cool game
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|My &#34;nic&#34; was one that I chose in 1999 because I couldn't get the one I wanted. I chose the name of the singer in the band I loved. I probably should have chosen the name of the writer of the songs I loved the most (Chris Degarmo) but you go with what you knew at the time. This album (CD...whatever you choose to term it) is what I loved the most of the band since I first started following it...Great music...Great lyrics and a clear love of what is given. I know the history, I know what has happened. I may not be able to change the nickname I chose over a decade ago, but I can clearly see which configuration is the TRUE Queensryche.  This is TRUE.
1610660242|5.0|I took notes on both. They are both a quick read. I would buy both again. I would like to meet Tony Hsieh one day.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|\\"I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I only know what I can do.\\"<br /><br />I went to see the new Star Trek movie, in 3D. It was very good. If I was rating for Netflix, it would get a 4 out of a 5 star rating. It's actually 4 1/2 but it's not a 5, so you rate it as you can. Very good but not GREAT. Since I won't give spoilers, I have to say there was one scene, very emotional, that would have sold it for me. There was some foreshadowing but not clumsy and neon appointed \\"hey this is what's gonna happen.\\" I was so into it that I didn't read the solution right away, but still figured it out before everyone in the movie did.<br /><br />The 'bad guy' is a very bad guy, and I enjoyed that kind of clarity because it's not always that clear in life. I get a queasy /creepy feeling when I spot a shoplifter at work. I know it even when they act friendly toward me. It's the same feeling I get every time a politician appears on TV. That's both parties, you are fooling yourself if you really believe that Your party is better. It's the power thing. I see people gravitate toward power and criminals as though it would make them powerful by osmosis. I wrote about the TV show Hannibal, a while back, and how it was tempting to sympathize with the evil title character. This the same kind of reach; people who feel powerless in their lives sometimes accept bad and even evil in order to try to overcome what they think they lack.<br /><br />At work one night, one of my co-workers had denied a sale of alcohol to a man because he appeared to have been drinking. He got belligerent and, by the time I got there, his actions left me no choice but to ask him to leave. He then tried going into the main part of the store but I stood in front of him and told him that he had been asked to leave. He was insistent, I remained firm in my resolve and this standoff went on for about a minute. At that point, a member of a large biker gang came over, and told the guy I had asked him to leave. He then grabbed him by the shirt and threw him through the door. Drunky was in over his head, and all I could picture was him getting the beating of his life, or worse, and me having to spend the rest of the night talking to the police.<br /><br />I got between Drunky and the Biker and told Biker that I had it covered and to go ahead and take off before the cops came. Drunky was on the phone at that moment calling the police. Biker kept moving toward Drunky, but I stayed between them, calming Biker down, thanking him and assuring him that I would take care of the situation. Biker and his friends left. The police came about a minute later but Drunky proceeded to irritate the cops enough that they ended up taking him in and never asked me what had happened.<br /><br />Later, one of my co-workers commented how it was cool that the Biker had helped and I said, No, it wasn't. It's easy to appreciate a wrong thing done that helps you out but it doesn't change the nature of the action. It's still a wrong thing. That's true without going \\"worst case scenarios\\" where it easily could have turned on me for getting in the middle. That's the nature of bad and evil. You'll accept it as long as it's not directed at you. Whether it's a pork laden bill passed by Congress, or a crappy law that helps you or your family out at the expense of others...or just a pissed off Biker looking for a fight. Wrong is still wrong.<br /><br />In the movie, there were bad things done, and other worse things to be done because one person was justifying his actions by going \\"worst case scenario.\\" This (bad action) will prevent even more awful things. I know, confusing, but that's what happens when you try to let \\"a little bad\\" or evil in. You start to think a little bad won't hurt....much.<br /><br />The line that stuck with me was from Kirk saying the line at the top of this post. If I ever told you that I had a plan for the most stressful times and incidents that have happened to me, you should feel free to call me a liar. Instinct, experience, and knowledge each play a part. Prayer plays the biggest roll and I wonder why I haven't proclaimed it more. Sometimes the world and life seem overwhelming and about to conquer everything around. I look up, and around and now I will say:<br /><br />\\"I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I only know what I can do.\\" I'll pray and then move forward. I know that Good is better to follow, and will win in the end. I will also remember to say Thank you God! And remind myself that I probably should have said that first.
0307463745|5.0|thnoughts.<br />I bought this and &#34;Delivering Happiness: (Zappos)&#34; I took notes on both. They are both a quick read. I would buy both again.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a pretty fun game...seems perfectly playable without any in game purchases.<br /><br />My girls really like passing time with it.
B00ECP764C|5.0|The absolute best feature of this flick is the spectacular CGI cinematography.  Turn off the soundtrack and the BluRay alone makes it worth the purchase. The LE metal case is a free bonus.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I'm not the greatest hip hop fan but I like to think my taste in music is good. For hip hop, I prefer Billy Woods, Black Star, Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, EL-P and Ratking - in short, a lot of stuff that's not necessarily mainstream. I love Twisted Dark Fantasy despite one or two issues concerning irritating loops or irritating vocals. I thought Cruel Summer was disappointing, cliched and largely forgettable.<br />However, for Yeezus, West has impressed me. It's not as fantastic as Twisted Dark Fantasy but I would rate it as his second best album. I love the unique beats, his rapping and the unusual style of the songs. He's gone out of his way to think up something new. It is sparse however, almost minimal in comparison to previous efforts (as you can tell by the 'album cover') - but by no means bad.<br />I would say however, I was really dissappointed with some really annoying vocal effects within Blood on the Leaves (some of the female loops are really horrible to listen to over and over). And I find the same issue with poorly used repetitive looping on the last track, Bound 2 where the \\"uh-huh honey\\" is oddly used.<br />Lastly, I felt the album ended a bit prematurely. Other then that, this was a great album to listen to. It has replay value and makes for a different hip hop/rap album to the mainstream norm. I actually look forward to what Kanye will do next and really hope we don't see an end to his creative musical adventures.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This little gizmo has provided good connectivity and a pleasant surprise for how easy it is to set up it is allowed us to stream YouTube videos very easily and Netflix movies in high definition very well it this device is only going to get better with updates its good now and will be better with some improvements
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Works well on my Samsung Galaxy S4, Almost like the original. Fun little game. Easy to learn. Can't beat the price.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was completely mesmerized by this series.  It is rare that I can immerse myself into a TV show but this one captivated me form the start.
B000BVD460|5.0|enjoying this cd just as much as the rated one... Was happy to find it new, but would of been happy with used
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|One of the best, if not the best documentary I have ever seen! Dave does it again. Man of many talents.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Purchased the first one for one of my daughters. Loved them so much had to own my own. One of those trilogies you can watch over and over.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I found this to be a very easy read, interesting and informative.  The author does a good job to stick to an historical perspective of a  person who's story is so controversial.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|was purchased for my daughter for one of the songs, but starting to like the rest of the cd. Takes time and they will grow on you.
B009WUBERW|3.0|I actually expectexd soemthing better since it had chuck Norris in it, some funny humor if you are old enough to catch all the references but the first one was better.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great performances by all actors. Great writing with suspence and revelation in every episode. I am new to this amazing serious and was happy I could watch seasons 1 and 2 without waiting a week.  How will I bare the weekly wait in Season 3!  This is a MUST watch series!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I just love this app its so awesome its like the funnist multyplayer game I've ever played it's ssssoooo<br />AMESOME. I just really really really like it so ya its awesome.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I'm not totally through reading this book yet, but reading it is giving me chills as I know most of what it says to be true. It's a very enjoyable read, and it gives me lots of hope. I know hands down this stuff works, my biggest obstacle I'm realizing is myself. But I know once I get focused, the FP is there for me all I have to do is summon it<br /><br />Once again I realize the biggest problem is getting out of my head and into the zone of where I want to be and the things I want. I know for a fact this works, as I've tested it time and time again on little things and sometimes big things, but I know it works. Considering we only use a very small percentage of our brains, and now knowing what the rest is capable of, you'd be foolish NOT to get into this book and challenge yourself to the infinite possibilities of what IS!!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I really like this game a lot but the only thing that I don't like is that you can only get trading portal and the library thing along with the along with the battle collision and the the other things are only available on Apple devices. I have this game on my kindle and android phone and on both of them I can't get any of those things
B000005H3M|5.0|Big Swing Face personifies Buddy Rich in his approach, style and energy. This CD blends his incredible drumming techniques with an energetic enthusiastic talented band. Every selection features the exciting adrenalin coming from Buddy and his wonderful ensemble. This is a \\"must have\\" for any jazz aficionado.
1440503257|5.0|My lilttle cousin is a big harry fan and i purchased this book for her because she wants to throw a big harry potter feast. This book has so many wonderful recipes to try and i love how its designed....
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an exciting page turner with lots of twists. Couldn't put it down, need to check out others by this author.
B00DYEN6XC|2.0|This is a pretty decent movie with lots of action. I just wonder why they didn't add the figurines to 3D version of the Blu-Ray set. It means you have to buy two sets. As for the UV copy, it's a con. One should be able watch these digital copies for an unlimited amount of time.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Loved the book so much I watched the whole series on Netflix and can't wait for season two. The Netflix series departs from the book but not in a way that I was ever disappointed with. Would like to see a second book that covers the transition back to life after prison.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A very realistic description of English society, still very much in place nowadays. Great cast and intelligent  dialog . English subtitles not well placed and sometimes not syncronized
B009WUBERW|3.0|This movie is strictly to watch all the old action heros and maybe some of them needed a payday. So if you like constant action with clearly defined villains and heroes here it is ! The plot is superflous to the frequency of auto and semi-automatic weapon fire with all calibers making themselves known. Apparently they never heard of the ammunition shortage that is going on in the United States. If you have an interest in shooting as I do, ( targets , never living creatures) the supernatural ability to run and dive and shoot is breathtaking to say the least. It was exactly what I had expected so fire away Sly and friends and make another one.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminds one of old school arcade gaming.  This was a blast.  Graphics and ability to upgrade items was really cool.
B005F9TQ9C|5.0|Originally spread over 2LPs, it's taken many years before it clicked with me how wonderful this record actually is. I'm glad I ignored the negative comments about Self Portrait otherwise I would have missed out on this delightful record with it's general nostalgic, take it easy vibe.<br /><br />Self Portrait is certainly different from the rest of Bob Dylan's records, and one track, a cover of B. Byrant's \\"Take me as I am or let me go\\" sums up for me the best way to approach this recording.<br /><br />Leave expectations aside, take Self Portrait at face value, and enjoy the beautiful mixture of tracks that include originals songs, cover versions, live versions and the instrumentals.<br /><br />This CD is one of a few early Bob Dylan's that has never been remastered, but no worries on that score as it sounds fine just the way it is.<br /><br />**This review was written before news that a remastered version of Self Portrait was to be made available to those who bought the very expensive deluxe edition of Bob Dylan / Another Self Portrait 1969-1971: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 10 (4CD + book).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters are all so engaging, even the unlikable ones.  They are very well developed.  Even the people you love to hate are shown to have depth in their characters.
B00AEBBA0Y|3.0|I read the novel years ago when it first came out, then saw the film when it was released. I enjoyed it then. Extremely well produced and photographed, and very enjoyable entertainment.  The budget of the film is definitely on the screen.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I didn't expect to be able to laugh out loud when I watched this.  It is even better than Red2 in theaters now.  The characters are very likable.  Situation are farfetched and well done.  Love the relationship between Bruce Willis and John Malkovich.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Conner and Megan . Wow I was so glad this book was FREE I really enjoy reading this book. I laughed and I cried. It was so good. I could not put it down at all.the love making was intense and romantic. I was on the end of my seat.trying to see if the were going to work it out or not. But they did Love THIS BOOK!!!!. I wish there was a second book. I was not done reading Bout Conner and Megan at all. I WANT MORE !!!! Thanks you Mira Lyn Kelly . Amazing book
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|This app is great if you are using Gmail.  It is similiar to using Gmail on a computer.  The price is great for this app and I do encourage anyone using Gmail to install it their tablet for a better experience.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Short and to the point. Easy to follow and understand, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get in shape
B00DW39B2K|1.0|What a mish mash junker. Do not buy or rent, especially if you are a fan of Denero or Travolta. I refuse to take the time to describe how stupid this flic is. Wish I could cut it a break, but it doesn't deserve it. I dare you to try not to laugh when you hear Travolta's terrible fake Serb dialect or see his ridiculous beard. Just try.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Another awesome product by Google.  Works perfectly.  Android interaction works perfect with all my Nexus products.  Highly recommended.  Netflix works great!
B002OOG6YY|1.0|I was actually at this show so was looking forward to getting it.  The Video is so much better on this than the previous release.  It's a cohesive show, it looks great and is well edited.  The vocals as others have mentioned, does not sync up at all and is definitely not from this performance.  I'm a producer and engineer and have put together a lot of these DVD's and I can tall you exactly what happened.  They clearly went back into the studio and re recorded ALL of the \\"live\\" vocals.  Unfortunately, it's not that uncommon.  Not only is this obvious because it doesn't sync up but it's obvious they also did it with a studio mic which sounds very different then a live mic.  It's especially disappointing because this is specifically advertised as a real representation of this specific show.  They really blew an opportunity here to do something very cool.
B007MDB71O|5.0|what a fantastic film. How did we never here of this film before? The whole family was gripped it has everything a fantasy film should have. Now I'm off to find it on Blu ray, luckily  being that we only have just seen this for the first time lets hope a sequel isn't far away.
B000MV9026|5.0|My 3 yr old granddaughters love this movie! One of our favorites. Very sweet movie that holds their attention the whole time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game to play with the family!<br />Hope there are a lot more rooms to go through. A very cool game.<br />Thanks
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very well written, with great voice and writing style. A MUST READ, ESPECIALLY FOR TEENS who enjoy reading. Stephen Chbosky struck gold!
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Sweet, no- violence, no sex, no drugs...100% real family entertainment. The way television and movies uses to be.  Such a shame more programs aren't like this.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game.  Though I'd probably do better with a stylus.  It ramps up in difficulty pretty quickly.  It was free app off the day but I'd probably buy it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved the way the story developed. Could hardly wait for the continuing episodes.  The plot moves along at a perfect pace -- keeping my interest and begging for more.
B005IT0V8O|5.0|A Must for any student.  Easy to understand and helps improve writing skills.  I had the old paper back version but glad to see they have it on Kindle now.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|If you want to have a sense of ancient Alexandria, this is a sine qua non.<br /><br />The scenes of the library of Alexandria quite moving.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I'm amazed how they have kept this series fresh. Not surprised the series will end this year. I will miss it.
B003MC5N28|4.0|This is part of a set of books that should be a must-read for all. I highly recommend this series.
0143124544|4.0|I really enjoyed the development of characters and the story in Me Before You.  The end of the story left me devastated and haunted.  So, I guess you could say it was a good read; just make sure your boundaries are up!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is a really good Steven King book.  I found it hard to put down and read it in a just a day or two.
B001FQFFMG|5.0|I love this movie. Have watched it several times. It's about the life of Johnny Cash, and the love of his life June Carter Cash. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are fantastic playing the leading roles. They actually had to sing all of the music in the film, which made it more believable. Wonderful movie.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book is quite explicit, but the story line is believeable and gives you a little insight into an alternate lifestyle.  Wasn't interested enough to read the second and third books.  Definitely for adults.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|After awhile the objects are repeated so I would like to see updated lists of things to draw. Other than that it is great fun
B009LMTDL0|3.0|While Sheryl definitely has an interesting, inspiring story of success, most of this book is a feminist manifesto, pointing out why the gender gap is still so big and why women still aren't equal.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|If you are looking to kill time this is the game for it. It is not obey hard but not too easy
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This is my first rating ever.  This movie was too much gore for me.  Yes there are special effects, but too much blood.  I guess I was looking for something like the movie Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app makes me so happy. This is my favorite app to play. It's fun and addictive, and always takes away my boredom away, great app (:
B00EBRWN80|1.0|Very few channels in English, most of those that were said they couldn't be played. This app is an absolute waist of time.
0345529057|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Game Of Thrones series and am enjoying the books even more, I have been burried in the books since recieving them.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good time killer. Enjoyable and the upgrades are good. I remember this on the Atari all in one console. Enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|me and my dater love to play this game one horror a day we play it.we laghe and have fun
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It is awesome and it helps me learn about my safety and when I get a gun I will know how to use it.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book was formula for about 100 pages and the it began to shine. Great character, great story, waiting for the next book
B0068PHS5Q|5.0|As it has been said before, this is a very good example of the type of book that would suit the scrutiny of a book club.  The characters are beautifully portrayed and the storyline although rather far-fetched is entertaining.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I really liked this book, which explores the abstract quality of character as it relates to success in a young person's life (in the traditional sense - staying out of jail, graduating from high school and college, and getting a job). It wasn't excatly &#34;light&#34; reading - much research on the topic is discussed here, along with some framework for how this question has played out in the political landscape- but it was definitely a rewarding read; inspiring, even. I definitely recommend this if you are remotely interested in education reform and/or public policy on the subject of poverty. As a parent, I was hoping the author would give concrete advice on how to instill this character in every day parenting, but perhaps that's a subject of another book.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|You won't be disappointed with this depiction of yet another story where the characters traverse and survive war torn Afghanistan.  A very informative book on the hardships endured by the poor in that country and their indomitable human spirit.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|This movie is action action action.  lets just say if I would not mess with this woman. Ouch! I feel it already
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was amusing and entertaining.  The main character was endearing in his brutal honesty which was obviously driven by Asperger tendencies.  A love story of a totally different kind.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The mystery is satisfying and the characters are very intriguing. The whole series is well developed and produced.  I wouldn't be able to choose my favorite actor because the whole cast was captivating in their roles.  I look forward to a second season of this wonderful show.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Having just been to Sweden I found the places mentioned easy to identify with and have to say I was a bit horrified with the plethora of retirement homes springing up.  I loved the way the author treated the main character's personality and interwove his life into significant events in world history.  A great weekend's read.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I really enjoyed all the characters.  The understated humor and confidence of the characters was very entertaining.  Plot twists and surprises kept my interest.  Funny, love story, action, craziness and gripping all at the same time makes this a must see.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I started this book almost 2 years ago and was initially very disappointed with the myriad new characters and tons of new side/sub plots.  But after watching the most recent HBO GofT series I was having withdrawal symptoms, and so I began this book again.  Parts of it were very good and other parts not so much.  All in all, though, I am glad I read it.  It was a bit of a slog at times but now it's on to book five!
0670014893|5.0|Two British civil servants, one younger, one older, from different<br />social backgrounds, each committed in his own way to to doing the<br />right thing, to being on the up-and-up, each expecting transparency<br />and decency from colleagues and superiors, find themselves in a new<br />world in which covert operations are outsourced to vague corporate<br />entities and the rules are all somehow changed. Traditional channels<br />of reporting wrongs lead to dead ends. They face difficult<br />choices. Reading this book in the summer of 2013, its topic of<br />personal responsibility in the context of secret government-corporate<br />interaction, at a time when even the courts are secret, seems more<br />relevant than ever.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed's gift as an author is her ability to share her emotional and physical transition and trancendance as she hikes the PCT. Her descriptive powers place you inside her head and heart and body as she moves from despair through acceptance into forgiveness and gratitude. Her story is powerful and inspiring.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I love This app it does what I want it to do, it is very easy to use and I think it picks  up sound fine I don't have a problem with it at all :) &lt;3
1439102813|4.0|I had difficulty putting this book down!  My spouse has AD and it illuminated many frustrations, feelings, and needs of the patient.  There is so much written about the caregiver's needs from their perspectives but not enough about the afflicted.  My spouse wants a support group for him to attend. That was highlighted.  The early onset of the disease was frightening.  This is a disease in need of more funding for ongoing genetic research and testing of new drug options for the reversal of the disease. I liked the Q and A of the author and the study guide in the back of the book.
B00A03WBVI|5.0|This is a really great album. I love every song on it. Its nice because all the songs are good.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Excellent memoir.  Very well written and would recommend to other people to read. Very eye opening to what life is like on the inside of the federal prison system.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|..Stepping away from a hectic day<br />made easy by this game. Take your time and use the hints when you're stuck.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|This book presents a different view of Jesus based on the historical events that are documented for the area he lived in. It confirmed some of the traditional beliefs and disputed others. Worth reading if you are open minded.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The only tv show I've actually paid to see, and probably the only one I ever will, though never say never.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show.. wish I didn't have to wait so long for the next season, the actors are excellent.. it's interesting to see how the other half lived
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's ok, modern version to an already old concept. Let's time go by fast I suppose. The upgradeable things make it a bit funnier.
B00EQ0CKRQ|2.0|The screen shots and description are totally misleading. The graphics are not as good as asphalt 6, the crashes are totally lame because your car doesn't fall apart at all, if you just tap a wall you crash, the controls are hard, and the jumps are also pretty lame. Gameloft, if you make another lame game that you say is really fun, you will lose this customer and probably other customers too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am so sad at th  end but the rest is AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait till I can get the third book
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Sure is a great game. I used to play this on a Windows 95 computer, but now I'm actually good at it! The touch screen helps, and makes this take on the classic well worth the dollar once it's full priced.
B00AEFY08O|5.0|First off, an incredible love story with great<br />imagination and depth.<br />A man with limited mental abilities<br />who falls into success.<br />A touching courageous film for the entire family.<br />Awesome blu ray!!!
030758836X|4.0|Very Fast read, keeps you hooked with the numerous plot twists.  Well written and a book I couldn't put down.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I really enjoyed this game... 4 stars for me. I don't play a lot of games but I'm very into this one
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Tom cruise is just weird, I have never like one of his acting movies, and after the crazy stuff he pulled on Oprah , the best thing about this movie was Morgan freeman, can't believe he made this movie. Usually he chooses great story's , this movie has no great anything so boring, I fell asleep, the twist at the end was the only part that had some interest of a plot in a movie that would keep you into it, but this was at the end so there you have it, looks cool but it should be blown to oblivion.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Really happy with the chrome cast even if I had a somehow difficult setup. The chrome cast wouldn't connect to my wifi with a net gear router (WDC3400 I believe) I had to use an other wifi network to get it to work.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|What is there to say about this movie, other than it was great. The story is great and the twist of the whole story line will just go wow.
B00DSY8D36|3.0|It is OK needs a lot of updated features.  I am an iAnnotate PDF user for along time on my iPad which I use constantly for teaching and preaching.  But when I use my iPad for presenting a powerpoint I needed something for my notes.  I am using a Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;.  It does not have enough of the features or as easy to use as iAnnotate.  It looses the annotations and I have to keep bookmarking the page where I left off.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome I am so addicted to this game cant stop playing this so cool worth trying this ...:p
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I enjoy this game very much and you don't have to wait to earn energy. You can get it by completing tasks
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I am a Follett freak. This was very similar to &#34;The Key to Rebecca&#34;, yet, it doesn't matter, Ken Follett will always be top notch in my reading time. Thank you Amazon for offering him.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great for our living room that has a projector in it.  Everyone can stream videos to it straight from their phone or computer, it's great.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a ful game. I have enjoyed it. I just wish I could link my kindle and my android phone together. It would make it easier to play the game.
1594203334|3.0|Before I begin my review, I think it is only fair to warn you that I read Bringing up Bebe at a time when my son was 13 months old, and still not sleeping through the night. I had also just made the very difficult decision to resign from work to be a stay at home mum. So, as you can imagine, the last thing I needed was to hear how all French babies sleep through the night from 4 months and that being a SAHM may increase my chance of divorce by an alarming percentage.<br /><br />So, my emotional state being duly noted, let's get on with the review.<br /><br />Pamela Druckerman is an American journalist who married an English journalist and has set up house in Paris. As the title suggests (I'm not giving anything away here) she falls pregnant and has her baby far away from the American life she is accustomed to.<br /><br />Along with the challenges of adjusting to life in a foreign country, she begins to notice differences in the behaviour of French children as opposed to her own American raised daughter. They are polite, independent, sleep through the night and are not fussy eaters. She investigates the seemingly superior French parenting, and Bringing up Bebe is the collection of her findings and observations.<br /><br />I don't think this book was ever written as a parenting guide, it is clearly a memoir. However I found myself feeling guilty and judged at certain points. For example, apparently it takes French women 3 months to lose their pregnancy weight. Fail! It is important for French mothers to go back to work relatively soon after baby is born. Fail! And baby sleeping through at 4 months, well FAIL!<br /><br />Having said that, there are certain ideas that are very interesting, especially when it comes to the French treatment of food and feeding a child. I can also appreciate the French woman's need for `me time' (Yes, please!) and encouraging your child towards independence.<br /><br />It is, of course, a very generalized view of both French and American parents. I am sure, somewhere in Paris; a 13-month-old keeps his parents up at night, while an American toddler will happily nibble on a carrot stick instead of a McDonald's chicken nugget.<br /><br />Overall, Bringing up Bebe is an interesting read with a few good ideas, but personally I am glad I am not raising my child in France. The expectation to be the perfect parent and woman would kill me. And while sitting at the park with my Jimmy Choo's and size 6 Prada suit sipping a skinny latte watching the kids play quietly by themselves sounds divine, I quite enjoy running after my son in my muddy trainers.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the language, the description of places, food, and feelings. The author is a superb storyteller! I've read all of his books and have yet to be disappointed.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|The members of Rush started out as masters of their craft.  That in itself is a distressing realization to anyone who writes or plays an instrument, but Peart, Lee, and Lifeson began at the top and rose from there.<br /><br />This latest album , though, is so much more than anything they have produced before.  The concept album trilogy that began with 2112 were the songs of defiant and eventually cynical then hopeful youth.  Clockwork Angels is the autobiography of a sensitive, intelligent Everyman who has reached the maturity to laugh along with life, instead of fight it at each step.  \\"Headlong Flight,\\" reminiscent of \\"My Way,\\" sung by Frank Sinatra, takes the whole of life, its bad and its good, and expresses love for all of it.  \\"The Garden,\\" the most lyrical of Rush songs, even keeping \\"Different Strings\\" in mind, quotes Candide by telling us that the only thing we can do is tend our own gardens--in other words, live our own lives in the best way we can for ourselves and for those around us.<br /><br />Review by the author of [[ASIN:0983687242 A Draft of Moonlight]]
B009RH9J7W|5.0|The case is great. I just started to use the rotating feature so that I could just READ and not hold my Kindle. It makes it hands free with just a 'dot' to turn the page. I love it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Its a pretty fun game when you have to kill time. Upgrades make it fun. A few more of them would be nice though.
B002T9H2LK|3.0|Historians have debated whether the Allies could have taken action in time to lessen the horrors of the Holocaust once they knew what was going on in the death camps.  Opinion is divided.  Tarantino jumps into the fray with a tall tale of a commando unit consisting of American Jewish soldiers (led by a non-Jewish officer) sent after the Normandy invasion to demoralize the German Army by killing captured German soldiers in gruesome ways -- I won't spoil it by saying how.  Think about this for a second.  (a) Would the U.S. military have approved such an operation realizing (as they must have) what the Germans would have done to captured American soldiers in retaliation? (b) The idea that the German Army would have thrown in the towel, or even been slowed down, just because Brad Pitt and his gang were running amok is silly, e.g., the surprise that came to be known as the Battle of the Bulge.  Now, if Brad had brought Angelina along as Lara Croft, who knows ...<br /><br />Viewers who can suspend disbelief (there's more to suspend than I've indicated, lots more) and \\"go with the flow\\" will enjoy this movie.  It is visually inventive and the acting is terrific.  Waltz deserved his Oscar; the movie is worth watching just to see what a master actor can do.  You know what you're getting when you go to a Tarantino flick; he delivers trademarked thrills and things \\"blow up good.\\"  Only three stars because I found myself going \\"huh?\\" too many times as the story switched gears and entered truly preposterous territory.  Incidentally, one thing Tarantino gets absolutely right is the \\"branding\\" idea, which is how we should have treated the hard core Nazis we captured, but didn't.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I liked it, the move had a lot action. Nice to see the author do something different from the twilight books
B000005HBI|4.0|give yourself time to explore this cd and you want be disappointed with the variety of rhythms and percussion arrangements
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game reminds me of temple run (which I really enjoy).  I am a really, really big fan of the minions and the Despicible Me movies:-) so this game is great.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a marvelous device for streaming youtube and netflix so far.  With the APIs that are coming, I'll be very interested to see what comes next.  I had no trouble setting it up, and was even able to get houseguests streaming youtube videos at a recent party with little effort.  The quality is high, and even the Chrome browser streaming that's still in beta works decently well.  For this price, I can't imagine having gotten a device even this good.  Unless you already own every other streaming device on the market, you need this thing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game! Really fun, great updates, awesome tracks. A great selection of vehicles. It's super addictive too! Definitely worth giving it a try.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|GPA amazed me during an interview. I enjoyed his spoken word but his writing has made me a fan! I loved the different types of poetry used. I also truly enjoyed the ability to enjoy reading about lust, love and sex without feeling embarresed. Great book and it was supposed to be my read for the week but I finished it today!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app gives you a multitude of options for solving problems. It's always available at your fingertips. I recommend this app highly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have loaded this game on my iPhone, my iPad and on my Kindle Fire HD.  Everywhere I go, I end up picking up one of these devices and playing this game.  In terms of a &#34;perfect&#34; game, this comes as close as I have found for this version of Solitaire.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I would like to get my cones back. I don`t won't to have this program take over my Kindle<br /><br />Thank you.  Cliff
B003D5X3VM|3.0|It was not as good as expected. His previous one was much better. Hopefully his next release will improve. We will see!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game was great. I enjoyed playing it. Even decided to actually spend a couple bucks and buy gems... not 24 hours after that my game updated... now it wont play. Stops at 50% download and tells me &quot;string not found&quot;. WTF!? I tried reinstalling,  no luck.<br />This is the 3rd Gameloft game that screwed up on my Kindle. Wont bother trying any more of their products...Most certainly wouldn't dare spending money on them either.
0425269205|4.0|I've been reading this series from the beginning. Love the characters and the authors approach. Am heart sick by the TV version and the abuse of story lines and bazaar way it continues -but like a train wreck still watch the the thing.\\"Dead Ever After\\" did seem somewhat rushed but I was glad it ended as it did Sam always seemed right to me. Sookie I shall miss you.Thank you Charlaine for a wonderful ride.I look forward to your next endeavor.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|To be honest, not the epic fight as the original Kirk vs. Kahn fight. Still, good movie, worth watching. Interesting twists in this movie.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game to pass the time when bored. Love the upgrades you can get to help survive in later levels.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Good read- the kind that draws you back in page after page. I love a book that you don't want to put down.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was one that I could not put down. Every character in the book was so real that I could see some of myself in each person!  The writting and development of characters was similar to Maeve Binchy's work (which I love).  I really enjoyed this book and it is one I would definately recommend.  The ending was so so good -- she wove a wonderful tale and she completed each character for me at the end.  It was just great!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|A wonderful book. I couldn't put it down! I never could guess what was going to happen from one page to the next. I will definitely be reading other books by s.j Watson.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Cute movie I enjoyed it.  I know it was meant for a very young audience but I am a senior and did think it very adorable
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a pretty good game. Only problem is it can get repetitive.And the upgrades get<br />expensive and hard to get
B009AY04A8|4.0|I tend to be impatient, but the story really does add to the game. Fun and mildly frustrating at the same time. Isn't that the challenge.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a wonderful game! Great picture, great minions, great bananas... until the ads started to kick in... in the middle of a game! When the ads started, it was going veeeeeerrrrrrryyyyyyy slow. Be careful!

B00B7364H2|5.0|I finding there's good recordings of classical music that i've never heard of before, it's like a discovery trip. So far i'm only one third through them. Normally I would mostly play vinyl but I decided to get this box set to sample for future vinyl purchase, and the big plus.... it's at such a good price.  I'm finding real good quality music in the CDs, mainly the strength/power and clarity of Mercury recordings.  I'd love to purchase series 1 at the same budget price!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|when I get the app it just wont install and everytime I try it wont install I don't know if this app is only for kindle fire hd

B0029ZA49Q|5.0|I initially had the tamrac straps for the chest case.  Very awkward, never really figured out how to properly use those.  Bought these based on good reviews and I was not disappointed.  I followed the advice of others and used it upside down for my camera case (tamrac case).  Worked great for my Mt. Whitney trip this past June.

B004YOEFG8|4.0|Amazing pictures, great colors, good use of 3D!<br />This blu-ray meet my expectations. It works in europe unlike stated on amazon product details.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder's near perfection shines through in many ways: character development, cultural references, pacing, and story--oh the story!<br /><br />Every fifth grader should read this book. Schools should issue it; parents should read along. If one book has captured the feelings of going into a new school or a new grade, Wonder has done it. This is a heartwarming coming of age story that should not be missed.<br /><br />I spotted some tiny imperfections, such as `putting down a Playstation' or a snowstorm that was showed up on different dates.  However, those minor blemishes dwarfed in comparison to the beauty of the whole. If anything, R.J. Palacio nailed cultural references, varying points of view, and true-to-life narrative perspectives.<br /><br />To me, the book's goal involved the beauty of us--all of us.  It achieved that goal.<br /><br />I give this book an easy five stars and recommend it to everyone, of all ages.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|The movie Hannah is a good representation of how a child may be taught anout thee corrupt evil forces that surround us. Realizing not all of us are former agents of the government yet is is necessary to have diversefied skills in order to survive in the world today.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The device works great! In fact it works better than I had even hoped and with the additional features soon to follow could there really be a better investment?
B009WUBERW|3.0|This movie is very corny.<br />Many of the older actors really ham it up, especially Mr. &#34;I'll Be Back&#34;.<br />It can be slow moving at times but most of the action scenes are fun.
B000W8HC8I|2.0|I would not recommend this book.  If you have read one story of drug addiction, then you have read them all.  I was hoping to read about how his scams actually worked and what he did to build his boiler room, but instead the book is about him constantly doing drugs and cheating on his wife with hookers.  Pretty boring overall.
034580404X|4.0|I still haven't read them, but they are a great asset to my bookshelf. Finally I can find out why everyone likes them
B00EEXST2K|4.0|Andy Bellin wrote the screenplay for this biopic-type film directed by both Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman which relates the life of Linda Lovelace, known as the queen of adult porn for her controversial role in the 1972 film DEEP THROAT and the writer of the confessional book ORDEAL which gave the public the `real story' behind the girl who was Lovelace before she died in 2002 - the girl who is used and abused by the porn industry at the behest of her coercive husband, before taking control of her life. The film is basically divided into two parts - the fantastical story of a freckled face `innocent' girl of strict upbringing who rises to fame by being the first porn star to perform fellatio on the screen and gained fame and stardom, and the second part of how this naïve girl was the victim of the abusive husband and porn industry until she gained the courage to marry and have a family and step out of the spotlight of her fame in Deep Throat.<br /><br />And the manner in which the two views on the same girl are interconnected in the film is the strong point of the movie: the technique of show `reality' while simultaneously depicting `fiction' works well. The cast is strong: Amanda Seyfried does a star turn as Linda Lovelace (aka Linda Susan Boreman aka Mrs. Larry Marchiano) though much of Lovelace's life is omitted (her liver transplant, her messy divorces, her other films, etc); Peter Sarsgaard is excellent as the smarmy drug-addled Chuck Traynor, the man who convinced Lovelace to enter porn; Sharon Stone and Robert Patrick as her rigid parents; Juno Temple in the thankless role as Lovelace's only friend Patsy; and the porn guys - Chris Noth, Bobby Cannavale,  Hank Azaria, Adam Brody as the well-endowed Harry Reems (though that of course is never filmed), Chloë Sevigny as a Feminist Journalist, James Franco as Hugh Hefner, fellow porn star Dolly as portrayed well by Debi Mazar, Wes Bentley, Eric Roberts, and Ron Pritchard as Sammy Davis Jr.! There are real taped interviews and comments by Johnny Carson, Bob Hope and  Walter Cronkite which enhance the credibility.<br /><br />The film closes with an interview after Lovelace has revealed her past in her best selling book ORDEAL - and at that point the film slides down the hill of Hallmark type feel good. An entertaining film about a name from the 20th century that deserves visiting despite the fact that it simply goes on too long.

B00AFROVQC|3.0|It is a good story, I liked it and I am reading the next one. I cant give it more stars because I find difficult sometimes to believe the characters, it is like they are somehow one way and then they change but in a way that it is imposible. But still it is a good story, and it is ok to read.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Overall, the story let's down this movie. Have we not had enough of aliens stealing Earth's water? There was no excitement, no special moments and nothing memorable.<br /><br />The characters are not particularly interesting.<br /><br />If you are putting actors like Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, I think you should be something better with them, then what they did. Although I think, the best performance was by Andrea Riseborough possibly as she had the most interesting character.<br /><br />The acting is good, and the filming was good. The special effects were above average.<br /><br />Would I see it again? No as I know the ending.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? The problem here is that to appreciate it. You need the big screen, but I do not think its worth the price for a ticket to see it.
B005S9ELVC|2.0|Gangster Squad, 2013 film     The movie begins with the story of boxer Mickey Cohen. The narrator says Los Angeles changed after the war (the effects of prosperity?). A man from Chicago gets a message to take back. Later a man picks up a young woman at a bus station. A policeman follows her into the room. There are shots and fighting. \\"Welcome to Los Angeles.\\" Those who resist are arrested. The judge releases them. Is Mickey Cohen protected by the Establishment? Sgt. John O'Mara returns home to his wife. When a brothel is raided the operators have to find a new location. [Shooting the scenes at night keeps expenses down.] One policeman visits a loan shark and sees who else is there. Jerry talks to a woman at the bar. \\"Who's running this town?\\" Sgt.

Later the squad will take down a casino in Burbank: destroy the equipment, burn the money, be gone in ten minutes. But the Burbank police protect this casino! Some of the raiders are captured. [Can gambling, vice, and drugs exist without local political tolerance? This is news that is not fit to print.] A man with a Tommy gun opens fire from the street! The prisoners in Burbank are released, just in time. The real money is in betting, says Cohen. The squad practices pistol shooting in the country. Can they plant a microphone in Cohen's house? [Using the telephone exchange avoids risks.] This microphone is planted inside.     An informant is questioned about a shipment. Can it be intercepted? There is a running gun battle on the highway. [No other traffic?] Mickey's men get an early retirement. \\"It worked.\\" There is a penalty for failure. The squad has a barbecue. Chief Parker tells them to accelerate their schedule.

Men is a car machine gun a house. Cohen and his boys talk to Jerry. Sgt. O'Mara seeks revenge.

[Why does the Establishment work this way?] John is a hero, but he lost the war. Grace returns to Jerry, she is his witness. The judge signs an arrest warrant for Mickey Cohen, who is warned. Tommy guns neutralize Cohen's bodyguards. [There is enough shooting for a war movie.] Can Cohen escape? Can O'Mara catch that Packard? Is this the end of Mickey? There is last boxing match. \\"Take him away.\\" There is a final word about the aftermath. \\"The mob never had a foothold in Los Angeles\\"     Is this movie \\"inspired by true facts\\" or another Hollywood drama? When Cohen goes to prison who will fill the vacuum for gambling, vice, drugs, etc.? Was there really no organized crime there? This is really a good story unless you question some of the details.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love dinosaurs so this is the best game ever! I'm constantly playing this and it kills my battery every day. Lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app for older kids. A little too intense for younger kids.  Easy to use and teaches true to life care and training of your horse.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The app is  great and realistic I recommend this app for gun lovers and I always play the app all day that's how much I love it
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Extremely addictive and fun. I really enjoy this game and play it non stop since I downloaded it. Love it
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Sharper graphics, I like how the story is no longer mission select based but instead goes from mission to mission in one continuous loop, and the game play is still as enjoyable as it was in the previous Dungeon Hunter game. While there is a slight push for in-game purchases, You don't need to use them because you can get by with the free in-game items easily.<br /><br />Overall, May not be my type of game but it's still a very solid app overall and I would recommend it.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|There is not a single bad song is this album.  Some are catchy .. you want to sing along all the time, others are deeply emotional.  a perfect companion for the road.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I love all the songs on this album.  I wasn't sure I would like it based on the hit song &#34;Sail&#34; which is ok but not my favorite.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Liked this book from the beginning. You knew what was happening but still had to think about it as you read. I guess it was what I thought N. Korea was like but still wonder if it is as bad as the story portrays.
0812982622|3.0|I, too, bought this book not only because it is a Pulitzer prize winner, but because it received 4 star accolades from Amazon readers.  There isn't a whole lot I can add to the many reviews that have been written, however, I can say I'm on the fence about The Orphan Master's Son.  It started off holding my interest, but the various characters and their stories all cleverly woven yet difficult for me to follow, caused me to put the book down after 270 pages vowing never to return!  Nonetheless - as the cliche goes - the best laid plans!!  I started it again within a few days and finished it which in itself is a personal achievement of perseverance.  While I cannot in all good conscience recommend it, I can honestly say it was very well written.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|I have always loved this game and I love how it really has stayed the same but it is still just as fun.  Everything works great and as I said a really fun game.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|would have been five stars except for the add on the home page, other than that fun and addicting game.
B00AFQC4QC|4.0|Nearly from page one, I found myself drawn into Greta's world and identifying with her across the decades. The realistic portrayal of the characters was a very different take on the WWII backdrop. These were not caricatures of pain, loss and suffering, nor the tragic heroes common to historical fiction of this era. Instead, Christoph Fischer drew us into the lives of normal people trying to live ordinary lives. The fear that drives many of their choices is a subtle undercurrent I found myself swept up in, caught in that moment of history where being Jewish could be a death sentence.<br /><br />The cast of characters is vast, but you aren't forced to meet everyone at once. It starts with Greta and her beloved books, adding in her admirer Wilhelm, then their families, the community and so forth until you have become acquainted with a hodge-podge of characters so odd, you can't help but believe them. I found myself nodding and mumbling, \\"oh yes, I know you.\\" These are real people, not so different from those you already know in your own life.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that there are parts of the narrative where I had to slow down a bit to really absorb the information being presented, but that might just be because I don't read much historical fiction and I was trying to learn about the world around them at the same time I was being entertained.<br /><br />**I was given a copy in exchange for an honest review**
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I am a psychologist, and found the portrayal of recovery from trauma in this book unrealistic.  It was accurate in having Ma more injured and less able to recover than the Jack, but the son's recovery happened WAY too fast.  To me, this was troubling.<br />My other major bone to pick is that I could not tell in what country the story was set.  Relatively late in the book, we learn that it is set in the US, but there are many references prior to that which indicated that it was set in the UK.  For example, Jack talks about how much he enjoys looking at faces from his high perch in buses (double decker, presumably).  The beginner's wheels on Jack's bike are called stabilizers instead of training wheels.  Ma and Jack both go to a top flight treatment center even though they have no money, and there is no concern about it.  (This is very obviously not the US!)  There are many more examples, but you get the idea.  I didn't care where the novel was set, but it's obvious it was set in the UK, and the necessary cultural references were not revised.  That is really sloppy, and one wonders why the publishers even bothered to change the setting to the US, although it must have had to do with profits.<br />These issues don't take away from the author's brutal, but realistic representation of trauma, nor her imaginative treatment of Jack and Ma's situation.  In addition, this was a powerful story of a mother's love for her child.  That said, the book was terribly painful to read, especially in terms of what happened to Jack.  Put that together with my other complaints, and I just can't give this book more than three stars.
B000KI6286|5.0|Thank You For Smoking cuts through the BS of so much pompous grandstanding that you'll find yourself chuckling all the way through this movie. Nick Naylor works as a tobacco lobbyist and has no qualms about defending cigarettes. It's \\"how he pays the mortgage.\\" He's divorced and has a young son. that add counterpoint to his seemingly diabolical lobbying. Then there are the surrounding characters ranging from a Vermont Senator to a tobacco baron to a couple of other lobbyists who represent alcohol companies and gun manufacturers. It's all fodder for skewering assumptions and debunking the national psyche on controversial topics. The plot races along as Nick falls in with a foxy reporter who takes him to bed and the cleaners when she reveals his behind-the-scenes machinations. Nonetheless, Nick Naylor knows how to spin and spins better than anyone else. As absurd as some of the setups are, it is entirely believable when one considers today's headlines. Performances here are among the best, including those by William H. Macy, Robert Duvall, Maria Bello, and more. Everyone, absolutely every member of the cast does a fantastic job delivering this piece, which is a tribute to the director who never preaches but rather holds the facts out for what they are. I've watched this movie three times now, and it only gets better.
B000ICXQU6|5.0|Since I really like Julia I liked the movie. Had a good story. Lets people know just what can be going on your own back yard.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Ok, we have one TV that has the internet connection with a number of apps, another TV with a Roku Box and now we got Chromecast from Google. Very disappointed, limited functionality, screen freezes when using Google Chrome as a browser, not much use for it. Just get yourself a Roku box if you don't have a smart TV (or even when you do).
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Simple to learn and fun to play.  I like how you can upgrade your middle system to make the missiles faster and last longer.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great. No delays in loading a video even on a slow DSL line. Seemless integration with Netflix and YouTube.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great puzzles! Worked together with the family to solve...fun for all of us. Tough enough to make you work for it.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|Imelda May has a powerful voice and is lots of fun.  This album has a number of great songs that I love listening to over and over.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this game is great but for some reason it wont open any more. ive tried to open it several times but all it does is: --when it shows one of the logos it normally does it says &quot;string not found&quot;<br />- then it almost opens<br />- then it closes
B0031R5K68|5.0|Another awesome Dan Brown book. Fast, frantic and excellent!!!! Heart stopping as usual. Dan doesn't let readers down in this one.
B0082FPIY8|5.0|This book was very real. I felt as if I had made the journey with her. Highly recommend it. Enjoy!
B004FOA84A|1.0|No hints. Can't move forward. I have four objects but nothing on how to use them. Having some hints would make the game worth getting.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|Got this because I wanted something to record my lectures in school. Tested and it works GREAT. Better than expected.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it awesome truSt me it's fun I I'm not won of those ppl that tells you buy it win its terrible  just trust me
B000W4RFHK|4.0|My husband recommended this book and there were moments where I thought, hmmm not sure what this is all about, but I always say variety is good.  So on that note,  give it a read!
B000FA5STS|5.0|I read a few bad reviews for this book but read it anyway to see for myself. This is a great story, a fast read, and is well written. I love all of David's books and this one may be my favorite.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting read. Definitely kept you guessing as to where this novel was going to go.<br />I recommend reading it.  It is a good read.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game is not meant for younger kids. It is too complicated for little ones to figure out on their own.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I'm glad they were able to put all of the games out at once. There was so much to the story line that I missed or forgot. Great bundle to have.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|love the UK version; a little more depth and some missing scenes....don't know why they decided to cut it from the US version...I love all the Downton Abbey I can get<br />Best show on TV!
B00BF2UKDE|4.0|A slow, melodramatic death march. Nick Cave is back with his slow, depressing masterpieces.  Lots of gems that get under your skin and fester.  Hauntingly beautiful.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Never wanted to see it and then we got rid of the channel. A friend told me to watch it and I caught like 10 minutes of the newest season premier and I just fell in love with Dexter
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I like the way you can navigate through the site now, but it took about an hour and both my son and me to figure out how to get Overdrive and Adobe reader loaded, passwords set, etc.  Now that I have it on my Kindle and have figured out how to get books I think I will use it when I find an epub book on the library website.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The story and writing was great. I like that at the end it makes you pause, reflect and wonder how your life could've been different depending on the path taken.
B001QWBM62|5.0|The Zoom ZH4N Handy Portable Digital Recorder is a well-built, easy to operate machine which will satisfy most users who wish to make an audio recording 'in the field' where studio recording is not appropriate. It is attractively priced, is built to very high standards and is compact and portable. Strongly reccomended.
6305428050|4.0|I use to watch this movie when I was younger now I am passing it on to my girls, still like it though
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game just like the title says. Easy to pick up and addicting. Good job guys. Keep up the the good work.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminds me of the old Atari days, good graphics, easy gameplay. A hint of nostalgia in every level, back when games were games were about the game, not the graphics
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I read the book when it was first released and from what I remember the movie stuck closely to it.  Due to the movie critics I had low expectations for the movie, but I was was pleasantly surprised to find that I was entertained the whole movie.  If you enjoyed the book, I recommend this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I  have  been  watching  NetFlix  for  years  on  my  DVD  to  flat  panel  set  up  and  movies  on  Amazon  Prime  on  the  iMac<br />I  thought  the  Chromecast  might  be  an  option  when  traveling  but  have  NOT  been  able  to  get  it  to  work  on  my  Samsung  flat  panel .  It  comes  up  with  a  code  and  tries  to process  it  but  always  comes  back  with  an  &#34;ooops  error  message&#34; .<br />Been  too  busy  to  deal  with  it  so  I'm  back  to  streaming  on  the  LG  player .
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS APP ONCE EBAY MOBILE STARTED ACTING UP ON MY KINDLE FIRE, THIS APP IS GREAT WORTH IT
B008CX2A2I|5.0|It gives the Cs-N755 the bluetooth functionality and the system turns on and play music automatically when you play the music form your bluetooth synched device
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|I'D RATHER USE THE CLASSIC SITE TO HARD TO GET TO WHERE I WANT TO GO QUICKLY SO I JUST END UP LEAVING APP.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|really liking this book when i have time to read it... robots, post apocalyptic scenarios, what else could you ask for?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's realistic and very fun. There's a lot of tasks and things to do. You can train the horse. You can compete and earn medals. I recommend it very much.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|If you are fan of Lomography/Toy Camera/Analog photo..etc, You should try Fuji Instax Mini. The size of the photo is just about the business card size and they are so cute. This one prints with colored border instead of normal white frames. I love Instax mini so much!!! Digital photos are beautiful in &#34;High Def&#34; way, but I love the lo-fi analog pictures for their nostargic and artistic mood.
1609611543|4.0|My housekeeper is obese and gorges herself on barrels of buns, doughnuts, bread, pastries, chicken jerky, raw oysters, and pork bellies.  Rather than firing her, I bought this book, thinking that it would motivate her to losing a couple hundred pounds.  I was wrong.<br />She ate the book and said it was delicious!
B000AP04NI|5.0|I am beginning to collect the older musicals and this was one of my first purchases.  It was a good copy of the musical.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I've read all of Nesbo's books that have been translated into  English. I also read other scandinavian authors such as Hakim Nesser, Michael Robotham and Henning Mankell.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|This was a great plot, with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.  Excellent casting for the roles of everyone involved, and it moved along at a nice pace so that you didn't get bored while plot was building.  Definitely recommend it!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The graphics are great and the game play is relatively smooth. I would recommend this game over many other in this genre.
030758836X|5.0|I don't usually go for the suspense novels, but for some reason I was drawn to this book.  I couldn't put it down and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Not my thing, but well put together. It moves quickly enough to keep a person interested, and slowly enough not to cause anxiety.The fish and plants are pretty.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really loved this book.  I found my self wishing he would change his mind after He fell in love; but I uderstand why he didn't  I plan to read more books by Jojo Moyes;
B007L3BMGA|5.0|It was different to what I imagined from all the hype, but  I loved it.  In fact I loved the whole series.  Books 2 & 3 were just as entertaining.  Wish there were more!!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Great visiual I do play bubbles every day and more then one game at a time. great when I head to bed
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|An old favourite, thoroughly enjoyed again.  Love the way he makes you believe the animals' story, and you can feel the COLD of the North.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Breathtaking view if historical context that really puts you in the times of Jesus. Very illuminating exploration that is well worth it
B000W967KQ|5.0|This is a very inspiring book for Trump. You won't learn any great business skills, but you will be full of enthusiasm, ready to rock the world.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This was free at the time, but I would purchase it...It has several Photoshop features..very user friendly! Im not a huge computer person however my photo's are important to me....Im usually unhappy with pics of myself and this program lets me &#34;Fix&#34; imperfections.....blemishes-crow's feet? Ha
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really enjoy playing the game. I have a lot of fun trying to beat my previous score. Great for any ages.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was the first book I've bought on my new kindle- and I couldn't put it down, a bit pricey, but worth it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It does what it is suppose to do....simple as that. Use routinely for cleaning out clutter,  especially for browser history.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|A a.  A.  A.  A.  Get the game bro and the item is strong enough for the kindle is strong enough for the potato salad with this monstrosity the item minus the kindle fire department and the only bones of Olympics slug Lucy the only bones in his nipples and the item over thoroughly.<br />Favorite flag
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|This was my favorite x men movie. I could watch it over and over and over and over and over
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book kept me guessing until the end! Great writing and superb story telling. I highly recommend it! Couldn't put it down.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This was a very good movie, I really liked it a lot. I thought it was very interesting and cute
B00AREIAI8|5.0|loads of fun just to pass time. I have horses and if u feed them that much wow they would love but not good man
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's usefulness is limited. Works fine on supported  apps but if you try to use on just the chrome browser has a lot of lag, blanks and just doesn't even work in any way that is  useful. Also if you don't click stop casting it continues to cast forever using  up available bandwidth. If you just want it for youtube  it works good  . Netflix only soso voice and picture don't seem to be in sync. also can't seem to get it to work on youtube if the feed is live.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|they would  have  had  a lot of trouble trying to follow the book in makeing the movie. The movie with Sabu was a decent adaption, however riki tikki tavie , and  the  elephant tail would have been impossible.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|There is no car effects with crashing effects. When you get wrecked, the car doesent show destruction, it just shows like a perfect car crashing but not getting hurt. I think it's a bug or something because in the trailer, the graphics are great, and there was great effects while here, there is NO effects AT ALL. No partical grinding effects like the other asphalt, no destruction. Please fix this bug.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Really really fun when ur bored. I especially like the &quot;point and click&quot; aspect. All in all, its a great game, memory well given haha
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a really good book with a story that was all too believable.  I couldn't put the book down.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|My antivirus software lookout said to delegate it because it's connected to an unauthorized or recognised groups that hack into or give your information away.
B00CX7TOOG|1.0|I love the two main actors, but this was a real snorer. John Travolta playing a foreigner was terrible. 98% of the movie was Travolta talking, talking, talking and talking. The only action was what you see in the trailer (which is minimum). At the end of the movie when he was on his knees telling de niro to kill him. I can guarantee in the theater the audience was yelling \\"kill him\\" just to shut him up.  I know that is what I was thinking.Not worth seeing and definitely not worth buying- unless you have had problems sleeping- this movie will cure that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app!!!!!! What I really like about this app is that it's free plus I love horse's so it's perfect for me. If you like horse's and like games where you get to take care of something then I really recommend this app for you.
B00095NX9G|5.0|She is an amazing dancer and a fabulous teacher - her teaching DVDs are well worth the investment - she goes over the technique and really breaks it down.
0399226907|5.0|I bought the board book for my 18 month old granddaughter.  She loves it.  We read it over and over.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Less than 5 minutes it was downloaded, installed and printing from my tablet.  No problems and no complex installment procedures.  I did it myself and it worked perfectly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to read the cards, and game has various settings--random, winning hand, multiplayer. Cards go automatically to the spot unless a choice needs to be made. When you have a choice of 2 spots, the game puts the card in the first available spot, which may not be the best spot at the time.
B000GRUMPU|4.0|Though I enjoyed this updated version of The Poseidon Adventure, I think the original still does it for me then.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|My little girls loves it she watches the entire movies at least 3 to 4 times a week an knows just about every scene in the movies!!
B005DJ7U5G|5.0|I enjoyed everything about this movie. It was action packed, suspenseful.  I can hardly wait until November when the movie THOR will be shown in theaters.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|It's nothing but a good time with this soundtrack. This is a must-have if you love the movie. Tons of infamous 80's rock hits. Love it.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|THERE IS NO SONG THAT GEORGE BENSON CAN'T SING AND SOUND LIKE MAGIC.  IF THERE IS SOMETHING STRONGER THAN MAGIC- THAT IS WHAT MR. BENSON IS DOING AS HE SINGS NAT KING COLE. I CAN'T ENOUGH!
0143124544|5.0|Enough has been written about the theme and plot of this novel in other reviews, so I'll just summarize quickly here: Lou is adrift as a 25-year old who has just lost her job waitressing at a local cafe in the small touristy English town in which she lives. She ends up working as a caregiver to Will, left a quadraplegic after a tragic accident. The story revolves around the evolution of their relationship, how this impacts both of them, and their families. As has also been written about, it also takes on the issue of euthanasia directly, as Will is not sure he wants to live as he is. I don't want to give away anymore, so that you can experience the deep and complex emotions of this book. It took me by surprise, and I found myself in tears more than once. I wasn't fully satisfied with the ending, and I didn't like the occasional random chapters written from the perspective of someone else in the book besides Lou. But overall, I felt this was beautifully written and both moving and thought-provoking. What more could you ask for in a novel?
B0012EM5D8|5.0|Once again Jerry Seinfeld demonstrates his genius in knowing what an audience wants to see. Great movie in showing the complex culture of the bee world through animation.
1401307957|5.0|Finished this book in one day and it's inspired me to see more, draw more and live more fully.  Love the fun journaling as well as great drawings.  Love the story this book tells.  Highly recommend.
0307744434|5.0|Literally the most AMAZING book I have ever read. To call it a work of art would be an understatement. READ IT NOW!!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was an exceptional game that I enjoyed immensely! The graphics are fantastic, the story line very interesting and engaging I couldn't put it down  and am looking  forward to the next game! I also loved the other games by this company! Great job, keep it coming!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|When this came out I jumped on it. Glad I did as the price doubled and tripled immediately after I got it. Should have gotten twenty and sold 19!!!!!  Works great- super simple, but as I said it is a little early as they need to line up other streaming support. I am sure that is happening as we speak and this will give the user greater media choices. Either way a pretty amazing product at a great price point.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The characters are very strong. It is always interesting to learn new cultures. The only difficulty was sounding out the names.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I am caught up in the drama and can't wait for the next episode.  Have to catch up before the new season starts
B003IEJZUG|5.0|This book is great! It is very sad too though. I could not stop reading it,wondering what would happen next! Sad though...
B008OE05IG|3.0|I get impatient with the subtitles.  Between watching the action and reading the subtitles, it was a little frustrating.  I never finished watching the whole thing.
B0050R0XEG|3.0|We really enjoyed the process of building this amazing replica, savouring the detail (as many other reviewers have discussed) and the throwback of the finished product.<br /><br />However, Lego could have improved the experience significantly:<br /><br />1) PIECE ORGANIZATION The pieces were organized just as Lego probably used to organize them back in the 60s too - completely haphazardly. For a truly great product, Lego should have organized the pieces in the order in which they are needed. 4 large bags for each quarter of the build process, with smaller bags for each step perhaps. For now, it is essential to separate all the pieces into Tupperware/Ziplocs as some reviewers have suggested. Investing this time upfront saves enormous discovery effort subsequently.<br /><br />2) MANUAL The colour contrast used to describe the pieces in the manual has little relationship to the actual colour of the pieces resulting in several comparisons to the Bill of Materials on the box and at the back of the manual. Lego could much improve the colour printing quality of the manual in relation to the pieces.<br /><br />3) PRODUCT For a set of such quality, there is precious little contextual information on this amazing vehicle. Lego could have included a commemorative booklet on the vehicle to provide some context<br /><br />4) BUILD QUALITY The roof is needlessly gingerly fit onto the body of the vehicle. This may be so that you can easily lift it off to show off the interior, but it still could have been structured better. There are also several areas where great details are simply covered up in the walls wasting pieces, construction time and no doubt design time. These could have been rationalized to simplify the ability to build the product. In a few areas, the end result is choppy (the table does not drop till the chair is nudged backwards a bit, one of the doors has to be pressed down to close/open because it hits the roof, the steering wheel does not actually turn the wheels,etc)<br /><br />All this being said, we're happy with the final product and hope to have it liven up the living room for years to come.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So many thoughts and stories to consider. Green makes you feel as if you are a part of the story.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Always have loved this movie and this HD version is fantastic.  Really love the video streaming ability of Amazon and have recommended to everyone who will listen to subscribe.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This is the studio where all the amazing tracks in the 70s and 80s came from what this is you love music
B005XQLBU4|3.0|The game is not to bad. It can get a little boring at times but it's nice to play something from when I was a kid.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is fun. My only critic is it is definitely not free. In order to get anywhere in the game,you must purchase gold bars. Otherwise, the game takes forever to get anywhere. A good daily ten minute time waster, though.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I love the hidden games.<br />Hidden numbers is just a great way of getting away from having<br />to find objects all of the time.
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|So so so so so so so so so I hate that one of the tasks every few minutes is leaving a rating or visiting facebook
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Target has the DVD version advertised for $24.99 which is around $10 cheaper than they have here on Amazon. I love the show and have the first 2 seasons and will get this season where it is the cheapest. Looking forward to watching season 4.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Clever writing, characters that draw you in, amazing show. It is amazing with the character development, and highly engrossing, plus touching and humorous.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|One of the most practical books for Corporate leaders and mid level management<br />You can easily apply the three ways for your entire org
B00785P2QC|5.0|very addicting love playing passes time I I I like like it it have fun playing playing the game game yup just giveme my points lol. why it working
B004GYY714|3.0|Not as simple as other apps out there. No button to quickly scan to another channel, say when a commercial comes on...
B003O86FMW|4.0|As good as the first. Great read can't wait to<br />Read the next one and see what happens to them.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Love this app....So handy and easy to use.  Good for all....This is silly to make one write more words than necessary
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan has become the top male artist in my list (there never was one) because I solemnly listen to only female artists (Whitney, Celine, Xtina and Charice).  I also feel that Charlotte compliments Jonathan very well but her vocal skills are not up to par with Jonathan's.  At time's I shriek when she hits a certain note or wished she sung it a different way.  Given time I hope she will become more adept at how to pitch note more perfectly.  On that note, Jonathan seriously has no Flaws! pitch perfect on anything that is spoken out.
B00CK6MUSW|4.0|For light reading I did enjoy this book.  I have enjoyed some of her rearlier books more, but that is just  my opinion.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Now, I love Doctor who, and it's characters, but Donna Noble is hands down my favorite companion. Why? She's funny, she's clever, she's nice, and she's the one companion not trying to get in the Doctor's pants. She's there for the adventure, which I can admire against someone just being there because, &#34;David Tennat's Hot...&#34; and trying to start a romance that is doomed to fail in the first place. With that said, this show keeps impressing me and entertaining me more and more. I can't wait for more!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|A very good album.  Rush usually delivers, but this one is a step up from usual.  This CD is the best next thing to being there live!
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|This was a great movie, no wonder it is a classic.  Both my 87 year old mother, and my 40 year old cousin loved the<br />movie.  We had a movie night and it was a great success.
0064471837|5.0|I must admit, I was initially skeptical of this series. My husband found  copy of Sabriel at our local used book store.It had been one of his favorite books as a  teenager. He hasn't steered me wrong yet, so we purchased a copy and I began reading it as soon as we got home. I don't usually expect much from YA fantasy, but this book was incredibly engrossing. I finished it that night,and we went in search of the rest of the seriesth next day. I found Abhorsen and Lirael to be equally well written, if not better. The main characters are strong practical women. They use their intellect to solve problems and keep their cool under pressure. They are excellent role models for teens. The world and lore created by Nix is unique and exciting.I would reccommend this series to readers ages 10 or so and up.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Fun fun fun. Love to play this game. Can't put it down<br />Gonna put it on all my other devices<br />.back to the game lol
B00BI745AA|5.0|Love every second of the movie. All of the sounds and actors were fantastic. The synergy on the cast and music is what helped make this film GREAT!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book that keeps you riveted on the players and the mission.  I highly recommend this book.  The Seals portrayed here are the real heroes!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I was glad that they let me download it to my phone unlike google play. I will be purchasing again.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really like this game and played it again once I finished. Was fun and would recommend to get this app!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Great honest book that even the most casual of runners will enjoy. Runners and non runners can take a message from the authors life. I highly recommend.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really interesting and keeps you wondering what will happen next. And it's not only searching for items so it's great!
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|Love Steve McQueen anyway, but this movie was a departure from his previous screen image.  He totally pulled off the affluent, polished tycoon type.
B001QERPDO|5.0|I saw them in concert and had to have some of their music. So glad I bought this CD.  Excellent.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This game is so much fun. I wish there was a chat room tho so we could contact our neighbors and talk to them if need be.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|I saw them in concert and had to have some of their music. So glad I bought this CD.  Excellent.  They are great in concert as well.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|Simply put, the animators succeeded with the constrained premise (no doubt the work of producers). The delightful charm of My Little Pony carries over into the human world.<br /><br />Sure, the plot has a few glaring holes (I don't recall high school girls being that forgiving), but keep in mind the target audience.<br /><br />The one reason I can't give it four stars is the digital copy. When I purchased it I was under the impression it would be redeemed by some digital store (iTunes, Google Play, etc.). To my disappointment, it is only a digital file downloaded to my computers hard drive not associated with my iTunes account. In today's market the words 'Digital Copy' usually mean so.<br /><br />Can't wait for season 4.
B008J34466|5.0|I bought this CD as a gift for a friend whom say P!nk in concert. Thankfully, this came with AutoRip and I'm able to enjoy the music as well.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I am a big NCIS fan and this book reminded me of that type of action and storyline.  I recommend this book if you like NCIS.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i really enjoy being able to play Solitaire,though I could do without the interruption of ads.  Most annoying.  Otherwise, love it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Just like the the old missile command, but with a new look. Fast pace lots of fun. Great for killing time at work.... kick back and enjoy
B005NFVZTM|5.0|My spouse and I enjoyed watching this movie.  It was fun and entertaining, which was what I was looking for.
