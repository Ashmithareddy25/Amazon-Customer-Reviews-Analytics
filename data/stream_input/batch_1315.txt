B000NTPDSW|5.0|One of my favorite films of all time and the Godfather Collection is a must have for your collection.  The Coppola Restoration is Brilliant !!!!
B002ZG976U|1.0|Ordered this as a Christmas gift.  Unfortunately when my daughter opened it the DVD was broken.  What a pain to have to return it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|a fantastic medium, this is a wonderful app and is easy to use.  I would, and do recommend this to anyone and all.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Fun addictive game. I love to play during my free time. Unlocking new games is a habit that I don't want to break!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This product arrived in the promised condition well in time for the Christmas holidays. Because we are big fans of the entire series (read the books together as a family and saw each movie as soon as it came out), we have not yet used the product, but because of the condition of other items we have purchased on Amazon we are confident in giving this one five stars (and the movie itself was certainly at least five stars!).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is good but ot takes a lot od old time to unlock and dont update. or you'll lose everything
B0029QRA1U|4.0|I received this as a gift and am very impressed with it!  My turntable is 30+ years old and I got tired of replacing the belts.  The software is very easy to use and uploads right into Itunes.  The sound quality is much better than expected as others have stated.  I kind of like the vinyl sound on some of my old well worn records when listening on my ipod.    My only complaints are 1) the USB cable is very short so I had to move my stereo system around to get the turntable near the receiver.  2) You have to 'watch' as you click on the next key to save the songs in itunes; I had to replay an album twice since I somehow deleted the songs.    Otherwise this is a great price (can get even cheaper when on sale) for a great product.
0316056863|3.0|I like Tina Fey from 30 Rock and was curious to see what she had to say. This book is a good light read. I think I enjoyed more the first half when she's was talking about her life growing up as a girl, teen and young adults. I think it would have been more enjoyable (for me) if she spent more time here...the 2nd half of the book was about her life in 30 rock and writting and working there...this half of the book I connected with less and didnt' find as funny...it felt more like something you would enjoy if you were in the industry with her...so this part was fine but it sort of lost my interest and didn't feel as funny...more insider type stuff and not being a tv writer or comedian...i didn't connect.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Wow!  What a great Christmas album.  He definitely took popular Christmas songs and made them into his own.  It is something you can play for the whole family.  I will play it every Christmas, for sure.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is amazing I am always it you must get his app as soon as I got I wouldn't. stop playing it
0553807919|5.0|This book is profound, succinct & extremely practical.  The authors put complicated brain researh into words & pictures & examples that are easy to understand & simple to apply.  It is a MUST read for all parents.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|I wish I just got the regular version as it was less money,as I dont feel this movie was not worth $ 4.99.I really wanted to like this movie but found it boring.It did have some very interesting parts in it, but overall a disappointment.To bad, I usually love these kinds of movies.
B004LWZW9C|2.0|Following the format of intertwining vignettes à la \\"Love Actually\\" and last year's \\"Valentine's Day,\\" Garry Marshall once again has directed a romantic comedy with an ensemble cast of more than a dozen of talented players. Unfortunately, \\"New Year's Eve,\\" ends up plodding through its 118 minutes without giving any of them a chance to do what they can do.   Set in New Year's Eve, New York, the film follows the life of such characters as Claire (Hilary Swank), Vice-President of the Times Square Alliance; a terminally-ill patient Stan (Robert De Niro) who wants to see the ball drop; a hard-working record company secretary Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), who just quit the job; a successful chef Laura (Katherine Heigl) and her ex-boyfriend Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi); and New Year's Eve hating comic book writer Randy (Ashton Kutcher) who is trapped in an elevator with Elise (Lea Michelle), and so on.   I can keep on writing the names: Halle Berry, Jessica Biel, Abigail Breslin, Chris \\"Ludacris\\" Bridges, Josh Duhamel, Zac Efron, Cary Elwes, Hector Elizondo, Seth Meyers, Alyssa Milano, Sarah Jessica Parker, Til Schweiger and Sofía Vergara, as well as cameos from Matthew Broderick, Common, Carla Gugino, John Lithgow, Larry Miller ... should I continue?   Too many characters clutter up the screen and none of them is fleshed out enough. Their stories, not very interesting themselves, are linked to one another in a convoluted way. In \\"New Year's Eve\\" there are so many romances going on, but for me the number does not really matter. All I wanted was just a few moving stories, or just one. Perhaps Zac Efron and Michelle Pfeiffer's story has potential for that.
1609419693|5.0|My wife and I have loved every bit of this book/audiobook. Its much more entertaining to listen to the audio book since Tina Fey is the reader. Don't expect any real deep insight into her personal life.  It's just a very funny collection of essays about her life and experiences in chronological order (sort of). Don't take it too seriously, just enjoy it.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|A 2011 animation \\"Rio\\" has everything that would make a great film. Well, almost. It has great visuals. It has nice music and musical scenes. It has great voice acting. There are also some decent action sequences (though not many in number). What it doesn't have is a compelling narrative that would make us relate to the central characters, two blue macaws Blue and Jewel.   Timid and bookish Blu (voice by Jesse Eisenberg) and feisty Jewel (Anne Hathaway) are the last of their kind. And having been raised in Minnesota by a bookstore owner Linda, Blue cannot fly. The film's weak opening gets better when Blu and Jewel are stolen from an ornithological institute in Rio by smugglers.   Most of the story based on a comedic fish-out-of-water situation takes place in Rio de Janeiro. This is a wise decision as the city provides the animated film (directed by Carlos Saldanha, co-director of \\"Ice Age\\" with Chris Wedge; director of its two sequels) with opportunities to show the beautifully rendered visuals full of bright colors.   But the film needs better storytelling. The script (with four credited screen writers) is not really great, just acceptable. The most disappointing thing about \\"Rio\\" is that neither the story nor the characters is given a chance to be really involving. It seems the filmmakers are not willing to take any chance, as seen in the half-hearted character development of human characters, especially Linda. Someone like Brad Bird would have given her a chance to shine. Some ideas (Blu's dancing skills, for instance) look as if forgotten or abandoned in the middle of the story.  I enjoyed myself watching \\"Rio\\" and its visuals, knowing that the film could have been much better with a more compelling storyline.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this thing is completely worthless...I showed me 3 year old and she was bored.  It was like I had asked her to watch paint dry.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This program does tts brilliantly, exactly what I was looking for. I have combined it with IVONA TEXT TO SPEACH natural voices and I can barely tell its not a person reading my pdfs.  Am looking for a help file to learn how to have it skip special characters during reading, is probably easy I just haven't figured it out yet. Well worth the cost for use with my lg optimus c android phone.
B005JLN9Z8|4.0|Truly an awesome band.  Don't know how they come up with riffs pulled from thirty years ago when bands from that era seem to have forgotten how to do it.  Album itself is solid though nowhere near as good as \\"Feel the Steel\\".  If you bought 'Balls first and don't have 'Steel, do yourself a favor, do a line, buy 'Steel, then do two more lines.  There's plenty of good tracks on here, but without \\"Tomorrow Night\\", which in my opinion is their best tune so far, it would've been filled with a lot of above-average album filler.  Not really a bad song on the album, but few that really jump at you as was the case with their previous effort.  Still, all in all, a really good buy.  Hilarious and hard rocking.  Also, if you've never seen them live (twice for me), do a third line and scoop up a pair of tickets.  One for yourself, and one for the cabbie that's gotta drive you home.  Chicks optional if they're cool.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Stunning graphics, well thought out game play, absolutely the best Mahjong game yet.  No problems on the samsung captivate glide.  I will continue to buy any other Mahjong games you create if you keep cranking out such greatness!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the amount of games. the one thing that I don't like is the amount of ads. The games are easy to play .
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome l love this game it is so fun after you play 1 game you will want to play another
0439023521|5.0|This was an original book to me. I was hooked from the beginning and couldn't put the book down, thus leading me to quickly move to the next book in the trilogy and I am now about to begin the third and final book. The plot kept me guessing, never knowing which direction it would turn. Further increasing my intrest was my cheering for the main characters in the book. I found myself gasping out loud at times as surprises jumped up frequently. I often can find \\"holes\\" in plots or get discouraged by authors writing subject matter that can be too unrealistic or impossible, but this storyline seemed very real, and I was swept into Catniss' world easily.
B004G6009K|5.0|My wife loves this movie so I got it for her for Christmas, she said the 3D was amazing. She's already watched it twice, and has been begging me to no end to watch it with her haha.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book will capture your imagination and your heart right from the first page. It's a wonderful story of two individuals, who have experienced unhappiness and loneliness throughout their lives and find a renewed hope in each other. A lovely read that paints a vivid picture of life in rural Ireland.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I love this game and have played it a lot on the iPad (the reason I give it 2 stars), but as of 1/13/12, it doesn't work on the galaxy nexus and I've heard that it doesn't work for ICS in general. As a paid app,  incompatibility is unacceptable.
0525478817|5.0|\\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" maybe John Green's best book yet. He fill the pages with poignant characters and creates a gripping plot with as many laughs as tears. The protagonist Hazel is so well fleshed out that I sometimes wonder if he actually shadowed a teenage girl to get it so right. His other characters like Augustus and Isaac are a revelation. Green is at his best when he is painting the picture. He punctuates it with humour and wit, doing it with an ease that is breathtaking. The plot takes you to emotional highs and lows and makes you feel emotion like only the great books can.   The book does however has its shortcoming (but not enough to knock of any stars off this review). Dialogue. While it is not apparent in this book as much as in his others, There are moments in the book that make me say \\"Huh?\\". For example, all the teenage boys and girls I have been around, no matter how smart, cannot perhaps even conceive the brand of wit and philosophical thought Hazel and Augustus can. It seems almost incredulous to me that a a 16 year old and a 17 year old discuss metaphors and existentialism with such abandon and so often in their life. My friends could barely get past their Facebook page/social life.  That being said, I do think it is perhaps his best book and people should read a book that makes even a cynic believe there might bee something called true love.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|My Week With Marilyn is the Best Movie of the Year. Not a flaw in it!  Michelle Williams acting is brillant and flawless.  Excellent screenplay.  I recommend this movie!  Don't miss it!  See it at the movies and buy the DVD when it comes out.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|Instinctively, I keep reaching for and playing this regularly.  While it is true that her vocals do sound incredibly processed, Femme Fatale is one video you might want to consider if you like shows by Cher, kylie, Madonna and Lady Gaga.  Femme Fatale employs the concert spectacular formula - stage, costumes and sets designed to blow you away along with a big cast of dancers and acrobats. In this case , the only absentees are the band, making the music seem all pre-recorded. Nevertheless, it's still a fantastic mix from start till finish.  While her Las Vegas DVD showcased Britney's hits up to her third album, Femme Fatale featured songs mostly from her new CD of the same name, with some from Blackout and Circus. Old gems are not forgotten. Toxic gets accelerated and Boys received an Egyptian opening.   What really got me going was Hold It Against Me, Till The World Ends and I Wanna Go - the last number had me putting my hands in the air and going Oh! Oh! Oh!...  Generally, singers who dance vigorously will be also breathing heavily. Somehow, I don't see or hear that here. Well, I'll give Britney the benefit of a doubt as I would have been on my feet all night had I attended the real thing!
B0059XTUVI|1.0|The Iron Lady is the worst picture of the year! The writer, director, and Meryl Streep used their far left political views to dismiss Margret Thatcher's greatness down to an old lady who is loosing her mind to dementia. Using flash back story telling to show her rise to becoming Prime Minister of England, the story line leans left and does not give Margret Thatcher her due as a great conservative leader.  I walked away from this movie disappointed.  My recommendation is don't buy this movie.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am a recently-converted Star Wars fan. For anyone who hasn't seen the Star Wars movies, I suggest watching them as soon as possible. They're that good.<br /><br />And this box set is exactly what an epic saga like Star Wars deserves. The packaging is beautiful. You can tell a lot of work went into the drawings on each page of the book and the collage of characters on the last page. But the packaging is just the beginning.<br /><br />I saw Star Wars on DVD the first time, and it was amazing. But I wanted to see what the movies looked like in HD. So I decided to buy the set on Blu-ray for myself. In a word, the movies look fabulous. Even the original trilogy looks pristine in 1080p. Star Wars has never looked better.<br /><br />Not to mention all the bonus features. The collection of spoofs on the last disc is absolutely hilarious, and there are enough deleted scenes, documentaries, and other goodies on the three bonus discs to last any fan a long time. Each movie also comes with two commentary tracks for more Star Wars fun.<br /><br />Yes, there are some changes in this release that some fans may find disappointing, but this release is too wonderful for any Star Wars fan to pass up. The beautiful packaging, awesome picture/sound quality, and bonus features make this set truly epic, and they make this set the new standard for other home releases to compare themselves to.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I first downloaded the free version, but quickly tired of the ads connected with it.  We enjoyed the game and so purchased it for my K Fire.  My grands 2 & 4 enjoy the game as much as the adults!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|To be perfectly honest, most of the books on my Kindle Fire are of the free variety. This book was recommended to me and theunusual title prompted me to download the sample which in turn made me want to read more. I am notoriously cheap so my first instinct was to not spend this much money on a book that I cant even put on my overstuffed bookshelf. I loved this book so much that not only do I not regret the money spent on the ebook, I am going to buy a hard copy as well. I recommend it for all ages. My 11 year old Harry Potter/Twilight fanatic is reading it now and she loves it. The unusual  photographs are incredible and the story itself is engaging and well written. I am left hoping for the author to uncover more photos and make this book the first in a series!
0525478817|5.0|This book made me feel so much. I felt like the Hazel and Augustus, Hazel's parents, Issac, and even Patrick from the support group were real people. That they had lives being lived out, and thought about. I felt so much for them by the end that I couldn't stop reading.  This book has taught me so much about, not only myself, but about life too.   I'd recommend it to anyone.
B005D0TETA|5.0|Beeing an old time fan, I always wanted to have a decent YES show in my collection. This bluray did the trick. It´s a great show, with excellent set list, mixing, mastering and video. The only set back are those animations that are sometimes a hassle. But they only stay for a couple of minutes, so it´s bearable.  If you are a YES fan or simply curious about this great band, this is a must have.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome game! it is so much fun I really like it! I just gitbjt.likeva week ago and its awesome!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|blah blah blah its a kinda fun game. its Kool to hav games like these in the car lol :)
B004U52VPS|4.0|We bought this for our five year old grandson for Christmas.  He was thrilled when he unwrapped it as he had played with his nine year old cousin's game and loved it.  All of us were down on the floor at one point or another during the time we had together over the holidays.  Then the two year old grandson got in on it and kept wanting to play Angry Birds.  The pieces are lightweight and seem to be very durable.  Some of the game cards depict arrangements that are impossible as the game does not come with enough long segments to create them.  The most fun with young children is letting them be creative and build their own ideas to knock over.  Keeping score for us was not necessary as we had enough fun just creating new set ups and knocking them down!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is an awesome, very playful game to play whenever we are bored.Especially when we have nothing to do.Very cool game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so fun it is easy to get new games and none of them are impossibly hard I love it
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Fun and easy to play. Makes you think and plan ahead. Reminds me of sophmore year programming assignments. 19 20

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was a great movie. Some language that yunger children might not should hear. This is a keeper! I definitely recommend it!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this is a great game. I get really frustrated but when I complete the level why I got upset just seems ridiculous. I like this app very much. I hope there will be plenty more levels and angry birds. :)
B002UZXJA6|4.0|Fast shipping good music my husband enjoyed it when I gave it to him for Christmas.<br />It's cheaper on amazon than it was on television. I got him a cd last year too. I think this is ridiculous to have to type at least 20 words.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I wish this app would install but otherwise it is great. I have this game on my ipod. I just wish it would download on my poor kindle.:(
B000BTJDGC|5.0|Hi  Sorry it took so long to reply, been so busy around here. I loved the movie, even though I had to sleep with the lights on for a couple of nights. I like a good scary movie once in a while. It only took a couple of days to get the DVD after I ordered it, so that was good. The DVD was in excellent shape so I don't have anything negative to report. Thanks!  Michele Gabbard
0525478817|5.0|This book manages to be important and expansive and heart-shatteringly good, but also delightfully ordinary. It's a small story, about one girl and the people in her life and the sickness life has handed to her, but it's also so much more. This is both John Green at his best, and a new and more robust John Green we have not yet met. I hope this book means as much to you as it does to me.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|just completely shuts down without warning  on my kindle fire.....very frustrating ...but it could be the fire which itself is unreliable , I am not finding much that runs well on it....
B004XANKVO|3.0|I wore this all across Bali and overall it's a fantastic bag. Really great way to transport your MacBook Pro and a fair amount of clothing, and so on. There are two major flaws however:<br />a) the chest strap is a piece of junk. Although the shoulder straps rock, the chest strap is a flimsy little thing that can break easily - and did break on mine, ripping the fabric. I'm sending it in for a replacement, however, I feel confident that the same problem could easily happen again. It's a design flaw. In the next generation, Thule needs to add a powerful, bulky, sturdy chest strap. This is only an issue when the bag is fully loaded with weight, but that was almost always the case with me!<br />b) no hip straps. This is a serious day-pack bag and if it had sturdy hip straps it could be a great hiking bag. But as is, there's too much weight on your shoulders (and on a chest strap that can't hold the weight).<br /><br />So, if Thule get smart and adds badass, sturdy chest and hip straps to the next edition, this will be a five star bag!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Although I had a bit of trouble getting into this book, once I was past the first maybe 30 pages I was hooked.  It is a phenomenal story of love and magic, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something that is well written and engaging. If you liked Shadow of the Wind or The Thirteenth Tale on anything by Alice Hoffman, you will love this book.
0439023521|5.0|I've heard so many great reviews about \\"Hunger Games\\" that I couldn't wait to read it. I checked with Amazon and found the book being sold by Mundo de Ofertas. I expected it in 7-10 days. I got it in 2 days and the book looked like new.  I recommend them highly. Their service was excellent and I would give them 100%. These days getting good customer service is rare. Mundo de Ofertas really delivered the goods. Bravo.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Tricky at times but in a way that only increases the fun. I really like that you have to unlock games by earning points.
B0062KJ1Q6|4.0|I watched this on amazon instant video and liked it. I would never pay $20 or however much it cost to own it (to be fair, I very rarely buy any movies so this is not a harsh criticism), but it was definitely worth paying a couple bucks for as a rental.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Great movie about society in the late 50's early 60's in the south. Read the book a while ago and enjoyed that as well.  There are several portions of the story that the movie omits or skims over, but all in all it is a powerful movie.  It addresses  race issues, and sheds light on how limited the choices were for women as well as the punishment for straying from the accepted norm of the day.  Loved the courage and characters of Skeeter, Minnie, and Abalene.  I believ this will become a classic!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very drifting i love it i play it all the time if i beg bored in the car or even at home i will.play it.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is probably one of the best I've discovered...Both local and int'l radio stations I've wanted to access and new ones already found....thank u TuneIn Radio...
B006GG1KOC|5.0|it was so awesome I love it with all my lo.ve heart and it rules. I wish I could play it all day long
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Reminiscent of what's happening now in the 99%/1% world. Beautiful human epic, reflective of values of the past. Poignant with raw emotion. The stuff role models are created from.
B005CMSDLE|1.0|A waste of money and by no means comes close to the excellent action movie \\"Columbiana!\\" There is NO comparison. I read other reviews which enticed me to order  both DVDs which was a huge mistake!  In fact, I couldn't even finish watching it! I  found it to be boring and a waste of film!
0525478817|5.0|I, like Augustus Waters, take pleasure in looking at beautiful people.  I also, like Hazel Grace Lancaster, take pleasure in reading well-written books.  This extraordinary 313 page novel would fit both of their interests and more.  I sobbed uncontrollably , I laughed, I lost myself completely to the book.  It's such an amazing piece, so amazing that it deserves a 3:19AM review from a more than satisfied, tired, and devoted fan.  This Novel and John Green certainly didn't FTBA.
0321356683|5.0|This is easily one of the most valuable books in my library. It is a book for intermediate to advanced Java programmers so I would not recommend it to someone starting out with Java. The content is rich and deep, and it's obvious that Joshua Bloch is a complete Guru of Java. Many of the items in the books are things that you wouldn't ordinarily consider, but guide you away from some very nasty, hard-to-find bugs that many Java developers create.   Consider the price of this book as a trivial investment in a deeper, stronger knowledge of Java that will pay back many times in making you a better developer.   I would also recommend this book as the basis for good interview questions when interviewing candidates for Java developer roles. Knowing this book well is great way to separate out good Java developers from the rest.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of fun, love all the different games! the whole family likes to take turns trying to beat the games. works great on my kindle fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was a pretty good app i like it because yanno its cool bit i need alo t of words so Rsi to r34d this yoou prologue can
0061122416|5.0|My son needed this book for school.  The shipment of the book was very fast.  The price was reasonable.  Good experience.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|blues is about feeling. every song here is loaded with it. hooks galore, incredible lyrics.  while he didn't have the voice of howlin' wolf or john lee hooker, his growl is pure blues.  to anybody who likes the blues or would like check out the blues, this is a must.  every song on this disc is a classic and nobody wrote better chicago blues songs then willie. a master in all respects. anybody from a blues novice to a collector should own this disc. consider the rock legends that covered these tunes ( led zepplin, the doors, the rolling stones, jeff beck ) and all the blues legends that got famous covering his songs. there's a very solid backing band, it's damn near impossible not to enjoy every song. when you have an album that starts with the amazing \\"back door man\\" and ends with the incredible \\"the same thing\\" you have an album that backs up the boast \\"I Am the Blues\\".
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is incredibly useful if you have multiple devices.  you can find your favorite content from anywhere.  I use it on my phone, tablet and multiple computers.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think the game is ok except that its gonna take forever to unlock every single game that id on it unpleasant u do the free points
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Amazing film, the best footage I've seen. Red Bull is an amazing sponsor to the world of extreme sports and I have yet to see a film they are connected with that isn't worth buying. For documentary lovers of extreme sports, this is like the Dust to Glory of snowboarding. Watch it.
B002I0J5FG|3.0|Quite simply put, the controls are awful.  When you take bad controls, a horrible camera, and put them together, you get a barely playable gaming experience.  I sincerely hope that whoever designed the control scheme for this game never finds another job again.  By the time Shadow of the Colossus came out, there were enough 3D games released that had perfectly intuitive controls. There's no excuse for the controls to be this archaic.   The horse is one of the best examples, left and right to turn the horse left and right and x to move forward?  Seriously?  It's almost like how the original Resident Evil was only scary because you'd be forced to watch your idiot character slowly turn around standing in place when zombies were diving in.  Really, it's just very sad.  The colossus fights are all very well designed, the music is absolutely epic, and just the entire scene is artistic and stunning.  I feel like if you go into Shadow of the Colossus looking for an experience, you'll love it, but if you go in looking for a fun game, prepare to walk away disappointed.  Each colossus takes a little thinking to figure out, and that's fine because the discovery process is fun.  But once I figure out how to defeat it, the execution itself shouldn't be so difficult!  Okay great, I now get that I have to stab him here, climb up there, jump to the ledge there, etc. etc.  Oh wait, I missed it because I jumped off randomly instead of onto the ledge.  Oh wait, I was jamming on the buttons and my character just clung on for dear life even though the colossus wasn't even moving.  These little things are incessant and it drives you mad.    The button response is just awful.  Sometimes it makes sense because the idea is that the colossi is constantly attempting to shake you off, but there are way too many times where it isn't even moving and I have to jam on jump eighty thousand times before he actually jumps.  This wouldn't be nearly so annoying except that you have a limited amount of grip, and if you fall off you usually have to start your journey all over again.  Most of the suspense of the game boils down to whether or not your character will actually listen to what you tell him to do.    Ultimately, I gave up after killing the fifth boss.  I realized that I wasn't enjoying the game at all, the only reason I was playing was because I felt like giving up would be \\"quitting.\\"  And you know what, it's really a damn shame, because if the controls and the camera were even \\"decent,\\" this really would have been a good game.  Obviously, I'm in the minority but I'm really a stickler for great controls.  I love hard games, one of my most glorious gaming experiences was finally beating Ghouls n Ghosts for the original NES, but I don't like it when games are hard simply because I can't control the damn character!  I literally think SotC would be ten times better if all the colossi had twenty times more life, and decent controls.    Anyways, if you're a real stickler for crisp, intuitive controls, I really cannot recommend that you buy this game.  It will absolutely drive you insane.  I'm one of the those games who just has to beat every game he buys, but the controls in this game irritated me so much that I couldn't even beat the game.  Let me put that into perspective for you.  This is a game that most gaming magazines gave a 9.0+ to, and is probably one of the highest rated games on Amazon in terms of customer reviews, and I got to the point where I literally couldn't stand it simply because of the controls.  I literally have no, that's right, ZERO gripes about anything else in the entire game I had experienced thus far.  That's how much I hate the controls in this game, that's why I had to essentially write a multi-paragraph rant about it, games that have controls like SotC should literally be legally forced to have a warning sticker on it so I can avoid them all like the plague.  I realize this has been a very long review, so I'll sum it up here.  Graphics:  10 (Give it a break it's an upscaled PS2 game)  Sound: 10 (Incredible soundtrack)  Story: 7 (It's okay, you can't really dock them for it because I feel like that was intentional)  Design: 10 (The bosses look amazing, the ways to defeat the bosses are creative and a joy to figure out, just excellent design overall)  Controls: -20 (THE CONTROLS WILL MAKE YOU BREAK YOUR TV)  Overall: 3.4  (Yup, I hate the controls.)

B004Q7CIFI|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Mr. King's work; a can't-put-it-down, put-life-on-hold sort of fan who likes nothing better than a big ol' King book to pick up at the end of a long day. If I'd bought the print edition, I would've skimmed through the middle of the book and enjoyed that which was interesting (the beginning and the end) a whole lot more without the five years of tedious meandering through time and Texas that must take up hundreds of pages. If I'd gotten it from the library, I would've given up and taken it back.  On Kindle, however, I just clicked through page by page determined to get my money's worth and wondering throughout just what was his point.<br /><br />Was the ending worth the work?  All I can say is Mr. King finally delivers his celebrated, never-to-be-rivaled, bizarre twist on reality.  An interesting bonus autobiographical look (at least that's what I think it was) into his recovery from his terrible auto-ped accident. What a lot of disappointing drivel in between.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I just bought the kindle keyboard and have been looking at reviews of all different kinds of cases and sleeves for weeks. I really fell in love with this case even though it says for the kindle fire a few of the reviews said it fit the keyboard version so I decided to go for it. I had a hard time deciding which color to get I really like the green one but I ended up going with the brown one, I love the old lord of the rings mystic feel it has. I just received it yesterday I put my kindle in it right away and it fits Perfectly! Closes all the way and the straps are a snug fit, also none of the keys are covered. I also feel it is more comfortable to hold while reading when its in the cover.  I can tell its not leather when I touch it, but its still a high quality material and still feels nice to the touch. It looks like leather and the inlayed designs are beautiful!  All in All very nice case and I am very happy with it and excited to finally have something to protect my kindle that wont short it out or anything.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I do feel the $50 is a bit steep being that its not leather. But I would but it again.

B000CNDJGC|5.0|The CD arrived exactly when Amazon said it would. Loved hearing Izzy & even Axl's early sound. However, I'm very disappointed that Vicky Hamilton- the boys 1st manager & supposed former friend couldn't be bothered to spell Izzy's birth name correctly in her intro. It's ISBELL, not Isabelle.  Nitpicking, I know, but for anyone who has read my other reviews will guess I've always been more of an Izzy fan than a Guns fan. It just bothers me that he was the co-founder & main songwriter of this formerly great band, yet so called friends can't be bothered to spell his name correctly. I also don't understand about the \\"Gilby remixes.\\" I can't tell if Gilby has replaced Izzy's guitar w/ his own or if he just remixed the songs. I admit that it's hard for me to pick out individual instruments in a band. If Gilby did replace Izzy's guitar w/ his own, then I truly don't understand why. No disrespect to Gilby, but he had nothing to do w/ Hollywood Rose, thereby he wasn't part of the \\"roots\\" of the band. He was considered nothing more than a hired hand during his brief time w/ guns & was fired a year or 2 later. I guess with all of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame hoopla surrounding Guns, I'm a little touchy about the classic line up who performed on the qualifying albums.

1451648537|5.0|I didn't want to read this book. I know the ending. It took me a month to get through it. This is not because it's a bad book. On the contrary - it's outstanding. Isaacson has prepared an insightful, detailed, and well balanced portrait of Jobs. His venomous personality (at times) stands in great contrast to his brilliance. One very profound example of Job's nasty streak is on page 103. A colleague urges Jobs to offer pre-IPO options to one of the longest standing Apple employees. The colleague offers to personally match whatever Jobs does. Jobs' response: \\"Okay. I will give him zero.\\"  There is nothing here to define Jobs as a \\"nice guy\\".  Jobs was also a true artist who combined design aesthetic with technology. That list includes Mac, iMac, ipod, itunes, iphone, ipad - each a truly revolutionary product in its own right. I set out to see how influential these were to me and my family. Digging though online purchase receipts (via Quicken on my iMac), I was astonished to discover that in over 20 years, we have purchased over 100 Mac devices. If that's not influence, I am at a loss to define what is.  Issacson's narrative is a journey - emotional, poignant, disturbing, and, in the end a convincing depection of a man whose legacy is destined to help define our time.
B0068AWQQ2|4.0|It was good! It left me grinning... This particular writer is very good at setting a fast pace. I've never found vampires very scary (who has, really) and I saw the \\"scary\\" claws, and thought it was probably a good \\"campy\\" movie. And it was-the way you'd expect Fright Night to be-but I was honestly impressed at the tension the movie created. It was fun.

B006GHA9QQ|1.0|--------------------------------------UPDATED REVIEW BASED ON DVD PRODUCTION AS SHOWN ON PBS------------------------------<br />As promised, I am now reviewing the actual production filmed.  What I find interesting is that it was on TV 2 and a half weeks after the video release!!  This confirms my initial thoughts that most people are rejecting it.  But I am reviewing it as a second look of the show and a first look of a new production.<br /><br />As with most ALW shows, the production is more sumptuous than the score.  Beautiful sets and costumes and TV direction but at the heart is a bad libretto and score (as with most ALW shows, there are great songs but the overall score is mediocre.<br /><br />Early on Meg and Madame Giry sing that the night that mob came for the Phantom, they found the Phantom and smuggled him to Calais then to the US.<br /><br />Next when Christine first sees the Phantom. the sing Beneath the Moonless Sky and sing about the night that they met.  Now, some think that it is a time after the initial show but I feel it refers to the time that they went to his lair in the original show (moonless sky -- sewers of Paris) makes sense.<br /><br />Taking this into consideration with the song about his escape, then the only time for the \\"conception\\" would be that one night where she went to his lair.  And most people agree that nothing happened there!<br /><br />So as I originally stated, having the boy Gustav (great French name?) being the Phntom is still a stretch beyond reason.  And this is why I stand by my one star review.<br /><br />Another issue is Raoul.  Phantom begins with the auction where an old infirmed Raoul buys the music box.  It is obvious that he well off with a man servant.  But at the beginning of LND, it is stated that that Raoul has gambled away his fortune.  And later on, it is stated that he is a drunk.  Another rewrite of the original.<br /><br />If ALW was not involved in the show, then I would be more forgiving but he statedin the program that he was incharge of every aspect of the show especially the book of the show.<br /><br />As I have over and over stated that the issue is not the staging but the story.  The best example I have of the staging being the issue is the show that premired at the same time as Phantom, Into the Woods.<br /><br />I saw the first national company of the show.  At intermission everyone was saying it was the best show they ever saw.  At the end of the show, we were all dazed on how the second act totally sunk the show.  It was so dark (in tone and texture)that it totally ruined the show. Six months later, I was in London and saw their production.  They took out the darkness and made it more of a farce.  This worked well and kept the tone very even throughout the show.  It now worked but was a bit hollow.  A few years later, I saw a production by Glen Casale in Long Beach and he combined the best of both verions and added a few improvements of his own and turned the show into the great show it is.<br /><br />What I am trying to say is that the problem with ITW was the direction not the book or score.  The problem with LND is the book and score and while a great director can camaflage the flaws, they cannot remove them, especially when they are as glaring as those in this show.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW based on London Production------------------------------------<br />I saw the show in London just before it closed.  And I can say that the subtitle should be \\"but thank God the show did!\\"<br /><br />Be warned that to tell you why this show is so bad, I will have to reveal some plot secrets.<br /><br />The Phantom has escaped Paris and is now in turn of the century Coney Island where he can blend with the other side show freaks.  He has built a vaudville palace and has lured Christine Daae to perform there.  Christine married Raoul who has become a drunk.  They have a son.  Madame Giry and her daughter Meg have followed.<br /><br />Meg has become the Phantom's ingenue but he still desires Christine.  When Christine is lured to Coney Island, Meg realizes that her chance at being the main attraction is slipping away.  This sets up a series of events that will end in tragedy.<br /><br />Now for the spoiler, which I guessed about 20 minutes into the show. Chistine's son is not Raoul's but the Phantom's!  Now could someone tell me where in PotO did Christine and the Phantom ever make love or just have sex.  This is just ridiculous.<br /><br />What's even more disappointing than the banal book is the contrived score.  Even at ALW's worst his shows usually have at least one or two show stoppers.  This score is more of a show snorer!<br /><br />If you are a Phantom lover, protect your memory of that show and pass this one up. Or wait until it is shown on your local PBS station (probably in the next year) as Cats, Joseph and JC videos were.<br /><br />UPDATE - Los Angeles times Saturday, February 25, 2012.<br /><br />'Love Never Dies'lives<br /><br />Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom sequel, rejiggered after chilly run in London, heads to cinemas<br />By David Ng<br /><br />Let the Andrew Lloyd Webber offensive begin.<br /><br />The famed British composer a Phantom of the Opera seems to be everywhere this season with the revivals of Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita opening soon on Broadway and Phantom sequel 'Love Never Dies' hitting cinemas around the world next week.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that the celebrated composer - who has multiple Tony awards - was nearly down for the count last year when the critics and audiences delivered a knockout punch to his Love Never Dies during its London run. The highly anticipated sequel received mixed to negative reviews and closed earlier than expected in August.<br /><br />Lloyd Weber said in a recent phone interview from New York that the London staging \\"didn't work\\" and the recent Australian version that opened in Melbourne \\"worked triumphantly,\\" though he acknowledges that \\"my involvement in Australia was that of an observer.\\"<br /><br />\\"There's not a lot in terms of rewriting - no new music was written for Australia, but one or two things have been rethought,\\" Lloyd Webber said. \\"Very small things can make a difference. One of the things I've learned in my career is that the fine line between something being huge or not is very small.\\"<br /><br />The Austrailian production will hit cinemas in the US starting Tuesday. It will be the first time that the US audiences will have a chance to see the musical Lloyd Webber said he isn't concerned that this screenings could you rode the chances of a Broadway transfer.<br />The musical will screen in about 600 venues in North America and more in Latin America, according to Omniverse Vision, the distributor.<br />Lloyd Webber was in New York to drum up interest or support for love never dies he said a Broadway transfer of the SDRAM production would be expensive but he remains optimistic.
1598878735|5.0|The Talent Code is a great book with many great ideas and explainations for how we learn.  A friend of mine teaches professional motocross and it is clear to me now, how he has done so well. - He is using the principles of the Talent Code.  Having the book on CD and someone reading it is a huge plus.  I just put the discs into my cd player in my truck and my first long trip to Vegas and back, wham!  I was in the know.

0811870413|5.0|I bought 6 different books recently on Artisan Bread and so far this one is one of my favorites. The recipe for country bread works great and tastes spectacular. If you don't own a scale or a thermometer and dont see the need in using these instruments in baking you probably should skip this book. I followed the recipes to the letter of the law with measuring water temp, dough temp along with weighing all ingredients and every recipe turned out as pictured in the book. Some of the other books on Artisan bread I have tried the recipes and they did not come out even after making them on several attempts which leads me to believe they were not kitchen tested. The guys at Tartine tested their recipes with a test group by giving the group the instructions in the book and measured their success  before they published the book which is included in the first chapter. Love the book, Love the recipes!!

B000M341QE|5.0|As a big Scorcese fan, and after reading some of the reviews, and after considering the content of these reviews, someone who has not seen this movie (and I can't believe there are many of those) should consider the following: Is this Scorcese's best movie? Probably not. Did it deserve Best Picture? Probably not. Is this Nicholson's best performance No. Is it De Caprio's best performance? Maybe. Does the movie depict some semblance of reality of what it is like being undercover? I would say so. If you haven't been there you have no idea what is like.<br /><br />The movie commands a great script and the direction is right on. The Departed deserves to be viewed and deserves the Academy Award to someone who was robbed of it several times over.

B005V1WZ10|5.0|I'm so glad that Korn is back. I already grew sick and tired of all the trash that's been played on the radio (I'm not listening to the radio ever again). Korn's tenth studio album is an experimental project that seems to be a triumph. They mix their traditional rock sound with dubstep, and while I have never heard of this so-called Dubstep before, it sounds just right for this album. I admire the band's experiment with new sounds and melodies. This is such a different Korn album, and yet it's really superb. The songs are unbelievably enjoyable, though the entire album is fairly short (it's barely forty minutes long, but the Special Edition CD does add two more songs). People might feel uncomfortable with Korn's progression, but true fans will always acknowledge that every rock band always does something different. In this case, Korn succeeds with their dubstep environment. Kudos to Jonathan Davis, Munky, Fieldy, Skrillex, and everyone else who participated in Path of Totality.<br /><br />Grade: 9.5 out of 10<br /><br />Also from Korn<br />Self-titled debut (9.6 out of 10)<br />Life is Peachy (7.2 out of 10)<br />Follow the Leader (9.8 out of 10)<br />Issues (9.7 out of 10)<br />Untouchables (9.1 out of 10)<br />Take a Look in the Mirror (7.9 out of 10)<br />See you on the Other Side (7.6 out of 10)<br />Self-Titled, 2007 (7 out of 10)<br />Remember Who You Are (9.4 out of 10)

B006O5Y0SS|5.0|Although Woody is physically absent from the film, his philosophy and style is in every moment of this film. I feel as though he has come full circle in this film, fulfilling his true desires in life and love. Reminiscent of his earlier films such as Annie Hall, Hannah and her sisters, Deconstructing Harry, Everyone says I love you--Midnight in Paris enchants with its fantastical and nostalgic journey while it ridicules the pedantic and uncreative. For we cannot reach our most creative side unless we let go of our fear of dying and losing touch with reality. Loved all the cameos particularly of Adrien Brody as Dalì; Owen Wilson's best performance yet!

B005Z271Y6|3.0|The performance of Adele and the sound quality are five stars, the production quality two.  Is the Director A-D-D? Does he think we all have 2 second attention spans?  Stick with a shot for a while!  She has slows songs I would imagine would require infrequent edits. But I would be wrong.  Today's media equates a million edits with creativity.  Adele is the show not your stupid edits and camera movement.  Adele is a throwback artist relying on her voice, not heavy instrumentation, dancing/gyration, or flashy dancers.  It's the audience, musicians, and her voice. Let us watch HER and listen to the voice, see her emotions while singing the song, watch the musicians perform their craft. Let us get lost in them and the music.  Instead I got lost in the cutting, panning, zooming, cutting like it's a MTV video for kids!  The first time I watched the DVD it was quite distracting.  The second time through I acquiesced, gave in, and didn't let it bother me. As much!    Watched it with wife the first time, my 17 year-old daughter (BIG Adele fan) the second time. We all thoroughly enjoyed the music. It felt like we had been at a concert. I can live with the f-bombs. She's only 21 and a little bawdy.  But please re-edit the dad gum thing!

B00009V7RF|4.0|This rap CD is very mainstream but at the same time quite excellent. Words can't quite describe the best tracks on the album. Labor Day (It's A Holiday) is track in the first batch of tracks that really gets you pumped and ready to dance. Sexy is extremely melancholy for Black Eyed Peas and has them touching on a jazz-lite tone. The lazy horns really do it for me. It's a favorite. The Boogie That Be (another fave) is very sexy. It's another track you can dance to and what Fergie says in the bridge might get you in the mood. ;) She sings wonderfully on this disc.<br /><br />If you like Rap with a mix of R&B and Pop, get this. There is also a Rock-ish song called Anxiety (Feat. Papa Roach) that my cousin LOVED when this CD came out.

B001NXDSLQ|3.0|First let me say that I was the idiot who thought that this contained the whole Woodstock concert (all days and all footage). Instead, I got one or two videos from each artist. I wanted to see all of Jimi Hendrix's concert or all of Janis Joplin's. Sadly, its not here. A friend said I'd have to find and purchase a different dvd and that costs alot more. I give it three stars because I did enjoy the videos that were there and they made me feel as if I was at the concert. If you are looking for the entire concert with videos of all songs from each artist, this is not it.

140053271X|2.0|The device physically, is relatively good for the money.  There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.  The problem with the B&N system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.  If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.<br /><br />I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.  By contrast, with the Kindle system, you simply buy a book through Amazon using any credit card (which does not have to stay active) and send it to an authorized device.  The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.<br /><br />If you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.  Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.  Furthermore, it would appear that B&N is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard.  By opting out of this model, you are left with an utterly useless device.<br /><br />Why none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.  I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N altogether.<br /><br />I give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.  While you can delete your credit card from B&N, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.  Either that or hand your child your Visa and tell them to enjoy!  Now that's what I call convenience.o add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.  Either that or hand your child your Visa and tell them to enjoy!  Now that's what I call convenience.
0525478817|5.0|For a very long time, I have followed John and Hank Green as the vlogbrothers, yet never reading one of John Green's novels. I'm 24, and felt a young adult novel wouldn't touch base well, despite the reviews I've read for every one of his books.  Problem was, The Fault in Our Stars struck a little too close to home for me not to read it.   I had a bout with cancer like Hazel, and so far have walked out with the help of an experimental treatment. This book retold those times I had, those struggles, and made me realize how lucky I truly am. Even more, I live in Indianapolis, home of John Green and the setting of the book. So much of this hit so close to home.   Read this novel. You won't regret it. It doesn't matter your age. Keep the Kleenex's close. And realize the triumph we have in our lives.
B005NQ94KS|1.0|Real life is hard enough, why make movies to just be the bad, tragic, mundane parts of life. If it is not going to be a special relationship or a special story  then I fail to see the point of making this type of movie. If the rest of the movie had been fun or easy to watch it wouldn't have been so bad. This could have been an inspiring love story even with the tragic ending, but instead it was depressing, uninspirational and boring and after spending all that time sitting through it, I was at the very least expecting a happy ending and I didn't get one.

B004EPYZXU|1.0|I'm a big fan of the Space Program, followed all the launches in the early 60's as a child, the Gemini Launches, The Apollo Launches, I cried when the Apollo 1 Astronauts died in the fire, was devastated when the Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff and was heartbroken when Columbia broke up on re-entry.<br />I enjoyed Apollo 13 Immensely as a movie, although, I thought what happened to the astronauts in real life was nothing short of heart stopping but I thought it was very well done, the acting was superb and it brought to the screen one of the most riveting moments in NASA History at that point.<br /><br />All that being said, we come to Apollo 18, the biggest problem with this movie is it doesn't offer ANYTHING fresh in the way of an idea for a great plot.....I'm going to paraphrase here.....\\"the government sent Apollo 18 to the moon on a top secret military funded project and shot film of the mission, this movie is the result of the film\\" or words to that effect.<br />GEE, this sounds like deja Vu all over again, didn't we hear this in The Blair Witch Project and other films that followed it many years ago?.<br />In short, this movie sucked big time, Major Disappointment, IF YOU MUST see this movie, Rent it and go into it with your expectations LOW and I'm talking Barometric pressure readings LOW enough to cause an EF-5 Tornado because if you do, you just may be able to sit through the whole thing without turning it off, if you don't, well, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!

B004FOA84A|4.0|awesome adventure game. i play the online and downnloadable version like this one from msn games. this was better than most of them except that it was extremely short.
B005CC0CMC|5.0|I have already reviewed the individual products on this site so what I am going to talk about is if this set is right for you.<br /><br />Kindle set is a go. Good price for awesome books.<br /><br />Paperbacks I would say that if you are looking to get into this series try just buying the first book is sometimes a good way to go with this set. Having talked a lot of people in to trying to read this series it isn't for everybody. The other reason I would shy away from buying the papaerback set is it is a box set for only the first four books. I am not a fan of a box set without having all the series in the box.<br /><br />Then the very expensive hardcover set. I would love to buy them but they look like they are for display collectors series to me. So unless you are looking to buy then store away I would skip that set as well.<br /><br />I hope this helps anybody trying to decide which way to begin this series. Remember Winter is coming.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Solid album and one of the Beatles finest moments.  This album embodies the true essence of rock music which such epic tracks as Come Together, Silver hammer and who am I kidding the whole album is great.  Money well spent, always on real music.
B005MW8CLK|5.0|Gish was my introduction to the Smashing Pumpkins and a cd that stayed in heavy rotation throughout the early 90's. I'm glad Billy re-released Gish and gave it the due respect it deserved.....the remastered cd and the live dvd make this item well worth the price of admission to owning this box set.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The white album is one of my all time favorite albums and not to mention one of the best rock albums ever made.  The songs are epic, the lyrics are solid and the whole experience of this great record will be a memorable one for anyone who discovers it.  Great stuff.  Beatles forever.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|What an intense ride this was! This book is a unique take on sci-fi videogames and futuristic society yet at the same time he does a flashback to the 80's. There are references to many 80's movies and to the music of those days which were so sweet. The protagonist, Wade Watts aka Parzival, is immensely lovable and the antagonists, the Sixers, are heinous and detestable the nth degree. The supporting cast is equally endearing and engaging. The world Cline builds is detailed and completely crafted. I feel bad for Cline, he has to top \\"Ready Player One\\" in his second novel and that's no mean feat!
0007270968|5.0|I really enjoyed this small, fast read.  It shows that you don't need a lot of words to relay what you want people to know.  I've been a huge Gordon fan and I am an even bigger fan now (if that were possible).  His background is not what you'd expect.<br />A fast read that gives you a look at what made Gordon Ramsay.
0071762345|5.0|This is an excellent book and worth the read for anyone who is promoting anything.  I highly recommend it for business people but also for musicians and even pastors and non-profit leaders.
0525478817|5.0|Part one: The Book.   \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is a work that defies its genre in all the best ways possible. The silly boycrushes and superficial gossip that most writers think makes up 99% of high school steps aside for a beautiful, honest, heartrending story of life, death, and love. I can only compare this book to Markus Zuzak's award-winning \\"The Book Thief\\" in terms of sophistication and depth.  Hazel and Augustus are two of the most fleshed-out characters, particularly teenagers, that I have ever read. Their story is a joy and a privilege to read. Furthermore, their love is more real than anything else you will ever find on the Young Adult shelves.   Note- Read it alone if you can. People give you weird looks when you aren't sure if you're laughing or crying.  Part Two: A Response to Several Reviews  This bit is written in response to those who find the dialogue unrealistic, particularly for wee little teenagers. To them, I'd firstly like to request that you stop being condescending. Does every teenager speak like that? No, of course not. But please don't assume that means all teenagers are incapable of using words with more than two syllables, or lack the brainpower to be witty, insightful, and existential in conversation.   Having spent the last five or so years in this nebulous \\"teenagerdom\\", I believe I may be qualified enough to judge the \\"teenageriness\\" of Green's dialogue. Do the characters sound like teenagers? No. They don't sound like iCarly, or Bella Swan, or Troy Bolton or the majority of teens in pop culture.   But they do sound like me, and my best friends, and the people I surround myself with in high school. They sound like people, people I'd like to meet. Like the books defiance of the Young Adult Genre, Hazel and Augustus defy the conventional teenager model, resulting in some of the most honest and real characters I have read.  Part Three: A Letter   Dear John Green,     Thank you.  Sincerely,     A Young Adult
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I loved this movie. There were a lot of great action actors in the movie. I'm a huge Sylvester Stallone fan so this was wasn't a letdown to me. Other than the movie being a little dark in some of the action scenes it was great. The movie was shipped quickly. I received it a day early so that was a plus. No damage to the package. Great quality.
0525478817|5.0|I have read quite few books in my own sixteen years, although I've only been reading for eleven, and only books that have a meaning for probably six of those sixteen. Generally, because I read so much, and write so much, I'm slightly detached from any situation in text. I may tear up, but it doesn't have enough behind it to warrant the tears. I read this book in 2.5-ish hours, and and probably one of those hours was spent earnestly laughing through my earnest tears. The words are real, and well put together, and very much felt as one reads them. They suck you in, so you think that some real person is telling their real story. I'm still shaking.

B004EPYZQ2|3.0|A vastly overrated outing from both overrated director J.J. Abrams and has-been Steven Spielberg, this film has gotten about 95% of its success on those two names alone. Therefore, for the sake of a non-bias review for yourself, simply forget (as hard as it may be for the average American), FORGET that this movie has any connection whatsoever with J.J. and Ol' Steve. Take the film for its own right, and you'll see that this is perhaps the most overrated film of 2011. If you remember the teaser trailers leading up to its release, you'd say they were vastly vague, and revealed almost nothing except for creepy music and a lot of darkness. There is a reason for this, it was an attempt to create a buzz for this film because the filmmakers knew they had nothing to really work with. Any other type of trailer would've simply revealed every details about the movie in a matter of 2 minutes. Because, honestly, that's all the time you need to reveal every plot device this film actually offers.   The film stars a group of no-name teenage actors who are growing up in the late 1970's, they all are in the middle of creating a low-budget zombie film when a train station scene changes their lives (at least for a few days), when they witness and come head on with a giant train crash, holding an alien that the military is trying to keep under wraps. The teens escape with this knowledge and are then pursued by said military... the film basically delves into a continuous desperate attempt to try and create characters who we really never end up truly caring about, and a plot that drones on, stretching for suspense but never achieving any of it. Later on after a semi-climactic (not really) final scene, the aliens escape and we really never get to know what happens to all the kids as the movie just ends.   The biggest problem with this film is that J.J. and Spielberg try to take various elements that would equate to a heart-warming movie - middle schoolers, puppy love, a simpler time and generation (1979), quiet mid-western town, etc - and try to toss in a strange antagonist (aliens) to mix things up, but never actually using any of these attributes to do anything worthwhile. What Spielberg and J.J. seem to forget is that these elements alone will not create an enjoyable film, you need a good script to do that, not to also mention better actors. In other words, while it was cute to get no-name teenage actors to feel more realistic instead of hiring Lindsay Lohan and the cast of High School Musical, they don't put on performances that really break any ground. They play their parts well enough, but never hold any chemistry or magic, many times when even given the opportunity simply act as wooden slabs, displaying forced puppy love crushes and social tension. It just never works, it's hardly ever believable. Sure they're cute and the \\"pretty girl\\" definitely can pull of the \\"mystery girl with a heart-melting smile\\" well, these things are all ruined by forced monologues of things that are never touched upon in any way during the film except for the part when the kids are just TELLING us. An example being one drawn out monologue with said pretty girl going on about some memory of her childhood while watching a film in a dark room with the kid who's going ga-ga over her... her forced tears don't fool anyone, I don't care what Spielberg says in the featurettes, it's boring and useless, does nothing to enhance her character or do we see any of these elements of what she's actually TALKING ABOUT during her monologue as all these kids (except for the main protagonist boy) don't even seem to have any parents! To put it another way, don't have a character talk about things in her life she does or does not like, have her cry over it, stretch to make it dramatic (even though it isn't because her character isn't built up well enough prior for us to care), and then NOT have these things she's talking about be seen in any way whatsoever throughout the movie.   Anotherminus being the military/airforce/whatever who is trying to keep the Area 51 alien under wraps. Of course they fail, but even though the aliens themselves are supposed to be the the villains, so are the military. The issue here is that the aliens do not make themselves well known enough for us to be scared of them, dislike them, or desire to see them die for being the villains - they just aren't written in the film well enough at all except for just a few scenes of \\"rarr! be scared! I'm the alien! The bad guy in the movie! rarrr!!\\" Sorry, but that just isn't enough. Moreover, the military/airforce guys are too nice. They don't do anything that makes us dislike them or see any reason whatsoever why we should even be rooting for these obnoxious kids. Hence, we don't. So there really don't feel to be any \\"bad guys\\" in the film.   To just make one last point, the time era the film takes place in also is near unbelievable. Sure it's 1979, and things aren't THAT much different than they are now, given a suburb, but the point just isn't made well enough, and I can't tell whether it's because of bad props or just not enough atmosphere helping me to really believe this really is 1979. A film like \\"Born on the Fourth of July\\" with Tom Cruise from the late 80s made the 60's FEEL like the 60's, as does the recent hit \\"The Help,\\" as well as \\"Forest Gump.\\" These films highlight their time era, thus making it more believable, and in a way making the characters more genuine and likable. What only adds to this problem is the way the kids in the movie speak. They don't SPEAK like kids who grew up in the 1970s, or act correctly in terms of body language; rather, they speak way too modern, all carry a sort of sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek attitude you'd expect from a kid growing up in the 2000's. Obviously Abrams is too young to even know how children acted in the 70s. Perhaps Spielberg could've written or directed a bit of this film, at least he has some experience during this time as it was when he created some of his most classic films.   Spielberg and Abrams like to boast about how this film is done to pay \\"homage\\" to old sci-fi thrillers of the past. Besides E.T., I honestly don't think anyone really cares. I mean, who has even seen these old 50's movies besides die-hard movie buffs themselves who are forking over about 1% of all this film's earnings? You want to pay homage? Fine. But at the very least make a GOOD movie with a GOOD script.   Anyway, aside from the lack of characterization, the plot goes nowhere as the military scenes involving the guys trying to cover the whole thing up are never interesting, and there are never any plot twists among any of the characters, but things just play out exactly as you'd expect them to throughout the movie. The ending just, well, ends. I actually remember fighting to not fall asleep during the the last half hour of the film.   One reviewer states that this feels more like a big-budget Disney film, which is very true. This movie seems to want to impress adults by incorporating \\"childhood charm,\\" but does none of it, especially not with that dumb alien storyline always getting in the way. This movie simply feels like a big-budget film that could've just been premiered on Disney XD. This one may have been intended for all ages, but adults simply won't feel any charm whatsoever, and neither will teenagers, although they may enjoy seeing peers their age argue, sometimes. Maybe, but I'm just chancing it.   Spielberg has not made a decent film in years. Minority Report, though containing a great story and special effects, lacked good direction. There weren't very many thrilling scenes throughout it. Although it still worked mostly because it contained a good story. J.J. Abrams has got to be the most overrated director alive today, and only seems to do well simply because American audiences fall so easily for big-budget films with very little substance. While Star Trek made a good film, it did contain a good number of flaws, namely, a lame and boring enemy.... which is the same we get in Super 8. J.J. also can get a good word in by legendary directors, thus people simply fork up the money and say they enjoyed the film because they can't see past a special effects show with substandard characterization and a predictable script.   While Super 8 wasn't terrible, it was definitely overrated, and just comes off as your average run-of-the-mill alien flick starring some kids who you won't ever remember again. The campaign for this film did lots to draw people in, considering all the mysterious teaser trailers that made this film almost feel like the most mysterious and epic alien-lands-on-earth film ever. It would be nice to actually, then, you know, make the aliens have some REAL interaction. I'd say rent, don't buy.   Technical Stuff:  On a technical level, the Blu-ray disc looks great, the movie is sharp and sound is top-notch. The train crash scene (being the only worthwhile thing in the film, and the most exploited as it seems to be the only thing that drew people in) boasts of great bombastic sound and sharp picture, and beautiful explosions. The special features take are all filmed in HD, and take you into behind-the-scenes footage of making the film. Unfortunately, we can only take so much, as much of this is simply overkill. I don't need to see every waking moment of what people did and talked about while they were making the movie. Especially if it was a movie I didn't much even care for. The only films that can get away with this type of footage are ones where you REALLY want to know what went on... such as, let's say, Lord of the Rings.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app. You have so many translations literally at your fingertips. Its so easy to jump between your reading plan and the Bible if you need to look something up. There are so many reading plans to choose from, and it always keeps your place and can remind you to read if you need accountability. Love it.
0307944093|1.0|I agree completely with the other one star reviews in that it is too long and lacks any real story. I felt that it was constant dialogue and the main character was just painfully self absorbed. I was hoping for some type of love story, or at least that was my impression when I purchased it. I can't believe this is becoming a movie!
B004P7CNE0|5.0|We liked this movie. Action packed ,fast moving. Matrix like action. Christian bale was great. I love futuristic movies .

B0043D2FB2|5.0|I bought this book after watching a history TV show about Buddhism not knowing that much about it other than what other non-Buddhist people understood. I was looking for the most direct teachings from Buddha as I could get and not someones translation of his teachings. What I found was everything I have always been looking for but did not know it. The book was the catalyst to my beginning and understanding of how to be happy in most every facet of my life. This book is great because it groups the Buddha's teachings from several scriptures into focused subjects and helps to summarize them when they become repetitive for the purpose of the oral transmission in which they were first passed down.  This book was a fist step to changing my life forever and I hope you find within it the joy that I have. I am forever grateful.
B005CM1IMU|5.0|Bought this DVD in Blu-ray to have a copy that I can play as I desire to watch the movie from time to time. Own a copy in VHS, but no longer have a VHS player.

B004478GN8|5.0|My son asked for Star Wars Legos. That kind of left a lot of room for interpretation.  So this was one of the many<br />Star Wars sets I ordered. It requires a set of instructions with a blueprint almost that he has to follow to create the structures shown on the outside of the box. It's good because he has to follow instructions, he has to look at the picture and translate that into what he's building.  It's great for him. And he loves it. Win!
B004FEJ3VY|3.0|We ordered this for our almost 5 year old boy.  This is our first transformer experience.  My husband is a Mechanical Engineer & has great admiration for the design that goes into these creatures.  To be able to fold into such detailed objects is amazing.  That said, we wonder just how practical they are for tiny hands.  This particular model was over the age recommendation for our son, but, we still don't know any child who could successfully build this thing into either subject without adult intervention and or popping pieces off or breaking altogether (my husband got a little frustrated himself the 1st \\"go around.\\" :)).  Our son loves to fly Optimus Prime through the air, but as far as \\"transforming\\" him, he'll have to wait a while to be able to do just that on his own.  Amazing Engineering Design feat, but, practical toy that our child plays with, not so much.  Wish they had one with larger parts but without SO many small pieces for our little one's little hands.  That would be a great way to jump start him into the Design Engineering field.  :-)
B004EPYZQC|3.0|Fast Five is the latest in the action-driven, visually stunning, Fast and the Furious series. I would think it's the last installment, but these days I suppose anything is possible. It begins with brother and sister Dom and Mia Toretto (Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster) along with ex-law enforcement officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) as wanted fugitives on the move and in need of gainful, thought not legal, employment. Once they find a job and prove unsuccessful in performing it, they are now sought by a drug kingpin and faux philanthropist who contracted them in the first place.<br /><br />  Rather than knuckle under or retreat, the trio decides to bankrupt their unscrupulous foe, and thereby render him powerless. For this they need help and that is the reason they bring any living associates they from the previous films that played a significant role. All the while their nemesis has informed the American authorities as to their location in an effort to spoil their plans. Enter The Rock, playing U.S. Marshal Luke Hobbs, with the unflinching assistance of the Rio police, who are paid agents of the aforementioned kingpin. In addition, Hobbs has a very rigid view of his responsibility for the larger portion of the film.<br /><br />  Fast Five isn't anything its predecessors weren't. Save for a little misdirection at the end. It's about beautiful cars, beautiful women, and the occasional fistfight or shootout. In that regard it's a success.
B005F3XV62|2.0|Griffin Keyes (Kevin James) is the perfect employee. In addition to being the favorite of all the animals at the Franklin Park Zoo, he's professional, courteous and well-liked by his co-workers. His dedication was only compounded when, five years earlier, he was dumped by his fianc&eacute;e mid-proposal. But when his fianc&eacute;e (Leslie Bibb) comes back into his life at his brother's engagement party, his career soon feels like an albatross around his neck.<br /><br />  Fearing the loss of their favorite zookeeper, the animals (voiced by Sylvester Stallone, Nick Nolte, Cher and others) intervene. They reveal the fact that they can speak and always could and then proceed to offer Griffin whatever help they can in winning back his former girlfriend. The attempts and advice vary in detail but what it all amounts to is a slapstick tsunami. It can enhance a storyline when used correctly but the use of it in this film is meant to replace one. It makes for a lot of laughs, but not a lot of originality. Basically, if you've seen the commercial, you've seen the movie.
B005OK721G|3.0|Living a happy, normal life, a ten year-old girl named Cataleya (played as an adult by Zoe Saldana) narrowly escapes execution at the hands of the same men who'd already murdered her parents. After escaping, she goes on an epic (at least for a ten year-old traveling alone) journey. Finally ending at her uncle's home in America. Her uncle asks the young girl what she wishes to be when she grows up and she says an assassin. After initially trying to dissuade her from this course of action, he offers instruction.<br /><br />  There's nothing earth-shattering here. There's barely a narrative here. It's basically the human equivalent of two trains colliding on a track at full-speed. I admit, I enjoyed it. Having said that, it's a popcorn movie, or it would be if I still ate popcorn. Action sequences, fight sequences, and explosions. If that's not your thing, skip this one. If it is, you'll probably like it a lot.
B005TPCQ5I|2.0|Emma and Dexter graduate from school and then end up at her place for what could've been the beginning of a whirlwind romance or a one-night stand but ends as something of a near-miss with them deciding to remain friends. Emma (played by Anne Hathaway with an absentee accent that comes and goes with no real mention) is an aspiring writer from a humble background. Dexter (played by Jim Sturgess of 21 and Across the Universe) is the son of wealthy parents with whom he has a difficult relationship.<br /><br />  Through many years we see Dexter (Sturgess) go from a television personality who's despised even by his fans to a man with no career who takes a job at a restaurant in the hopes of moving up the ladder in the organization to make a living for his wife and child. Meanwhile Emma (Hathaway) spends most of that time working in a Mexican restaurant and involved with a man she doesn't love but who loves her dearly. And for a large portion of that time in her life, she and Dexter are not speaking despite being each other's best friends.<br /><br />  While Sturgess is believable enough as the uber-cad who gets by on charm until that gives way substance abuse and boorishness and Hathaway is fine save for her accent, the story isn't very interesting and the ending left me annoyed and confused and maybe more than a little aggravated. This is not really what one looks for in unadulterated sap.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Precision driving can mean the difference between a long prison sentence and a clean getaway. For the right price and with the right connection, those are services you can obtain once and only once and Ryan Gosling provides them.<br /><br />  Starring as a character that is never given a name, Gosling works as a mechanic for Shannon (played by Bryan Cranston) who also allows him to use vehicles brought to his garage for servicing for his illicit activities. In addition, he does the occasional bit of stunt driving for Hollywood films. Not to mention the fact that Shannon's (Cranston's) associate Bernie Rose (played way against type by Albert Brooks) is considering a proposal Shannon made to have Driver race professionally with Bernie (Brooks) as their benefactor. Things appear to be going swimmingly until Driver offers assistance to a neighbor being coerced to perform a robbery. The neighbor, Standard (played by Oscar Isaac), was recently released from prison and fears what his associate will do to his family. A family that Driver became quite close to in the time between when he met them and the day Standard was released.<br /><br />  The violence is a little gruesome, and the surreal nature of a character with no name is something that didn't actually strike me until after I left the theater. That said, the story is interesting, the performances spectacular and the general feel of the film is right on target. It is light-years ahead of films like The Transporter that seek to turn their characters into superheroes.
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|You work all your life in the service industry with the hopes of a comfortable retirement 25 or so years down the road. Meanwhile, the money in your paycheck earmarked for your pension has evaporated into thin air. While this might be enough to make anyone snap, imagine being at the beck and call of the man responsible for bankrupting, not only your retirement fund, but that of all your coworkers.<br />The Tower is home to the most expensive real estate in New York City. But the real draw of The Tower is not the location or the amenities in any of the individual apartments, but the staff which is on duty 24/7. The penthouse apartment is occupied by The Tower's wealthiest resident Arthur Shaw (played by Alan Alda) who is the CEO of a high-return investment group. When his fund is exposed to law enforcement and in the press as a Ponzi scheme, it falls to building manager Josh Kovacs (played by Ben Stiller) to inform the staff of The Tower that he'd invested their pensions with Shaw and that said pensions are most likely lost. And during all this, Shaw (Alda) is under house arrest in The Tower. But when a doorman just shy of his retirement becomes despondent and attempts suicide, Kovacs resolves to find the rainy day fund that FBI Agent Claire Denham (Tea Leoni) assures him Shaw is hiding. All in the hopes of retrieving what's rightfully theirs Kovacs, Charlie Gibbs (Casey Affleck), the building concierge and Josh's brother-in-law, and Mr. Fitzhugh (played by Matthew Broderick), a former Merrill Lynch employee who was evicted from The Tower after losing his job, savings, and marriage, join forces and begin devising a strategy for the caper. But knowing they're in over their heads, Josh enlists Slide (played by Eddie Murphy), a thief and Kovacs neighbor who he once went to school with.<br />I've never been a big fan of Ben Stiller and while I have great appreciation for Eddie Murphy's early work (the Beverly Hills Cop series, Coming to America and even The Distinguished Gentleman) I've long-believed his best years as anything but a voice actor were behind him. That said, I enjoyed this film a great deal.an) I've long-believed his best years as anything but a voice actor were behind him. That said, I enjoyed this film a great deal.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|A factory accident in the small town of Lillian, Ohio leaves an emotionally distant man (Kyle Chandler) a widower and his son without the one parent he could relate to. At the reception in their home, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Chandler) ejects a man who showed up intoxicated and his son Joe (Joel Courtney) bears witness. In an effort to buy time so that he himself and his son can come to grips with the loss, Jackson tries to persuade Joe to go to baseball camp for the summer and, at the same time, disparages his friends whose interests include the production of monster films for one and explosive for another. As they are in the middle of one such film and Joe promised to help complete it, he declines the offer.<br /><br />  One night, he sneaks out of the house to joins his friends in filming a scene at a train station and they are all nearly killed when a train is derailed after a head-on collision with a speeding pickup. It is the collision and subsequent events that are the source for most of the film. The train belonged to the Air Force and before long, so does the crash site and most of the town as it is placed under a de facto martial law. Joe and Charles, the director of the film that brought them to the train station in first place, examine their footage and see something escaping the train.<br /><br />  Written and directed by J. J. Abrams of Lost fame and with Steven Spielberg co-producing, Super 8 is easily a step above efforts like Cloverfield and Artificial Intelligence while falling just short of films like E.T., Super 8 is a welcomed addition to the sci-fi genre and a great time to be had at the movies.
B003Y5H5C4|4.0|Someone straps a bomb to your chest and tells you that if you don't rob a back and return with at least $100,000, they will detonate the bomb and kill you. What do you do? That question is put to Jessie Eisenberg in this film as he portrays a pizza delivery man who is certainly unhappy but far too much of a slacker to make any serious effort to change his circumstances.<br /><br />  Nick (Eisenberg) runs to his closest friend for help. Of course they have just had a falling out and Chet, a teacher, (played by stand-up comedian Aziz Ansari) is very surprised to see him. Even more so when he sees the explosive device and realizes his friend just brought a bomb to a school full of innocent children. Soon Chet agrees to help and the robbery becomes inevitable.<br /><br />  There has been a small degree of criticism for making a comedy film about circumstances which are eerily similar to those of another pizza delivery man in Pennsylvania. Of course, the man in that case was not an unwitting accomplice but was in fact in league with the robbers and simply believed the bomb was not real. Oddly enough, an episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent bares an even more similar storyline and predates the Pennsylvania case and an episode of Bones that also contains a plot with many similar elements came and went with no such outrage.<br /><br />  That said, the film is a comedy and achieves it's objectives with relative ease. Eisenberg is seen here with his usual mannerisms but without the intelligence he's previously displayed in films such as The Social Network and Adventureland. Aziz Ansari is passable as the best friend and the would-be killers, played by comedian/actors Danny McBride and Nick Swardson are funny, though not particularly frightening without explosives. All in all, it's a solid comedy, a good time, and not much else.
B006OFN0SE|2.0|With no real knowledge of history, someone asked \\"who was the most powerful man in the country during the sixties and seventies\\" would probably answer with the name of a president. JFK, LBJ, or Nixon, most likely. And they'd be wrong. During all their turns as chief executive, only one man had all of them quaking in their boots.<br /><br />  J. Edgar Hoover (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is dictating his autobiography to a young FBI agent and this provides the sequence of events for the film. The beginning of his relationship with long-time secretary and confidant Helen Gandy (played by Naomi Watts), the creation and growth of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and those prominent cases that helped to garner press coverage for the Bureau and Hoover specifically. Chief among those is the Lindbergh kidnapping. But we find out later during a private moment between Hoover and his deputy, Clyde Tolson (played by Armie Hammer) that his recollections are usually embellished and occasionally flat-out lies. And while the relationship of Hoover and Tolson has been the subject of much speculation, the film does little to explore it.<br /><br />  If you read and remember my review of Water for Elephants, than you know I hate Leonardo DiCaprio. That hatred, however, has not stopped me from enjoying several of his movies in the theater and purchasing them on DVD. The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and, most recently, Inception to name a few. I also enjoy Clint Eastwood's work as both a director and an actor despite serious missteps like True Crime and Blood Work. And while I've never liked Hoover, I was anxious to see this film on his life. When you start off intending to make a film about a paranoid, power-mad, cross-dresser with a penchant for blackmail and who is alleged to have had an affair with his second-in-command, ending up with a dull finished product is practically an accomplishment and that's what happened. Perhaps any one film is not enough to offer real exploration of this polarizing historical figure, but with the cast and crew already mentioned and a script by the same writer who brought us the 2008 biopic Milk with Sean Penn in the title role, this was a disappointment and a rather significant one, at that.cal figure, but with the cast and crew already mentioned and a script by the same writer who brought us the 2008 biopic Milk with Sean Penn in the title role, this was a disappointment and a rather significant one, at that.
B004LWZW7E|2.0|Everyone is on a clock. What keeps the general population from devolving into id-driven mobs is the fact that no one knows how much time they have left on theirs. If you had a constant reminder on your forearm, however, you might simply go about your life in a desperate attempt to prolong it. Or not.<br /><br />  Will Salas (played by Justin Timberlake) is a 28-year-old factory worker whose one year clock started and aging stopped, like everyone else in the film, when he turned 25. He and his 50 year-old mother Rachel (played by Olivia Wilde) live in the ghettos of Dayton hoping to earn and save enough to at least see the next day. All while wages in the ghetto are constantly going down and the cost of living is constantly going up. Then, while out drinking with his friend Borel (played by Johnny Galecki), he learns of a man with more than a century left on his clock who has unadvisedly advertised his good fortune while in the same bar as Will and Borel. A local time-thief enters the picture and, rather than retreat like his friend did and advised him to do, Will comes to the aid of the fortunate stranger. While saving his life was all for naught, the stranger gives Will all the time left on his clock before allowing the time on his own clock to run out while he's sitting on a bridge overlooking a dry river basin.<br /><br />  \\"Time is money\\" was a phrase first coined by Benjamin Franklin. While the idea of reversing that concept to \\"money is time\\" is interesting, I don't believe the cast was up to the challenge of exploring it. Whatever success Justin Timberlake might've had in supporting roles, he doesn't have what it takes to be the leading man. Amanda Seyfried, whose role has her playing off Timberlake for a lot of the film, is another professional whose appeal tends to overshadow her abilities for some reason. Perhaps an independent production could provide actors with genuine talent, who are young enough to look the part, but this is closer some sort of CW melodrama.
B0034G4P80|3.0|The film opens in a realm and/or planet far removed from Earth and human existence. We're given a brief overview of the major events in its history and then we're introduced to its royal family battlefield conqueror, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth). After disobeying his father, Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) he is banished to Earth and stripped of his godlike abilities.<br /><br />  Enter Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). While studying anomalous events in the atmosphere under the guidance of her mentor Erik Selwig (Stellan Skarsgard) and with the not-so-able assistance of Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), she bears witness to Thor's banishment or rather the tornado-like occurrence that made it possible. This intrigues Foster and after a brief period of reticence she hopes to offer help to Thor and, at the same time, elicit any information he might have that could help her in her work. All the while, turmoil in Thor's realm could potentially destroy both it and Earth.<br /><br />  I'd not seen Hemsworth before and while the part requires very little beyond physicality, he is adequate at least. The \\"earthlings\\", are good enough as are those from Thor's home planet and the story is about what I expect. It's not amazing, it's not awful. Basically, it's just a good time at the movies.
B0034G4P94|5.0|What happens when you have two separate underdogs fight each other in a winner-take-all competition? You end up hoping neither one of them will lose. That's the situation in this thoroughly engrossing mixed martial arts film. Something I never thought I'd say after teen-filled drama Never Back Down released in 2008 that used unlicensed MMA bouts as a backdrop.<br />Brendan Conlon (played by Joel Edgerton) is a man who gave up fighting professionally for his wife Tess (played by Jennifer Morrison) with whom he now has two daughters. Tommy Riordan (played by Tom Hardy) left home with his mother to escape his father's abuse and joined the Marines after she passed. Brendan (Edgerton) is now staring at a debt he can't overcome thanks to his mortgage and goes back to professional fighting in the form of parking lot bouts with inexperienced opponents. And when a video of one of these bouts on the internet is seen by his boss (Kevin Dunn), the principal of the high school where he teaches science, the winner-take-all event is his only hope to avoid foreclosure and relocation. Tommy (Hardy), on the other hand, made a promise to the family of a fallen comrade and intends to keep it no matter what that might mean for his competitors. That includes Brendan who is only revealed to be Tommy's brother well into the film.<br />I'm not really a fan of MMA. I had a passing interest in boxing at one time, watching it that is, but it passed. That said, a well-made film can make any sport, with the exception of curling, seem interesting. And while some may see the release of this film as being too soon after the critically-acclaimed 2010 Mark Wahlberg film The Fighter, or as some sort of Rocky rip-off, I see a well-made, well-acted, realistic film about two men determined to fulfill their obligations the best way they know how. In the ring. Not to mention the sympathetic performances put forth by Nick Nolte as the father of the two competitors and Jennifer Morrison as the suffering wife.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Nick, Dale, and Kurt are all years into their careers and have found themselves in an all-too-common situation. They hate their superiors. Nick (Jason Bateman) works for someone intent on keeping him under his boot till one of them dies or ruining his career should he ever decide to quit. Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), after his longtime boss, a man he genuinely liked and respected, dies, is working for his boss's unqualified, obnoxious, drug-addicted son (Colin Farrell). Dale (Charlie Day) is a dental hygienist whose boss (Jennifer Anniston) is sexually harassing him in addition to molesting her anesthetized patients.<br />Drowning their sorrows, they all ruminate on the idea of how much better their lives would be if their bosses were dead. Next thing they know, they're devising a master plan with the help of a \\"murder consultant\\" (Jamie Foxx) whose real first name is barely mentioned and whose nickname is an expletive. Saying anymore about the story would give away too much.<br />While the top-tier talent is relegated to the antagonists, Bateman, Farrell, and Sudeikis bring the most to the film, comedically. And the writers, one of whom has a near-forgettable role as a co-worker of Bateman's character, should be congratulated.
B004XQO90O|4.0|\\"Suspension of disbelief\\". It's an agreement between viewers and the people who take it upon themselves to entertain us. We all know its fake but put that aside for the short time they've asked for our attention. In this latest Jake Gyllenhaal film, that agreement is stretched to its absolute limit and for some, beyond.<br /><br />  Gyllenhaal plays army captain Colter Stevens who's suddenly found himself on a train across from woman who keeps referring to him by another name. Additionally, she's talking to him as if she knows him. After a relatively short time the train meets with a catastrophe and Stevens is in a confined area staring up at a monitor being asked to explain the events. Still struggling with memory issues, he's given the assignment, \\"find the perpetrator\\", and returned to the same situation. This series of events occurs several times in a way that would more likely remind many viewers of Vantage Point, assuming there are many people who saw it. That said, it isn't intent on inspiring a debate on the time traveler's paradox or parallel universes. It's a whodunit adrenaline ride made to entertain and it does just that.
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|With the best players playing the right way, a team is assured a victory. But if the best players are too expensive, do you simply take who you can get and give in? Or have you been overlooking quality players simply because conventional wisdom said you should?<br /><br />  Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) is General Manager of the Oakland A's and after losing the last game of the season against the Yankees, three of his star players leave for more lucrative contracts. He'd hoped to match their offers, but the owner couldn't afford it. Then, while looking for a trade at the Cleveland Indians' headquarters, he noticed his counterpart appeared to be taking direction from someone he'd never seen before. After the meeting he approaches Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill), the one person he didn't know in that meeting who seemed to be calling the shots. Brand and Beane soon have a rapport and before long Brand is Beane's second-in-command despite serious resistance from the rest of the staff in the Manager's office who feel Brand is a threat to the team and the game itself.<br /><br />  Sabermetrics has had wide-reaching and long-lasting effects on the game of baseball from supposedly ending the Red Sox losing streak to posthumously exonerating fabled great \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson. The story is interesting and Jonah Hill acting way outside his comfort zone is, to say the least, adequate. Brad Pitt also plays his part well as he often does, regardless of the material. That said, at two hours and thirteen minutes, the film feels too long. I don't say that because I believe all movies should be shorter than this, but I do believe this one should've been shorter.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Cal Weaver (Steve Carrell) is happy in his marriage and dotes on his two children. Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) is dedicated to the pursuit of one-night stands with beautiful women. And Hannah (Emma Stone) is a soon-to-be lawyer in love with a man who her best friend believes is beneath her but who Hannah (Stone) is genuinely hoping will propose. But Weaver (Carrell) is blindsided when his wife of more than 20 years, (played by Julianne Moore) confesses she's been unfaithful and wants a divorce.<br /><br />  We soon find Cal Weaver living in an apartment spending an inordinate amount of time at a local pickup joint drinking heavily and repeatedly stating the particulars of his wife's infidelity to the establishment's clientele. This puts a serious crimp in Jacob's evening and so he offers his advice and services as a life coach, of sorts. Meanwhile, he's made several overtures to Hannah only to be rejected every time.<br /><br />  I'll admit, there are few moments where the characters find themselves in situations so embarrassing, that I can't bear to watch. That said, this is easily the best comedy I've seen this summer, and perhaps this year. Good premise, great characters, and amazing twists you do not see coming. Loved it.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|In a world of cage matches and underground brawling, boxing seems sadly tame by comparison. And with ever-increasing technological advances, robot death-matches may be a coming attraction destined for a venue near you. Though probably not in the not-to-distant future depicted in this Hugh Jackman science-fiction movie.<br /><br />  It's 2020 and Charlie Kenton (Jackman) is a boxer whose days in the ring are long-behind him thanks to the emergence of robot boxing. He now controls other fighters (robots) from the sidelines. Unfortunately, he's had a long run of bad luck and is in serious debt. He's then hit with the news that the son he never sees was recently orphaned when his mother, and Charlie's former girlfriend, died. At the custody hearing he sees Max (played by Dakota Goyo), Max's wealthy Aunt Debra (played by Hope Davis) and her husband Marvin (played by James Rebhorn). Marvin (Rebhorn) tells Charlie that while they want custody and know that he doesn't, they have plans for the summer and they are willing to pay a six-figure sum if Charlie will care for Max until they return. And at that time he'll relinquish all claims to Max. Soon Max and Charlie find a robot to replace the one lost in Charlie's most recent bout and embark on the process of training it and repaying Charlie's debts.<br /><br />  I wasn't expecting much from this film given the premise and the fact that some of Jackman's previous films (the X-MEN series and Wolverine follow-up) left me disappointed. I was surprised and very pleased to see this film outshine those in execution and conclusion. Jackman's role isn't all that different from ones past but the tone and supporting characters make for an extremely enjoyable two hours and seven minutes.
B005TBN3EU|2.0|They're all back, they're in Thailand, and they don't remember a thing. Again. Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha all return in this sequel to the wildly successful 2009 comedy. This time it's Stu (Helms) who is about to be married and his friends are in Thailand for the wedding with Alan (Galifianakis) being brought along out of pity. However, this time Stu is determined to avoid being drugged. Imagine his surprise when, once in Thailand, that is exactly what happens. And while a member of the party is, again, missing, this time it's his future brother-in-law Teddy (Mason Lee) who is nowhere to be found. And upon inspection of their unfamiliar surroundings, they find his finger on the coffee table still bearing his class ring.<br /><br />  I'll admit that I, unlike most viewers, saw the first film and considered entertaining rather than hilarious. The second film is certainly lesser, at least as entertainment. In 2010, an action/comedy titled The Losers introduced the idea of `green terrorism' by demonstrating a fictional explosive with all the destructive power of a nuclear bomb that created no radiation or fallout. The Hangover II is essentially a \\"green comedy\\". Whatever esthetic differences there might be, it's primarily recycled materials from the previous film.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|The film begins with Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) giving a brief insight into the lives herself and her community who work, for the most part, as domestic staff for the white elite of Jackson, Mississippi. How she's spent most of her life raising white children and how she'd recently lost her own son. And Minnie, her friend, (played by Octavia Spencer) loses her job due to an inability to abide by unjust rules and hold her tongue as she's expected to.<br /><br />  Meanwhile, Eugenia \\"Skeeter\\" Phelan (played by Emma Stone) has returned home from college with a degree and plans to use it. An idea that is lost on her friends and family who saw college as a means to an end in their quest for suitable husbands who could support them and their future children in the manner they've become accustomed to thanks to their upbringing. And while Skeeter(Stone) finds a job writing a column about cooking and other matters she has little to no expertise on and a valuable resource for the column in Aibileen (Davis), she soon finds her real passion in chronicling the life, times, and injustices of African American domestic servants in Jackson.<br /><br />  I've heard the criticisms leveled on this film and, in all honesty, they're not wrong. It's depiction of racism is, for the most part watered down or rose-colored. And the film's main antagonist is a twitchy social butterfly whose only real power is her standing. That might make sense if her near-senile mother weren't heckling her in the background during those important social events. It is funny, the characters that are the actual focus of the film are endearing and the conclusion is satisfying enough without being too far-fetched to be believable.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|She's a teacher and she's bad? Genius! How'd you come up with that? Give that man, or rather those men, gold stars. Yes, it took two men to write this script. And the result? I almost feel stupid typing it.<br /><br />  Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey. An aspiring trophy wife whose hopes are dashed when her spineless fianc&eacute;e calls off their wedding at the urging of his mother and financial advisors. So she returns tail between her legs, to teaching middle school. A job she took because she believed it required little effort and offered a summer vacation. And, almost immediately, she discovers a teacher from a wealthy family trying to find his classroom. She makes her intentions very clear, though Scott, the teacher (played by Justin Timberlake) doesn't catch on. And soon her efforts appear in vain when Scott (Timberlake) encounters the ridiculously named Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch) whose hokey goodhearted nature ranges from annoying to nauseating. In addition, Diaz's character maintains a friendship with the gym teacher (Jason Segel) based in shared apathy and sarcasm.<br /><br />  Is it funny? It has its moments, but overall the comparisons made between this and Bad Santa are accurate. Bad Santa being the role Billy Bob Thornton liked so much that he played it several times in \\"different\\" movies as characters with different names. This facsimile, on the other hand, is tame by comparison in addition to being largely dependant on the looks of its 38 year-old star who really should've past this sort of thing. Lowest common denominator drivel.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|Unbeknownst to mankind, the entire universe, Earth included, has been under the protection of a group of intergalactic peacekeepers called Green Lanterns. The only limit on their abilities is their imagination and the source of those abilities is willpower along with a ring and an actual green lantern. But for the first time in recent history, they are vulnerable. A dark force that draws his power from fear is picking off Lanterns one at a time. Wounded, one Lantern crashes on Earth and his ring seeks out his replacement.<br /><br />  Enter Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds). A test pilot for a private aerospace firm, Jordan is brash, sarcastic, and reckless. The ring and lantern find him and bring him, against his will, to his predecessor who informs him of their purpose.<br /><br />  Going into this, I kept referring to it (to myself and others) as The Green Hornet without meaning to. Leaving the theater afterwards, I still struggle to distinguish the two. Of course the characters are immensely different as are the stories. The similarities are the tone and the fatally flawed execution. I actually like Reynolds, generally, but maintaining dramatic tension while practically winking at the audience and his fellow cast members is a near impossible task and Reynolds falls far short of accomplishing it. The supporting cast doesn't really help, but the failure lies with director Campbell and writers Berlanti, Green, and Guggenheim.
B006QKJQM6|5.0|In this animated sequel, we rejoin Po (Jack Black) and the Furious Five in the routine rescue of a small village being stripped of any metal in their possession. While success appeared a forgone conclusion, something Po observes on an opponent leaves him dumbstruck and sends him flashing back to his childhood. Outraged by his combat failure, the Five and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) inform him that he is not to join them in their duties.<br /><br />  Elsewhere, we learn that the party behind the plundering intends to use the metal for raw material in a weapon; a weapon that \\"stops kung fu\\". Upon hearing that it was a panda that nearly thwarted the effort, he's noticeably unnerved. The reason being that a soothsayer forcibly assisting him long ago told him that a panda would be his undoing. Meanwhile, Po has returned home to his father to unravel the mystery.<br /><br />  I don't know if I was expecting a second film after the first one, and it would stand up on it's own without one, but I enjoyed this sequel immensely. The origin story, the identity struggle, the final confrontation and most of the intervening events are highly entertaining. A worthy follow-up.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|It's 1974 and the world has lost interest in lunar exploration. The government, however, still has plans for the moon. So they send Captain Ben Anderson (Warren Christie), Commander Nate Walker (Lloyd Owen), and Lieutenant Colonel John Grey (Ryan Robbins) to bring those plans to fruition. However, their attempts to do so are impeded by one terrifying unforeseen complication. They are not alone.<br /><br />  The found-footage style film is not entirely flawed. There are those who liked The Blair Witch Project and saw it as genius. I wasn't one of them and I haven't met anyone who is, but I'm almost positive they exist. And if you're someone who saw The Blair Witch Project and thought the only way to make it better would be to add aliens, have it take place 20 years earlier and on the moon, no doubt you'll love this movie. I, on the other hand, saw it as flawed and boring from start to finish and will not be watching again on cable, home video or any other medium barring some sort of coercion. Say a gun to my head.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|What if the weapon that does in modern civilization is one so small that it can only be seen under a microscope? And worse yet, what if it can't be stopped? If even hearing those questions causes you to panic, you want to skip this film.<br /><br />  Beth Emhoff (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) returns home from a business trip to Hong Kong with symptoms of what appears to be a minor illness until her husband Mitch (played by Matt Damon) finds her on the kitchen floor having a seizure. The doctors are dumbfounded as the disease manages to spread not only in the Emhoffs' hometown of Minneapolis but also in other communities across the U.S. and the globe. The resulting fears are then stoked by a conspiracy-minded blogger named Alan Krunweide (played by Jude Law) who sees the disease as an attempt to further trim the civil liberties of ordinary citizens while drug companies and medical professionals rake in untold profits. All while actual medical professionals (played by Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard and others) continue to work tirelessly and gain little, if any, advantage in the fight.<br /><br />  As already mentioned, this is a very impressive cast. The individual stories tug at the sympathies of every viewer while the overall narrative is chilling to both germaphobes and those with anti-government leanings. And the eventual explanation montage ties all the events off very nicely. Easily worth it.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|After a brief opening sequence revealing a startling find in the Arctic, we find ourselves taken back to the height of World War II. A Nazi officer (Hugo Weaving) and his men lead a raid in order to steal an object of great power and mystery. Simultaneously, in NYC, we see Steve Rogers (played in 98-pound-weakling form a la Benjamin Button by Chris Pine). Rogers (Pine) is being denied the opportunity to serve his country in the military due to various physical issues. Not long after this, however, a mysterious man (Stanley Tucci) offers him the opportunity to be a part of the Army's new super soldier program. And, with a little delay, Captain America is born.<br /><br />  Having never read the original comic books, I can't speak to their endearing qualities. And their timely inception no doubt did a great deal to inspire its readers, but the tone of the film is campy, and I don't believe it was meant to be. In addition, Pine (Captain America) doesn't really have the gravitas to pull of the role. I liked him and his co-stars in The Losers, and he was near brilliant in the irreverent, tragically-underrated masterpiece Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, but both those films had there roots planted in comedy. The First Avenger does not.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|We enter the story by finding a man (Daniel Craig) unconscious in the desert. He awakes with no memory and discovers a strange device on his arm that, despite numerous efforts, he can't remove. Before he's made any real assessment of his situation, he's discovered by three men who believe he'll bring them a windfall when they turn him over to the authorities. But, despite his memory loss, he makes short work of his would-be captors and moves on. Victorious but still with no memory.<br /><br />His wandering brings him to the nearby town of Absolution. Its inhabitants are nowhere to be seen until the local preacher (Clancy Brown) discovers him and offers to stitch the wound he (Craig) discovered when he awoke. Unfortunately, they are interrupted when Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), son of the town's benefactor and all-around miscreant, causes a commotion and accidentally kills a Marshall and (Craig) subdues him. As a result, he's identified and arrested for crimes he's previously committed. Our amnesiac's name is Jake Lonergan and before being transferred, the town is attacked by mysterious creatures first referred to as demons but that are, of course, aliens. Hence the title.<br /><br />I was as wary as anyone when I saw the title of this film. I expected a farce with a poorly written script and star-studded cast. While the cast is chock-full of familiar faces (Olivia Wilde, Keith Carradine, Sam Rockwell and others) the film is engrossing, well-written, and easily one of the better films based on a comic book that I've seen in some time.
B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|What if the greatest accomplishment of your life was a lie? What if that lie had become big enough to destroy not only your reputation, but those of your accomplices and your only daughter?<br /><br />  Rachel Singer (played by Jessica Chastain as a young Mossad agent with no field experience in 1966 and by Helen Mirren in 1997 as a hardened veteran scarred by her past) is tasked with assisting two experienced operatives in the apprehension of a Nazi war criminal so that he may be tried and, in all likelihood, executed in Israel. Her colleagues are two men she'd never met named David Peretz (Sam Worthington in 1966 and Cirian Hinds in '97) and Stefan Gold (Marton Csokas in `66 and Tom Wilkinson in '97). Their target is Dieter Vogel, (played by Jesper Christensen) a man given the moniker \\"the Surgeon of Birkenau\\". And when we first learn of the mission we are shown Rachel (Chastain) unable to prevent Vogel's escape and shooting him after being beaten and cut in her confrontation with Vogel. These events were chronicled in a book written by Rachel's daughter and that portion of the book is being read aloud by Rachel at a luncheon publicity event. After the reading she's informed that Peretz (Hinds) walked in front of a truck rather than be escorted to a meeting with Gold (Wilkinson) and an associate of his.<br /><br />  Suddenly Rachel is racked with guilt over her part in their fractured relationship. Their falling out was precipitated by her budding romance with Stefan and a shared deception that David could no longer live with. Stefan and Rachel soon resolve to correct their mistakes in hopes of sparing their reputations and that of their daughter Sarah (played by Romi Aboulafia).<br /><br />  I love World War II movies as much as anybody does and more than some. There are few cinematic events as enjoyable as watching a sociopath get what he most definitely deserves. That said, this film gives the viewer a sustained uneasy feeling and leaves you with the question of `what now' and doesn't do anything to answer it or soothe the discomfort. I suppose every film that doesn't inform the viewers with an epilogue leaves viewers with that question and even those that do have epilogues still leave some questions unanswered but with such a great premise and a truly impressive cast, I expected more and I didn't get it.anything to answer it or soothe the discomfort.

B0053YGYO4|5.0|I have a real fondness for Coldplay. They are not cool, and neither am I. The music is poppy perfection. I love life-affirming lyrics, soaring ballads, excellent piano and guitar. This is one of my favorite Coldplay albums ever: [[ASIN:B005L3HJ8M Mylo Xyloto]]

B006O5XYWG|4.0|Although sometimes corny, I had a blast watching this with my 10-yr old daughter.  I usually stay away from such fare, but will on occasion watch something clever like District 9 after checking the ratings.<br /><br />This was good fun, and the Golden Gate Bridge scenes were great!
B005XQLBU4|1.0|it is not very good graphics first of all and you have to know exactly were you want the Missouri to destroy the target and if I could rate it zero I would

1400069181|5.0|Blake Mycoskie started TOMS shoe company after visiting Argentina and learning that many children there didn't own shoes, leading to infections and diseases from dirt-born parasites.  The business donates one pair of shoes for every pair sold.  This quick read describes the challenges and joys of getting the business going, along with how it became so successful; however, the majority of the book focuses on how we as humans can become our own destiny.  The chapter titles say it all, among them: \\" Find Your Story, Face Your Fears, Build Trust, and Giving is Good Business.\\"  The chapters are simplistic but contain information which is so true.  Decide what it is you really want, have the courage to go for it, and remember the people who helped you along the way.  In other words, give back as much as you are able.  This is truly an inspiring book which I am happy to highly recommend.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|I purchased the Kingston Flash Card Reader after comparing what was avalable on Amazon who I usually do business with and they seem to have the largest variety and lowest price. The Kingston is a very good storage device for my 16M SD Card the only complaint I have is the exposed plug end. I build a little container to put the card reader in for fear the electrically exposed end would get damaged since I keep it in my pocket with my keys which could cause damage over time. So far using it this way I feel a little safer and the connector ends are protected. If Kingson designed this device with some kind of a protective end I would give it five stars. I use the device on a weekly basis and all in all I am not unhappy since the device has proven to be very reliable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game it was the best game. good game it was fun .this was a fun game did there. wish they would make more
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|This review is for the guys from a guys perspective:<br /><br />The story is about a dude who's bored (Richard Gere) and starts Ballroom Dancing because he sees a hot chick looking outside her dance studio window while he is on his way home on the train.  Of course he never tells anyone including his wife.  He discovers one of his office mates Ballroom Dances and it becomes their secret.<br /><br />The initial reason he takes up Ballroom Dancing is because he is bored with his life, his job, his wife, his kids.  HE sees a hot chick and is intrigued.<br /><br />His wife thinks something funny is up and ends up tracking him down to a Dance contest where she surprises him with daughter in tow.<br /><br />In the end of the movie he dances with her and tells her he doesn't want to dance with anyone else... boo hoo violins in the background.<br /><br />Had the hot Ballroom Instructor (Jennifer Lopez) given him a chance, he would have nailed her like a highschool kid in heat!<br /><br />But alas, your chick will think it's romantic because he ends up dancing with his wife at the end of the movie.<br /><br />It's like at the end of Pretty Woman where the Hooker rides off into the sunset with the Rich good looking dude. Pure Fantasy!  And how is a Rick good looking dude hooking up with a Hooker romantic in the first place?<br /><br />As with Pretty Woman, this one is bearable and you won't want to kill yourself afterwards.<br /><br />If you play your cards right, you could dance your way into your ladies heart...<br /><br />Chicks...  SMH
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this was a good game but some of the games we a little challenge like the frog game and its also hard to earn money for new games.
0312641893|4.0|Cinder, a cyborg mechanic with an unknown past, lives with a step-mother who not only resents and hates her but also blames her for her daughter having the plague.  With all of this stacked against her it's no surprise that Cinder is volunteered for experiments against her will.  The bright side of this dismal plot is the handsome prince who cannot possibly fall in love with a cyborg citizen.  To complicate matters further; their world is in danger and Cinder must uncover the truth of her past to save them all.  This is definitely an original take on a timeless fairy tale.  Cinder is a strong heroine as well as a strong character.  She was the only character that I felt like I got a good feel for unfortunately.  I appreciate a good villain and they could have been stronger.  There is a good amount of action which is a positive, but I felt the pacing was on the slow side and didn't quite match up.  Overall I liked it and will watch for future installments. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the retelling of fairy tales, appreciates a strong heroine, or is just looking for a fun read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good for passing time or when your bord. but good good good good. good good good good good a good game
B000BW7QX6|5.0|love have watched it 3 times now since i got it :) works fine sounds and picture are grand ^^ i will so buy from this seller again
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is amazing. it has plenty of translations to choose from and even free devotionals!!!  it is awesome!!!!!!! '
B0001DI0FI|5.0|From the look of it most reviews here are of the male persuasion. Let me state that I am a long time movie fan, have a large select library of movies and books, and feel the movie industry is letting us down generally. NOT HERE. Master and Commander is, I feel, Peter Weir's best effort and holds its own against Gregory Peck's Moby Dick as a historically accurate portrayal of the rigors of 1805 Naval life and battles. No detail is overlooked in superstition, man overboard, loss of life and limb,discipline by flogging, and the range of education/lack thereof within the crew. The acting is wonderful and the second disc fascinating showing how they did it all making the film.You feel the ship move, smell the smoke in battle, and feel the sea air as they climb the rigging. WOW.    I was happily surprised by the use of classical music and the wonderful score done by Iva Davies,Christopher Gordon, and Richard Tognetti, Australian composers. This score is a true character in this movie used during the montages of daily shipboard duties, evading attack into the fogbank,beating to quarters,battles, and burial procedures. Wonderful treatment and SO important!  The relationship between the two main male characters, the captain(Russell Crowe)and the ship's Doctor (Paul Bettany) is elevated by the fact they play stringed instuments well together and share that as a much needed outlet in the hardships,boredom, and terror of their life at sea.The final scene of Captain and Doctor playing a memorable piece as the ship turns about..WONDERFUL! This is definitely a GUY flick that most women can appreciate..just sit and let it flow over you!
B004XNGKBS|3.0|This is a great app except for one thing. It lacks the option of creating a note with multiple pages, a serious flaw. I would gladly give it 5 stars if it had this feature. Creating folders and sub folders would also be a great asset. Overall, this is good for writing quick information, but otherwise it is very limited.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|I bought this hoping that it would pick up the magic of the 80's.  It sure as hell did.  All I need now is my 85 Camaro, a leather jacket, and a chick from Jersey with big hair.
0073398101|5.0|I was not looking forward to going into AE 202 (Low Speed Aerodynamics) at Georgia Tech.  I was expecting hard work and confusion and, at first, that's exactly what I got.  I was completely lost; that is until I started reading this book more carefully.  I was scared going into the first test, but I started studying and re-reading the first few sections, and everything became as clear as day.  I went through the same process for the second test, and by the final I felt like I was a master of incompressible flow, entirely thanks to this book.<br />Make no mistake, though, this book covers flows in the entire range of Mach numbers.  I skimmed through chapters on supersonic and even hypersonic flow, and I was more than impressed.  The book explains the fundamental science behind fluid flow, as well as applications to aerospace vehicles.<br />While my professor went away from this book to treat viscous flows, I found these chapters to be more than helpful.  Since it is just an introductory book, it only treats a subset of flow solutions, like Couette flow and Blasius solutions, but it does provide enough references to guide you towards more advanced concepts.  Because of this book, I now have a keen interest in aerodynamics.  I highly recommend it for any aerospace or mechanical engineer, or any scientific mind who want to learn more about the fundamentals of fluid flow.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Missile Defender is a great game and is.super addicting! Get it today for free otherwise it's well.worth the 99 cents!
B003L77G8I|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Bones for a while now, and this season doesn't disappoint.  Following the reunion of the Jeffersonian forensics lab after a brief hiatus, this season treats such issues as the Booth-Bones relationship, Max Keenan, various on-off romances, and the Gravedigger.  there are plenty of new, fresh cases to solve.  This show is never dull, and always keeps you on edge.  I won't say it's one of the best seasons, because they are all so amazing, but I will say it is well worth watching if you are a fan of the show.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|book of acts is almost impossible to put down. extremely well written, captivates the imagination from beginning to end. amazing literary skills that allow the reader to understand and imagine exactly where he was during every step of his fantastic journey. if you are thinking of getting just 1 book, make sure its this one, YOU WILL LOVE IT! ;))
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I really enjoy playing Missle Defender. The game plays great on my tablet. The touch screen controls are flawless. You will never miss a shot due to lack of control. The graphics are nice too look at but a little plain overall. The sound could use some improvement as there is no music during gameplay and most of the sound effects that are there are just blips, bleeps and small explosions. The developer may have designed it this way to maintain the authentic retro feel but it would be nice to have some updated sounds and music. The game does start out a little too easy and it isnt until you reach the 9th or 10th stage where the game offers some challenge. After each round based on how well you did you will earn points that can be used to upgrade your weapons. I really liked this touch and it does add some depth to the game.<br /><br />Overall this is a 4 star game for me and I think just about everyone can have some real fun playing this game.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Clean graphics, fun, addicting, and overall well put together game. Great nostalgia with a new twist on a classic game. Love the trees.
0345522478|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have the next two and look forward to reading them. I loved the story and humor. I liked the way the author used contemporary references ie. Kill Bill and South Park, to lighten the mood in the book. I love Oberon he definitely doesn't behave or think Ike a typical dog, I hope or they may soon take over. I highly recommend this book when you read it you will want to collect the rest of the series.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|good but it annoys you every time you play until you review it. but free so can not complain too much
B005WY8YZW|5.0|I gave this CD as a gift and they loved it. The product arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game works on the Google TV.Just use the mouse pad and button to protect your city from the missiles.I just wish more games like this were available for the Google TV
B004G8QHKO|5.0|I listen to a lot of different genres (alt,electronic, classic rock etc);  this is my favorite album of the past year.  Best song, IMO, is Punching in a Dream;  this song is simply fantastic.  Both the lead vocalists are outstanding. Reminds me a little of MGMT's first album but they have their own unique sound. Pretty much the whole album is great (not just the singles).  There are a couple of songs I don't care for but the rest is so awesome, it still gets 5 stars in my book.  I saw them live recently & they were great.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|really wonderful game from start to finish this game is a lot of fun you can get very hooked into it I love this game
B005DOKK7Q|2.0|Too expensive for its use, it's nothing more than a holder for your Kindle. It's not even big enough to hold the stylus inside, which is real handy because the Kindle Fire advances too fast or not at all using your fingers. The fingers also smudge the screen, but the stylus keeps it clean. Useless as far as I'm concerned, I'm not using it, bought something else to hold the Kindle.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is the best. I was in youth group the other day and we were looking for a verse and no one could remember where it was. I was the first to find it because of the apps search feature
B005XQLBU4|4.0|a great rework of a classic game. the touch screen controls are a great way to play. Atari would be proud.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Don't expect to be blown away by any of the mini games contained within this. That being said, if you HAVE to just unlock everything then you will be busy for hours on end trying to earn pts to unlock the next game.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My thought was to have something a little bit bigger than my iPhone for email and web browsing at home and most importantly when I travel without packing a laptop. The Fire has hit that mark 100% and impressed with how easy it is to navigate the device.   I love it and think it is a great value!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|ADDICTING WILL PLAY IT FOR HOURS. WHEN I HAVE JUST A LITTLE SLACK TIME IT IS A GREAT GAME TO JUNP IN AND KEEP YOUR MIND GOING, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF NEEDED YOU CAN CLOSE IT AND COME BBACK LATER AT THE SAME PLACE YOU STOPPED.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|totally worth it, I was addicted from the first round. I loved the classic, this version adds new twists and features that keep you coming back for more.
B0000A5BSW|5.0|This is one of my brother's favorite movies -- he really enjoys it and I was happy to see it offered for purchase for him.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was super good. I love this app and I can barely keep my eyes off of it. My favorite game is sushi
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its got quick fun games that can help kill some time. you unlock games as you go which gives you a reason to keep playing but can be a pain
B005RYF5JA|3.0|Can we get blu-ray already. If everyone had crappy TV's this would be great but this is the age of High Definition.  5 Stars for content  1 star for presenting it on a 15 year old medium
B002VR9QXW|5.0|First, I wish to thank other reviewers for having recommended this so highly.  Based on those reviews, I purchased and watched, and glad that I did.    I was initially hesitant to buy this because a couple of other reviewers mentioned some disturbing, rude coughing audible during the second act. But, I heard no coughing whatsoever.  I have a pretty high-end sound system and watched at full room volume, so feel I would have noticed the coughing, if it had been present. I was listening using the 5.1 surround mode.  Don't know if there might be a difference if I had used stereo.  Is it possible that the engineers who produced this were able to re-mix and eliminate the problem?  Don't know.  All I know is that the disc I received had no problems.    Special note should also be given to the dancing of Jozef Vargo.  There is a tendency to focus on the dancing of Giselle herself, to the exclusion of Albrecht.  Tsygankova's Giselle is superb in interpretation, with a light, weightless, delicacy of dancing that is wonderful to watch.  But don't ignore Vargo.  He also exhibits a weightless, delicacy of dancing to match Gidelle's with a caring, gentle, supportive demeanor that I found very appealing. In summary, this new blu-ray version with Tsygankova and Varga at the Dutch National Opera is a step above other performances I've seen, a true masterpiece of chemistry, artistic sensitivity and technical virtuosity.  Superb, just about perfect filming and editing as well.  Thanks to all who recommended!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Kingdom of Heaven is the story of a French ironworker in early 12th century Europe who heads to the Levant to find redemption. What he finds when he arrives is nothing that he expected (or could expect) and the movie is the story of the personal and social challenges of the era. It certainly has a number of messages it attempts to make--both overt and sublime--and we may find that we don't agree with everything the movie has to say. But its almost impossible not to be impressed and intrigued with what we see in the story. It's a story that makes us think, and it's also a story that helps us learn a critical piece of history. It's a story that entertains. It's a grand work made accessible to nearly anyone. And it's a story that will likely leave you wishing to learn more.<br /><br />Kingdom of Heaven is a panoramic epic, eminently suited to the enlarged vistas of the super wide screen. It shows its best with huge, wide landscapes of cities, troops, and landscapes, and proceeds to fill them with color, detail, and power. It is a lushly filmed piece that finds its best home in the Blu-Ray format, which alone to date is able to present in the home setting the original intent of the film's look. It is gorgeous to view, with so much detail and visual activity in each scene that it will take multiple viewings to take it all in. There are few films that are as visually beautiful as this one.<br /><br />Further contributing to the experience, the Blu-Ray edition of the movie comes with lossless, 5.1 audio. This means that, if you have a home studio system, you will experience a superior audio presentation, but even two channel (stereo) systems will provide a much more clear and powerful soundtrack. This is a good thing, because the musical composition of the piece is hauntingly beautiful. It's a multimedia experience when coupled with the high definition video of Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Of course, directing and acting in the movie is first rate. There is little to be desired in the execution of the film, although some will say that the director's cut in the Blu-Ray format, at over three hours, is way too long. It's a valid point, and it's the same one that was made against The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. But in both these cases, the director and the story have a lot to say, and I would venture to bet that few will regret the time spent (on either work). Here, the story is much more complicated than GBU, and it can also be said that a little knowledge of history would be helpful to understand the story. But every possible support is built into the film so that anyone can follow.<br /><br />An amazing work on virtually any measure, learn some history while enjoying the story.though some will say that the director's cut in the Blu-Ray format, at over three hours, is way too long.

B003B02PEU|4.0|One of Grisham's best I'd say. The author capitalized on what he does best, that's the legal part, then added a lot of heart to it.  It combines the thrill and drama of the scenes in the courtroom with the heart and soul and lives of its many colorful characters.  The story spans a decade, the 70's, a period of transformation and awakening, especially in the deep south.  It talks about taking risks, commitment, growing up.  It demonstrates the power of the written word.  It relates how true friendship can break barriers.  All of these, Mr. Grisham cooked up, and peppered it with the legal excitement that he's become a master of, and the result is just very tasteful.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good free app! It would be more better for me if I can figure out how to get the upgrades to get the more cool enhancements that is in the game but overall the game can be fun to play!
B001AFF25W|2.0|The authors personal story is full of inconsistencies.  It is difficult to read the book beyond statements that are either lies or errors.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great Bible, easy to navigate! I can search for words and find several scriptures relating to those words! I also love their Bible plans.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game play is only okay for many of the games.  you get what you pay for in this case.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game works flawlessly on the kindle fire and its so addictive. What more can you ask for? It's already free today but depending on the price normally I may have hypothetically paid for it had I known it was this much fun.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As a cat person, I was not expecting to love a book about dog spirituality and reincarnation, but this book touched me deeply. It is beautifully written and made me rethink the soulful look I have seen in the eyes of certain dogs I have known. Read it!
B005XQLBU4|1.0|BAD GAME do not get it. very very VERY stupid worst game ever created big waste of my time do not get it
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|After blasting through The Hunger Games and Catching Fire in days (or less), I was surprised to find myself dragging through this book. The first 3/4 of the book was not exciting and, at times, flat out boring. The last 1/4 of the book isn't so bad and the conclusion is satisfactory.  All in all, I felt this book severely lacked the imagination and excitement of the first two books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the last book I thought I would enjoy based on the futuristic theme of the book.  I thought this may be a book men would more likely enjoy due to the violence.  However, after persuasion by many friends, I downloaded it to my Kindle app on my phone.  I loved this book. It was well written, exciting, and insightful.  Not to mention suspensful. I'll be downloading the next two in the series today.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game seems pretty cool so.far. I am writing this review for points though. so far I enjoy it though!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Quick, easy to play clone of the 1980's classic.  New features include upgradeable missiles, nukes. trees, and improved graphics.  Missing are orbiting satellites and bombers. The touch control is perfect and makes this game much easier to play than the original.  That is the only problem with the game.  It's too easy.  My first game I got up to level 20 before I lost A city or tree.  After another few levels I got bored and let my cities all get nuked so I could get finished to see what the ending sequence looked like. The ending sequence is a bit of a disappointment and lacks the panache of the original.  Overall a very nice game.
0525478817|5.0|It has been a long time since I read a book in one sitting, but I COULD NOT put TFIOS down. One page you're bawling, the next you're falling off your bed laughing.<br /><br />I don't know if this book is a true portrayal of what it is like to live with cancer, but as someone who lost someone I truly loved to cancer, it absolutely speaks to my experience.<br /><br />The only bad part about this book? My \\"J-Scribble\\" was in red - also no hanklerfish! :[ If the worst part of the book is that the author did not sign it in a color that I find particularly pleasing to the eyes - well then - that speaks volumes about how ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT this novel truly is.
B0062P3392|4.0|With a cast that includes Jason Statham, Clive Owen and Robert DeNiro you would expect an exceptional film. It is a good film, filled with action.<br /><br />This film is said to be based on fact and not fiction. It is far fetched in some ways, but with the recent assassination of a scientist in Iran, presumably by the Israelis or the CIA, I find it more believable. Two teams of ex-SAS men are trying to kill each other. Or, at least, Jason Statham, has been asked to kill four ex-SAS men, and to make it look like an accident. He agrees to this mission to save the life of his mentor, played by Robert De Niro. Clive Owen, is from a group of men called the 'Feather Men' who are hired to protect ex-SAS men from retribution. A little convoluted, but all in all simple to follow. Each team has become hired killers after their stints in the SAS, and this is not a game for amateurs. De Niro is being held hostage by a sheik in Oman. Statham travels all over th eworld to hunt for his prey. He has a team that is first rate, and some of the action is complicated and breath taking. What holds this film together are the characters and the plot. We can see the action in many films, but the plot and the acting here are superb.  All of the killers realize it is their professionalism that keeps them going. Face to face combat and high technology are all a part of this play.<br /><br />I liked this film, and as a spy novel/film afficianado, much of it seemed realistic. Of course, the director/writer took liberites, but that is necessary in this type of film. There is a little bit of love interest, and that creates a huge problem for one of the men,. The rest of the teams do not mention family, and it would seem in this kind of world, loners would be the best killers. I would have expected this film to do much better at the box office. I only heard about it once it was on DVD, and I wonder about the back story.<br /><br />Recommended.  prisrob 01-14-12<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0052OWGYW The Mechanic]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000IZUHNM Bent]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000I62JBE The Score]][ASIN:B000I62JBE The Score]]

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great update to the original... Watch out those missiles move faster after each level... Don't let the first few levels fool you.  Had a &quot;blast&quot; ;) great free app of the day! A must have... Especially if you remember the original!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I should have better things to do with my time than play ( and rate) this game. Thanks for listening.
1594202842|1.0|I was appalled by this book, not only by the racism and ego-centricity of the mother, but by her compulsive, controlling behavior.  I'm a mother, too.  My son was #1 in his high school graduating class, won first prize in a local art competition, was a Science Olympiad winner and a debater who made it to Nationals. He did those things with our encouragement, but I never screamed like Amy Chu or had other temper tantrums to make him perform.  The rules were set and they were fairly strict, and he knew the rules and, for the most part, went along with them because they were reasonable.  One summer when he was 9 or 10, he learned the names of Western birds, their Latin names, their bird calls and habits -totally on his own.  He won Science Fair with that.  My husband and I were working (real jobs where you're there from 8:30 to 5:30 or later).  I occasionally asked my son about homework but it was always done, unless he wanted me to edit a long paper he had written, and then we would discuss my suggestions for slight changes in wording or grammar.    My son is hardly the only American child who's a high achiever or who is well-disciplined.  His friends were equally motivated.  But he's a great person whom I respect, and there's not much I would change about his childhood.  We didn't have the luxury of annual trips around the world, but he's doing that now on his own with money he's earned, and he's enjoying it and learning from it.  I didn't have to orchestrate every moment of his waking life.  What Chua's daughters achieved seemed to be more for their mother's ego.  I don't understand how humiliating a child in public makes them a better person.  They will learn about winning and losing just by living, and no one is #1 in every aspect of their life.  Her children may perform music, but they'll never compose it.  It's unlikely they'll ever do anything creative because to be creative, you have to be able to fail and learn from it.  Ny son's friends are a mixed bag racially and culturally, as well as from various countries, and I don't care what race his wife will be.  He dates young women of every race.  But this is the second time I've run into Asian prejudice against Caucasians despite both women marrying Caucasians and raising their children in this country.  If they really hate the American way, they should go back to China and stay there.  I'll buy the ticket!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|This game is cool and I love it they should make another part to it blah blah blah blah. blah
B005CA4SJW|2.0|Characters are dull.  Their motivation makes no sense most of the time.  They constantly bicker for no reason other than to fill time.  The zombies make no sense.  The rules of contamination are unclear and keep being broken.  The capabilities of zombies keep changing.¨  The series is heavily doused in estrogen, in an attempt to attract fenale viewers. Do we need romance and intrigue in a zombie movie?  We have the irritating stereotypes again, most notably the white redneck. But then we have Mexicans who only look like criminals but are in fact decent hospital staff. Some people cringed I am sure, and wondered if some p.c. staff edited the script before they started shooting.  Oh, and how do you put the main character inside a TANK surrounded by zombies and not have him drive it and mow them down with machine guns? What a waste of what could have been the greatest scene in the history of zombie movies...  Final verdict:   This series is mainly frustrating, but it has some good action as well and some pretty good zombies. I sugest that you watch it while doing the washing up or something, so you can do your housework during the dull scenes and concentrate on the ones with action. You won't miss anything, every single round of bickering is identical, with the same characters saying the same things over and over again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app so many features. You can create a profile, highlight notes, start reading plans,make notes, choose which Bible version, and so much more!!! Truly the best Bible app for the kindle fire and any smart phone!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun little games with a challenge to open more. me and my kids all enjoy it. some of the games seem super hard, but most are doable.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|If you like blasting missiles away, decent graphics, and good sound effects then this is the game for you. I got up to level 25 before my &quot;game over&quot;. The game gradually gets more challenging. Kid friendly game!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I enjoyed it. similar to missle command. It is a simple pass the time type game but good non the less.
0446691437|5.0|if you sit down and read this book with a skeptical view, it will change you! Everything in this book is written in a way and broken down that is so logical, you cannot argue with it. As an artist, business man, musician, or whatever path you choose in life, it's main concept is... \\"don't let resistance get the best of you\\". What is resistance? Find the detailed explanation throughout this book!
B0063GORYU|5.0|works great, addictive game. play on my computer but now have on my fire for on the go.  what more is there?
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Simple but fun! I hope like the upgrades but it could use different weapons to mix it up. Good time easter...
B005K2Z5IA|5.0|My Grandmother gave me a kindle touch for Christmas, but being accident prone I was a little nervous to take it on the go with me until I got a case. I liked the colors of this case and so I bought it. When it arrived I was blown away by the quality of the materials and construction. I am looking at other Timbuk2 bags for my other luggage needs. Definately Recommend.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very addicting but hard to get enough points to unlock more games. I use to play the ds version of the game.
B00427X9WI|5.0|This is an excellent, thought-provoking movie. I am not typically a big Julia Roberts fan, but she's great in this one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|quick look and you know what the weather is. alerts are visable right away.  great app for people are on the go
0321704452|5.0|Loved this book!  Beautifully written, chockful of great content. A wonderful antidote to the \\"same-old-potato warmed over\\" PowerPoint presentations so many of us have sat through, and are determined to step outside that box and provide content of real value and interest for those who are honoring us with their valuable time.
0470876417|5.0|The pictures in this book along with the practical tools on the companion website enable you to put the tool and process into action immediately.  I read a couple of pages, looked at a lot of pictures, watched the canvas video on the website, and I feel ready to start using it in a planning session of around 20 people.  The fact that the book is a product of collaboration is very inspirational.
0321811984|5.0|Since another reviewer has done such a beautiful job, I won't repeat his comments, other than to say \\"Ditto!\\"<br /><br />What a wonderful resource for ideas, tools, and inspiration.  After a ten-year hiatus, I am moving from private practice to focusing on courses, workshops, and seminars.  Realizing my presentation skills were rusty, after reading Naked Design in one sitting, I came back and immediately purchased Presentation Zen (2nd Ed). as with N/D, I couldn't put it down until the last page.<br /><br />Presentation Zen gives marvelous guidance for creating truly effective and memorable presentations. As I am developing the 2012 programs, every time I open the book to clarify a point, find myself re-reading whole chapters again, and again, and picking up on another delightful nuance each time. Originally purchased the Kindle version but, as with Naked Design, decided to get the hard copy because it is one I will want to keep at hand for a long time.  Worth every penny -- and much more!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|free and a good way to pass time. there is a lot of variety and pretty easy. complete offers for more points
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This is a fun game,but your only hope to keep all the buildings safe until you get all the upgrades. If you lose a building it gets pretty pointless because you can't upgrade your own missles. Ok for a free app. I didn't immediately uninstall, so it must have some merit<br />.
0553582461|5.0|These books, after reading the 5 previously of course, for me have more than made a good story, but introduced me to someone I will undoubtedly remember my  entire life. Fitz is more than a character in a book, you are in his mind, share his good luck, bad, happy times and sad ones. You feel emotions as if you are the one experiencing everything, I wish I could find more books with the same type of in depth character relationships... I don't know if i will. If you are someone thinking about picking up assassin's apprentice. Do it, you will thank me later.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|I am not a motorcycle rider, but this is the most powerful show on TV.  I only wish the season was longer as I can't stand having to wait so long to see what happens next.  If you haven't watched this series, do yourself a favor and start with season 1.  Once you start you too will be hooked.  Bring on season 5!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over again.  It is action packed and a good watch for everyone.  It is a thrill a minute.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|First of all, this game is super boring Second, when I shoot the missile it doesn't even hit the enemy missile no matter what Third, It doesn't have any story line to it I would recommend not getting this game ever.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good app for killing time in class. easy gameplay. and have had no glitches. and has a lot of options and different game options for play.
0439023513|2.0|While I really loved the first two books in the trilogy, I have to say this one was disappointing. This one took longer to get absorbed into, and by the time I got into it, I was more just wanting to finish the story to be done with it. The last third of the book is what really turned me off. Considering the masterful way the other two books ended, the ending of 'Mockingjay' was even more disappointing.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you've read the first two, you'll have to read this one, but don't expect the same strength of the story or characters. While the first book was a fantastic story of human nature and survival, 'Mockingjay' felt like playing a video game with lame action sequences that really did little to develop the characters.
B005UT29Z0|3.0|This was a good movie. It has a lot of character interactions, and makes one think about the ethics and what is right and wrong.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it. it has a lot of different features to.planners and also translation. I truly thank God for this app
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is so cool I like it alot so so so cool I am 13 so so so so so so cool
B006JPS1OM|3.0|I haven't yet played it but all I know is that its taking a real long time to download I stared downloading it at 9:15 and right now it is about 9:36
B004SDEP38|5.0|I have purchased several of these type apps trying to open and work on a 800 mb spreadsheet. This did it first time and works every time on my Acer honeycomb tablet.And the best part of it was a Amazon Daily Free App.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a good game for passing time! can't go wrong with original solitaire. like the options that go with it too.
0525478817|5.0|This is the first book by John Green that I've read and i was blown away, writing was superb and i will enjoy his other books i have no doubt.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it it just takes to much time to build up points. but I really like it. its good.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Great album, great concert! Adele as she really is (including hair curlers and pins). Instead of a sad (as I expected) concert, this is amusing and very funny. Which shows that Adele beyond her great voice and incredible touching songs, also is very smart and has a great sense of humor.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like all the fun games but I didn't really like having to unlock them all and then the update deleted all of my progress
B005K17RU0|5.0|Trouble-free installation on Kindle fire. Easiest weather app, by far. Love the always-on feature that puts weather just one click away at the top of the screen.
B005JU5JTI|1.0|I like comedies so I saw the previews for this movie once or twice and thought it looked interesting. But I never saw them again. So my grandmother told me that she thinks that this movie bombed. So I went on Amazon and I saw the reviews! YIKES!! There were more bad reviews than good reviews. But I still wanted to see it to decide hmm... is it as bad as what everyone on Amazon said it was? It turns out IT WAS EVEN WORSE!!! I mean we have this lazy, goldigging, trashy woman played by Cameron Diaz whose rich fiance dumps her, with the help of his mother, because they figure her out as a golddigger. Shes also kicked out of her fiance's house and with no where else to go and with no money to get a boob job she met a guy on Craigslist and shes currently living with him and you guessed it, GETS A JOB AS A TEACHER!!! This movie is rated R so if you're thinking of showing this to your children ages 13 and under I suggest you don't! We have Cameron Diaz dry humping a male teacher played by Justin Timberlake. And she is shown wearing provacative clothing at a car wash. WAIT FOR IT IT GETS WORSE!!! At this carwash you also see a boy having an erection when he sees his teacher in \\"SEXY CLOTHING\\" at this carwash. SPOLIER ALERTS AFTER THIS POINT-- In the end we have Cameron Diaz dump Justin Timberlake and get with the gym teacher that she basically treats like garbage through out the film AND WAIT FOR IT.... since she's no longer a teacher she works as a guidance counsler AT THE SAME SCHOOL!!! The END!!! This movie is disrespectful to teachers everywhere! But this would be a good movie to show to bad teachers so they learn WHAT NOT TO DO to be worse teachers than they already are!<br /><br />Acting:F<br />Comedy: There was NOTHING funny about it!<br />Plot:F-<br />Movie overall A BIG FAT FAILURE!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool appppp. I recommend it. its so addicted to play so fun. vjgug xtdtdyj kbohohob fhfyf yfugj hfydf hfugj cgfufu jvjv... get it!
B005HSL626|4.0|great game the best Eva but not as fun as the upgrade and 2 many ads but still my sis and brow liv this game
B004RJMUJO|5.0|the paid version is great, but I am going to list the pros and (very few)  cons.  pros: no ads good unlocks very addictive who doesn't like to cut up an endless gauntlet of fruit!!??  cons: some (minor)  lag spells, mostly during instillations and updates on the kindle some acheivements are hard to get and might frustrate you they make you join feint, because without it you see hints that without feint, the game is &quot;worthless &quot;  other than those few cons, this app is fantastic and deserves 5 out of 5 stars
B005XQLBU4|5.0|you must upgrade your town quickly or else the missles will be too much to handle made it 30 nights on my first try. unbelievably fun!!!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I have read all five of the \\"Fire and Ice\\" books and have become disenchanted with each new publishing.  As a reader I expect each book to claim a specific issue, dance around that issue with characters and action then resolve it by the end of the book.  None of these books have done that...  instead it seems that they are written as a TV series leaving all of the principle characters hanging in limbo to be brought back at the whim of the author.<br /><br />There is a lot of 'fluff' used as filler, for example,  how many times do I need to read about the colors of the banners of all the folks who are involved in the upcoming battle.  I accept the idea that each book will need to revisit some of the action from the previous books in order to maintain continuity but there is a point at which the reader's brain will just glaze over trying to get past the mountain of words that have little bearing on the story.  It is very difficult reading when you must sift through all of this just to get to the meat, and disappointing to learn that at the end of book five nothing has been resolved.<br /><br />I doubt that I will continue with this author.
630575067X|5.0|The VHS version is the only real version that the Dark Side has not gotten their hands on. The DVD is full of filthy lies that the Siths want you to believe.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|I waited for this movie to come to Richmond, Va. I didn't, much to my dismay & disappointment. I invited both my daughters, who hadn't read or seen this movie, in any form, to watch it with me.<br />  A spectacular, stunning display of wonder unfolded before our eyes. Even the proper use of the English language was not a barrier for my daughters, to understand this play of the master, Shakespeare. The music was otherworldly, transporting the spirit, as the story came alive, weaving its magic before our eyes.<br />  For me, this will be the role of a lifetime for Helen Mirren. She brought to life the gifted sorceress. Her acting was bold and powerful, and at the right moments, soft & tender. Her magical spirit Uriel was played to perfection by Ben Whishaw.<br />  See this movie! You won't be disappointed, but be struck by its beauty and power, to lift your spirit also to soar.
B000VBIEXS|1.0|I'll agree with other reviews in that this is one of the most butchered remasters I've heard. Maybe the good mastering engineers just aren't around anymore. Overcompressed, overEQ'd, thin.
B0059XTUO0|5.0|What I mean by \\"in the movie\\" is because if you ever seen a B&W movie showing a scene in a movie theater, how the light and shadows of the people watching it is scene, it felt like I was there.  I saw this movie at the Arc Light theater in Hollywood, and almost all people are adults.  So like in the old times when most of the theaters customers where adults, it just gave this atmosphere that you where part of a B&W movie scene.  But the movie was great, some funny parts with some serious parts also.  I also loved how they stuck with the 4:3 aspect ratio for the movie to give it a the authentic feel to it.  I'm not very good at doing reviews, but if you think this movie peeks your interest, do your self a favor and see it in the nearest theater if you can.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|nice game that doesn't require a lot of levels or complex gaming. very easy to learn &amp; will be playing again
B005XQLBU4|5.0|missile command or whatevwr they're calling this one deserved the magic of touch.  nice revisiting of a classic.  enough upgrades to make it new, but not so many that it gets away from the original concept.
0525478817|5.0|There was nothing about this book which wasn't beautiful and striking and heart string pulling.  There were parts that made me laugh and parts that made me cry.  This book was so perfectly set up and so perfect in every respect that I cannot give it any less than five stars and I can't express how much this book sucked me in and wouldn't let go as I rode a roller coaster that only went up
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game was and is outstanding.  but I dislike the fact that you have to earn coins to unlock games.
006113127X|3.0|I read this book in the course of a weekend.  It has no plot, no suspence, no symbolism, and offers to solutions to life's most vexing questions.  That being said, it's a fun read.  If you like reading about drinking, whoring, and fighting, you'll have to give it one more star.  I like these themes in moderation-- hence the three star rating.  I've read three of Bukowski's books and I think this one is almost as good as Post Office.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved this game... it was Is so much fun to pass the time with. but the update erased all of my data.
B0055SWM08|5.0|cool game yo. I like it very much I like to get perfect on LLC the levels cuz I'm really good
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are so much fun! I literally spend hours playing them!! I highly reccomend them to everyone! love it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I had a lot of fun playing this game.  the controls work well and its cool how you can build your buildings back up and make the missiles more effective.  Definitely worth a try I say.
B0055SWM08|5.0|the music is nice, and it is aesthetically very pleasing, which is nice because the challenges can get frustrating when you dont figure it out right away. worth the dollar.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I caught BB last year when AMC was running all three seasons prior to the start of Season 4. I recorded a few of them from Season 1. I watched the first one and knew this is going to be a great show. I recorded all of the 3 seasons but didn't have time to watch any of them at that time. Feeling under the weather one weekend I decided to start watching the series and was addicted like Jessie and friends were addicted to meth. Every show is better than the one before it and each Season it gets better than the last. Genius show all the way around from the writers to the producers and the actors who truly become their characters and play them brilliantly. I have watched shows like Sopranos Six Feet Under Deadwood Dexter and they were great shows up to a point. BB blows them all away and as much as I like to watch the show I think it's very clever planning this show for only 5 seasons. It will end as great as it began so you can't say I watched until like the 7th season and wasn't that good anymore. This is the only TV show I have purchased and have also told people no when they asked  to borrow it. I am still too addicted to share it with anyone;)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I bought this on my Supernova tablet and it plays great. Very fun and and addictive. Awesome strategy game!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|addictive game play and very challenging.  for a game as simply as this I was very surprised. at how much fun I had.  bravo for the company that created this game.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is exactly what it says. Downloaded videos to the app to play locally without an Internet connection. works great!

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It is a great stress reliever and it is easy to use. I highly recommend it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun and fast paced. highly addictive. really best played with HTC pen, makes it much easier to be accurate. fun
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this was a free download. no complaints. same play as missile command an eighties arcade game. plays great on my kindle fire. good work.
B004LWZW4W|2.0|There are some big ideas in this film about science, ethics and money that are interesting. But that's it. Ideas. And a movie needs more than ideas in order to touch us. It needs emotion. \\"Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes\\" has none of it. I was left cold. Never did i care about any of the characters who were devoided of all depths. They were unidimensional and walking cliches. Their actions and their dialogues served only one purpose: to make the story go forward. I was only curious about how this all came to be, this ruling of the Earth by the apes. A scientist blinded by his father's illness tests a new discovery on apes. The animals become intelligent and the new discovery kills almost everybody on the planet, thus enabling the apes to rule it. The film could have lasted 20 minutes and that would have been more exciting. There is a reason why there's been a lot of movies about these talking apes but never one explaining how it all started: it's not that interesting. Not for two hours. And you can talk all you want about the quality of the special effects but i never bought the character of Ceasar in the first place. He always looked fake to me. Always. And how am i supose to care for the hero when i know ultimately that his experiment will fail and cause the end of civilization? At one point in the film, we get a glimpse of astronauts going to Mars and even getting lost in space. That was even more interresting than the story of the apes itself! I'm guessing without being an expert about this franchise that a possible sequel would involve these astronauts coming back to Earth and being up for one gigantic surprise! Now that's the movie i want to see. That's the movie they should have done. And this here movie, this \\"Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes\\" could have been a 5 minutes intro for that movie.
B000VKW7AK|5.0|This is the best box set i have ever owned. Now i can say the only thing that sucks about this collection is it has only 5 discs. To my man Dave i need more. Never stop kicking' my a**! Buy this you will.
B000CC1U0U|5.0|Product was great just as advertised def doing business again Thanks man woohoo I'm lovin it baby!! Woop woop beep beep
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The app works great. Sometimes when trying to type words that it doesn't know it can be agitating. But I still love it. :-)
B0018M6J90|5.0|It is a wonderful movie. You could call it a chick flick, but a lot of men will like it too.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun, easy to play and addictive. Good download. Hours of shooting fun. Much better than the Atari version on the other apps.
B006JCC1GO|1.0|this app sucks if u want a piano app get little piano plus y would u get that both those games suck bad. get a cool app
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a game if you are board and want to waste some time but it gets kind of boring after a couple of tries to beat a mini game.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I would totally recommend this app to anyone. I have really enjoyed it on my kindle fire. the best part is that its free. I will be purchasing this once the trial is up.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is the best free app there is on the kindle fire. You have to get this you will have so much fun that it will seem a couple minutes passed but really a couple hours.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|get this game and you wont regret it!! it has 117 game in all! and its free! I love it!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The way it is organized, the devotionals that are included, and all the different translations of the Bible make this app a must!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|game installed without a problem on my toshiba thrive tablet. definitely fun to play. I like the idea of the upgrades - blast range, missile speed, etc. Very nice twist on a clasic game. Job well done, Epic Pixel!!!!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This movie came out when I was a kid, and it's always been one of my favorites. I'm so glad they left out the \\"extra\\" song added a few years ago - that was really crap. But this one is just like the original movie, but now in blu-ray, so it's the perfect combo!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game rocks. You can play whatever minigame you want and you earn points to unlock others. I recommend this to anyone who has boredom issues.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|kills lots of time. sometimes a bit frustrating, but fun overall. lots of ads, but I kind of like that you have to earn points to unlock games. makes it interesting.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|the game is glitchy, has a hard time functioning on the kindle fire. has no clear way to shut down the game.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this is stupid. dont get it. waste of space. waste of time. boring and the ads really blow. it is no good and very boring.
B003NTMREM|2.0|This is the keystone cops meet pornography.  And yes, the second episode is softcore porn.  This isn't moralizing, it's noticing the obvious.  In one of the episodes, no less than three of their team members have guns on the bad guys and they STILL get disarmed by their own incompetence (namely, one of the characters is having a conscience issue with shooting a self proclaimed mass murderer).  The dialogue is idiotic and the plots are what you'd expect from a 6th grade sci fi fan (I'm thinking like beevus and butthead, \\"heh, heh, let's make a female alien who kills people with sex, heh, heh...).  If you're looking for decent sci fi, try Primeval, it's so much better.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Very cool app, would be cool if it had a woo feature. Also some options to speed up the mouse would help a lot. Other than that it works very well
B004ZT9QVQ|4.0|I was expecting this to be a lame \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" rip off episode.  Well, it is that, but it is alot more, also.  There is a fantastic plot twist and in true form, the Doctor delivers a life lesson with panache.  The best episode of this season, imho.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|really fun game, shares the inevitability of demise with classic missile defender games but not the hopelessness of it. also it was free
1599219751|4.0|\\"The Long Walk\\" combines a great story with outstanding writing and is spiced up with a dash of controversy.   First, the story: At the outset of World War II, 24-year-old Polish soldier Slavomir Rawicz is captured by Russians and sent to a Siberian gulag. The forced labor, near-starvation diet, and freezing temperatures don't sit too well with Rawicz and six of his fellow inmates and they decide they might like it better elsewhere.  They escape, and start walking -- out of Russia, through Mongolia, across the Gobi Desert, into Tibet and then over the Himalayas (in the winter, no less) into India. It's not called \\"The Long Walk\\" for nothing.   Maybe you think 4,000 miles of walking would make for a tedious story. Far from it.  As Rawicz tells it, the men battled hunger, thirst, ice, snow and severe temperatures. Time and again, they seemed on the verge of death, only to be revived by the fortunate discovery of a trickle of water in the desert, or a kind sheepherder offering a meal.  (Helpful tip: If you're crossing the Gobi Desert, a snake makes a lovely snack. OK, it's the ONLY possible snack.)  Still, not all of them make it through alive.   I've read a lot of survival stories and there are few that can match \\"The Long Walk\\" in terms of the length of the suffering endured by those involved. The only two that come to mind are the ill-fated Antarctic journey of Ernest Shackleton and the tale of Louis Zamperini, whose story of torture and abuse in Japanese prisoner of war camps in World War II is told in Laura Hillenbrand's \\"Unbroken.\\"  I was so absorbed by \\"The Long Walk\\" that I was saddened to read, after I finished, that in recent years an amateur researcher named Linda Willis found evidence suggesting that Rawicz never took this journey. The documents Willis found suggest that Rawicz did not escape, but was released as part of a general amnesty after the period when he was supposedly walking to freedom. This doesn't mean that no one did this walk -- some believeRawicz may have been told about the harrowing march by others and passed off the story as his own.  It's incredible to me that this widely read book, released in 1956 and translated into 25 languages, endured for over 50 years before these documents emerged. Why did it take so long? Rawicz died in 2004, so he can't respond.   The documents unearthed by Willis raise serious doubts, but they don't definitively disprove Rawicz's story either. My own feeling is that in the book Rawicz describes an amazing amount of detail - including some events that reflect badly on him -- for someone who supposedly wasn't there. I wonder if he did hike part of the journey, but did not cross the Himalayas. He hurries through this latter section relatively quickly and, in the book's most head-shaking assertion, claims the group saw two abominable snowmen in the mountains.   All that said, I do have to give credit to the writing: The book is first-person, but was actually ghostwritten by English newspaperman Ronald Downing, and I'm sure Downing deserves much of the credit for a story that is told crisply and clearly, while avoiding overwrought emotionalism. Downing's clear descriptions are excellent examples of how to \\"show\\" readers rather than simply tell them. For example, early in the book, Rawicz and hundreds of other prisoners are chained to trucks and marched through snow to their prison camp. Then a ferocious blizzard hits:  \\"The sky had been heavy, the clouds low and lead-gray, when we got under way soon after dawn, and the blizzard shrieked down on us two hours later. It slowed the convoy almost immediately until we were creeping along, heads well down, at only a slow shuffle. It was almost impossible to open the eyes to it. The snow packed on our matted hair and beards, coated the lorries and the taut chains, mantled the soldiers exposed to it ahead and above us, crouched forward near their whitened machine gun.\\"  With that kind of writing, the author doesn't need to tell you that it's bitterly cold, you can FEEL it.
B004Y8Y26C|5.0|You may not want the whole album, so just get these: Escape 700, Container park, Escape wavefold, Devil is in the beats (and maybe \\"Devil is in the detais\\" and \\"Hanna's theme (vocal version)\\"). The rest are not so much songs but background music for various scenes in the movie. I loved the movie, and probably half the credit goes to the music. The Chemical Brothers killed it. I'll definitely be kickin' it to these songs for a while.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not my usual genre, and it's been decades since I was a young adult, but I really enjoyed this book (borrowed during my free month of Prime included with my new Kindle Fire), and I plan to buy the rest of the trilogy. It was hard to put this book down! While the main characters are teens, this is a great book for middle grades high readers through adult.
B000FC2ROU|1.0|Extremely trite, sophomoric, flat, and boring. The connection between story lines is weak and anticlimatic. There are so many promising elements of foreshadowing that went nowhere, leaving me feeling cheated. The charcters are one-dimensional and unengaging. Very disappointed. Read Night Circus instead, if you like Magical Realism.

B00479SVBU|5.0|My car does not have an aux in option or any way to directly plug in my iphone to the sound system. I'd given up on fm transmitters after being given one that required changing the channel every few miles on the road and constantly had some level of static. The Soundfly is AMAZING. We drove from Seattle to the Oregon coast and back, listening to podcasts and music on my iphone the whole time, and never had to change the fm channel. I haven't used the SD or USB stick capabilities but I am a happy camper. Highly recommended.
B005HSL626|5.0|Totally addicting. The game premise couldn't be simpler, you slice fruit and avoid bombs. It is tons of fun. I love it. Great to play just to kill some time and relax.
159514188X|3.0|I wanted to love this book. I really, really did. Unfortunately, for me it just didn't live up to the hype. It started out strong and I found the basic premise to be very compelling. However, about halfway through the book I started getting bored. I thought some of the relationships between characters could have been more believable. I also felt like something needed to move the story along more quickly. Something really unexpected needed to happen at that halfway point, and it just didn't. All in all I thought the book was okay. Not terrible, not great. I suppose it's a good read for young adults, to help remind them of the importance of really considering the possible impact of their words and actions... although to me, that message felt a little heavy-handed.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Not a bad little game. I'm glad I went with my, &quot;what the heck&quot; moment and decided to give it a try. Thanks to the reviewer with the strategy tips to stay alive longer.

B005974CNA|5.0|Okay, what am I going to say that everyone else has not?  Well, I'm a drummer and the highlight of the year sometimes is finding awesome drumming in the latest DT release. Since they got Jordan, they've been cranking ... a new album comes out before it can finish digesting the previous and it's always way above par in virtuosity, and every album has a different character than the one before. Well this one is definitely different, and mostly because of the new drummer.   MP has been my drummer hero since I was 18, and the thought of him leaving the band was stunning but I think I was actually ready to embrace the change.  Judging by his DVD's and side projects, it seemed like he was going through a personal mid-life crisis and he took everyone else along with him. I believe all the hats he wore in DT began to get too heavy and burdensome. I believe that playing with his side project bands and filling in as a drummer-only hired-gun, and going on tour with all the other guys was a welcomed vacation to him. He also lost his father, which is a devastating loss to anyone with a relationship with their dad... and obviously, he was a big stabilizing influence for him.   We ended up the leader of our favorite band desperately pining for some youthful ideal, hanging with and trying to relate to the 'cool' Metal core Roadrunner crowd. But c'mon friend, you're a man with a wife and kids! You're part of a successful and basically self-made, one-of-a-kind phenomenon in the music industry. Everybody tries to emulate DT and more specifically the way you play drums. My band was playing a concert in a park and during sound check I started noodling around and showing off. I heard a dad bring his son up behind me and he told him \\"See, he does it just like Mike Portnoy.\\" You're the reference point! Let the straight metal bands play metal and growl and drool and cary on. Leave the blast-beattin' to the guys who have given their life to the extremes! You do what made you great - be the best, be progressive, be Dream Theater! I don't want to bring the boom down on Mike too much, don't get me wrong. I'll always be into DT even without Portnoy and I'll always be a Portnoy fan even without DT.  There's my rant. So here enters Mangini. If they wanted a one-album-stand, they would have hired Virgil or Thomas. If they wanted to be extreme metal they would have brought Roddy on board. But they decided to go with Mangini - he's the perfect fit, and the one that really desired the brass ring of musicianship. Everyone else in the process just paled before him. I wish they would have included footage from the Donati and Lang jam sessions, all of them for that matter. The DVD is just a hard copy of the web movie, there is nothing new except what sounds like a studio version of one of the meter-busting riffs from the Mangini audition that plays over the menu.  As for the album, the main influences have radically shifted, Petrucci and Labrie are the centers of gravity on this one. James sings perfectly in his range and really gets to use his whole voice range. I'm not an expert on sining, but you can tell when something is forced and when a guy feels like he's racing in this groove - as in all his solo albums - this felt that natural. Jordan, of course, does his duty and belts out lines that are too fast to follow and soaks us in some brilliant ambiance. Does he really use his ipad for all that? The album does seem to be full of single note heavy stuff played on Petrucci's 7 - which is fine by me - because inevitably the guitar work is heavy, but you know it will explode across many frets in many positions. In so many ways he outshines the keyboard leads but he's the main attraction now and he doesn't disappoint.   It's been said that the drums and the bass are not out front or very loud. But I warn you, hear them live and you'll stop complaining. I caught a show on 12/02/11 in Anaheim, CA and there was plenty of rhythm section power.  So much that Jordan's tone was struggling to be heard. In fact the songs from this album are 10 times as intense and three times as heavy live. I saw Mike Mangini as the human metronome he is with bass drums from heaven and the high-riding chinese cymbals that solve world hunger. And Lord forbid it if Myung took a dramatic pause on his bass, the air seemed to leave the room.  I do agree that this album has the same soul as Images and Words.   Basically:   On the Backs of Angels = Pull Me under; (The Whole Song Structure)  Lost not Forgotten = Under a Glass Moon; (the chorus is a dead giveaway)  Outcry = Metropolis Pt.1;(The verses, and crazy break, just sing \\"for eternity\\" at 10:49)  Breaking all Illusions = Learning to live; (Definitely. Awesome intro, odd meter bass ostinato verse 1)  So, is this a bad thing? All I can say is \\"cool, cool, cool\\" think of it as a 2011 upgrade. You have Jordan and Mangini now. Alot of us old-school fans have been wanting to get back to the basics for a while now. Most DT fans if asked will say their favorite album will be Images and Words, or M2K. This is the DT you've been waiting for, except with a heavier edge, and Since nearly all the songs are 7 minutes and up, you really get your money's worth.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I pumped a lot of quarters into Missile Command machines way back in the day, and this game captures the spirit of the original.  If Atari was to produce an updated version of this game, I imagine it would look something like this.  Definitely worth the $.99 if you missed it as FAOTD.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book surprised me - I had read some of the reviews, but wasn't initially that excited about it. But after a friend recommended it, I downloaded it.  It was overall a really good book - I think the ending for me lacked a little bit of the wow factor, but I liked how everything tied up and there were no questions left lingering.  I thoroughly enjoyed the description of the circus - it is very imaginative and I found myself closing my eyes trying to visualize the vivid descriptions.  The premise of using your senses and being open to magic was very intriguing.  I'm glad I didn't miss this one, but it's not one of my favorite books - but definitely a memorable one.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was recommended to me by a family member who usually has a very different taste in books than my norm.  I'm glad I put that aside and read the series.  The story is engaging, full of twists and turns and characters that the author was good enough to allow to be imperfect.<br /><br />Don't start this book if you have a tight schedule because you won't want to put it down until your finished and can get the next book in the series.<br /><br />In many ways this trilogy speaks to the unrest we see today in not just the U.S. but throughout the world.  Be careful who you trust!

This adapter does not work well at all, it worked perfectly for about a month, but then i started having issues where i would have to detach and reattach multiple times for it to recognize my samsung monitor. I know for a fact it wasn't my monitor or macbook pro because i bought a much BETTER adapter made my Belkin which not only recognizes my samsung monitor immediately but also gives me more options in the mac display preferences. So please, save yourself the money and buy a different cable, i recommend Belkin (works great).

0307592731|5.0|This work was a bit different that most books I have read in this particular genre, i.e. hiking books.  Over the years I have read and collected quite a number of these accounts of journeys by various individuals, for the most part from those that have traveled the Appalachian Trail.  To be frank, I have not read one of them that I did not like and despite the work being reviewed here being a bit different, I make no exception...I liked this one too.<br /><br />The potential reader should first be aware that this work does not follow the traditional formula we find in most of these books.  Yes, it is about hiking; in this case the Pacific Crest Trail but it is also a very emotional story of one persons search for themselves.  As you can see by the other reviews here, some like this, some do not.  While there were a couple of aspects of this book I personally would have done different had I written it, it is never the less Cheryl Strayed's song and sing it she did and I have to respect it.<br /><br />First let me say that this lady is a very, very good writer.  If you will not that even those that did not care for Cheryl's story all that much admits the fact that this lady can write.  That is not an issue.  As far as story telling ability and pure prose, she is equal to any in this genre and superior to most.<br /><br />This is a true story.  It is a story of a young girl who had a very rough upbringing; very poor and in ways was in a abuse situation.  The one anchor in her life was her beloved mother.  Ms. Strayed's mother died at a very young age and the emotional impact sent ripples though the author's life with rather dire consequences.  The author fully admits to having made some very poor choices in her life; cheating on her husband who she loved, becoming involved with drug use (heroine), sleeping around with completely strangers in one night stands and so on.  She does almost finish college and at a point in her life; a very low point, decides to walk the PCT on a whim.  She has had little or not hiking and back country experience and it becomes quickly apparent that this young lady is completely clueless as she begins a completely solo journey.<br /><br />Now let me state right now that I have never hiked the Pacific Crest Trail from end to end.  But I have, over the years, hiked portions here and there from the far south to the northern end.  Let me tell you that this is rough, rough country.  It is NOT for the ill prepared, inexperienced and most certainly not a trail to try to solo whether you are a man or a woman.  There is just too much complete wilderness and far too many things that can go wrong.  Folks, you can easily die out there for countless reasons.  Cheryl's journey is quite remarkable...not the brightest thing a person could do, but remarkable, never the less.<br /><br />But the hiking part is only a part of this story.  The author examines quite closely her rather troubled life and shares her thoughts with the reader.  These thoughts are quite personal - this lady did a lot of soul searching.  She examines the poor choices she has made and attempts to learn from them and confront the demons that seem to travel with her.  I personally found her candor to be quite refreshing although time and again throughout the book I wanted to reach into the pages, grab her, shake her and shout \\"what in the world were you thinking?\\"  I have a daughter the same age as Cheryl so I suppose I related to the author more as a daughter figure than anything else.  Having a son just a couple of years older than Cheryl who could be her male counter part cause me to relate to this writer on levels that made me rather uncomfortable at times.  But that was good...we all need a bit of discomfort from time to time.<br /><br />This was one of those books that once started I simply could not put down.  I feel that for some readers there may be aspects of this work that they might find a bit distasteful, i.e. her frequent references toher sexual history, but that did not bother me all that much - as I said, it was Cheryl's song so I simply let her sing it and listened.<br /><br />The book is an obvious cathartic vehicle for the author and I hope it worked for her.  I think I would be comfortable talking with her over coffee on my porch...at that is saying a lot for me.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks- as I said, it was Cheryl's song so I simply let her sing it and listened.    The book is an obvious cathartic vehicle for the author and I hope it worked for her.  I think I would be comfortable talking with her over coffee on my porch...at that is saying a lot for me.

B006QVRUS2|4.0|One boy hits another boy with a stick, but it's all four parents that really duke it out. In what seems to be an almost-too-long, dialogue-filled postage stamp of a movie, the four actors do their best to hold up what is actually a modest concept film which started life as a play. The entire story is played out in the living room of one couple, played with variable success by Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly, as they entertain, argue and ultimately throw out the other couple, played with a bit more finesse by Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz.<br /><br />Foster comes off the worst of the foursome, over-acting and seemingly struggling with getting her part to look natural. Reilly is alternately affable and clumsily angry, an easy stretch for him. Winslet is near-perfect as a spoiled commodities broker, but the real pro here is Waltz. His subtle, schmoozy-yet-sleazy low-voiced lawyer schtick is spot on and provides the anchor to what could have easily fallen into disarray.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and ignore all obvious comparisons to \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.\\" This mini-duplicate stops short of any real, serious drama and these four people's problems (and much of the acting) pale in comparison to the earlier film's premise. Loss of a child, emasculation by a whore-of-a-wife, alchohol abuse writ large, and more. There's just not as much meat on this film's bones but it's also much easier to take.<br /><br />The movie's script covers a lot of bases and the story line becomes a mini-mirror of society in a nutshell. What the two couples want to do is behave as civilly as possible and handle the mini-crisis as politely as possible. What happens in the end is the complete opposite and that in itself is a metaphor for various aspects of humanity: We want to be our best, but, unfortunately, at times devolve into our worst.<br /><br />There is some nice camera work here too, lenses are switched to near-fisheye and the camera gets shaky when the foursome get a bit tipsy on good scotch. The wide shots are filled with a perfectly dressed, &uuml;ber-smart NY apartment, complete with the statuary and artworks that any upper west-side intelligencia would possess. The apartment's only flaw happens halfway through the film, when a gastric surprise takes it down a peg. Some clever bits with art direction as well, when the camera captures action in the background or framed in mirrors depicting a duality of actions and philosophies.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad rendition of this work. I would surmise that given more time for character development or perhaps more rehearsals, Foster could have done a better job with out reaching so far for what is already in her grasp. This is a far cry from what I'm used to seeing from her, thus the reduction of one star. See it, buy it and enjoy it anyway.re filled with a perfectly dressed, über-smart NY apartment, complete with the statuary and artworks that any upper west-side intelligencia would possess.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the best books I have read in a long time and certainly the best sci-fi/futuristic book I have EVER read! I read the entire series in the course of a few days. It is completely and utterly breathtaking how Suzanne Collins has written this series. The games are intense and interesting, like an episode of Survivor in the good days. It is really fast-paced and easy to read (it's impossible to put down.) You immediately connect and sympathize with Katniss Everdeen, the brave girl who protects her sister time and time again and volunteers as a tribute for District 12. As the story unfurls, the fake romance between Peeta and Katniss will certainly tug on your heartstrings and the ending is too ragged not to immediately start reading the second book, Catching Fire, in order to find out what happens next.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|There have been so many articles, stories and forum comments written about this album, it's hard to believe that it was just released in the last several months in some type of completed form.  Let me first say that Mike Love is an idiot of the highest order for so many things, however, his obstruction and objection to the completion and release of this album back in 1967 was, without doubt, his most insane act of all.  But I don't want to put it all on Love, the other tentions such as the members of the band attempting to break away from Capitol Records to start their own record company didn't help either.<br /><br />Brian had also began having mental health issues with the strain of the project and tension in the band and record label plus the birth of his first child.  I wish the band, especially Carl and Dennis Wilson, had helped out Brian more to complete this project and bringing it to it's much anticipated and delayed release date.  Otherwise, I wish Brian had found the strength to complete the album with Van Dyke Parks and sessions musicians as he did with \\"Pet Sounds\\" (the remaining Beach Boys providing just the vocals on that masterpiece).<br /><br />I understand to a degree why there might have been reservations as \\"Pet Sounds\\" from a chart standpoint didn't sell as well as previous albums, topping out at #10 on the Billboard charts in the U.S., nor did it sell as well as some of their contemporaries albums at that time here in the U.S.  However, this was in large part due to Capitol Records not promoting the album in the U.S. as it should.  Some of their executives didn't like the new direction Brian was taking the band and wanted the same old songs.  They even went so far as to release & stock the shelves with the BEST OF THE BEACH BOYS album released the same year and not PET SOUNDS.  So there's a reason why the album didn't initially take off in the U.S.<br /><br />Even without the proper and deserved support from the record company, it still produced 4 top 40 singles in the U.S.  It sold wonderfully in the U.K. reaching #2 on their charts and influencing every artist there at the time.  Bands like the Beatles & artists the likes of Bob Dylan were openly and loudly singing the praises Brian and the music he was creating at that point in time and he should have been given more of a chance especially after all the fame he had help to bring the The Beach Boys up to that point.  \\"Smile\\" was an album that was to be The Beach Boys' triumph and the ultimate validation of Brian Wilson's genius.  I am so sorry that it wasn't released back when it should have been but I'm very happy to have both the 2004 Brian Wilson Presents version and now this one as they both give us an idea of the scope and magnitude of Wilson's genius.<br /><br />He was truly a one man show in so many ways and was set apart from other of his contemporaries as he was involved in EVERY phase of the creation of their albums.  \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"Smile\\" both display how truly far ahead of the mainstream he was and music in general would have been so enriched by the back to back releases of these incredible albums.  The Beach Boys were truly an incredible and historic band and people like John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Martin, amongst many others, were heavily influenced by and appreciated them.  The old saying, \\"better late than never\\", is so very appropriate for this long awaited release.  I hope Brian has found some of the peace he was so much seeking back during the Smile Sessions, he is truly deserving of it.<br /><br />I hope this release only helps to solidify what he and the Beach Boys meant to music across the board.  It is truly amazing what they did accomplish and primarily what Brian Wilson was able to accomplish against so many odds.  At their best, they were every bit as good as artists and bands of that time period and were a major force in music the likes of which has been seen only a precious few times at any point in history.4 top 40 singles in the U.S.  It sold wonderfully in the U.K. reaching #2 on their charts and influencing every artist there at the time.  Bands like the Beatles & artists the likes of Bob Dylan were openly and loudly singing the praises Brian and the music he was creating at that point in time and he should have been given more of a chance especially after all the fame he had help to bring the The Beach Boys up to that point.  \\"Smile\\" was an album that was to be The Beach Boys' triumph and the ultimate validation of Brian Wilson's genius.  I am so sorry that it wasn't released back when it should have been but I'm very happy to have both the 2004 Brian Wilson Presents version and now this one as they both give us an idea of the scope and magnitude of Wilson's genius.<br /><br />He was truly a one man show in so many ways and was set apart from other of his contemporaries as he was involved in EVERY phase of the creation of their albums.  \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"Smile\\" both display how truly far ahead of the mainstream he was and music in general would have been so enriched by the back to back releases of these incredible albums.

0525478817|5.0|This is easily John Green's best novel so far. It was gripping and emotional, but never in a way that made it feel cheesy or manipulative. It was a story about two teens - Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters - who were living with cancer, but I never felt like it was a book about cancer. I'm not sure that I can really do the book justice with a review, except to say that it was just lovely.
B00005ASHM|5.0|One thing was always clear when one discussed the most popular artists or bands from the 1960's, The Beach Boys were near the top of each and every list and at one time in the 1960's were voted the most popular band.  Sultry vocals and harmonies, great songwriting about things that most people, in the U.S. in particular, could understand and relate to, being on the beach, cars and girls.  However, Brian began to want to explore more in music and draw on the rich and outstanding wellspring of musical genius he had within him.  This began to eat him up inside as the record label and those within his own band, Mike Love in particular, couldn't nor wouldn't allow themselves to understand.  I've heard many reasons for his nervous breakdowns but I believe this to be the catalyst.<br /><br />This was a man who was hearing wonderful musical themes in his head and was not being allowed the time, space and creative freedom to explore and bring these themes into fruition.  On top of that, the \\"British Invasion\\" was in full swing and those artists and bands were bringing a fresh perspective on music, both it's recording and production, to the world as well as the \\"Motown Sound\\" topping the charts with one great artist after another.  Fate typically does things when least expected and fate saw an exhausted Wilson being home recuperating from his breakdown at just the time the \\"Rubber Soul\\" album was being released by the Beatles.  It would be the album that helped to validate the direction Wilson was feeling his music and that of The Beach Boys should be going.<br /><br />He found his creative \\"second wind\\" and with the help of friend and lyricist Tony Asher, he begin to compose, write, produce and record the songs that would become \\"Pet Sounds.\\"  It was truly an ambitious project and one that would change the face of not just rock music but music in general forever.  When his fellow band mates returned off of the remainder of the tour Brian had left, he had basically the entire project completed except for the vocals.  Once the other members, along with Brian, laid down their gorgeous vocals which, as usual, were one of the many strengths of the album, they had completed a true game changer and neither they nor the music world would be the same.  This album would inspire a whole host of artists to change their entire perspective on how songs should be both written and recorded.<br /><br />Paul McCartney took a copy to John Lennon and they listened to it over and over again until it became engrained in their thought processes.  George Martin, their brilliant producer, also was listening to the album and it was now the catalyst for what would become \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\"  Funny how fate and destiny work, isn't it?  Bravo to you Mr. Brian Wilson, I recently listened to this album from beginning to end and marveled at what was produced.  You and Mr. Asher created a masterpiece that truly changed the music world and more importantly, validated your true genius.<br /><br />P.S. Here's what others were saying about the album and Brian Wilson:<br /><br />Eric Clapton stated that \\"All of us, Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce and I consider Pet Sounds to be one of the greatest pop LPs to ever be released. It encompasses everything that's ever knocked me out and rolled it all into one.\\"<br /><br />Elton John has said of the album, \\"For me to say that I was enthralled would be an understatement. I had never heard such magical sounds, so amazingly recorded. It undoubtedly changed the way that I, and countless others, approached recording. It is a timeless and amazing recording of incredible genius and beauty.\\"<br /><br />Beatles producer George Martin stated that \\"Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper wouldn't have happened... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds.\\"<br /><br />Paul McCartney has said \\"It was Pet Sounds that blew me out of the water. I love the album so much. I've just bought my kids each a copy of it for their education in life. I figure no one is educated musically 'til they've heard that album. I love the orchestra, the arrangements. It may be going overboard to say it's the classic of the century, but to me, it certainly is a total, classic record that is unbeatable in many ways. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried.  I played it to John [Lennon] so much that it would be difficult for him to escape the influence, it was the record of the time.  The thing that really made me sit up and take notice was the bass lines and also, putting melodies in the bass line.  That I think was probably the big influence that set me thinking when we recorded Pepper, it set me off on a period I had then for a couple of years of nearly always writing quite melodic bass lines.  \\"God Only Knows\\" is a big favourite of mine, very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one. On \\"You Still Believe in Me\\", I love that melody - that kills me. That's my favourite, I think, it's so beautiful right at the end comes surging back in these multi-coloured harmonies, sends shivers up my spine.\\"<br /><br />Bob Dylan has said of Brian Wilson's talents, \\"That ear - I mean, Jesus, he's got to will that to the Smithsonian.\\"<br /><br />Roger Waters stated that along with Sgt Pepper, Pet Sounds \\"completely changed everything about records for me.\\"<br /><br />Elvis Costello stated \\"Last summer, I heard \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)\\" played on the cello. It sounded beautiful and sad, just as it does on Pet Sounds.\\"<br /><br />Pete Townshend stated \\"'God Only Knows' is simple and elegant and was stunning when it first appeared; it still sounds perfect\\".<br /><br />Tom Petty stated \\"I think I would put him up there with any composer - especially Pet Sounds. I don't think there is anything better than that, necessarily. I don't think you'd be out of line comparing him to Beethoven - to any composer.\\".

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a marvelous book, rich with wonderful characters, story lines, and delicious tidbits of history. And, maybe anti-history.  King doesn't go over the edge in fantasy on this one. Instead, he relies on a much-debated episode in history as well as his own character's tale to create much more than one would first expect. That's a good thing.  The long book is full of rich detail, but don't gloss over it.  Besides being lots of fun, many things will figure into the story.      I started out reading the book, but a friend recommended listening to it. Craig Wasson gives a virtuoso performance that adds to the entire experience.    Just get started reading - or better, listening - and don't read the spoilers. It's worth discovering on your own.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great twist on a classic. lots of fun. even my kid who never played classic wanted a try   starts easy then it gets hard
B005XQLBU4|3.0|good game. be nice if double bonus points for perfect round to upgrade quicker. other than that its alright game.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Very satisfied with the transmitter.  I'm enjoying my music and other media.  I was also satisfied with the reasonable pricing and shipping.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|made it to day 34 and all upgrades on my first play. it gets pretty tough so I recommend not trying to save the entire city. just 2 or 3 building
B005XQLBU4|4.0|great game much better then original missle defense. awesome game. the creator of this game has done a great job ugrading a classic.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are really addictive but a few of them are almost impossible to get the required scored. good free app but not the best.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I got this dvd today and I love it . hachi is a great movie. for all of the family.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|super addictive time killer! totally reminds me of the classic arcade games. more levels/cities to defend would be nice addition.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the features, love the free Bible versions, love its versatility.  I use it in church, Sunday school, Bible study.  I love its portability &amp; ease of use.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Today's selection highlights everything wrong with the magical world of \\"apps\\"-- how hard is it to come up with an original idea?  Especially when the game it's ripping off, Atari's Missile Command (1980), is also available on Amazon's App Store!?  Look up \\"Atari's Greatest Hits\\"--Missile Command is included, and for FREE!  Why is Amazon giving away a cheap clone of a still copyrighted work?  Why does it sell it for 99 cents?  I don't care how faithful a copy it is, I'm not downloading it at any price.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|On Galaxy S, runs great. Hectic after level 30, it really recreates the feeling of desperation and despair in the old missle command. The world is ending... and no matter how good you are, eventually you will have to sacrifice people to try to save the remnant. Eventually the enemy overwhelms you, the only thing left is a score representing how long it took for you to fail. Awesome storytelling with no story.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|kill them all to win the prize of the victory and the glory and it is fun too for realski
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Addictive little application, brings me back to the good ol' atari days, but with upgraded grphx and sound.... Give it a try...
B005XQLBU4|4.0|a very nice remake of the old missle command .  would recommended to a friend .not much else needs said.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun game, well executed. I made it to night 20. Good job with the resource management. Will keep around for a while.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is amazing.  there are so many games.  once you play you do not want to stop. really you don't.
B0067AC5KA|3.0|The positive thing  about the Millenium Trilogy is the originality of the heroine and this helps the reader develop curiosity regarding the principal character and thus get interested in what happens to the character as the stories progress.  However the storyline is anything but original and has perhaps been told and retold in various forms especially if one is a voracious reader of thrillers.The book is not a literary gem which,being fair to the author, is probably because it is a translation. There is a lot of redundancy in the storytelling : facts are repeated in detail in different settings. For example the journalists discuss proceedings at their meeting and the same facts are rehashed when the police have their meeting. What this ends up doing is consume a lot of pages where the plot gets bogged down.  The reader is also warned that key plot mysteries from the previous book are revealed in subsequent ones which makes it necessary to read the books in order.    From a strict \\"is it a high octane thriller?\\" standpoint, there are better and faster paced thrillers and authors out there. On the other hand the book might be worth going over once-even if it is to form an opinion whether the reader agrees with some critics who claim the book to be an instant classic or whether this trilogy has been undeservedly over hyped.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this gamevis very impressive and if you miss it's your fault, not the game's.  this game is addicting and totally worth the money.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|wanted some easy games to play. some of them are not as easy as I thought, but decent for free
0525478817|5.0|I had pre-ordered my copy of TFIOS once John announced that he would be signing them. My expectations for the book were pretty high since I had already read his previous books and loved each of them equally. When I got my copy I immediately sat down that morning and started reading...I didn't stop til I was finished. This book made me laugh, cry, and hope for the future. This book not only makes you cherish the life you've been given but also gives you hope to find a love like Hazel and Augustus had. The love story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters is like no other. The Fault in Our Stars is yet another amazing book written by John Green. DFTBA.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|Ok, so I read all the reviews, checked all the sites, and did my own foot work in making sure that these issues weren't going to be an issue for me. Ordered, opened, setup, and had my headphones working in 3 minutes. Not bad, 5 stars for ease of use with new HDTV. . . The first two hours went by grand, sounds from all around, crisp audio, although some what weak on the bass, still no pops, claps, or interference. Then . . . it started  Later that night when I went in for another round of Modern Warfare 3, within 15 minutes these headphones were unplugged to be boxed up and sent back. What happened? Nothing in the setup had changed, no new wireless devices were added or moved, I was sitting 3 feet from the receiver, and new issues arose. Loud popping was witnessed every 30 seconds to a minute, I thought, maybe it's the headset issue, so I removed the cable from the controller to the headphones, still had popping issues. Then every 4 minutes it would completely lose audio. . .   Setup for those considering: MacBook Pro in the same room, as well as a Mac Mini (media center) hooked up to the same TV as my gaming. A wireless apple time capsule for internet, although the 360 was connected via wired connection. The TV I used to hook it up was an LG 47LW5300 3D TV. The TV did not support DD 5.1 through the optical out, so I was forced to use it directly connected to my 360. Not the biggest complaint - but I could not find any info on passthrough for this television so I wanted to put it out there. Most times I was sitting 5-6 feet from my wireless receiver for the headset.   Again, try at your own risk, but hear my plea . . . Try out the Turtle Beach x11. I went back to these as a result of the issues and the sound is NEARLY up to the same level as these wireless headphones. Yes they are in stereo, but man they sound great and are extremely comfortable (More so than the x41!)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great games to help pass time away. also games for every age to play. great for everyone. give it a try.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|This product is just what I wanted.  it is a way to take notes with my kindle fire!  thank you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|just downloaded this so I haven't played too many of the games yet, but so far they have been a fun way to turn off mu brain and just have some mindless fun. I am glad I got it after this update that everybody is so ticked off about.  LOL
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I may be in the minority, but I thoroughly enjoyed the last book in this trilogy. It was action packed and did not let me down in the area of excitement.  I refused to read these books for the longest time and when I picked up Hunger Games I read it in a matter of days, finishing the entire trilogy in just 2 weeks. Don't let the other reviews distract you from buying the last book. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there were some parts that could have been left out. All 3 books are well written and enjoyable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and very addicting.  some of the games are very difficult. I recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great. it is almost never ending. also you do NOT need wick to play it. FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|I keep seeing a lot of reviews that this game is \\"repetitive\\".  Have none of you people ever actually played Missile Command?  Of course it's repetitive, all 80's video games were repetitive.<br /><br />I like the fact that you can upgrade your missiles and that you can rebuild your cities quickly if they're damaged or destroyed.  I'm extremely disappointed that you can't chain explosions like you could in Missile Command (i.e., you shoot one missile, it creates a large explosion, which can destroy other missiles which create explosions, which can destroy more missiles, etc).<br /><br />There seemed to be some anomalies in targeting.  I'd tap the screen and a target marker would appear, but the missiles would sometimes explode someplace else.  This proved fatal in higher levels because there's no time to shoot again.<br /><br />The game also kept running and making noise after I pressed the home key upon finishing a game.  It took me a bit to figure out why I was hearing birds every so often.  Watchdog showed it still running in the background.  I tried to reproduce this, but it didn't happen again.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fantastic game. Touch breathes new life into this classic. Even if you miss the free giveaway, this game is well worth it.
B004123CO4|5.0|The troubling mysteries of the speedlight all became clear to me when I read this book.  One very careful read and I've felt grounded ever since in how to choose between TTL and manual, how to bounce my light, how to set up my exposures. It's a must read.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|I haven't read the comic books, but I do enjoy some big-screen versions of them. This was the best action-adventure comic hero adaptation that I've seen in a long time. Evil villain, nerd becomes hero, beautiful woman, and of course, Stark Enterprises. :) Of course, it is formulaic. They handled it beautifully with just the right touches to make it real enough and funny.   Now the shield as boomerang surprised me, not having read the comics, and I loved it eventually. Almost too exciting for my little self. It was great!  Two other action/adventure movies I've seen lately are Thor (GAG GAG GAG) and Green Lantern (lots of fun). Captain America, however, shoots them both out of the water.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Room is a terrific,  but horrific story told through the eyes of 5-year old Jack, who has spent his whole life in Room, with his mother (Ma).<br /><br />Jack and Ma live in an 11 X 11 room, where they are held prisoner by Old Nick.  Having been born in room, Room is Jack's only known place of existence.  Ma creates an illusion for Jack, so he would live a content life, not knowing what he was missing by being held prisoner (which he is unaware of). He never knew Outside existed or was real. Plant is real, Bed is real, Rug is real, Animals are real, but only Ant and Mouse, Dogs and Cats are just TV.<br />Old Nick controls every aspect of their world, from Sunday Treat, which could be Killers (pain relievers) for Ma's bad tooth, or a new book for Ma & Jack, what they eat, whether they have heat or electricity and wether or not they survive.<br /><br />What a book.<br /><br />Finally, Ma begins to a reveal a little of the outside world to Jack and they try to hatch a plan to escape Room.<br /><br />I don't want to give away more, but I will say the only negative is that the book is a little hard to understand at first, because we view the world as the whole world, but Jack only knows Room. It makes what he is describing a little difficult to read at first, but after the first few chapters, you will be enveloped in his way of thinking and his existence, contained to a single Room.<br /><br />Also, readers should be aware of some adult situations in the books.  Although they are described through the eyes of a five year old and not made blatantly obvious in words, the context is easily understood.<br /><br />All in all, would highly recommend this book to any adult looking to read a great novel, and perhaps gain a new perspective on the luxury of personal freedom.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Perfect touchscreen port. -Addictive fun. Responds brilliantly on Kindle Fire. Remember to rebuild those structures _great game to kill some time

B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a good game but some games are confusing and I think they could do better. Also I don't like that you have to buy the games. can't you just play them all? But overall it is pretty good so nice job.&quot;

B005K17RU0|5.0|this is the  best way to get your weather report by the hour. it makes it a lot easier to get your local weather. the Tv weather is always different from channel to channel, this way, no trying to figure out your area.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This was billed as the last in the series that started with [[ASIN:0765348276 Old Man's War]] and [[ASIN:0765354063 The Ghost Brigades]], following the life and times of the occasionally green-skinned John Perry and Jane Sagan. It's a rip-roarer of a book, with John Scalzi's wry and often comedic sense of humor coming to the fore. The book is full of intrigue and politics, but that doesn't get in the way of what is on different levels a family saga, a gentle romance and a series of intrigues that Machiavelli would be proud of.  I would recommend this for anyone who enjoyed either of the previous two books. If you've not read them, or John Scalzi's style of simple and funny writing gets on your nerves, forget it. The plot is pretty good, and the science fiction aspect relatively small - certainly not enough to get in the way of the story.  I've just seen that there is actually another novel from John Scalzi set in the same universe, [[ASIN:0765356198 Zoe's Tale]]. Something to look out for!
0451232577|5.0|Ken follett is the master story teller for epic historical novels. With this first installment of a promised trilogy, he is on the top of his game. Follett reminds us of historical events in a vivid and interesting way, through characters that are deep and flawed, real and in tune with the times. I cannot wait for the second volume.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|While not missle command this is a basic fun game and the upgrades are a nice touch.  Missile Defender works well on the Kindle Fire.
B0065GG2ZK|2.0|This is one of the most terrible albums i have ever heard. This is not rap. This is pop. I wouldn't have a problem with drake if he just stopped acting like a rapper, and admitted he's just a pop star
0062011847|5.0|My husband and I love this book and the fact that it was a Vimes book.  He is our favorite character.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A great book right from the beginning.  A book about JFK and portals as only Stephen King could write it.  Love, love, loved it.  Highly recommend this book.  It is a must read.

B001UHOWW4|5.0|I had read a few years ago (2008?) that the latest DVD was remastered in HD.  While the DVD looked fantastic, it made me wonder if there was ever going to be a blu-ray.  Let's face it, this was shot 50 years ago.  While the colors are bright and image quality is very sharp, it doesn't have that level of reality you might expect from a modern film.  Something tells me this was not tranferred from the original negatives, but rather a technicolor print.  The original negatives probably have not survived as well as the ultra-stable technicolor dyes.  But this is okay because this type of print is exactly what the audiences saw in the theater.  Don't get me wrong.  The picture is as stunning as it gets.  Just don't expect the imagery to jump out at you like something shot in digital.  BTW Did not realize that the guy in this movie played white-haired cigar-smoking Hannibal in \\"The A-Team\\".
B005HSL626|5.0|its so fun!! I luv it! ! I really like it though it has ads. at least u still have fun and not. pay ..
B000067FP8|5.0|Came across the original Gremlins film a couple of months ago, watched it for the first time since a kid and realised I'd forgotten just how good a horror film that was.  I had seen the sequel in cinemas with a group of fellow first year of high school mates when it came out.  I remembered some of the gremlin characters such as Brain and Flasher gremlin and that I liked it but I did wonder if it would be that great now that I'm more than 20 years older, as some 80s/90s movies I watched as kid such as Goonies really don't stack up to my romanticised memory when watching today.  However I'm pleased to say Gremlins 2 The New Batch was absolutely brilliant! It was funny, the Gremlins themselves, although at times you could tell were puppets, still look brilliant. I think the fact you can tell they are puppets helps it to be such a watchable for younger kids as well as older ones and adults film. I've actually bought a few figures by NECA because I liked these characters so much.<br /><br />Gremlins 2 if you haven't seen it is a totally different type of film to the original. The original was a horror film with funny moments every now and then.  Not sure if it was marketed as a kids' films but we were a less wussified generation back then, and everyone watched it.  I think the creators knew this sequel would be watched by kids so it's deliberately made to be a lot more fun, it's the reversal of the original, now being a comedy film with small snippets of horror.  The new batch is not as dark a film with less horror and smaller human body count, with most people who die in this one simply just disappearing with the next human character just appearing at the location wondering where they are.  It's a really fun film, the fact that there's a research lab tenant in the highrise building allowed the writers to come up with some really great mutation Gremlins such as the super intelligent Brain, the bat gremlin, the gremlin with vegetables growing from its head, one that grows a spider's body and heaps of others.  Plus you've got the usual simply mischievous ones such as one in a trench coat that flashes its reptilian body which is funny since gremlins unless they find something to wear are always nude anyway.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of sequels this film stands in its own right.  There's talk of another Gremlins film possibly in the works.  I loved the first two and would love to see a third but only if it's done properly and is as good as the first two.  Terminator 3 and a heap of other films who had a good initial film and sequel but terrible ones to follow have proven that you need a good script too.  I hope they stick with the hand and robotic puppets for the mogwai and gremlin characters and don't just go for the latest fad of CGI as that would take a lot of the fun out of it.  The Muppets didn't ditch the puppet formula with their new modern movie and neither should Gremlins if they chose to make a third one.  There are also some nice bonus features such as deleted scenes (with or without commentary), commentary accompanying the movie if you wish, the trailer, a behind the scenes featurette as well as gag real.  There are also subtitles for the hard of hearing or those for who English is a second language there's a few other subtitle options too.<br /><br />A brilliantly done movie and DVD package, I have no regrets buying this and you'll have plenty of friends and work colleagues asking to borrow it.r's body and heaps of others.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|One of my favorite games on PC but didn't work on my OG Droid.  Upgraded to Galaxy Nexus only to find out it freezes up after a minute, every time.  Pop cap please update!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very easy to pick up and love. Good time killer and upgrades are a great add on to a classic!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|very addicting. lots of fun to be had. its hard to stop playing this game. some of the games are very hard.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! Its so addicting!! I cant put it down! Even my mom and sister are addicted! It is realllyy awesome on the kindle!
B005I64U5C|3.0|Through a quirk of fate test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is chosen against his better judgment to save the world and maybe the universe form a being, don't laugh, and named Parallax that lives for fear.<br /><br />As with all comic to big screen transformations the restrictions to conforming to the comic books shackles any potential for a good movie. The graphics look hokey but better than not. They could have zipped him up in a green fuzzy suit.<br /><br />The story is generic the god guys and bad buys are also generic. You could make book on the dialog. And the pattern is so obvious that they did not waste any time with twist or turn surprises. This was designed to be a pilot (no pun intended.)<br /><br />The film passed time but would not thrill any comic fans or generic movie watchers.
1451648537|4.0|I am a Steve Jobs fan and was really excited to read his biography. I was surprised to read that he was really crazy doing things like sticking to a strict fruit diet.But he always had the penchant for simple user friendly designs. He hated anything that he thought was a bad design, even the oxygen mask he had on while he was terminally sick!!   Things that I learnt from the book are the following:  The ideas to make everything minimalistic and simple    There are no boundaries to innovation - things like budget, time should not be considered during the creative process
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got this because I wanted some simple games to pass the time. it was a good investment since I can play a lot of different games without a bunch of different apps to keep up with. I can just open it up and play what games I have unlocked so far.   the concept for each game is pretty simple and you get points to unlock other games. too bad the farther I get the more points are required to unlock games. but overall, the games are fun and great for passing the time.

0385535139|5.0|John Grisham certainly doesn't need my help selling books.  He is probably the most successful writer in later times and seldom strays from legal stories, but while each does deal with the law, he builds characters that you can readily identify with, hate, love, whatever and as in \\"The Litigators\\", create a story that is totally possible and believable.<br />  This book is based around a couple down and out ambulance chasers and a young lawyer from a large firm sick of the long hours and thankless work for much less than what the partners make.  After a day long drunk adventure, he stumbles upon the small firm Finley and Figg, and offers to work for them.  Without giving the plot away, the story ends up in the courtroom fighting a huge drug company.<br />  Grisham has a way with prose that explains the system in accurate detail, himself a lawyer, without drowning the reader in needless elaboration.  It is this touch that makes him endearing to millions of readers.  He seems to have a real heart and understanding of the poor and downtrodden, and can remark in great detail the life of so many lives in bad situations.<br />  \\"The Litigators\\" may not be as moving perhaps as \\"A Time To Kill\\", or contain the element of danger in \\"Runaway Jury\\", but in its human portrayal, it is quite touching in its own right.  It takes quite an imagination to keep a series of novels that have central themes interesting and not becoming hack jobs, like certain nameless authors who seemingly turn out retread \\"new\\" books every couple of months.  This is why John Grisham is one of America's better writers.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is always on my list of holiday movies to watch each year! It makes you feel good and laugh at the same time! I love it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun game, easy to play, and very addictive! Reminds me of the old game missile command but with a new twist
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is simply great and proves once and for all that missile defense games work best with a touchscreen tablet! Awesome.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun to play. works great on HTC EVO. keeps you entertained for a while. no issues at all. down load it and play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a great game and it does not take up that much space on your electronic. you can play whatever you want as long as you can and there all right there.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Great game. Does NOT run on Samsung  Galaxy Nexus. Pop Cap needs to clearly state the devices that do not work for this game.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|true to the classic missile defense game, definitely like the available upgrades. not bad for free app of the day.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I downloaded this app and have not found anything wrong with it! It's a lot of fun! I would recommend it strongly to anyone who loves solitaire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is fabulous because it provides any translation you could desire and allows you to compare them so you can gain the most understanding from Gods word. the reading plans help you to spend time daily in the word and the notes and highlighters are excellent for remembering passages that are pertinent to you. this app does so much I haven't discovered it all yet!
0345529057|3.0|First of all this is a great series.  Just when you are starting to piece the plots together and think you able to figure out what will happen next, G.R.R. Martin changes the game!  All in all I would give this a 5 star rating and would encourage anyone to read it.  For the price you can not beat this purchase either.  However, when my copy was delivered book four, \\"A Feast for Crows\\" was missing pages 239-302.  I have asked Amazon to do a Quality check on the book but in the meantime I would suggest that whoever orders this box set to go ahead and purchase an individual copy of \\"A Feast for Crows\\" as well.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|Saw the first i loved it i know this one is going to be even more insane cause the last one was great producing great acting and great picture i know this one will be even better
B003UESJH4|5.0|The DVD was packaged well and arrived in great condition. The movie disk was like new. I was very satisfied with the transaction. Thank you.
B006L4MX0Y|4.0|No matter what every fan of this movie and books say this is not the better Japanese version of the Hunger Games or what the Hunger Games is trying to be while similar in topic, mostly just the kids killing each other thing, this is much darker and grittier than the Hunger Games and while I like both books and movies, this focuses on keeping youth from uprising and keeping them in school (as opposed to keeping the general population in line with a reminder of the governments power in the Hunger Games). The story is great and gritty not for the  and this movie is uncut so you get the Directors cut of the film, and contrary to popular opinion this movie was released in limited quantities the problem was that no distributor picked it up because of the lack of interest at the time, now  that it has gained cult status it has finally gotten the respect it deserves. Check it out you won't be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just got it and I love it! it's great and somewhat challenging. it's fun and the games on it are really cool and some are funny!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun. Easy. Good graphics. Would be better if &quot;city&quot; could grow or change. Will be fun to see what future updates bring.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I made a New Year's Resolution to watch at least one BBC program a month on my Kindle Fire streamed through Amazon Prime in 2012.  I was thrilled to today watch the presentation of Elizabeth Gaskell's NORTH AND SOUTH.  Beautifully filmed, perfectly cast and  with wonderful timeless themes it was a joy to watch from beginning to end.  I had previously enjoyed the BBC adaptation of Gaskell's WIVES AND DAUGHTERS but loved NORTH AND SOUTH even more.  Highly recommended to all lover of British Victorian literature.  I intend to read the book this year as well.  And the streaming through Amazon was perfect both on the Kindle where I watched the first two episodes and on my PC where I viewed the others.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|All I have to say is PLAIN BORING all u do is shot the.missles so they don't hit the buildings ..... and for 99 cents what a rip off!!!!!! DONT GET IT!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. its easy enough for little kids to do it ,but challenging enough for teens. with so much variety in game choices you will never get bored. I love how you have to keep unlocking the games because it gives a fun reason to keep playing. over all its an awesome app and even awesomer because it free!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is one of my favorites. It works great on my Kindle Fire, and I love the tools and options it gives me to help me strengthen my relationship with God. If you're considering getting this app, do it, it is definitely worth it.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|this game is fun somewhat.  you cant really do much and its hard to believe that this app was really something you pay for.  I think its just rediculous and wonder if some of the apps of the day would be better.  cum on amazon!!!!!!  and thiis game seems like stupid zombie.  prolly. from the same company.  well with that said I'm off to get my body soaked in my $10000 jacuzzi.  in my $11478000 house.  my dad is the vice president of amazon. once a month I get to choose any app to make free.  I didn't choose this one but I chose dead runner.  great take if you didn't try it out yet then go purchase it because it is a load of fun.  hell and bugs to the people who follow me and tell me what apps they want to be free so I can make it happen.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a really fun game. I love all the different kind of games you can play. Great great game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is fun and it seems never ending. great game I love. blah blah blab blah blah blah blah.
B001EN71HC|5.0|Three Austin Power blu-rays for a great price! I will enjoy watching for years to come! Or at least until blu-ray becomes obsolete. :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|aweome I think if all the apps were unlocked it would be bad and it would smell terrible and it would be bsd
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|This film took a long time to be released on DVD, but it was well worth the wait. Julie Taymor is is a true visionary. Her interpretation of The Tempest brings both the beautiful and unexpected to Shakespeare's masterpiece. I've never seen a completely satisfying production of this play on film or video. Despite the efforts of fine actors and directors who've attempted it, the visual aspect of past productions could never match Shakespeare's exquisite language. Julie Taymor's completely individual VISCERAL sense of design and movement, as well as Elliot Goldenthal's musical score, are genius. They illuminate Shakespeare's text and the masterful performances of the cast with true insight and magical delight. Not to be missed. The Tempest and Taymor's earlier film of Titus are far and above my favorite interpretations of the Bard's work. I really look up to Julie Taymor as one of the finest artists of our time.
B006JCC1GO|1.0|this app sucks just like all the other keyborde apps. don't get this app it sucks very bad. it makes me want to barf
B00664AM5C|1.0|This movie is basically a zombie apocalypse movie with all the zombie parts taken out. Thus it quickly becomes boring and tedious. Watching people in bio hazard suits ponderously moving about is just not enjoyable without the zombies tackling them and chewing through their suits down to their soft and delicious flesh. The scenes of people slowly and horribly dying become dull and boringly realistic when they fail to reanimate as viscous cannibalistic fiends.  They even have a scene where a scientist injects herself with an experimental vaccine. Nothing at all happens to her as a result which is very anticlimactic.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This makes reading so simple LOVE LOVE LOVE it. You can have the Bible translated into king James NIV etc. Have daily devotionals, take notes, even highlight.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use and fun to play. I love the helpful hints! Wish I could win more of the random deals.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|A must for any Dr. Who fan!  The Doctor, in his eleventh incarnation, is an excited explorer of the universe, with a keen intelligence that means he often notices what everyone else has missed.
B0021L9MJG|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, the greatest horror anthology ever stringed together, & most of you probably have seen it many times. For those that have not, do! Now!<br /><br />George Romero directs. Not his most groundbreaking film (no pun intended), that would be \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\" Not his best known sequel, that would be \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\" This is not a sequel at all, but it's Romero's most entertaining film & my favorite of his!<br /><br />Written by Stephen King. Make up effects from Tom Savani, are wonderfully gruesome!<br /><br />My favorite episode, \\"The Crate!\\"<br /><br />\\"Just tell it, to call you Billy.\\" LOL!<br /><br />Worth the Blu ray upgrade!

014312093X|1.0|Who's kidding who, by page 84 I was lost. I didn't know what was going on and I didn't really care. I find that Le Carre is really good (The Spy Who Came in From the Cold) or really bad (The Tailor of Panama and, unfortunately, this book). Don't give up on John Le Carre 1 starrers; just go read The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and then wonder how he could have written this one.
0142403873|5.0|We got the board book version of this story for Christmas for our boy who just turned 3, and it has quickly become one of his favorites.  The rhythm and repetition have made it so he is repeating bits of the story to himself in his room after only a few reads, and he loves to shout out lines with me when we read together.  I love the clever little protagonist.  It's hard to find such a great little story for kids that also has such a wonderful cadence for reading aloud--both kids and parents enjoy this one even after dozens of readings.  I have a feeling this will be a favorite for a long time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is a unbelievably fun game for a cheap price! if you ever enjoyed or missed missle command check this out. very addictive gameplay with light depth as result of a upgrade system or repairing damage to your city. well worth a dollar indeed!!!
B001V7UXG2|4.0|The indifferent video transfer is just cheap and if the series is watched above 480, the results are stretched to distortion.   Years later, the series is as funny and clever as ever and offers me a quiet respite from the all too modern world's version of comedy.  This is how it is done and deserves its classic status.  A must see for those who may only know F & L from House and Kingdom.
1936719118|3.0|This is one of those short reads full of great little takeaways. If you are an entrepreneur who enjoys reading about others success you will enjoy this pocket sized book. There are a few fun gems I enjoyed:<br />\\"When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say 'HELL YEAH\\"<br />\\"If you set up your business like you don't need the money, people are happy to pay you'<br />\\"It's OK to be casual'<br /><br />An easy read and it is as if the author is seated with you telling you his story. I enjoyed it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game's are kinds stupid, but it is addicting so it makes it fun. some controls are hard on the fire.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|Nearly the entire story is told as a flashback. The action keeps jumping between the present, and the past. There is no real developement of the relationship between Rochester and Jane, as was the case with the Masterpiece Theater production. I found the performances lacking in nuance and depth, as though I were being rushed through the story. Sort of \\"let's get this overwith, since everyone already knows the story.\\"  As to the DVD itself, the viewer must suffer through 5 minutes of trailers for other films, before the program begins. It is not possible to fastforward/search past the trailers.  The effect of the trailers is to guarantee that I will NEVER BUY or VIEW ANY OF THOSE FILMS.  Bad idea!
0142418471|4.0|LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! This was a John Hughes inspired, teenage coming of age story with a touch of Broadway musical. What else could I possibly ask for?!?  Told from the alternating perspectives of Will Grayson and....Will Grayson. We follow one 17 year old boy as he struggles with his attention snagging gay best friend Tiny, the attractive yet unattainable Jane, and his own quest to remain emotionally disengaged from everything around him. The other 17 year old Will is coming to terms with being gay, attempting to live his life in the midst of depression, and overcoming a harsh deception. The two Will Grayson serendipitously meet and - with the help of the flamboyant and utterly adorable Tiny - change each others lives.  I generally enjoy teen fiction. However, I was surprised at how much I loved this despite the male lead characters, lack of vampires, and tackling of the difficult issues that face teenagers today. It was heartwarming, engaging, and totally sappy and cliche in a Pretty In Pink/Breakfast Club kind of way.  I am withholding one star because of my shock at some of the language (the F bomb was dropped often) and the blunt 17 year old male view of sex that I didn't stumble onto until I was around 23! However, this is most likely due to my complete naivety! lol.  Overall, a great coming of age story if you can overlook some of the language. Plus, I listened to this on audio and it only enriched the experience (says the girl who never listens to audiobooks).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|You should try this game it's a great game. Why don't you try it? I think you would like it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|You got to pay attention and have good reflexes. Only sucks when you start to lose buildings. But still cool.

0525478817|5.0|Green said it best: \\"We made the story funny. You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice.\\" His trademark humor is here; his brilliant youngsters are here. His genuine characters, his real issues. And more. This book is more. Hazel and Augustus -- and Isaac -- are some of the most amazing characters I've met inside a book for years. They're smart...between the two of them, Hazel and Augustus reference or quote, among others, Dickinson, Beckett, Shakespeare, Ginsberg, Eliot, Whitman, Fitzgerald, Proust, Twain, Salinger, Anne Frank, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams and Frost...Man, would I love to be their teacher!<br /><br />But this IS a sad story. Sad, but not hopeless. Sad but not utterly depressing. Sad and dark, sad and angry. How could teens with cancer NOT be angry. I wondered and wondered how Green was going to explain the title, the famous quote from JULIUS CAESAR. Cassius tells Brutus the fault IS NOT in our stars...but kids with cancer?? That is the fault in and of the stars. Kids who would grow to contribute so much to the world if they could just grow up. Kids with intelligence and insight that would enrich everyone's life.<br /><br />And that is a theme of the book...how do we, can we, make our mark in the years we have? Gus, more than Hazel, wonders about this. They both live out their own form of heroism, and I love that they each recognize the heroism in the other.<br /><br />Augustus gives Hazel his wish trip to Amsterdam to meet an author she's obsessed with, and with that, Green gave me Anne Frank's house. I never got to go in...I just hovered on the outside, on the street in front of the canal. But John Green, and Augustus and Hazel gave me the tour, and I'm forever grateful.<br /><br />This is one of the most important books about suffering and heroism and love and loss I've read in years...it made me sob out loud, and I'm so glad I finished in at home!

0143119680|5.0|I just wanted to keep reading. I hated having to go to sleep at night because that meant that I would have to wait until the next day to find out what was going to happen next.  I would get home from work in the evening, pour a glass of red wine and curl up. Cheese, crackers and reading were dinner.  I can't wait until the next book so I can become totally engrossed again.  When the movie version of A Discovery of Witches comes out, I will be first in line.  I will make sure my non-reading friends at least experience this great book that way.  I hope that the casting comes at least close to the characters that the book allowed my imagination to create.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love this TV series, this and Bones are great. I purched both of these through Amazon. Amazon is very good to work with. They always try to meet all of your concerns! Thank You Amazon!

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Missile command with a slight twist. Simple interface and sound effects, interesting upgrade path, a rehash of missile command-like games, but fun nonetheless!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|if you don't like missile defense you may not like it, but what it does it does well. I recommend this game

B0052REQLK|5.0|I'm a physician who has been in practice for 28 years. One of the joys and privileges that I've always discussed and appreciated is the ability to speak to my older patients about their lives and experiences.  I can't even begin to tell you how much I have enjoyed doing that and the amount that I have learned. They have much to say and we have much to learn.   Buy this book.In a disposable culture, books like this can lead to personal and cultural changes that are so necessary to help appreciate what life has to offer.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|My wife and I were ordering two iPhone 4s phones, so I looked over the choices for cases and bought a couple of this item.  What I was looking for:  1) Something to protect the phone in the event of a drop. This cover doesn't seem to be sort of thing that would prompt me to drop my iPhone on concrete from 20 feet up on a dare, but it seems to provide decent enough resilience and protection that it would be pretty likely to protect the phone adequately. There's a tradeoff between compact enough to go in my shirt pocket and armored enough that I would think I was carrying an old \\"brick phone.\\"  2) Need something with some grip to it. I'm getting to be old, have dry skin, and have a genetic condition that has left me without fingerprint ridges. I drop stuff. This has enough grip to the plastic that I don't risk dropping the phone. (Incidentally, the ridges you see in the pictures are on the inside of the housing, not the outside.)   3) Need it to be slippery. I've had rubbery cases on my iPod Touch that were hard to get into and out of my shirt pocket. This slips in and out easily enough, yet It's grippy enough that it's not likely to slip out of my pocket if I bend over.  4) Price is right. Very reasonable.  5) Packaging is as advertised. I didn't have to struggle with knives and cursing to open some blister pack, just fingernail through a seal and open a cardboard box and later put it in recycling.  6) Enclosed screen protector is adequate. Goes on reasonably easily, does tend to bubble a bit and is a grease magnet. There are more expensive protectors you can find on Amazon and I'll probably change to one of those sometime.  We're both happy with this purchase.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works well!  It's nice not to have to shuffle cards anymore.  My favorite is the autocomplete when I win - makes me smile!
0545265355|5.0|I purchased these books for my son as a christmas present. He loves that the books are in the box set,and he has starting reading, they were delivered to Perth Australian fast. The best.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire just to kill time. However, I have throughout enjoyed playing it. Nice game.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Nicely done. Simple graphics yet addictive. Sounds are very good for a phone app. Excellent adaptation of Missile Command from the older game platforms
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I've been a huge Michael Crichton fan for years.  When he passed I found myself branching out to other sci-fi genres attempting to fill the void of having no more Crichton in my life.  A co-worker asked if I had read \\"Old Man's War\\", I had not so she loaned me the book.  I couldn't put it down.  The writing flowed in a familiar way to me, the detail Scalzi put forth when describing his characters and scenes was outstanding and reminded me so much of what Crichton did.  I couldn't have told you he was a new writer when this book was published because it read like a seasoned writer wrote the book.  The story was original and not very \\"out there\\" as I thought it might be.  Scalzi doesn't spend much time on the science in the story but just enough time to give you a basic understanding of what is going on and not to talk over somebody's head.  If you are looking for a new sci-fi writer to fill your void I highly suggest Old Man's War.  I hope the follow-up is just as good as I can see reading Scalzi's stories for some time to come.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I hope I'll can edit word, exel and powerpoint files from my kindle fire. It will be perfect for me and my wife work
B005XQLBU4|3.0|It's a good clone, but doesn't offer much more than the original. graphics are good, but should change up as you progress. The limited ammo is a good challenge, making you concentrate on accuracy rather than just bombarding the sky. With more variety to the backgrounds and ammo selection, this could add a lot of long term play to this game.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I cant believe this is free. don't listen to all the wimps complaining about the adds. there are a few but not annoying
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|There are two stories woven together to make this artful tapestry.  A Story of a Strong Woman  and ... the at times gut wrenching life of an elderly woman trying to keep herself from going mad.  This story wraps you in from the beginning and has you rooting for the ol' gal to win it all and near the end an emotional farewell.  But the other story is her dealing with the ails that come along with aging.  There is an obvious compare and contrast between what is now and what is then.  Those that look at this incredible screen play with any political ideology will miss the beautiful story about a powerful charismatic woman that defied all the odds.  I have more curiosity for Margaret Thatcher after watching than I did before this movie.  While I am not a fan of her political ideologies, and also not a Brit, for me the movie accentuates Thatcher's human element which coming from an ironclad figure head is an interesting perspective.  She fought for what she believed to be what was just and what was right.  Regardless of what your political position is, if you agree or disagree with her politically, this movie was elegantly crafted and did not in the least diminish the memory of her 11 year historic rule.  It showed the raw visceral power that was and still is the incredible, delightful and powerful Margaret Thatcher.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Like the old missile command you must defend your city. Worked well on Kindle Fire. Just like old game you will be overwhelmed at some point. Intuitive mechanics, not so hard that a noob can't survive for a while. Fun game but gets boring after a while.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun game when you're bored, but the controls stick a little.  The games vary a lot in difficulty, even on the same level.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|the surface to air missiles frequently but not always overshoot their targets. Because of this im not always sure where to aim. this makes the game play extremely frustrating and not as fun. if it wasn't for that 1 bug I would be tempted to give this game 5  stars.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app has kept me busy for hours. I just wish I could play without. the constant. other apps interrupting. But a great game.
B005T87QCI|1.0|every time I open the app I need to download it and then when Im playing it goes back to the kindle home srceen it so stupid.stupid.stupid.stupid
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games alright at first if you're really bored but starts to seem pretty childish.  I got bored pretty quickly.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a good fast pace missle defense game that gradually speeds up as you play through the levels. Good for a quick game!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is awesome! 101 games in 1 for FREE!can u believe that? and, no, the games aren't boring, they r radically fun!! 101-in-1 games is the bomb diggity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it great game lots of fun. easy kept me entertained for hours. kids also love to play. check it out
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this item for my boyfriend for Christmas along with other survival items and he has used it a lot. My kitchen knifes are no longer safe! He says that it is<br />easy to use and works really well. Thanks Amazon for your help this holiday season.
B005XLN97M|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC new Barbie house for 2012!  LOVE the floating stairs!  Great idea Mattel!  And it was really easy to put together.      The only thing that I wish Mattel would do with these current Barbie houses is to break up the pink & purple a bit more.  It would be soooo much nicer if they would have brought that aqua blue you see in 2nd floor, to the downstairs room and even have made the floating stairs, the TV stand and the 2 bar stools aqua blue instead of pink.  There's so much Pink on Pink anymore in these new Barbie homes.  Maybe add some yellow to these Barbie houses.    I was fortunate enough to recently purchase the original 1978-1981 A-Frame Barbie Dream House on eBay in MINT condition.  Now THAT IS A BARBIE house.  Yes, they did sort of remake that house, but again, in all that pink & purple.  Plus it is much smaller and there are no jalousie windows.  I guess I brought this up because if Mattel would add other colors to these houses, I believe they would sell even more and even faster than what they do now.   Anyway, back to this house.  I say go for it!  It's really great and my niece LOVES it!  Again, I must give props to the floating stairs!  VERY NICE!
B005QUQ99K|5.0|This is exactly what my grandson (age 6) wanted.  He said it was his \\"favorite\\" Christmas present.  He kept working at it until he finished it.
B0064SHI9I|5.0|Using droidx, version 2.3.3, unrooted.   Had an issue with listing all of my application when you try to create a backup.  I do have lots of apps that I collect.  :-)  I contacted suport and they responded quickly to my issue. They worked with me until I was able to create a backup. They sent me a beta version with the fix to test.  Great support with the developers!!  The bad part of this, I bought MyBackup Pro from Amazon and it doesn't have the new fixes yet.  The google market is updated with the new fixes.  Amazon still have version 3.0.2 and the Market has 3.0.7.  BUT the developer said I can use the beta version that I got from them until Amazon update the application. ( I hope soon!! ) Still learning the application, simple to create a backup for your applications & data. I have not got a chance to restore or schedule a backup, but that is next on my list to check out. So far, it's pretty good!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun simple games... great app for free some games are supprisingly difficult. this should keep me busy during my down time
0525478817|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite books ever. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, and I finished it in a single day despite being incredibly busy because it was just that awesome. The complexities of Augustus made him one of my favorite character to ever grace the pages of any book. Hazel was a strong narrative voice that has stayed with me despite having read the book days ago.  I couldn't stop thinking about it as I read; I was onstage in a musical Friday night, and my thoughts were on TFioS the entire time (thank God I had no lines). I most definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for something worth reading.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Pure awesomeness. Everything works great on my HTC Incredible running 2.3.4. I just played through until night 14 or so. Upgrades make it fun. Definitely a game that will stay on my phone for a while. I recommend that you try it out. It's a blast. No pun intended.
0802130208|1.0|I'm sure I will be called stupid for not adoring this book, but I just don't understand the following it has.  A professor recommended it to me and I respect his opinion, so I tried to read it.  I read 2/3 of it before I was so disgusted and angry at the main character, I could not finish it.  There are only three other books I have started and not finished because I had such a strong aversion to them. This one was so bad, I recycled it.  Maybe my humor isn't well matched with the humor in this book, because I didn't smile once.  Most of the time I found my self dry heaving a little bit at the disgusting description of the main character. I suppose for that, I will give the author kudos for creating a character that was so revolting and colorful, that I literally almost threw up.  I guess the fact that his character moved me to anger and disgust means something, but I cannot say it means that the book was good.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fantastic title! I don't typically buy games without some sort of preview but I saw it reviewed very well on a site and was intrigued.  I've yet to be disappointed by this calming yet challenging game! The music and graphics are a perfect blend of elegance and simplicity. Thanks FTG's for a great game.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Challenging and lots of fun! Sound effects are awesome. I'm pretty fussy about choosing a game, but this one I like a lot.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This app is a somewhat modern spin on the Atari classic. If you liked that, you will like this and all the old strategies work. Having said that, you probably won't play more than a couple times before getting bored.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I was so excited when it arrived(a day late) and expected it to come in a padded envelope(oh,well) It was a little tricky to put the batteries in, but with a little help from my brother, I heard the bwuuuzzzzpp noise before it was fully assembled. I would have loved it to have come with the psychic paper, but as this is the newest model, I guess they have there decisions. I really recommend this toy, over the Eleventh Doctor's sonic screwdriver, as its very bulky and hard to use.
B00005JKOI|5.0|I received the DVD within days of placing my order.  It was exactly what I ordered and what I expected.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|good game, looks good except the two player mode would be so much better if you didn't have to keep switching the kindle. it would be awesome to just leave it on the table between you.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Clean, stable app..  Works great on KF with stylus.  No apparent glitches of any kind.  It is actually what its predecessor's wish they could have been.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun simple games! pretty easy to figure out and get the hang of. kinda fun to work to open new games and pretty easy
B005OCFGTO|5.0|No extras with this set, but with them taking these movies off the market to be released later, it's a great deal.
0385535139|5.0|I have read every book written by John Grisham , that i know of, to date. All have been exciting, entertaining and difficult to put the book down. I would recommend to any one, who likes suspense and intrigue, this is the book for you!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great time waster if thats all you have to waste time which is all I apparently have todo on a sunday.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This version of &quot;Missile Command&quot; really makes a conviencing argument that a touch screen is the ideal interface for a game of this type.  The weapon improvement system is also a very nice addition and this is the best take on the classic that I have seen in years.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|this is a very good smooth game it's fun.  this is the kind of game you play while you are waiting or just to waste time but you won't be bored
B000002WFF|4.0|I'll try not to get too sentimental over this album/CD, as I saw it back in 1970 at the \\"Cinema\\" in Union City, N.J. - with about six other people. I had about a month and one half \\"off\\" between the end of the Spring semester at College and the start of my summer job. Was in high spirits as I marveled at the \\"new\\" Elvis - like his fans, now never having to look back at \\"Paradise, Hawaiian Style\\", following the amazing Singer Special for NBC-TV and the return to live shows and very solid, new contemporary hit singles. The new Elvis, trimmed down with ridiculous triangle side-burns, and a white jumpsuit (which John Davidson copied in 1974 and Britney Spears copied in 1996). With a 38 piece orchestra. Never *could* find Scotty and D.J. in that group!<br /><br />The scant attendance aside, the movie has survived as perhaps the only \\"Elvis cult\\" movie. The performance footage was fine...but was subject to cutesy cutting - like split screens of Elvis and a side of beef (in the Hilton kitchen). Ironic metaphor? nah....not if Elvis had anything to do with it.<br /><br />I doubt I wondered if the documenatry would hve a soundtrack release - I alwaystried to get to the new Elvis features 1964 to 1966 *before* that came out - to appreciate the musical mediocrities. Actually, all of his features had 3-4 really good tunes.<br /><br />Somewhere around town, I saw it - the soundtrack to the movie (which, by the way, I enoyed then and enjoy now in the original form before the butchering in the special edition. Now *I'm* thinkin' red meat.....). I did not buy it until about ten years later.<br /><br />I cannot explain why I wouldn't buy a good Elvis album in that time - anyway, here it is, from '93 as a CD. Except that, it's not really a soundtrack album! There are three actual live numbers from the film (correct me if I'm wrong) and studio versions of what I surmise were *meant* to be live. Somebody decided to overdub audience sounds on \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\", to make it even more confusing.<br /><br />To the actual tracks: save for three or so, they are all excellent - new ffresh songs by the new fresh Presley. His voice is almost overwhelming in its' power and timbre. Vibrato any Opera singer would notice. \\"Stranger In The Crowd\\" and \\"Twenty Days and Twenty Nights\\", both hip beat ballads, are immensely successful. \\"Patch It Up\\" defies genre, just a thumping Country rocker, in a cool arrangement. Listen for Elvis call out \\"Charlie\\" in the number [Charlie Hodge, we must asume).<br /><br />Another undefinable and engaging Country-Pop item is \\"The Next Step Is Love\\", always an under-appreciated emerald, every bit as good as (nearly) anything by Jimmy Webb at the time. Elvis hits the line \\"shadow of a perect day\\" and Attila The Hun would be moved to tears. Just awesome.<br /><br />Lowlights: \\"You Don't Have To say You Love Me\\", yes a good single, but quite uninspired and unnecessary and \\"You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling' - again, if you're not gonna \\"make the song your own\\" - forget it! At least on the big ballads. \\"Just Pretend\\" is a great showcase for Elvis, as he works wonders on a this notes-in-search-of-a-hook deal. Yet another Country-Pop-ballad, and a popular \\"lost\\" Elvis cut. Interesting approach, though - there are zero '50s songs here, unless I missed one. Obviously, Elvis was determined to show he was timely, on stage and in the studio - and more importantly, totally back on top.save for three or so, they are all excellent - new ffresh songs by the new fresh Presley.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|has a lot of fun games easy to use and I like the reward system only bad is I don't like some games but have to play to unlock more I do want to play
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Great movie I have watched it three times because it is just raw and so funny. That is the way it is. Not for children but a great movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Took me awhile to buy these books and I don't regret it at all. I couldn't put it down. And now that I'm done with them, I want more. These books were so good I find it hard to get into other books. Please for the love of god Suzanne Collins write more! :P  10 stars!!
B005OSUKSA|5.0|To write or try to describe how music can move you deeply, it could need probably a complete chapter, so to speak. I have been following David's trajectory for several years. Be awared that David Garrett is not an improvised violinist, he is a great performer, a consolidated musician, a Virtuoso. It is amazing and wonderful how a young man, since his early 11 years old, was so mature with his performance, and has come to be into an astonishing violinist. The first time I heard one of his recordings I was so attracted and fascinated, the violin sound was so brilliant, deep and moving at the same time that I couldn't help but only to feel great joy. Since then I have bought every CD. And \\"Legacy\\" is by no mistake a precious gift for your ears. The recordings selection and interpretation are magnificent, not only by David's virtuosity as a Violinist but the Director Ion Marin and the Orchestra complete the circle. If you are David's big fan you would enjoy it as I have but if you only have heard David Garrett by reference, you won't be dissapointed with this Legacy Master Piece.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun to play, I cant stop.but some levels are kinds hard for me to play.so fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so awesome.I might die for it if I didn't have it.however doesn't have it.u better get it now.(or I will haunt u your whole life.)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the app since it makes it so I can have the One Year Bible with me all the time.  I have used the One Year Bible for for years.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun app.  Reminds me of the solitaire I used to play on my Pc back in the day.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Awesome upgraded version of missile defense. Love having to choose between upgrading missiles or rebuilding lost buildings. Awesome response to touch, no lag.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good quality game. Just like missile command when I was a kid. Out works exactly like advertised. I recommend it.
014241543X|5.0|If I Stay by Gayle Forman is easily one of the best books I have read this year. It's an intensely personal story about the struggle of a young girl whose world is changed in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />Mia's life is full. She's been very blessed. She has a wonderful boyfriend, is an incredibly talented Cellist and she has a wonderful close family who gets her. She is close to her parents and younger brother, in a way that few people are really able to experience, especially as a teenager. We are given just enough time in the beginning of the book to meet Mia's family and in those few pages, we are able to see the connection this family shares.<br /><br />Her family is involved in a horrible accident, and Mia is rushed to the hospital in a coma. She watches everything around her trying to understand the changes to her life, and where to go from there. Because she realizes it's her choice. She can choose to live or die. And what would you decide?<br /><br />The book is Mia's struggle to make that all important choice. The story is told in flashed between then and now. We switch between scenes with Mia and her family and friends in the hospital, and her memories of the important people in her life. We are introduced to everyone through Mia's memories as she lays in a coma in the hospital, in limbo between life and death. It's heart wrenching to watch as each loved one comes to her bedside to talk. They give her words of hope, love, encouragement, understanding, and peace. They plead for her to remain, even while understanding why it's so hard. Every page teams with emotion and every memory tears at your heart.<br /><br />I won't go into detail about the complete impact and effect music has to this story other than to say it is essential to almost every character. Music is a way of life for these people and it's changed each of them. Mia's boyfriend Adam is in a band that might be about to make it big, Mia's been playing the Cello for years, her father used to be in a band and on and on.<br /><br />The writing in this book is incredibly powerful. There is a genuine connection to each character and a realness that makes you believe in them. I would say that Forman is a genuinely gifted writer. I can't remember the last time I believed in people so much, felt so much like the people I was reading about were real. I had tears streaming down my face for the vast majority of the book, and I was unable to put it down. It's a short book, and I read it in one sitting, but that in no way takes away from its impact. This book is beyond a doubt powerful, emotional, and compelling. Never doubt that its important.this book is incredibly powerful.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Excellent, accurate response on HTC Sensation!  Fun Game.  I usually don't play non-brain exercising games on my phone, but I will be playing this.  My favorite upgrade is using points to upgrade the missile speed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great.  I wanted radar....now I have it<br />recommend to anyone who needs a weather app.<br />Again, the radar is what got my attention
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are varied, providing plenty of choices, hawever I'm not impressed with the lack of levels for the games; one and done is not my usual style.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great free game for the fire.  controls are simple.  easy to understand.  fun to play while ur waiting.  go USA
0525478817|5.0|I finished the book a few days ago, and I find myself thinking about it numerous times a day. This is not a book you read, say \\"huh\\" and then forget. After the mind-blowing event of reading it, you will find yourself dissecting, thinking, and analyzing things and conversations in the book throughout daily life. This is a book that will pull at your heart strings, make you cry, make you laugh, but most of all, it will make you think.  I love book that make me think.  And I absolutely love TiFOS.  There has always been a weird protected spot in my heart where Alaska lives as one of my all time favorite characters, and now Hazel and Gus are there too.  Great job, John.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game just takes a while to unlock all of the different games. worth getting because it is free. worth it
B006GG1KOC|1.0|don't wast your time and money on this app it so sucks my 4 old got everyone correct its so easy so simple so wasteful! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001EC3JME|5.0|Great holder for large Flash light. It keeps and holds the flash light just right.I'm using a large flashlight and it doesn't fall out.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|If only my child was older. This would be a fun game to play to teach different ways of looking at thing which are sometimes the same and other times different. Game clearly presents objects for comparison and is easy to use.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of fun minigames, pop ups are somewhat unnecessarily large but only appear between games, great for the price,over all a great time wasting app and lots of fun for kids
0755490355|5.0|Found part of the collection (4 of her 6 titles) at Half Price Books, and I chose \\"Emma\\" to take home with me. Beautiful little editions, perfect size to tuck into a purse (albeit a medium to large purse). Hard burgundy cloth cover with dust jacket that features artwork pertaining to the book - in this case, a sketch of Emma with a pillow to place behind her seated father's head. Also has an attached ribbon to be used as a bookmark. I'll be adding the others to my collection, too, I'm sure. DO note, though, that the typeface is very small, probably about 7 or 8 pt. For a young girl with no eyesight issues, this would be a perfect collection of books for her book shelf, and easy little books to tuck into a backpack. Reminded me of the small books of sonnets and such that the actresses in the movies based on these books are always carrying around to read; thus their charm. Enjoy!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This game is fun but lacks i small amount in the keeping me hooked area. It has a good response for play and is in general a good time killer. On my Motorola electrify.
0307595579|5.0|The presentation of the books is excellent and I liked having the 4th book on the author.  Amazon had the best price of everywhere I looked and they came very quickly. Made a very attractive gift.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much that they should make a board game out of this game because I like it so much.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I think this app is wonderful. I got it on my kindle fire and the picture and sound is amazing.
B005V20JKI|5.0|this game is a very fun game. whether you want to play it for 10 minutes or 1 hour either works as its addicting! The only problem is that amazon is incredibly slow on updates so we still don't have the Christmas content. Just give us the update already amazon! it runs perfectly on the kindle fire, don't know why this game is getting poor reviews, its a very good game.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The way defender was suppose to be played.  A lot of fun.  Starts off easy and then gets more challenging.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A good selection of free and good games that have iniative to keep playing to unlock them all. A must download considering it is free.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|In agreement with most of the other reviews, this app shuts down conatantly. I have a Droid and assumed that the problem was related to the fact that I had an older phone but this seems NOT to be the case. I enjoy Mah-jong but am unable to complete even one complete game. I'll be looking for an update soon or Ill be saying bye bye to this one.
B0037AGASG|5.0|I bought this CD for my daughter who is a true Belieber and found I liked it just as much for the style and quality vocals. My World 2.0 is complete with songs you can sing and dance to. My favorites are Somebody to Love, Never Let You Go, and Overboard. The duet with Jessica Jarrell has some nice harmonies. It is particularly refreshing to hear a young artist singing age appropriate songs. I look forward to more from him as he matures as a talent. For now, I enjoy how it makes me feel and just want to get up and dance.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|i got it free so it's great ;-)  i wouldn't pay much for it. gets a little old after a few days.
B0026MEM4K|5.0|I would first like to say that I own the original CD release of this album but not the SACD release. I thought it was interesting that MoFi chose to remaster such a recent album, perhaps testimony to the artistic quality and classic status it possesses. I am amazed at the extra level of detail MoFi has extracted from so recent an album and can categorically say this is far superior to the original CD. I have seen some comments in reviews that this MoFi release is even better than the SACD. I wouldn't be surprised if it were. If you love this album and don't have access/ability to play the vinyl release, and given it's a fraction of the price of the now-OOP SACD release, snap this up before it's out of print!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are amazing. who would have thought about this kind of thing? I love them all! I wish I could make a second 101 games
0525478817|5.0|This is such a wonderful book. John Green takes the lives of two teenagers and weaves the most beautiful, funny, poignant, touching and tragic story I have ever read. Read well and DFTBA.
0439023513|5.0|I want to say flat out that I enjoyed all three books from beginning to end. They are extremely well written and well paced. I cannot understand why people don't like this final book. The Hunger Games events are entertaining and thrilling but this series is about love and war. The third book, \\"Mockingjay\\", continues both the love and war elements and describes the districts rebellion against the capital. I have never considered myself a \\"realist\\" but after reading some of the poor reviews the only conclusion I can come to is that people wanted this book to be fantasy. The series IS NOT a fantasy and never leads you in the direction that it is going to be a fantasy. This book beautifully and accurately depicts real human emotion during and after traumatic events. I really can't say enough positive things about this series and I can't wait to recommend it to family and friends.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a game that can somewhat entertain you when you get bored. It's probably be more suited for younger children. For teens, its a time-filler.
0143034901|5.0|Daniel is a young boy hurting from the loss of his mother. His father in order to help him heal takes him to a secret place called The Cemetery of Forgotten Books and tells him to pick a book that would be his forever, one that he would \\"adopt\\" and take care of his whole life. Daniel picks a book called The Shadow of the Wind and here is where the true story begins. Daniel loves this book and tries to find more titles by the same author, but what he uncovers is a story older than himself and much more mysterious than he anticipated. Unexpectedly he uncovers a Pandora's Box of love, hate, friendship, envy and revenge and he becomes part of it, unraveling a story that has so many twists and turns you begin to doubt every character's motive. Some pages will leave you with chills, while other pages tell a love story that will break your heart. This books has many plots and twists but read this book, you will not be disappointed!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game for free. Random deals with the opportunity to replay deals. No glitches noticed. Great basic spider game for a great price!
B0034G4ORC|1.0|No not again not another one of those alien invasion movies. You know the type, incompentant aliens invade the earth and a bunch of Marines with no acting skills, save the day. The aliens want to steal our water... becouse earth is the only planet in the universe with (drum roll)liquid H2O. Yep you read it right folks earth is the only place in the whole universe with wet water.so these really nasty aliens land in the earths oceans fuel up on our water and then march into L.A.why?  Becouse they want our wet water. We see a handfull of these guys shooting it out with the G.I. joe's but acording to the news bullitins so many of them have droped into earths oceans that the earths ocean levels started to go down in a day.   on the end the marines find a magic solution and the humans now have a chance against the aliens. What gets me about these movies is that they go against history simply put when a technologicly advanced civilisation comes across a more primitive one guess what hapens? Not sure well just ask the American Indians or the Australian Aboriginals.Now imagine thoese people really defeating the powers that invaded them, yeh right. So if movies with D.O.A. plots, non acting, shaky camera work and average FX, are youre thing then give this a go.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|ok fun to play, but can be frustrating. once you get use to it its a time killer, especially at work
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good time waster but not much variety. The controls are kinda sticky sometimes. I think these are fun games for kids.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Great task manager.  Works well, with a great interface.  Syncs with Google Tasks, so it works with multiple devices.  I use it on my phone and tablet.  Works great.
0062082353|5.0|Being a longtime Tom Clancy and Carlos Hathcock fan, this book was an obvious selection for me.  It did not disappoint.  As this happened in my lifetime, I recall reading the news releases.  I remember the Fallujah, Ramadi, and Sadr City campaigns.  Sitting in my living room reading about something a world away gives no insight into the reality of war.  Mr. Kyle puts war into a personal perspective.  I intended to lend this book to a co-worker.  This will not happen.  It will be reread, then placed in my reference collection.  He will need to buy his own.  I suggest you buy your own.  Aaron
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I bought this largely for the digital copy.  Unfortunately, the UltraViolet digital copy is not the sort of digital copy that has come with other movies I've purchased.  It is extremely restrictive and an absolute pain to use.  The description of what you get in the digital copy is misleading, and the final product is horrible.  Such a shame, as the movie itself is very good.  Stay away from the UltraViolet digital copies.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|While it is fun to see such familiar characters again in new situations, this book is very thin.  Austin fans will be bored with the rehash of details they know so well. The last chapter where James attempts to \\"wrap up\\" Darcy's feelings should have been left in Austin's much lighter hand.  For a James mystery it's okay, if over plotted.  There were some delightful descriptions such as Darcy describing the women in the court room leaning forward to Wickham like so many lap dogs sniffing a tasty morsel.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I have the original version of this game and I must say this version is 100% better. The game play is smooth and flawless. Touch screen control to aim fire missiles is easy to learn and use. Graphics are not high tech but they work. I have several game apps that have awesome graphics but play like garbage. So having the developer focus on game play instead of looking great ia refreshing
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its great wen ur bord an nuthing to do but its great that there is more that just one or two games in one game but iver all its good to play arround with
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Love Youversion when I have access to wireless, but would really like to see Notes, Bookmarks, Plans, etc. available offline.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I feel kind of bad to admit that, at first, when I heard Gaga's debut single \\"Just Dance\\", and saw her look, I thought she was a carbon copy of Gwen Stefani and didn't really think she would get far. Boy was I wrong. True, there are several moments on \\"The Fame\\" where Gaga sounds identical to Gwen Stefani, but she makes these tracks her own as well with her own inflection. And there's a reason why \\"The Fame\\" has topped the Billboard Dance/Electronic albums chart more times than any album before, each and every song is as catchy as can be. If it's not the guilty pleasure \\"Poker Face\\", you will be jamming out to songs like \\"StarStruck\\" and \\"Paper Gangsta\\". She even offers a few tracks with deeper meaning than going out and clubbing, but she still manages to keep it upbeat so you won't be totally depressed. In short, Lady Gaga is the definition of \\"Fame\\", a talent who is undeniable and an album you can't get enough of.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This a great game. Lots of fun to play. I would recommend to any one. Addictive. all my friends love to play also.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very easy to play. I love it espically since it uses touch and go. you don't have to drag the cards around.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|if you are a fan of Missile Command you will see the resemblance between the two games.  touch screen control was very good.    watch out for the large bombs!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|saves me 117 downloades cause i have them all with this one app. only rec. is don't upgrade because it will erase your previous wins. all in all i really like it
0811876373|5.0|I got this for my Nephew, He LOVES baking and wants to be a chef one day. Thanks so much!
B005XQLBU4|2.0|Got to level 40 on my first game...difficulty ramps up far too slowly. Upgrades max out after only 5 levels. Needs more variety in enemies (even the original Missile Command has more going on than this game!) Also ran into a bug where a new game would not let me do any upgrades at. all.  I'm a little surprised by the almost universally-glowing reviews for this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a very very very very fun and cool and really really really awesome and never ever ever gets boring to play ever
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this app for about a month and I love it. You can pick the translation you prefer. I love the plan section,it allows you to set up a reading plan or get daily devotionals,which is what I use the plan feature for. This is one of the apps I use several times a day.
B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|Motorhead is alot like Saxon, every release is good.  They stay true to there sound. Cant wait to see them on the Gigantour 2012
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the variety of games! some are annoying to have to finish even if you don't enjoy the game, just to get to more... but I like the challenge.

B003L77G10|1.0|The product arrived damaged and we were never able to watrch the complete second season. The quality was poor and the sound was very bad. The return policy is just to much hassel to bother with. All my other items have  been fine. This one was a dud.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its so fun but sometimes a little hard I love this game no joke eek : -)  Love it, plus its actually 117 games fyi people I don't understand all the complaints its just fine on my kindle fire
B000XR4OC0|3.0|Tom's shoes sells a good product and the company itself seems to do some good in the world at the same time; but buyer beware. They have terrible customer service -- slow and fraught with errors. Be careful of buying shoes that you're not sure about on-line in case you have to return them. For example, I was told that refunds, once the shoes have been received, is about fifteen days. Compare that to Amazon, who refunds your money in two days.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|most games are pretty simple. would be great for kids.  I am not sure I would purchase it again. But since it was free it works out.
0439023513|4.0|This book starts off slow.  A lot slower than the already slow pace of the other books to the point where it's really boring. Besides that I loved this book.<br /><br />I don't understand why people think this is a romance series.  From the beginning it seemed so much more than that.  And if anything the romance was more of a way for Katniss to follow the decisions she believed in.<br /><br />And as you read you should focus more on the politics of it. Of why there is a Hunger Games in the first place.  Then as you see the new society of the rebels you realize - wait a minute who is the real enemy? Is there a clear enemy?  I like this book because it's not black and white at all.<br /><br />I  think this ending was suitable.  It's bittersweet.  And I like that.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its goof for all ages some games are harder then others but it works fine on my fire. minus the ads. I hate them so there's 4 stars instead of 5
0439023521|5.0|Anyone who says this book is a \\"waste of time\\" or an \\"okay read,\\" is crazy. This book, and the following two, are one of the best books I've ever read. It has it all! A read good connection with the characters. I just could not stop reading. You love a good read, this is top of the list.
B00009W0U4|4.0|The first half-hour or so of this movie is shot with the camera swinging around, unfocussed, and only partly intelligible.  OOOOOOhhhhhhh!  How artsy!  My wife and I barely lasted through this part, although as the movie goes along, the camerawork begins to settle down.  That's the only reason we managed to suffer through the first part of the movie.  The rest of the film is steadier, and almost excellent.<br /><br />The story is told backwards, and (probably) would only have had impact had it been done this way.  Dialogue minimalistic, but OK, since in French and must read subtitles.  Thing is, the dialogue is essential to the overall meaning of the film, so you do have to keep up with it.  By the end of the film, I was wondering how much credit Amazon would give for trading it in (only about $4).<br /><br />Next morning, voila!  So that's what's going on!  Wait a minute, so that's how all of this pieces together?  And that's why the movie is titled \\"Irreversible\\"!  Incroyable!  I gotta watch this again!  There is a lot of significance in the later scenes of the film (which, of course, in the context of the story, happened before the events in the beginning of the film).  This is not just another T&A, slice-and-dice, bloodfest, but is actually telling us something significant.<br /><br />The movie is extremely brutal, and graphically sexual.  It is disconcerting, because the scenes are being shown in reverse (along the lines of \\"Memento\\"), but do not overlap in content or context the way \\"Memento\\" does.  And that is significant as far as the title is concerned.  But this movie actually makes you think, once the initial shock value (which is rather substantial) wears off.  That's not to say I won't ultimately trade this one in, but only after I've watched it at least one more time.<br /><br />It could be this film borders on brilliant.  If only I could figure out why the camerawork is so weird at the beginning.
B006INDMEE|2.0|I found this movie emminently unwatchable. I'm surprised that none of the reviewers mentioned the exteneded scenes of the nazi war criminal, as a gynocologist in E. Berlin, making polite conversation with the heroine as he gives her a pelvic exam. Not only do they repeat this scene at least 3 times (what was her purported problem anyway?), but the scenes are spoken in German so you don't know what the hell they're talking about! Then there is the scene where the heroine, woozy from just being knocked out by the the escaping nazi, shoots said nazi in the back using a pistol from about a block away, perched on a fire escape no less. A shot like that is simply not realistic. The interpersonal dynamic between the characters is wooden and uninteresting. This movie is badly directed, badly written, and a waste of acting talent.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|like the old missile command game.  I enjoyed it, especially since it was free. I don't know if. could play it every day but it was fun for 20 min
1849163863|5.0|This is an extremely well-crafted,  very intelligent novel. It is so much more than a mere murder mystery/police procedural - Peter May can truly develop three-dimensional characters - with both halos and warts - and this author's sense of location is quite brilliant. His sense of mood and mind-set of the Isle of Lewis - one of the outer Hebrides' slands - is  splendid, both its bleakness and its wonders.  A highly recommended read, and we eagerly await volume two of this new series.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Maximum volume for my computer is barely more than a whisper.  I dont know if thats windows vista, or a defect with this computer.<br />Without this amplifier, the sound level is between 30-55% of hearing level.<br />With it, its more near 65-80%, which is a marked improvement.<br />However, at max volume, I would have expected it to have been deafeningly loud--it isn't.  Again, it could just be a defect with my computer.<br />Im somewhat pleased with my purchase.  At least now I can pretty well hear the movies or television shows I am watching.<br />It's definitely better than it was.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok I looooooooveeee this app.the games awesome I play everyday. my very favorite game is urban skydiver or bouncer.  you guys keep.it up

B005XQLBU4|4.0|overall good game. could potentaily get boring after a while but free is fun need stronger buildings.lol. that would just be too easy though.
B005QBKXSC|5.0|Superstar.  Daughtry has done it again with this album.  Every single song is good, but some are really outstanding, perhaps even better than the hits from the previous CDs.  The highlights of this collection are \\"Crawling Back to You\\", \\"Start of Something Good\\", \\"Gone Too Soon\\", \\"Rescue Me\\", and \\"Spaceship\\".  Chris Daughtry has alot of talent in every area:  writing, vocals, and performing.  By this point, Daughtry has a core of at least a dozen great songs, and they will be performing actively for decades.  If you loved their other highlights, such as \\"Feels Like Tonight\\", \\"September\\", and \\"No Surprise\\", you have got to own this CD.[[ASIN:B005QBKXOQ Break The Spell (Deluxe Version)]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots  of fun so far! I like the fact that there is lots of different options to keep you entertained! Get bored... switch games!
0316056863|3.0|The book is an interesting and often funny combination of memoir and ha-ha how-to.  Tina tries too hard and often to be funny and so for every hit there's a couple of misses. The humor is not that often funny based on what happened, it's Tina trying to write it funny when it isn't.  You can almost hear her voice as you read it.  She's playing the same personality here she does on \\"30 Rock\\" as Liz Lemon, which is, after all, based on her real life as an SNL writer, but it's also the same role as most of her SNL characters except Sarah Palin.  In short there isn't much range to this woman.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just a little tedious.  Although I've always liked her, I don't think she's as funny as most people seem to.  To me she's just very likable and funny, but in a nice way.  Witty, not hilarious. When she tries to get a little raunchy with sexual innuendoes and 4-letter words, it seems a little out of synch and forced.  There's a whole chapter devoted to her co-workers on \\"30 Rock\\" that reads like what should be the book's acknowledgments page except it goes on and on.  She never mentions her husband by name and although he's in a few chapters, and there's even a photo of him, he's never part of the dialog or story which is a shame, because he comes across as mostly irrelevant and it makes Tina seem narcissistic.  She also writes about her hometown, but I don't think she names it.  It's just always \\"my husband\\" and \\"my hometown.\\" Few people are criticized directly, though Tina rants about a lot of types of people.  Surprisingly she does criticize her father in one chapter and that works well.  Her mother is barely mentioned.  She praises many people, but I don't get that much of sense of their relationships.  For example she talks of Alec Baldwin a lot, credits him over and over as the reason 30 Rock gets respect.  But I get no sense of their relationship.  In the end I felt like I didn't really get to know Tina better, just her shtick.  But I'm complaining too much.  Most of the book is interesting, humorous, droll.  Tina does get very serious about only one thing: how women, particularly women comedians, are so badly treated in show biz.  I personally think she leans on this a little too often for it to blend into the rest of the book, or she should have been more serious, more often with other issues.  We get it. Men are jerks. Comediennes are not taken seriously...or comically... whatever.  Obviously it hasn't held her back too much.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Pretty good though a little easy, I stopped trying after day 42 or so and let myself get nuked to end the game. Ran smoothly on my Zoom. I liked Warheads better as free app of the day but this one was good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun and lots of games to play. I would suggest that every body give this game a try. very worth the time to play
B002ZG97LK|5.0|If you can remember the great nights country dancing AND line dancing at the Riverside in Tukwila, then you will appreciate this movie.  I loved both the music AND the dancing in this remake. Ready to cowboy up?
B004UFEJXK|5.0|I have to admit that I did not watch Wall-E until the end of 2011. Why? Because the poster of the movie gave me no clue of what it is about and I thought it is \\"just another animation\\". I was wrong, it is \\"just not another animation\\", it is something I have never seen before (I have seen most of Pixar's animations). The presentation of the story differs from all the computer animations I have seen so far. The movie uses very few dialogues and communicates the story mainly by simple sounds, body language and music. Nevertheless, the story is well told, very interesting and the emotions are well communicated (as least for me). I love the ending too. I am not a professional reviewer but it seems to me that the movie ends on an emotional high instead of rounding up and calming down at the end, quite different from the majority of the animations that I have seen. Again, I am not a professional but it was how I felt.  After watching it, I was so amazed that I bought a blu-ray drive so that I can re-watch Wall-E on blu-ray. I then bought this combo and I like it very much, indeed I think the money was very well spent. I think other reviewers have done a great job in explaining its contents too. If I could, I would have given this movie along with this combo a 6 stars rating.
1934030198|4.0|The book presents some complex training methodology and putting together a training program based on the information and concepts in the book takes days.  Casual triathletes may find this frustrating and potentially overwhelming.  I would figure elite athletes would have coaches to put all this info together for them in the form of a training program.  So who is the book geared to?  Anyone who has had prior, advanced athletic training and is accustomed to periodization training concepts.  Anyone who likes to obsess on their hobbies.  Anyone who intends to take their triathlon training from casual , just wanting to finish - to setting some PRs.  There is a wealth of usefull, interesting and valuable information int this book.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|Some may not agree, but to me, it is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. I like the fact that it did not draw my attention away from the movie but was yet beautiful and memorable enough to motivate me to search for it. Of course, whether the soundtrack is beautiful and memorable or not depends on the individual. But to me, it is a great instrumental work, very interesting, inspiring and touching. It is more than a movie soundtrack, more than just entertainment, it is indeed a piece of art. I commend the good work of John Powell and the performers. Here are my highlights:  This is Berk  Forbidden Friendship (graceful and beautiful beyond words, in-cooperates with the movie so well just like magic)  See You Tomorrow (Not many people highlighted this, it is a very playful piece, I especially like the phrase for which Hiccup entered the hall and all the people flocked to him (at 1:22-1:29), deeply impressed with the timing)  Test Drive  Romantic Flight (same comments as Forbidden Friendship, together they make the two most beautiful pieces to me)  Where's Hiccup? (I like how it slowly transits and builds up to the melody at 0:52 and I like the piano part, it just feels different)  Coming Back Around (very graceful and then very energetic, I can't think of a better music for the ending)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great re-imagining of a classic. This is what it should be, no lame virtual joystick retrofit, but built for touch. Really got my heart pumping and the adrenaline flowing!
B005CGI3ZG|3.0|This item was purchased for my daughter's birthday and she loves it, however the packaging was wrong and season 5 she is missing a disc so really it is not a complete series.  Very disappointing.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|decent games but a whole lot of ads to avoid.<br />but the price (free) makes it worth it. Some of the games are hard, some just irritating.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Awesome game for free. Very challenging in the upper levels.  Works great on the kindle fire! Highly recommend. it to everyone. I do want to add one negative that I found. After I finished playing the game, I let the fire go into sleep mode and I could hear a faint whistle coming from the speakers. Never had that happen before last night, so not sure what caused it but the game was the last thing I played.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Not a bad game, pretty fun.  Some of the games lame, but on a whole worth downloading.  Nothing to complain about...It is FREE!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|i really like this game. it didnt have any issues and was fun to play. i wouls highly recommend this game

0307959856|5.0|What do you get when you mix two great authors together, one from three centuries ago and one from the present day?  You get \\"Death Comes to Penderley\\".  In this book the indomitable Ms. P.D. James combines her long-time admiration of Miss Jane Austen and her writing with her own formidable talent as a writer of top-drawer detective fiction. And the result is one that I think Miss Jane Austen would appreciate if she could see it.  Ms. James takes us to England in the early 1800's and to Pemberley, the home of Mr. and Mrs. Darcy, whom we haven't heard from since we last closed the book entitled \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  And we have a sudden death that occurs on the Pemberley grounds which throws the Darcy's and their considerable staff and far-flung family into a turmoil.  Before the final pages the Darcy's are faced with all kinds of moral and judicial dilemmas, and they are forced to deal with some long-buried emotions.  Ms. James does a remarkable job with this herculean task.  Who else could take on Miss Austen and continue her story written so many years ago?  Ms. James is a remarkable talent, and I have personally enjoyed every one of the many books that she has written.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|decent games. takes too many points to unlock them. snake is hard. lots of ads and offers to sign up for things. meh.

1452101248|4.0|I've been a vegetarian for 40+ years, and this book wowed me. Great pictures, really inventive stuff. I have taken issue, over and over, on cooking times and oven temps. Cover dish as an example: 200 degrees does not get the eggplant soft and supple w/the given times. The Very full tart (delish) at 325 took for-ever to set, and the 450 was kind of harsh to roast the veg. The eggplant/mango/soba noodles were so good I couldn't stop eating them!!
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|Outstanding and as good as his last 2 CDs. He's great! Don't miss it or you will be missing the best music out there.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|That's all fabulous, as simple as that. Great to kill time or whatever. Love it, kids at age 5 like my little sister and up could play it along with a 90 year old
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Most folk should be familiar with the story by now: disgraced left-wing journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired by a wealthy industrialist to find out who killed his beloved niece 40 years ago. Blomquist hires as a research assistant the titular character, Lisbeth Salander, and together the two uncover the hideous and frighening truth.<br /><br />For my money this is a superior version of the rightly celebrated book than the original Swedish cinema version (though I've not seen the extended tv version). David Fincher, the director, places his trademark noirish stamp upon the movie. The result is a dark and exciting film with much to enjoy even for those familiar with the story. But like its fine Swedish predessor it is not an easy watch: as a movie about violence againt women it does not flinch from some harsh depiction of such violence.<br /><br />The cast is stellar, with Daniel Craig doing his charimatic best as Blomkvist. However at its centre this movie has an electrifying performance from Rooney Mara as Lisbeth, catching every nuance of her complex personality from her prickliness to her vulnerablity and tenderness. Its an amazing piece of acting. One must hope that plans are already afoot to permit her to reprise the role in film versions of the rest of the trilogy.
B004OT0YNG|5.0|I purchased this for my grandson's birthday.  He loves legos anyway, so I knew it would be a hit and it really was!  At his party,.. he opened his gifts and his daddy saved the lego gift for last.  When he opened it, he literally jumped for joy, and later, not knowing I was listening, I heard him telling one of his friends, \\"My Grandma ALWAYS buys the best gifts!\\"  So, I pretty much think that, that says it all!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun and eventful. u are able to play for hours and not have to continue playing the same game onerous and over.
B006SVHOL8|1.0|Paid for HD but the movie was below standard def and stopped more times than I could count. Of course I was charged $4.99for HD. Looks like Amazon hasno customer service department so I'll have to cancel charge on my card. Pain in the A$$!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game and responsive touch controls. Addictive game that brings back arcade memories! I would recommend this game to anyone of any age.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I absolutely do love this app. I use it every day. It totally guides all decisions about my wardrobe and activities with very accurate information. Thank you so much for providing it to us!!!!!!
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app is okay, but TubeMate is much better - has all features of the paid version of this app, but for free.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. And I like how if you get stuck, you can use a hint. But you can only use so many. Game is worth the dollar.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|The Digital Copy promised expired November 30, 2011.  Movie is excellent, getting both DVD and BluRay is great.  Not getting the promised Digital Copy nor advice of it's expiration in negligent and is misrepresents the value vs cost.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great fun. runs smooth. sound effects are solid and graphics are good. gets more challenging as you go. my 6 and 7 year olds enjoy it too.
1419702238|5.0|I purchased this for my 12 year old grandson for Christmas. He is a fan of the series and was very happy. He finished the book in short order and is waiting for the next one.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|great app and even better for FREE. : ) only suggestion is that it could run a little faster in between boards
B005XQLBU4|3.0|the game reminds me of another game from the past but this version is much better than that one. a good game to pass the time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|good graphics, strategy and overall game play was perfect. The only thing it needs more of is a continue from a previous night so you don't have to start back at day one and repeat all the easy levels.
B000F9RB9Y|3.0|The original terminator would not say is the greatest sci-fi movie ever but nonetheless a decent introduction to the franchise.  It is pretty interesting and the sci-fi effects are good but of course nothing like T-2.  I know that the sci-fi movie business was just getting going in the mid 80's so I am not criticizing the movie on behalf of that.  If your a fan of the terminator movies and have not seen it be sure to do so but otherwise look towards T-2, or T-3 for a more impressive sci-fi viewing experience.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
0812992792|3.0|The novel is interesting in the sense, that it takes us on a trip into a world, that is a totally closed society which we know little of....and I'm sure most yearn to read more about, whether truth or fiction.   As such, Mr. Johnson does well in breaking new ground, and although his literary skills are well in evidence, I found myself begging to get into a theme or naration that would keep me interested, especially after 100 or so pages.  The book meanders throughout, many of the developments I found unplausable...but not knowing much of NK, could be normal, even in a work of fiction.  Well written, even if the story did bounced all over the place, however it could not get my juices flowing, and I found myself putting it aside several times in order to finish the book
B003L16FAE|3.0|I am not a big fan of Science Fiction movies but the Predator is fairly entertaining. It must be around the top of ground breaking films when it comes to the sci-fi library and industry. By the late 80's to early 90's more science fiction movies were being made as technology became more advanced. My favorite sci-fi move to date is T-2, which is a much more well rounded movie than this in my opinion.  Overall if you are a fan of these types of films or one of Schwarzenegger, then think you could enjoy it but for the more casual sci-fi fan look towards some more recent releases for a more well rounded experience.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B0029LB2V4|4.0|Well, it took me a long time to finally getting around to watching the Tudors, but I finally did since it comes with my prime membership.  I have mixed feelings, but no reservations about the quality of the production, it is top-notch, they did a beautiful job, but I love period dramas from this era.  The costumes and settings were just something to really marvel at, and some very fine performances as well.  The only thing that I didn't like so much was the way some of the characters behaved, they were a bit depraved, but not all of them thankfully! There is more than a little violence in here.  But, if you can deal with that, it is very worth the time to watch!  Thanks Amazon.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this installed on every Android I touch.  First installed for me by a tmobile tech that knows I love scripture, I now have it installed on over 8 devices.  Works great on my Kindle Fire and another Android tablet I have as well.  Posting direct to Facebook and the highlighting features the most.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|i didn't install it cus it said it required full internet access permission.  why is that?  There's no link to ask the developer so just left an even rating of 3 stars.  dev can emai me if they want ebaybuying6 (at) gmail dot com
B0031RS2HC|4.0|The world needs a Jack Reacher, thanks Lee Child!  I have recently discovered the author and really enjoy his books, also just love the character. A no nonsense drifter who solves the City / Towns problems he wonders through. The story is solid and difficult to predict which keeps you reading, thinking wow, I would love for this guy to wonder through our town. It is a very entertaining book and one I have recommended to my fellow reading friends knowing that they will be captivated by Jack Reacher!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I read the Bible every day and this is most helpful.  I can listen while I   read.  But I prefer to study the NRSV.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thus app is very handy.  I love the variety of versions available! The reading plans are a wonderful aspect of this app ad well. The many resources available are a wonderful asset to my study time in the Word. Highly recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I got this app for free and it is a decent app.  the games are fun.  and it pass the time
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is the best. I love how you can choice what game you can play there are a lot of games in one.
0756686970|5.0|My son (age 9) got this for Christmas as a gift. It is wonderful. Very detailed, very well organized. I got my son some colored pencils and he has been coloring the inside and back covers for fun. Out of all the LEGO books/Star Wars books my son has this is probably in his top 5 of favorites!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is an absolute must for any android device. Thanks to evernote, I'm able to record and categorize a variety of important - but fleeting - thoughts for later review on a variety of platforms.
0439023521|5.0|When I first heard about this series I wasn't that intersted in it.  In my experience the things the majority of people just LOVE tend to be things that aren't really that intersting to me.  However, my husband read it and raved about it so I figured it was worth a shot.  I couldn't put it down, read it in about a day and am looking forward to reading the next two.  I only wish I shelled out and bought it in hard cover!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun and addictive game. It reminded me of missile command with a few twist. Very responsive controls and descent graphics.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app so many games and stuff to do and you don't need Internet to play,you know why because its awsome
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its very cool game . I LOVE the black bird. its so a five star.it is my favorite game so toately. a awesome game
1451627289|5.0|I actually finished this one a little before Christmas, but it's taken me a bit to get to writing this. Stephen King's most recent novel (a big one, at that, over 800 pages), titled 11/22/63 deals with the idea of the Kennedy assassination being prevented. Remember, this is King we're talking about, so clearly how this comes about is a bit outlandish, but also tons of fun.<br /><br />It follows Jake Epping, a thirty-five year old high school English teacher in present day, who through a series of events is introduced to a sort of time portal located inside the pantry of a roadside diner. This portal is invisible to the naked eye, and always brings the traveler to a specific day in September, 1958, no matter how many times they walk through the portal. The diner owner, Al, convinces Jake to travel back to 1958 and live in the past for five years with the sole intent of hindering Lee Harvey Oswald from killing the president on November 22, 1963. Kennedy being such an influential and well-liked president, they are overcome with curiosity as to what the world would be like now had he lived to complete his presidency. Among other reasons, they debate that events like the Vietnam War might be avoided altogether, thus possibly saving thousands of lives, and changing the future in enormous ways.<br /><br />A large portion of the novel is spent on Jake's life in the past, which is painted with amazing clarity and nostalgia by King. This is fitting because King himself would have been about 16 years old when Kennedy was killed, so he does a great job of expressing the general attitude of the 50's and 60's while including many of the simple pleasures of the time, as well as some of the darker realities like the tension of heavy racism in the country.<br /><br />King rarely lets a novel pass these days without at least hinting another of his works within the story (his fans know all of his work is encompassed within the `King Universe'), and 11/22/63 is no exception. Fans of IT and Insomnia will notice some fun and significant connections when Jake passes through Derry, Maine on his way down to Dallas, TX.<br /><br />Time travel is a tricky subject to get right, but I think King's take on it is unique and well executed. The `Butterfly Effect' is discussed and pondered much throughout the novel, as well as the continual theme that `the past is obdurate.' It doesn't want to be changed, and perhaps even `fights' to keep things on course. I won't divulge whether Jake succeeds in his mission or not, but I can say that the future is changed merely by his presence in the past and the consequences are a bit unexpected.<br /><br />From the earliest pages of the book, you can't help but start devising your own ideas about how our world might be different if Kennedy had lived, along with an intense curiosity on how King would interpret those differences. Again, without spoiling it: he threw me for a loop. I had two basic paths in mind as to where the novel would go, and it didn't end up being either one of them. But I will say it was a delight to be so surprised and not get the ending I was expecting, and also that I think it was the right ending. But you can decide for yourself on that one.<br /><br />Overall, it was a very enjoyable book. It gave me quite a pleasant `experience' living in the past and getting to enjoy bits and pieces of how things worked back then. That may seem like a simple way to put it, but that's really how it felt. King's characters are always so real, they act and speak and think like real people, so you don't mind just `hanging out' with them for a while, even if the plot is not directly moving forward. Remember, Jake had about four and a half years to kill before getting to his mission, but King doesn't just blur over this, he brings it to life and makes it fun. The book is part fantasy, part science fiction, part historical novel and all imagination. It amazes me that King is still churning out such large, lively books every year at his age. But in my humble opinion he's still in top form.n top form.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I was looking for the slot to insert my quarters!  This one has a few different twists, but I could see myself playing this over and over.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Controls are not very smooth...you can tell the game creators were running out of ideas.  it can be fun, but could use some work.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Really simple game yet challenging in every level and has just enough difficulties to over come. A good game to kill time.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Didn't bother reading through the negative tripe littering this album here on the site, as I'm sure most of it is from non-fans who expect their bands to play music exactly how they want it. I found this CD to be another step forward in the evolution of Rob Zombie, as he's no longer just trying to bash our brains in with heavier-than-thou riffs (although Tracks 7 and 9 would beg to differ). The best songs are Track 10 - an ominous piano, slide guitar and sludgy guitars make this a lovely romp through the dirtiness of Zombie's mind - and Track 11, which is a cacophony of slow - but screeching - guitars, Zombie's chanting and an unpredictable ending that sounds like the band simply jammed it out and called it an album. Get this to hear how Rob has tinkered his sound.
0385534639|4.0|The Night Circus is, by far, the most aesthetically pleasing novel I have ever encountered. Every sentence is flooded with sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. Morgenstern literally transports you, body and soul, to the world of the circus and it is hard to escape. I had to force myself to put the book down and take breaks in fear of devouring it too quickly and missing out on the true experience.<br /><br />For me, the plot was drawn out longer than I would have liked. The characters are outrageously delicious and the story lines of each character intersect almost perfectly with one another. However, because the narration jumps from character to character so rapidly from chapter to chapter, I missed out on a lot of character development and relationship development. Many of the major plot points were jolting and sometimes seemed out of place because of the lack of in depth development between characters. I wished for a deeper connection to each character since my connection to the circus became so strong.<br /><br />That being said, the story inspired me. Reaffirming to the reader the importance of love, timing, and the written word itself. You are never too old to believe in magic. The Night Circus guides you to the iron gates of believing again. And Morgenstern gives you no choice but to enter.
B000NDEXOI|4.0|Skid Row won't ever by Motley Crue or Def Leppard, but they made competent, almost-stoner metal. The first two songs are the ones that made this band huge, and they are interestingly enough unlike the rest of the record: \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" is a shoutalong with fiery guitars, while \\"18 and Life\\" is arena-ready ballad-making at its finest. Otherwise, look for plenty of thick riffs and an overall good effort.
0060526491|5.0|...is anything but melancholy.<br /><br />If you are a Tim Burton fan in any stretch of the imagination, this book is a must read. I eagerly opened the first page of the miniature hard bound book and didn't put it down until each poem resonated through me. In every poem there is a lesson, a story, and a message to any reader. Each poem is easily accessible by any reader.<br /><br />As a Burton fan it is also a wonderful opportunity to get a peak into Tim's own mind and world. By pouring his soul into each poem, the reader is able to feel their own little personal connection to the world famous director.<br /><br />It is reminiscent of Shel Silverstein's or Edward Gorey's poetry. It can either be extremely sweet, extremely sad, touching, or disturbing.<br /><br />A definite must have for your book shelf. It's great for conversation starters or for lonely rainy days. You will love every page.
B000001EHS|5.0|Def Leppard had it all: huge guitars that could either propel a firebreather or hold up a ballad. They are the quintessential 80's metal group, and anyone who is a fan of this genre should love everything they'll find on this disc.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's easy to play on my kindle fire.  Loads quickly and it can be challenging or simple depending on which deal you choose.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game is both simple yet challenging.  a great combination for hours of fun.  I need a few more word for the review.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is a good remix of the old Missile Command game. The graphics are clean, the game play is smooth, and I like the fact that you can repair your buildings and upgrade your defenses. The difficulty starts off pretty slow, but quickly scales up.   Don't know if would pay for it, but definitely worth the download as the FAOTD.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Good game. Very good faceplate and atmosphere. The difficulty ramps up nicely. I only wish there was better support for tablets/large screens.
1423140591|5.0|Love the book and the author. Favorite book of the series. Waiting for the movie. Got this book on audio and in print. Amazon had the best price around.
0142410705|5.0|This book is considered one of John Green's lesser books, but I personally enjoy it more than some of his others. There is just so much humor in this book, and it's a fun read. I enjoyed the footnote-type style that he took with this book. There is a bit of strong language in this book, so it probably wouldn't be best for younger kids, but it is enjoyable other than that.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app has games for every type of person, and the games provide a challenge so you will not get bored
0525478817|5.0|This was an amazing book. It was definitely a sad book; I cried more during this book than any other I've ever read, but there is a lot of humor that comes with it. The characters are wonderful and realistic.   This is definite must-read not only for John Green fans but for anyone. This book doesn't have as strong language as some of his other books, which I personally liked.  The Fault in Our Stars is absolutely wonderful!
B004UID2LC|4.0|Its cool that you can save your favorite videos! I was using this and it work pretty well on my kindle fire. I like this app, but I don't love it.
B000002GXS|5.0|One of his best CD's. Get it before they run out. I listen to it over and over. I live in San Diego County and especially enjoyed his songs about the area. A great poet.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is wonderful. My children just LOVE this game! I recomend this game to everyone that have children or grandchildren!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|- good that you can upgrade bldgs. and weapons.  there should be a save button between levels so we can come back later and not have to play a game to completion
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Shipped quickly. Great quality. Very happy with the price. Item arrived as described and in a timely manner. We love this movie!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Great for looking around at Wifi networks, their security levels, channels, strength.<br /><br />Great for walking around your home and determining who's nearby home is interfering with your network, and on what channel you can best set your router.<br /><br />Great for finding dead zones at work, or anywhere.<br /><br />With the optional Connector Library, you can click on a net and connect.<br /><br />There are many tools like this, surely, but this one's simplicity and ease of use (we call that \\"usability\\" in the biz) put it ahead of the rest.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a colorful, sharp-looking, modern version of Missile Command that has been designed to work great with touch screens. I've installed on my Kindle Fire and find a 7\\" screen to be a nearly perfect size for this game. Allowing upgrades to weapons and being able to rebuild adds extra challenge because you need to think strategically. Watch out for and always get those nukes!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and free, ads are mildly annoying but easy to ignore. I Qm rating the game so I can get more points to unlock more game time.
1451627289|5.0|I loved this story, and even at 849 pages, it didn't seem long.  However, it contained many minor, and a couple of major factual and logistical errors.......Here are a few examples which disturbed me....  1.  When he recounted the results of the 1958 World Series, beginning on page 253 he said the score of game one was 1-0 for Milwaukee over the Yankees.  In fact, Milwaukee scored one run in the 10th inning to win that game 4-3.  2.  On page 264, he says the score of game six was 2-1 for the Yankees.  In fact, the Yankees scored two runs in the top of the 10th inning, Milwaukee scored one on the bottom of the 10th, and the Yankees won that game 4-3.  It looks like King, when reviewing the box scores of both games, confused the 10th inning scores with the totals.  3.On page 338,in the summer of 1961, George Amberson is enjoying a Ritchie Valens song, and comments that Valens had been dead for \\"almost two years\\".  In fact, Valens died on February 3, 1959 so he had been dead for two and a half years.  4.  On page 306, George refers to the \\"Maine license plate on his car\\"...Then on page 335, Miz Mimi comments on the \\"Florida plates on your auto\\"......  I could give more examples, but would have to include spoilers, but you get the idea.  This is a great book that could have used better proof-reading........
0691152640|5.0|If only history didn't repeat itself! In \\"This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,\\" the authors look at how we deceive ourselves again and again by convincing ourselves that the economic laws of nature have been repealed. They haven't! People are always trying to create something out of nothing, information is always imperfect, and basic laws of supply and demand and utility re-assert themselves.  I found this book fascinating in the threads that it wove together, dating from the Middle Ages to today. Anytime someone wants to argue that we are in a new era, or anytime someone wants to sell you something because everything is different than is ever before, this book should be on hand as an easy rebuttal.
0525478817|5.0|I went into this book having no idea what it was about. All I knew was, John Green had come out with a new book and that was enough for me. So, I'm going to give all of you the same option I had to just be completely surprised and blown away. All I will say is that this was both the funniest and saddest book I have ever read. I laughed out loud, I cried real tears . . . sometimes at the same time. This is a brilliant book. John Green, you are my hero!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|A great time killer that is both easy and challenging. All its missing is different enviornments and a few surprises as you get to higher levels.
0307891372|5.0|skyrim, elder scrolls v might be the best rpg game i have ever played. the graphics are great, the story line is terrific,you are in complete control of how you want to live your rpg life.  this game may last 300 hrs or longer.  what a huge world there is here.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it this has many awesome games it is a very good game I am so glad someone reccomended it
B004LROMSY|3.0|This show got cancelled after just this one season. It is rather unfortunate because it was interesting. It is a mythological show of course and not history in the slightest. But then niether are the written tales of king Author! The real one was a warlord in Britain who was defending the british against the invading anglo saxons and engles. At least the time period is right, it's taking place in the early 500's or late 400's A.D.  The show is mainly a drama and it's budget precludes any big battles. BUt then even the excellent 'game of thrones' doesn't have big battles in it! The story mainly revolves around King Author and his love affair with gwen. Merlin is depicted as more bloodthirsty than usual in this one and that may make people unhappy. It's a decent show though and it should have gotten a chance for a second season. Unfortunately this is all there is. The blu ray looks great as it should and there are extras on here. The acting is pretty good in this one and that's not a problem either.
086571701X|5.0|I bought this book and devoured it in two days. It is an excellent guide to getting started in Aquaponic Gardening. There are guidelines for size of fish tank and stocking to the amount of grow beds you will need. There are excellent comparisons of different media types as well as the types of pumps and ways to recirculate the tank water through the beds. If you are looking for specific plans this is not the book. If you want a manual to allow you to customize the materials you have into a workable system this is the book for you. Highly Recommended!!!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|This game sounded really cool based on all the reviews until I installed it and immediately got a push ad in my notification bar.
B005HSL626|5.0|highly addictive! I loved this game the moment I got it, I couldn't stop playing! three different modes to play on. the fun never ends. arcade mode is the best. slicing fruit can be fun! get it as quick as possible!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was recommended to me by multiple friends so i finally gave in and decided to read it and i must say im glad that i did! in the beginning i had a hard time with the style of writing. the author kept switching back and forth between past and present and not in a very fluid manner. However by chapter 6 all resistance was futile. I was so impressed with the author`s imagination that i always had to know what was going to happen next. I couldn`t stop thinking about the characters and the story! This book was definitely worth my time. The entire trilogy was for that matter. A must read!
B005XQLBU4|2.0|this game has good graphics but all you do is shoot misuls at other misuls.save your time and don't download this app
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game points hard to get sometimes bit it is fun to play when.u are bored. four stars I believe
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Great way to pass the time.There are many games to choose from.It is some what difficult to unlock the games.
B001661RC2|4.0|In listening to tracks on their albums here I have to say these are guys are solid. This is the way music used to be - original music played with heart and soul - musicians who are actual musicians who write and play their own music. I miss those long ago days when albums were anthems to life and people were more concerned about that than getting their names up in lights by wearing stupid costumes and writing crap (i.e. lady gag me). Rock on and keep strong Black Keys!
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|im so happy about my producted i ordered it about a wk ago and got it a day after it shipped and it was supposed to take 14 days.. i love this company i always get my stuff early and its always as described..used but perfect like new thank u from me and my kids...:)

B0054JZC6E|2.0|this looks like a fun app, but i don't know since i can't install it, even with a wifi connection.
B000005HFH|3.0|I bought this hoping to find the same intensity present in his horn music.....not so much. Not that is isn't very pleasant..... it is! Relaxing and low  energy....and that's the problem: low energy. He had a sweet voice....(sweeter horn!), but I just don't get the impression he was that \\"INTO\\" this music. All depends on what you are looking for, I suppose. For easy listening \\"Pop\\" music with a bluesey note, this is just super. For die-hard Chet Baker fans, maybe not so great. Quality of the recording is good. Just not Chet at his best, for my money.  Would I buy it again? Maybe....just for the ultimate smooth background.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|i loved this app, had no problems with it. it was rather large so when i beat it i uninstalled it. overall a very fun take on match 3 games.

0307278255|4.0|These stories are about Bengali immigrants from the Bengal area of India, around Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). But these folks are not urban slumdogs or even rural slumdogs, arriving with manure on their shoes. These are high-end folks with PhD's and MD's who grew up speaking English in India and who came to the USA to be doctors, professors and engineers in the high-tech beltway bandit firms around Boston. There is a lot of local color of the modern Boston suburbs. The Bengalis live in upscale suburbs like Lexington in modern glass houses with acreage overlooking the Massachusetts woods and coastline. Their children will go to prep academies and then on to Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr as a prelude to rounding out their pedigree with a graduate degree from an Ivy. And these high-achievers do indeed expect their children to do so. In fact, one story is about a family's shame when a son becomes an alcoholic and a drop-out. There's a twist to saying these stories are about \\"immigrants\\" because these folks were fully assimilated into the global upper class before they even arrived in the USA.<br /><br />Still, there are ethnic ties that persist. They return to India each summer with the kids and some return to India to live. They bear the stigma of being identifiably Indian in the context of American culture. The book is made up of interconnected stories  that we assume are quasi-autobiographical for the (female) author. They vary from the classic immigrant saga to those in which the ethnic factor is attenuated and incidental to the story.<br /><br /> One of these stories is about little girls whose mothers drag them to American birthday parties in their saris and yet they grow up to have affairs with married men. In another story a woman married to an American wrestles with the dilemma of the Indian expectation of having her father come to live with her after the death of her mother. In another, a daughter reflects on her mother's romance with a male immigrant. A sister makes the mistake of letting her alcoholic brother babysit for her in London. A young man is so devastated by his mother's early death and his father's remarriage that he becomes a global nomad, wandering and essentially homeless. In another story a young woman learns her boyfriend is a philanderer and in another a woman turns away from her married lover after ten years of promises that he will leave his wife. (Is that a record?) With the head start they had, these Bengali immigrants became Americanized very quickly and how that happened is a fascinating saga.<br /><br />The title is from a quote by Nathaniel Hawthorne that is worth repeating: \\"Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn-out soil. My children have had other birthplaces, and, so far as their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.\\"etting her alcoholic brother babysit for her in London.

B0064NTZQ2|1.0|Just like in the story \\"The Emperor Has no Clothes\\" everyone is afraid to state the obvious, and the obvious in the case of \\"Drive\\" is that this movie is the WORST ALL TIME MOVIE, EVVVVVER!!!!  This movie is billed as an action movie; but what it is is a big time snooze fest.  For a story that's about a guy who is a stunt driver by day, and a get-a-way driver by night, it's absolutely amazing just how BORING(!!!) this dredge of a movie is.  Even the opening get away scene (which definitely does set the tone for the entire movie) has no excitement, or anticipation, built into it.  The scene was a kin to watching the O.J. Simpson white bronco \\"chase\\" scene.  And that comparison is actually an insult to the white bronco chase scene, as at least the bronco chase scene had a sense excitement and anticipation to it.  There is absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters/actors.  All of the characters are losers and we, the viewers, are given absolutely no reason, what so ever, to care one tiny bit about any of the characters.  Ryan Gosling (sp?) tries his best to channel Clint Eastwood's \\"man with no name,\\" and few words, and fails MISERABLY(!!!).  This was my first Ryan Gosling movie, and very likely my last. I've always heard what a terrific actor Gosling is suppose to be.  Well, based on his performance in this train wreck of a movie, if Gosling is the future of movie making, it's no wonder that Hollywood is floundering so badly.  The only anticipation I derived from this abominable waste of celluloid, was waiting for the wonderful Christina Hendricks to make her appearance (how she got herself roped into this garbage is beyond me).  But alas, even the desire to see the beautiful Ms. Hendricks wasn't even enough to get me to stay in my seat.  I couldn't take it any longer.  I walked out, and got my money back, without ever seeing Ms. Hendricks (which was probably a good thing, as if I saw her in this horrible movie, my opinion of her may have nose dived as well).  This is not a movie to waste your time, or your money, on.  If you're thinking of buying this terrible excuse of a movie, Please, please, please do yourself a favor, and DON'T DO IT!!!  If you feel you just have to waste 2 hrs of your life that you'll never get back, and have nothing to show for it, then at least save yourself some money and go rent it from Red Box for a $1 (and even paying a dollar for this horrible movie is a dollar too much!!!).  Giving this movie even a one star rating is being too generous.  If you still want to buy, and watch, this movie, don't say you weren't warned.

1401223176|5.0|In short this comic book had amazing art work and it was interesting enough to enjoy. I loved the involvement of a wide range of characters, some good and some bad... Although the ending has a bit of a nice twist to it, it also can be looked at as a bit of an upset(people know batmans identity that shouldn't IMO)... Also, didn't like the whole love interest thing between batman and catwoman i guess because i expect batman to always be a bad a** character and not sprung out over love even though this wouldn't be the first time, but with that being said, the involvement with catwoman sure doesn't take away from this novels action and fun. A nice read indeed! felt it needed more than a 4 star rating, but less than a 5 and seeing as i couldn't give a 4.5 then 5 it is!
B001DUDKEY|2.0|I thought the lead woman did a terrible, wooden portrayal of Anne and was mis-cast for this part. It was the only time I really didn't want the hero to \\"get the girl\\", she wasnt' worth getting.  Her young sailor was wonderful, but there was no evident love or sensual tension between them.  It made the ending abrupt and unbelievable.  It was also filmed very darkly, literally, not figuratively.  But rather than being moody and setting period ambiance, many of the scenes were just dark - making the characters hard to see.  This was annoying.    I hope someone attempts this script again, only with a new lead woman, better lighting and with more visible tension between the leads to make their love story believable. This copy went to the Good Will.
B004YOEFG8|1.0|This was just awful.  The 3d effects are few and far between.  The content is boring, its only about the building and maintenance of the telescope...not actually images of what the scope sees.
0451197968|4.0|I heard about this book after I read the currently very popular, Hunger Games Trilogy. Someone mentioned that this book was similar, but perhaps a little more adult version and it came a lot earlier.  Of course, I was intrigued.  Fresh off my previous addiction, I decided I needed to read this - right away.  There were so many comparisons drawn and people kept saying this book was much better.<br /><br />So of course, I downloaded the Running Man right away via my Kindle. I was not disappointed.  From the beginning, it went straight into the plot.  It is an alternate future with many similarities to our own.  People faced desperate times and were going to great lengths to just stay alive.  It kind of reminds you of current events. This book read very quickly and definitely made me think. I finished it in about 3-4 hours.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the forward did give away the ending and also I didn't necessarily like this ending, but it probably was the best that this type of book could give for an ending.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />I was upset that at the end, the hero really got screwed. He got even but it was disappointing because I got so attached to him. I was hoping after reading the Hunger Games, I could find a book that was as interesting but would end happily, I guess. I felt really invested into the main character.  He kept hitting all kinds of road blocks but was so clever about figuring ways out of almost certain doom.  It seemed unfair that he had so many odds stacked against him. I liked the book very much, but again I was angry at what happened.<br /><br />In the end, this book was still so gripping and engrossing, I would still recommend this to people who like books similar to the Hunger Games.
B001UV4XI8|3.0|The Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 1 DVD takes several minutes to load.  This is rare and unusual since all the other DVD's play immediately. I question whether the disc may be defective;  however, the movie is great.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|This is an excellent book, very well-written.  Normally I would have looked at the description, thought it looked great, but not spent the money for it because I'd want to read more than the sample to see if I'd like it.  So I was fortunate to get it on sale through my Amazon Kindle, and boy am I glad I did!  However, don't read the book just because it has a fantastic tale about a boy and a tiger sharing a lifeboat.  It does, but there's a lot of stuff first, including a lot of background about the boy's life in India living at a zoo, and how he decides to be Christian, Muslim, and Hindu simultaneously.<br /><br />The book doesn't promote any particular religion, and if anything, makes those who are dogmatic about one faith or another seem somewhat foolish compared this young boy with his simple faith.  I found this part of the book to be quite compelling.  However, I know religion is a sensitive topic for many people.  If you happen to be deeply religious and would be offended, or you are an avowed atheist and don't want to read anything about it, then you should skip this book.  Otherwise, I do highly recommend it.  It would also be a great book for a book club, by the way -- lots to talk about!

0307387178|5.0|Jon Krakauer paints a very vivid picture of Chris McCandless in his book Into the Wild.  Having read this over the course of two days, I was immediately drawn to the subject matter of an idealistic young man trying to live out an idyllic life in the wilderness of Alaska.  Having myself been interested in the work of the Transcendental movement, the common spokesmen typically being Thoreau and Emerson (who as a teenager was a hero of mine) the thought that someone living in modern times, with no formal survival training and had actually tried to live out similar ideals, was appealing.  Karakauer's writing style is journalistic in nature and his strengths lie mostly with his very thorough investigations into the subject.  To his credit, even when he is reflecting on his own experiences in comparison to McCandless's he does exhibit a great deal of case solving as it were to come to his conclusions.  His forward is key also to understanding his own stance on McCandless's last days and for those who may have skipped reading it I suggest you go back and read it as it does prepare the reader well for the journey they are about to embark upon.<br /><br />Like many stories of this nature, the call of the wild uncharted territories of the world is hard to deny for young men like McCandless.  In fact at a young age he was drawn to stories like Call of the Wild by Jack London, but the thing that sets Into the Wild apart from that literary classic is that this is real.  Krakauer sheds light onto the complex and almost paradoxical ideals that conflicted within McCandless throughout his life.  He avoids romanticizing Chris, but manages to not gloss over him, to define him as a stubborn inexperienced thrill seeker.  Most of the drama inherent in the book is due to the stories of Chris himself as recounted by his family and those who came to know him during brief encounters along his travels, and not the way that Krakauer writes the book, though it is very well written.  Chris certainly left a huge impact on those around him, and this is clear throughout.<br /><br />McCandless's own uncompromising views on life and humanity seem to also be mirrored in the unforgiving life or death landscape in which he chose to venture into his final days.  In many ways I had to consciously remind myself that this was a work of non-fiction.  Just as dreams inform the dreamer of the unconscious powers lying beneath the surface of waking life, and influencing them, so the wilderness seems to stir in mankind a longing for a chance to rekindle the passion for base survival in modern day living.  But again Krakauer manages to maintain an even line between what each person's perception of who Chris McCandless was, and what drove him to make the choices he did.  In the end, the voices of those who knew Chris or spent time with him ring the loudest.  One in particular was an old man who after having only known Chris for a very brief time, pleaded with the young adventurer to be his grandfather.  His subsequent account of what happened after learning of McCandless's death by starvation in the wilderness is the kind of thing that resonates at the despair that only a parent could feel at losing their one and only child.  Both heart wrenching and filled with anguish.  A feeling I won't long forget after having a brief glimpse of it through Krakauer's account.<br /><br />As much as there is a balance to the narrative, it becomes apparent that Krakauer seemed to be seeking just as many answers as McCandless's family was and it becomes evident as the book begins drawing to a close that there is a sincere and deep respect for allowing those that knew Chris to tell his story rather than Krakauer feeding the readers his own loose ideas of what had happened.  Like any good journalist, he takes the facts presented and draws several possible conclusions, and though he shares his own thoughts to the readers, he ultimately lets them decide as to who or what they think about McCandless.  You may find a similar problem with this book that I encountered.  You may have trouble putting it down.  Either way, I would highly recommend Into the Wild, though be warned that not only is it emotionally draining, it will linger with you long after you read it.r problem with this book that I encountered.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|My 10 year-old daughter has a kindle fire and got this app. Although not educational, she really enjoys it. You start with 10 games of the 117 games featured on the app. When you play games you get points which you use to unlock more games. She really likes this app and says that all of the games are fun. The only bad thing about this app is as you unlock more pages of games the amount of points needed to unlock them gets higher, which means it takes longer to unlock them. But other than that, I highly recommend this app.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Cool app like the old atari game. Like that you can upgrade defenses and rebuild cities. Performance on my Motorola admiral is great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it. it works as it should, no glitches. I plan on upgrading to the better games, like freecell and spider solitaire. that is all for now, enjoy!

B000FDEU12|5.0|Gently Disturbed is the album that made Avishai Cohen explode on the European Jazz scene, attracting huge crowds and expanding way beyond the traditional jazz audience. And yet Continuo, the album that preceded Gently Disturbed is the one I find the most interesting, perhaps because the blend of musical cultures is slightly more pronounced.  It's no surprise that Avishai Cohen and his trio are adept at drawing from multiple influences: Cohen himself is Israeli born and bred but came to musical prominence in New York City backing the likes of Chick Corea. Sam Barsh started classical piano before switching to jazz with a blend of funk, r&b and groove on top. These threads are immediately apparent when you listen to his playing. Mark Guiliana is a New Jersey born drummer with fingers in both the jazz and the rock pies and adept at mixing both. Maybe this overview of the trio give you a sense of the musical blend I was talking about earlier. The addition of Amos Hoffman on Oud on a couple of tracks adds the little bit of spice that makes Continuo exotic.  What I like about the music on Continuo is that it's uncompromisngly melodic without being tame. It seems to me that Jazz has a complicated relationship with melody because it's a necessary element that you must nonetheless kill if you can. Avishai Cohen's trio manages both to perfection in my opinion. Fans of exploratory jazz improvisation might feel frustrated I guess, but for me the limited level of \\"out\\" is just right. Listen to Nu Nu, the opener: slow dirge intro to strong syncopated oriental melody gives to hard groove with oud and bass improvisations. There's variety and entertainment without compromise.  Avishai Cohen demonstrates that even in the 21st century you can play jazz with integrity but without necessarily sacrificing listenability. You can also play a jazz that draws from very varied influences without compromising the essential jazz nature of the music. That's what excites me about this record, and- to be honest - the two Avishai Cohen records that followed.
B000BDLJBU|5.0|I tripped over my headphone cord when it was plugged into the laptop.  Thankfully it didn't take out the motherboard, just the headphone cord.  I began looking for right-angle plugs, which are rare.<br /><br />I would never have paid so much (~$8) for a replacement plug if I hadn't read the other reviews.  They were right -- for something so small, everything about it is well-designed.<br />  1) internal nylon piece for strain relief also has a divider to keep the soldered \\"right\\" and \\"left\\" wires from touching<br />  2) outer nickel case is in two halves with threads on the outside.  You would never expect the threads to align but they do perfectly.<br />  3) rubber end piece looks way too small to put a wire through.  But the rubber is flexible so it makes a tight fit, mostly to have a finished look but also to keep moisture out.<br />  4) the nickel feels pretty strong<br /><br />It's as if they had a mechanical engineering contest and this was the best entry.  The build quality is so good that (if I don't lose it), it'll probably be in use on my next pair of headphones.

0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle's autobiography \\"American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History\\" presents a glimpse into the life of a U.S. Navy SEAL, which is extremely interesting without going into the gory details of battle.  This monograph touches on the training and the war from the author's point of view.  He describes the intensity of the training of a SEAL while adding the humorous accounts of being surrounded by a herd of sea lions and then later having a shark attack his swim fin.  Kyle goes into detail about the warrior concept of having to prove yourself to other members of a SEAL platoon, from the physical abuse to acceptance within a warrior ethos oriented society.  Kyle then presents his mental and physical desires to fight in a war.  The patience required of a hunter and the sociology of watching the enemy targets to learn and know when the time is right for squeezing the trigger.  The psychology of a sniper who becomes, through his own experiences, one of the many snipers who protected our soldiers and saved lives by taking precision shots to remove enemy targets.<br /><br />This monograph is an excellent study of the warrior ethos and blends humor, tragedy, and patriotism into a very easily read book about war.  All of the emotions of love and war are blended with additional writings from his wife Taya, which presents her concerns, trials and fears concerning her husband far away fighting terrorism in foreign lands.  A very good book for the casual reader who is not concerned about the details of minutia that would be very pleasing to a research historian.  I highly recommend this book and would rate it at 4 1/2 to 5 stars.

It is very focused on small local companies (pastry baking and the like) and gives excellent, readily actionable advice for this type of business.

Still a good reference for would-be entrepreneurs.

B0012GMW3Y|5.0|This has always been my favorite Byrds album.  Younger Than Yesterday may be more brilliant, at least it places, and Untitled may have more great tracks, but Notorious Byrd Brothers holds together better as an album.  I'm surprised that none of the prior reviewers mentioned Trying to Get to You, which to my mind may be the best track on the album, with a terrific McGuinn vocal.  The version of Goin' Back here--with the brief but memorable Kevin Kelly drum break right before the end--is definitive.  Draft Morning, Old John Robertson, Wasn't Born to Follow, Natural Harmony--all terrific.  I've been listening to this album for over 40 years and I haven't tired of it.

B0064T6LV8|3.0|Who doesn't like skee-ball?  Unfortunately, it has a few limits. Any regular skeeball player knows that the best way to make an accurate roll is to bounce the ball off the side walls to get it where you want. But they don't let you do that here. You have to aim down the lanes, and your only assistance is tilting, which you works, though you will need time to learn how much and how to tilt to get where you want.  Very difficult to roll straight down the middle when playing one handed. And kind of clunky holding it in one hand, and flicking with the other. You CAN do it with one hand, but you tend to roll to one side or the other instead of right down where you were aiming.   Since I don't intend to updgrade this, the \\"wanna buy me\\" pop up every 5 games gets a little old.  But it's not bad. If you have a few minutes to kill, it works for that.   Give it a shot if you like the game. It's free. You can always uninstall.  Oh, and how do I cash in all these tickets? I need some itching powder!

0385534639|3.0|I'm a fan of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis for their abilities to create worlds that live on past their authors and even the pages they were introduced in.  The circus itself was given more attention than Marco and Celia, though I believe the circus descriptions might have been meant to give insight into both of them.  It did not.  I do agree that many interesting characters were introduced and perhaps they might be given a novel of their own.  I did enjoy the way the author interspersed the main story with chapters on the circus tents/acts because it was like wandering the circus myself. However it might have been better if this was a series and not a single book.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this game! The games are not too hard to complete. And I also love that I can use pics from my gallery for the deck of cards.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my husband and I love it. there is a great variety of games and types. there's a game for every one. great game lots of endless fun.
B006GRBK4G|5.0|...you will really enjoy this movie.<br /><br />The storytelling is very well done although it does hop around a bit (maybe to make you watch it twice ;-)  ).  The most appeal for me is the access that Mark Neale has to the MotoGP riders and letting them talk casually about various races, their friends/competitors and riding in general.<br /><br />I don't watch MotoGP religiously, but when I record the races off the SpeedHD channel the focus is almost entirely on American riders, however they simply aren't the best riders on the track currently.  \\"Fastest\\" has interviews with *ALL* of the top riders (Americans included - don't worry) and you get a good sense of their attitude and amazingly friendly nature.<br /><br />On top of the dramatic story of the 2010 racing season is some of the racing footage shown.  What really captivated me were several shots of the bikes in super-slow motion where you can see the riders and their machines turning, bumping, bouncing, flexing, skidding, hopping, and you really get a better understanding just how insanely fast and close to the edge of control they have to push themselves and their bikes to be competitive in this age of MC riding.  My respect for all of these guys has magnified considerably and made me more interested in MotoGP as a sport (I even think it makes me a faster rider!  Ha ha!  Just kidding - I'm still slow!)
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game I had so much fun and my jana was stealing it because of how much fun.so that's why its so fun.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|It's a fun game, but it got boring after a few minutes. You are just doing the same thing over and over. Otherwise, it is a good game.
0062082353|5.0|Wow, book was a very good (and fast) read.  Man this guy has some interesting stories.  I'm glad he is on my side.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pthere are a bunch of games you can play some good some not so, you umlock more gsmes by reaching targets on others
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these are really fun games. so far have only encountered two I cannot beat. unlocking new games is easy though.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|for a free app on my kindle fire, this was fun. drives you crazy for sure, but it was a good trip down memory lane. it does get a bit repetitive,  but that's ok. I downloaded it for free.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game starts out at a light pace but soon you comtemplating which buildings to sacrifice!  Got it for free but would have paid for it.  This game is like missile command but with the upgrade system it makes it more strategy than normal!
0446547654|5.0|Everybody who likes Sparks this book is a must! I have read a hand full of his books and I thought this book would be just like all the other I have read but it surprised me and I couldn't tell how it would end!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game! It also works great on my Kindle Fire! It's one of the best games I have!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Definitely a good waste of time and slightly addictive. Definitely worth the money. Which for me was free. OK for some reason
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I wasn't sure if getting this app was a good idea but, once I started playing it. I loved It it's fun and a great way to waste time!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have had zero problems with this app. I have it on both my cell (2 yrs) and my new kindle fire (1month)<br />I absolutely love it. its helped me grow in my relationship with Christ and has been there lingering on my screens to keep me accountable lol<br />I shared it with some friends recently and they are besides themselves loving it too :)<br />must have app :)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using this app for my working laptop, home computer, and smartphone for quite some time. Very handy to keep my important messages and texts synced. It's only natural for me to include one in my Kindle fire now. Great app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it. it is so fun and I play it every day. so many games to.choose from! I love it!
B006M4F67A|5.0|this is the best mahjong i have played on my kindle fire.  but i had one instance of a 'force close' in the midst of a game.  serious boomer. but it is a very interesting, enjoyable and a bit of an addicting game.  highly recommend even with the force close.
1592536913|5.0|It took me the better part of four hours to pour and drool over all the beauuuutiful pics in this tome.... It's delightful!!! My only (and very slight) criticism.... Is that I would have loved to see more jewelry and clothing, but mostly more jewelry... And only because they can be a bit hard to find.  Thank you thank you for putting this together!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is an awesome way to pass the time and gets your brain working too! easy games for every age and fun for adults too!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This takes what was challenging in the 80s and, well, upgrades it.  you can spend points to rebuild destroyed structures and upgrade your powers.  one Helluva free ap!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A fun, challenging update to the classic missile command game. I'm particularly fond of the upgradeable defenses. Great graphics and music.
006135323X|4.0|Interesting insights into the decision making process. I hope one does not just enjoy the book as an interesting trivia, but also apply/ extrapolate the learning to real life..  Bottomline is : you won't regret buying the book !
B005XQLBU4|5.0|not a bad game. I had fun for hours. more fun then I remember as a kid. wish the back grounds. were a little more fun.
B001USHRCK|5.0|good LEGO   this product has plenty of bricks, figures ...  I am pleased to get this product   If you like lego, this is pretty good products
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This handy service / application / website is a godsend for keeping my complex and evolving custody case in order. The email feature is great for sending out spur of the moment thoughts to myself; so that they are centrally recorded and not forgotten. Ive tried every M$ and open source productivity product out there and this one beats them all with ease of use and simplicity. I cant wait to utilize it for my screenwriting; its worth going pro just to thank the programming team. Great App!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids love it, keeps them entertained. has a lot of different things to play so they don't get bored easily.
0762434279|3.0|I thoughtI was ordering the original \\" rich dad poor dad\\" paperback novel but instead I have this small sized version which isn't the one I thought I was ordering.If you are aware of what I.m talking about please get in touch so I can order the one I want, thank you...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it works pretty good on my kindle fire and the more you play the more games you get so its kind of addicting when you have time to kill. its free why not
B0054JZC6E|4.0|getting enough points is hard, but its fun. it's a challenge for sure, but its worth it in the end.
B004P2CQM4|1.0|its kind of creapy it floats by itself. the thing never worked and realy it didnt even have an on off button on the remote. it is so flimsy and the body dosnt even match the fins. the fins have holes in them it was not worth the time gas or money. we bought this product from toys r us i suggest buying them from the brand's website or a specialy marked store.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is an incredible puzzle game that's engainging, challenging, and at the same time it makes you feel smart. One moment I'd feel the level is impossible, the next I would be thinking it was easy. This is a fantastic experience that was worth every penny and I'd reccomend it to anyone.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|no problems, loaded great, User friendly, enjoyable.  Nice graphics, no extra mps to load, uses doubling cube if you choose.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad. but some of the game are a little weak.  graphics are not good but hey the app is free after all so all things considered its entertaining
0439023483|5.0|I had a great time reading this novel. The series appeals to me in ways others haven't in a long time. I look forward to the continuation of entertainment and surprises that are provided by this wonderful author. Highly recommended -  Thank you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game. I keep playing just so I can open up more games to keep playing. Some games aren't as good as others but still fun.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Fantastic cover, the hard back and corners are great protection.  The cover adds very little weight. Love the elastic strap that keeps the cover securely close.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|The product arrived in a timely manner, as described.  And it cost a dollar less than the price advertized in the pre-order.  Nice surprise.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Good movie. I want hesitant of watching and buying another comic/movie/remake or whatever you want to call it but was impressed overall.  Arrived in perfect condition and fast shipment.
B000PC6Z48|5.0|I love westersn and i love the Italian ones.  I had never seen this one, though have heard alot about it.  After reading reviews on here i took the chance.  I love it.  It is dang near as good as the Clint Eastwood ones.  This film is alot like the Eastwood films, A stranger walks into town and takes over.  But the catch is this guy drags a coffin where ever he goes. What is in it? That's the point, not to know.  Very effective.  Franco Nero is wondeful in it.  I love his little touches and evil glances he gives to people.  He is a fine actor.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good for killing time. excellent challenges. cant get s better game with so many options. like the sudoku game end the
0307959856|5.0|I think this book is an absolute literary triumph. In her latest novel, the venerable P. D. James weds her immense skill in crafting character-driven mysteries with her own passion for Jane Austen. She picks up six years after Pride and Prejudice leaves off (spoiler alert for those of you who haven't yet gotten to that classic--which you should, by the way; you will here learn how some of the relationships resolve in that earlier work), focusing on the home of Elizabeth and Darcy. But tragedy strikes on the eve of Pemberley's grand ball, and Elizabeth's brother-in-law Wickham is the suspect. By many twists and turns, we are brought back into the complex world of these characters that Jane Austen formed, this time in search of a killer.<br /><br />I was amazed at how well James is able to pick up the story from Pride and Prejudice. She deftly works her story in a way that seems so natural it was often hard to recall as I was reading whether events she referred to were in her work or in Austen's original. And I think she picked up on the perfect \\"seam\\" from P&P, with the tenuous entrance of Wickham into the Bennet family with all of the past baggage and conflict that he brought to that first story but which was left unresolved at the end. After reading Death Comes to Pemberley, it almost feels as if P&P is incomplete without James's masterful extension. This homage fit seamlessly with the original for me, and I loved it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really enjoyed it, honestly this game is really good and im glad I downloaded it to the Kindle Fire.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|decent game. loved  missle command as a kid. very good android recreation. love being able to repair buildings and upgrade weapons.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game! Engaging, entertaining, easy to play,challenging, overall wonderful! Highly recommend, fun for all ages and works great on the Kindle Fire!
B005IGVYUG|5.0|What can I say? My husband loves anything and all Tom Waits. He was in Heaven when he found this under the Christmas tree. I just have a hard time with his scratchy voice, so it was nice to see and understand all the information that was included. He's a great poet. I just leave the room when the CD is playing.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|I enjoy this CD alot. It has some upbeat songs, with real catchy phrases. Lots of different music types ,from rock to more of a hip-hop sound. My favorite song is the title track. Hopefully this band will continue with more success!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I wasn't too convinced that this was going to work well.  But to my surprise.  It worked so awesome for my kindle that I bought it for my husbands iPad too.  We both love it.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Absolutely love it.  Excellent vocals.  Excellent backgrounds . . . perfectly blended so as to no overshadow the message.  Speaking of the message  -  these songs are awesome!  Uplifting, positive, down home messages that will brighten  your day.  I love that Scotty stayed honest to his roots.  These are great and very well delivered.  Unlike the \\"scream every song\\" direction that the IDOL producers and judges push, these are just well sung songs performed in the old country style.  I will be anxiously awaiting recordings 2, 3, 4, 5 . . .
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is ok but some of the qualities make it very difficult to gt into the games.  the pop ups are also very frequent and very annoying.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I. I LOVE THIS GAME. I PLAY IT ALOT. NOW I'M LEARNING TO PLAY IT ON MY NEW KINDLE FIRE.

B005DESVPO|5.0|Gary Clark Jr. is the truth!! He is an amazingly talented guy and his sound is uniquely his, I simply CANNOT wait for his first full length album, this EP leaves you desperate for more! A truly great purchase. His future is so VERY bright!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome and really fun! I recomend it to everyone who likes mini games! ^_^  So get it I guess
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I was sent this very expensive product with out a packing slip. I tried to return the product and was told that amazon would not take it back. I had problems with the band. Do not order from amazon.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this app its cool ...I really buoy playing cards.nonlinear and the computer sometimes. the all gets stuck but I just force it.closed and continue playing my game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Have everynote you take on your tablet, phone, or laptop synced without touching a buttom. Very easy to use. Highly recommend Evernote if you take notes for anything.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game ..... especially side its free a lot of ads but they dont rlly bother me overall its a pretty God game
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I was hesitant to read the Hunger Games trilogy, mostly because there seems to be a lot of BAD books getting a lot of hype these days.  I'm pleasantly suprised to say that I really enjoyed the series!  There are a lot of reviews that criticize the main character, Katniss, but I found her to be a very realistic, multi-dimensional character.  It was refreshing to read a series with a strong female lead.  Some will claim that she \\"has no heart\\", but I read her character as one with deep emotions who has learned/ been forced to put her feelings aside in order to survive.  Bravo to Suzanne Collins for striking the right balance of strength and vulnerability in ALL of her female characters!  I would love to give the trilogy a 5 star rating, and I can give 5 stars to the first 2 books, but Mockingjay left me unsatisfied.  I felt that the ending was a little rushed, and it left me feeling that Collins was ready to be done writing before she had actually finished.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great game :) thought it would be lame cause of the price buts its fun and a little addictive. I do wish it had some more racing games but cant complain that's just what I like :)
B005IGDW24|5.0|The movie was great and the quality excellent. The price was comparable to the big W but it was easier buying from Amazon then leaving the house.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|The movie itself is great!...just an FYI the first two reviews state its the old school blue & red glasses and its clearly not.  This is a 3d blu ray release for active or passive 3d tv's not the old school 3d, you can clearly see that in the pictures the back of the case shows you need a 3d tv, 3d blu ray or ps3 player, and 3d glasses.
B003EYVY0E|5.0|Je suis très satisfaite car j'ai même reçu le produit en avance. Produit conforme à la description, en très bon état.
0440236304|4.0|This is not the first book I've read about the Normandy Invasion and the 506th PIR (Paratroopers).  If you have read \\"Band of Brothers\\", much of the story will be familiar. In fact, some of the same characters (in real life) are present in both. This book brings another perspective to the conflict, from someone who is the instrument of the Allied advance into enemy territory. The author is an unqualified hero, having endured some of the most vicious fighting of the war. I was amazed at the \\"matter of fact-ness\\" with which he recounts some of the horror. I can only imagine that this is a result of living through the madness of war. My own father is a veteran of WWII, and I am once again reminded of the debt we owe to these heroes. This book is a great first-hand account of the day-to-day fighting. The only thing I found lacking was the larger historical context in which the fighting took place. However, this is not the work of a historian, but a participant in the conflict. I commend the author for telling this story, so that those of us who weren't there can understand and appreciate what was fought for and won on the battlefields of Normandy. I look forward to his other books about WWII.
0307245306|5.0|This is a wonderful action packed read for kids. If you liked Spear Bearer (Lizzy Long) you''ll love this book.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|This app is not good for a Kindle. The Excel program is too big for the small screen for a kindle. If you try to minimize document too small. Getting my money back.
B002OSY2T6|2.0|I brought this toy for my daughter for Christmas hoping it would make crawling more interesting for he. It just sits there and doesn't encourage her to crawl at all! So disappointed.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I love the ease and use of this app. It automatically syncs with your Gmail account calender. Love it. Money well spent.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|great simple game for a quick break. got it as free ap of day but not sure I would of bought it. works well on kindle fire.
B004LROUNG|1.0|I read pretty much everything by John Grisham. This one was seriously disappointing. You read and read and read...nothing happens. Then suddenly everything is wrapped up in the last 30 pages and the book ends. Really disappointed!

B001N26GFM|5.0|I've watched many great film adaptations of books written about the Holocaust and how it affected all involved.  Yet, THE BOY IN THE STRIPPED PAJAMAS, was probably the most heart-breaking movie I've seen because it showed in chilling details how two young boys - one Jewish, one German, became innocent victims of Hitler's Nazis madness to exterminate Europe of non-Aryans.  The movie was all the more powerful and heart-wrenching in its portrayal of the hedonist perpetration of human extermination because the two main child characters [eight-year-old Shmuel, 'the boy in the stripped pajamas', and eight-year-old, Bruno 'the son of the Commandant responsible for the extermination camp were Shumel is held captive'] are exemplary in their roles of capturing children's naivety and inability to comprehend the unthinkable.<br /><br />Other reviewers have written in great detail about the specifics of the plot.  It is multi-layered and complex, examining the the characters who portrayed participants and victims of a an evil event in recent history, and the effects it had on each.  Instead, I prefer to focus my comments on why I believe this movie is so important.<br /><br />In my opinion, we underestimate the innocence of young children and their gullibility, their 'magical thinking' to believe in an idealistic world, and the pureness of their hearts to believe the best in their parents; failing to see, imagine, or comprehend any flaws. Even when young children are exposed to the 'worse' of abusive conditions, most don't grasp the depth of their circumstances.  For this reason [among others] children are easily manipulated to do what they are told by predators; coerced to believe in angels and gifts when they obey, or condemned to be tormented by monstrous demons if they don't comply.<br /><br />Because of the subtleties in the manner the scenes are directed, rather than the 'overtness' obvious to us as adults, the dialogue between Bruno and Shumel made this movie all the more chilling to watch.  As viewers, we watch their friendship blossom knowing they have already become unsuspecting victims.  Through the innocent and loyal camaraderie that we witness between Bruno and Shumel - two 'sacrificial lambs' - we discover the unimaginable horror, power, magnitude, and atrocity of the Holocaust.<br /><br />THE BOY IN THE STRIPPED PAJAMAS is a movie to be watched by families who have teenagers.  It is a film I'll long remember.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />January 14, 2012iewers, we watch their friendship blossom knowing they have already become unsuspecting victims.

B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC in this album makes the rough and ready style that they have now grown famous for, with good reason.  Songs such as \\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" demonstrate the strong instrumentals and vocal pairings at which AC/DC excels.  The musical composition style is ornate and clever, seemingly designed never to leave a dull moment in the tracks by always switching it up.  Though many of the songs on this album are clssics by now, the other ones are certainly not to be scoffed at, because truly this is an album where each song screams of intense value.
1582701709|1.0|I've always been some what of a self help junkie, I've felt for a long time my life just wasn't working the way I wanted but felt I was powerless to change it, I've read books from Tony Robbins, Lucinda Bassett, Brain Tracy but still life wasn't working, I was working in a minimum wage job I really disliked, living in a rent house, I couldn't even afford a car. In August 2010 The Secret presented itself to me.<br /><br />I first stumbled across the DVD and became so hyped I went out and bought the audio book so I could listen to it every day at work, At first I can't say anything really happened but gradually in 2011 a few things started to happen.<br /><br />One thing I always hated about my job was I was always the guy who got walked over, got the raw deal, had to cover for other people when they where sick etc and I really hated it, Gradually in 2011 this all stopped, my boss became some what friendly towards me, I got to do my own job all day every day, Ok I still didn't like my job but it was a hell of a lot better than it was.<br /><br />In Summer 2011 something kinda cool happened. I'd always been a fan of Brad Paisley, But he's in the US, I'm in Ireland and its rare for a big country music star to leave the US. I'd listen to his music at least once per day at work to kill the monotony and i'd often visualise being at one of his concerts, in June 2011 he announces his first ever Irish tour coming to Dublin. Now as I mention I don't drive and well don't really live anywhere near Dublin, so again I put The Secret to work, so a few weeks later he announces another 2 dates, one being only 20 miles away, so you know I go tickets and I went.<br /><br />I was still kinda undecided by The Secret, I needed evidence that all this stuff worked because of The Secret and wasn't just coincidence, so I set about creating my wants list for 2012 and I was prepared to live The Secret in 2012, So I returned to work after the Christmas/New Year holidays fully prepared for the New Year and a New Year of The Secret, I didn't even make it to my desk, my boss pulled us all aside and announced with immediate effect we are all made redundant due to the company being made insolvent.  This certainly wasn't in the plan for 2012, no job, no money, but on the bright side I now get to full put The Secret to good use and see if it really does work.<br /><br />So to sum up, I'm still not fully convinced by The Secret, sure some pretty cool stuff has happened but I think that may be down to just coincidence, I need more convicing, I will report back with my finding on living The Secret in 2012.<br /><br />EDIT**<br />So this is a follow up to my original review.  I dedicated my life to the Secret in 2012, I created vision board, visualised daily and lets look at what has happened.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my previous review I got made redundant in January, in February I found out I am not getting a severance package because of the sneaky underhand way my employer went under, I was also diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression, and in March my bank has taken it upon themselves to remove my bank account with my welfare / benefits money in it leaving me no money to pay rent, or to feed myself or my kids. So if this is what practising the secret can do I think I am better of away from it.
B0064W67IM|3.0|The Kindle sample was a major waste of space... three pages of the editor's forward only showed the features that are supposed to make graphic novels seem at home on an eReader do not work fast enough or efficiently. Sandman deserves better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game :) it is fun and addicting. just wish you got points faster to open other games but other than that it is great
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game. Works very well on Samsung Galaxy S II (Epic 4G Touch). Not my favorite genre but we'll designed and executed.
B002ZNJW0O|2.0|The romantic theme was intriguing based on the railor of the movie and triggered my purchase.   The writing style was very ordinary. The characters were easily understood, not much left to figure out. The development of the romantic relationship was convincing though.  Logan's character carried the book. His intuitive understanding of situations and his devotion to his dog stood out.  The story ended quite abruptly.  Overall the book had an intriguing romantic storyline, however the writing style was a little ordinary which made for a slightly boring read.  Looking forward to seeing the movie retell the story.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I cant see that there's anything wrong with the game it's very entertaining. the game does get more difficult but at a very good pace. Good buy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is almost addicting, it is a great way to pass the time I wouldn't reccomend this app for anyone over sixteen.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app love the games.  I always play it daily.  super job creators.  thank you so much. awesome job!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this on my Samsung infuse and so far it has worked perfect. I can even listen to someone read it to me if I want. great app!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is the perfect blend of strategy, timing and relaxation. I can sit and enjoy the challenges presented for hours without getting bored or frustrated.  Highly recommended!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun and entertaining, I like the simplicity of it too. not overly complicated and kept my attention. worth the download
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|Graphics are better than the graphics in any other game &quot;Asphalt &quot; &quot;Modern Combat &quot; and the strategic choices you make can be the difference between winning and losing. I only got to Mission 8 but it was great and if its to hard or easy you can change the difficultly which makes it better than some flash TD's. where you cant, point is, more than an hour of thinking strategy and acting as if you were on the front lines. 1 tiny problem for me though is the price, its not much but I want it lowered down to maybe $2.99 or have it be free one day, I haven't seen it free but if you can buy it, BUY IT!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|reminds me of old times when I used to play on the atari. here are seven more words to complete.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Had installed the app on a HTC Evo 3D. App wouldn't search for anything. Tried over and over...nothing. Finally, uninstalled.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Never was big fan of the original with the trackball but this touch version was fun. I am pretty sure l will keep trying to improve my score for awhile.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|Very well written and it was like I lived the movie and had a lot of stars in it to hold attention and was in depth of how viruses spread and technical but intersting
0307891402|5.0|Excelente articulo, pasta gruesa, mucha información , mapas (interactivo on-line e impreso), es mucho mas barato ordenarlo on-line que comprarlo en México.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun, game when you just wanna waste a little time. some are a little tricky at first, my hubby and I compete for the high score :-)
B004GUSG4M|1.0|I cannot imagine how so many people think this was a good read.  It was unbelievably boring. I actually quit reading it because I couldn't bear it, then went back to it after I read so many good reviews.  I finished it, all the while hoping something really good was going to happen.  It didn't.  Big snooze.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good light games.  however you must beat 12 games to unlock the next set of 12 games.  if you get stuck on one game to would be nice if you could skip that one game
B002XTBE8I|5.0|This was a gift they loved it. He is a big Eminem fan and it's a great album! I would recommend to buy.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This app is totally addicting and my husband calls himself a Kindle widower - Mahjong in only one reason I can't put my Kindle down! LOL
B005XQLBU4|5.0|good game that is easy to play.Got it yesterday and allready love it.Although not as good as angry birds, it is a good app
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game. Bring back fond memories of the days I played this game in basic. great addictive game. hours of fun.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game reminds me of playing Missile Command on my old Atari 2600!  This game starts out easy and quickly gets harder and harder.  Highly recommended for lots of mindless fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the app is pretty cool but takes a long time to get more games :D. the app has some pretty cool games too though
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm the king of this easy game that could be the easiest game on earth or in Mississippi at least
0525425578|5.0|My ten year old picked this up at the airport and read it cover to cover the next two days.  When my other son and I ran out of things to read, we started this.  I ended up taking it away that night and finishing it.  First Grisham I've ever read.  First rate writing and a good yarn.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Free Bible on the go. It could be easier to use. Lacks concordance. Not complaining. Love it, use it often.
B004HYGF18|5.0|Absolutely loved this collection of songs. Am new to this band, but would definitely look forward to their next CD
B00428CPUY|5.0|This was a great holiday gift for the one I love; together we are enjoying it and sharing it with our friends.
B006GRBK4G|5.0|The family enjoyed watching Fastest. It was filled with fun clips of the riders and lots of action from the 2010 season. If you like MotoGP, it is a good movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A very fun app with lots of games thats great for long car rides or time wasting haha.   Overall a good download for kindle fire.
B005974CNA|1.0|That was a dramatic turn!  Portnoy gone, Mangini in.....total opportunity to blow us all away. I have been a major fan since the early 90's, buying the CD's , attending the concerts.  I saw them perform at the Madison Square Garden show that totally overshadowed Iron Maiden! If Portnoy was protesting the change in music style or lyrics- I understand why!    Please guys, stick with the format that made us all love the music and keep us coming back! If you are a major fan, and you can overlook the weird lyrics and choir sounding format, then buy this CD.  I still revere them for the technical intelligence, but this effort totally missed the mark for me.  Mangini is really the only drummer who could keep up and thankfully he was chosen.  However, the ballad like speed of the music does not allow for him to showcase his true talent.  Oh, except the drum solo.  DEATH TO ALL BUT METAL!
B00000DC10|5.0|Refused the shape of punk to come is one of the greatest CD's ever made. New Noise is easily an anthem for the current generation of people who love roudy thrash music. Love em, and welcome back Refused.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a great game to while away some time!  No issues with lag, no missed touches, and the opportunity to prolong your inevitable decline makes the game much more interesting.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|Tried this game on a Kindle Fire.  First download went well (although slow), intro of game played out and then I was stuck at the murder scene (could navigate room, but couldn't select ojects, zoom or use hint) and could not close out of the game without going to the home screen.  I uninstalled and reinstalled in case that was the problem.  Retried with same result.  I've now uninstalled this game twice and won't waste any more of my time with it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a good game but the levels are kinda hard to beat. overall really fun and works great on the kindle fire
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a nice app for a classic card game. I like the auto finish. Never get tired of playing Solitaire.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|this app is so awesome on the kindle fire and idk what the other reviewer is talking about with the ads they are tiny and out of the way. Wish there were more levels on the free version but overall its awesome :)
B006DHASYM|5.0|Watching this movie is like getting an answer to the question: What if Nicholas Sparks (the writer of The Notebook, The Vow, The Last Song...) had a crude sense of humor--similar to Dane Cook? The answer is: He'd write this movie from start to finish.   What's Your Number? has moments of depth and meaning where the characters are introspective and very Sparks-esque. And then there are moments filled with crude, laugh-out-loud, bust a gut incidents and reactions. Anna Faris, as usual (see The House Bunny) nails each moment with the best comedic timing out there.   The supporting cast includes Blythe Danner, Ed Begley Jr, Joel McHale (from The Soup)  Also, for anyone contemplating whether or not to purchase this movie to see Chris Evans, there are countless times where he appears barely clothed. Additionally, he's surprising good in romantic comedies-- so if you only saw him in Fantastic Four or Captain America, have no fear -- he's a perfect match for Anna Faris.   If you enjoy the occasional romantic comedy, this is better than most out there. For comparison, it blew Something Borrowed, Valentine's Day, Bride Wars, and most recent rom-coms out of the water. It was somewhat comparable to Going the Distance (with Drew Barrymore) in terms of being well-written and having depth yet being really funny and having a great supporting cast.  One last note: even though it's a rom-com, and wouldn't typically be considered a demo-disc for a blu-ray/ hi-def presentation, there are scenes that are spot-on for blu-ray/hi-def viewing. (Beach scenes and outdoor scenes are incredibly crisp and detailed.) As long as the price is reasonable for the combo pack (was 19.99 at time of my purchase) then it's worth it to get the combo pack.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one of the best games I have played in a very long time.I would recommend this game to anyone that is bored of lousy games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a must have game for your kindle fire. I'm still trying to beat wife's score. love my kindle it is wonderful. Good luck and download this app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always loved this game, its always entertaining to me and definitely a time killer but if you don't enjoy card games then I wouldn't suggest it for you.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|This was a great purchase, all the movies except the first were playable and being that the first one is my favorite, I was very upset. But at the same time I got this for around $20 so I can't complain. I am planning on buying the first movie and replacing the CD.
B0034G4P80|5.0|It's a rare movie that provides a sense that every scene is done perfectly. I think Branaugh did that here. I thought it far superior to the Spiderman, Bat-man series that it has been compared so negatively to. It has the ability to merge the two worlds (the super-hero world of Azgar with our contemporary Planet Earth) in a fun way - with Natalie Portman effortlessly showing why she's an Award-winning talent. I thought she had great chemistry with Hemsworth, and Tom Hiddlestone almost steals the pic in one scene with Anthony Hopkins along the way. There is the cutting back and forth between the two worlds in a fun way with a fascinating plot. The cast is winning with Hopkins shining, the effects are some of the best, and I thought the hero earning his way back in the manner done was feel-good and fun and the dialogue between the brothers well-written and the fight scenes unusual and also well done. Idris Elba (The Wire) did all he could with what was given him, and could well emerge into a next level dramatic presence if given the proper role.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Seems like it would play better on a tablet.  it's really hard to be accurate on a phone screen.  Not a great game, but okay.
B001QOGYFO|1.0|Received the movie just before an extended trip so I didn't have time to watch.  Got back after the return time was up and discovered the dvd, which showed no marks, would not play.  The disc is the correct reagion and everything.  Not pleased that I bought a movie only to be given a defective product that I'm unable to return.  The disc should have been tested for funcionality before being sent out.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun, I got it the other day and loved it and I still do! so I call it a great app
B00003CXAA|4.0|The packaging was in great condition...truly nearly new condition. Disc one seems to be scratched a little, but we do have an old DVD player.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|very nice throwback to missile command. it starts off easy then gets real hard. the early stages can get a little tedious. the controls are pretty responsive on the kindle fire. nice free app and its a good revolt of an old classic
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app on a number of different devices. works great on all of them and you don't need a wick connection to use it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good 4 wasting time and fun. rest of this for wasting words. fhhvf gcyhvg fyfhvh ruufutxt xtufjgjg fghcthv thfthv dggccf ydkv hfjd
B005XQLBU4|5.0|missile defense is really fun. great for when taking a poo or just want to game a bit. simple but lots of fun.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a fun little game to pass the time. Classic missile defender and simple enough to not have to think to hard. Works great with droid 2.
B004NELBPC|3.0|whenever I load a slideshow I just get a black screen.  Sometimes swiping or tapping gets a picture but not from the chosen slideshow.  Bummer.
0439023521|5.0|I was slightly skeptical at first since I'm not really a fan of stories about deliberate murder, but Collins writes this story in a way that makes the subject matter not as gruesome as I was fearing. She really brings the characters alive and delivers a story that the reader wants to continue following. I did feel that the ending felt a little undeveloped and rushed, but this is being said before having read the next two books in the series. If I didn't know there was a second and third book to follow, I would have been disappointed about all the build-up in the text toward the end, only to have an ending that didn't feel as developed as the rest of the book did.   That being said, this was overall an excellent read that I would recommend to anyone!
B003Y5H5AQ|1.0|This movie is crap.  The plot is silly, and the acting is terrible.  Why did the Smurfs have to come to Central Park, of all place?  Why couldn't this have been a CGI movie that took place in the Smurf universe?  Having them come here to our world was completely unnecessary, and the subplot regarding the advertising campaign was utter nonsense.  It was like Hollywood took one of its cookie-cutter movie plots and added Smurfs and real people to the mix.  This movie was the same as Alvin and the Chipmunks, except with Smurfs.  Total, utter, intense crap.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Overall great app. Works great on Fire. Happy with touch response. Takes a bit to get hang of where to shoot but after that its tons of fun.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|It's amazing how much history is affected by one man's search for a good read.  And that good read was based off one idea.  Just one idea transforms history.  I will never see the enlightenment period without invoking the name of Lucretius.  I will never see our science without invoking Lucretius.  I will never see our own declaration of independence without invoking Lucretius.  It may be the case that the author over-amplified the direct link of Lucretius to the rest of history.  But it is without a doubt that Lucretius did have a hand in history.  After reading this book, I too shall declare myself an Epicurean as so many others have and pursue happiness.
0670022705|5.0|This is an eye-opening book that has surprises in every section.  As a social studies teacher, I have always incorporated the understanding of inventions as a cultural aspect of civilizations world-wide throughout history.  As I read this book, I continually found supportive and contradictory information regarding what I alway thought to be the truth.  I love to read a book with surprises, and this is one of the best I have read in years.  I highly recommend it for any social studies teacher.  Any life-long learner would be spellbound by the content of this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it has many different types of games the only drawback is when you update it you loose all progress. bye
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This app does and is exactly what it says, it is a FUN remake of an old favorite. It is well made, not overly complicated or simplistic, and it's challenging. You can turn off the sound effects (someone complained about them). This is what an app should be... small, fast and fun. If you want an impressive looking video game, get out of the app store.<br />I got to day 21 my first try, and it was fun. My friends and family will get a kick out of it. I would pay 99c for it if it weren't the FAOTD, but then I may not have tried it due to the people who complain with no valid reason.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I remember the first electronic attempts at including mp3 players with your car stereo.  Glad I waited until this thing came along.  I found it easier to go to Youtube to see the hook-up demonstrated, but just the same it was super easy.  I love that I don't have to burn CDs anymore or look for future cars that have mp3 players.  Highly recommended.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Best version of missle command I have ever played. Works great with my touchscreen.  The upgrade feature is a nice addition.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for any age. easy to win. lots of different games to play!!!!  def worth a download any day!  love it
B006SV2LWA|5.0|This film is engaging from the opening scene to the last.  It was interesting to see just how a similar scenario could play out in real life.  The acting is excellent.  Ignore the negative reviews!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A well done app with a clean interface and smooth gameplay, very nice. Graphics could be a little better but if the gameplay suffered for it then it's fine just the way it is.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|everyone should have this game its the best!! :) i play it all the time its soo entertaining i give it 3thumbs up
B005C9YZIW|5.0|I already had Planet Earth DVD collection and recently I upgraded to 55\\" LED TV and when I play DVD in this new TV, somehow I didn't feel comfortable. So I ordered again Blu ray collection and this is SIMPLY SUPERB. No need to comment any negative side of that. I prefer to buy original David Attenborough(BBC Series) series instead of American oprah winfrey version.  Happy Buying and NJOY...
B005XQLBU4|4.0|brings back old memories when i was a child. its a classic. i got it for free but its definitely worth buying.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|horrible. the missiles are too slow and its impossible to get upgrade points. the only good part is I got it for free.
B004XWMXX8|1.0|Below average production. One successful song can't sell a cd. we need some value for the money. . . . . .
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Missile Defender is a blast.  Tap the screen to defend against incoming attack.  The challenge increases as you must decide on upgrading your defenses or repairing your cities.  Essentially a Missile Command clone, but controls are much better than the simulated trackball used in Atari's own Missile Command app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|needs more games, but the ones on it already are pretty fun. It needs a update that brings more games to it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun and easy to play. nice old school graphics. throw back to missle command and the glory days of atari.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Just got this and has been real fun to play so far. I wanted a variety of games without having to download each individually and that is what I have gotten.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so fun.you can play lots of games.and also they are so fun.I recomend. this game to a lot of people.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read a few negative reviews, and went into the book with some apprehension. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the unexpected turns and the complexity of the ending. It does, I feel, wrap up neatly, just not the way you expected and/or wanted.<br /><br />Also, I was pleased that this last installment of the trilogy did not become a rehash of earlier books. So, many of the series spend about a third of the books retelling details of the previous volumes, so that readers coming into the middle of the series can catch up. This book did that very sparingly, which left more room for telling of the third tale. Also, I did not feel that the writer was getting lazy or was just in it for the paycheck as some series writers do(can anyone say the Sookie Stackhouse series?!?)<br /><br />I just saw the promo poster for the coming movie of the Hunger Games last night. I am a little afraid that that movie won't do it justice. Coming off the recent release of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (which did a pretty good job matching the intensity of the book), I am hoping for a similar movie with substance, not just sci-fi futuristic special effects. Let's hope, as this is a book I can recommend highly.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I typically don't dig playing games on my Droid X,  but this game was quite a surprise.  I saw all the high ratings for this program and decided to check it out.  The opinions to restore buildings and upgrade weaponry is a pleasant twist to an old game.  Well done.
014241722X|5.0|This was the first audio book I've ever listened to. I was enraptured throughout and could not stop listening . The abduction was even better. Can't wait for the third part in May!!
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|Excellent follow up album. Now I might be in my 20's but I must say I love these guys, their show, and their music.   First let me say how I was introduced to them. Well it was 2009 and I was invited to the Kid's U.S. open day and on the bill was Big Time Rush. I never heard of them and I was interested in who they were. Since I work in a school, I heard all my kids talking about them. So to say the least I was very intrigued to see what the big fuss was. Boy, was I blowin away!! They performed songs from their first album and I was shocked at how good they were.   When I got home I couldn't get their songs out of my head. So I was flicking through the channels and saw that on Nick it has a show called big time rush. I was so shocked that they not only were musician but also actors. Needless to say I was blown away after seeing their show. I laughed so hard at their comical antics.   So I downloaded the first album, fell in love. I was ready for the second and I was not let down. I love the new albums sound, even though it has more of a dance feel to it. As you listen through you see that they may have a few dance songs but they stayed true to their pop, randb, rock feel.  Love this album and these guys so much!!   It is a must buy!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great for burning time.  a little mindless at times, but fun all the same.  also, I just got a bunch of points for this.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love solitaire it is super fun but like how can u rate solitaire anyway this is super entertaining if u have patience.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are really really fun try 100 games and16. you will be glad you got it.  the coins are the finest. you can bye games. with coins. if your thinkinking about getting it then get it.it s worth. buying it hope you like it. mia
B006VRZ5YM|3.0|I really like both of the actors in this movie and yes, this is not their best, but it was cute. Which in other words means not pretty but not so ugly either, ha-ha. It was something cute to watch on a sat. night with nothing else to do, so if your in the same situation, I'd say that this movie wont be a waste of time.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I Liked it. It's not a traditional hidden objects game. You won't see a list of items to find. You have to figure it out by yourself. Minimum instructions. Some clues are challenging. It's short but it can take you time to follow the right track. I think it's a good way to spend a dollar. I wish they create more games like this.  KINDLE FIRE FRIENDLY!!
0553801473|3.0|I am afraid the Martin will suffer the same fate as robert jordan:  not finishing before he passes away.  the story is good but the pace is incredibly slow, much like Jordans wheel of time series.  looks like martin is playing it the same way.  at least 10-12 more years before conclusion
B005DOKK7Q|1.0|I received this sleeve as a gift. It would be the ideal case for me if it didn't smell so bad. I put my fire it it overnight and now the Kindle itself smells as bad as the case. Amazon should be ashamed to sell such an item. Now I'd appreciate Amazon's suggestions on how to get rid of the smell on my $199 Fire!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game whether I am @ lunch, doctor appointment or just bored. I truly am happy with this app!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Does this game ever get updated from PopCap Games? It would barely run on my old phone, and now that I have a new high end phone it won't run most of the time. When it does I can play one or two levels before it finally freezes up and I have to hit the home button and go and stop it from running and eating up all my RAM. Please fix this for Android 4.0 or the Galaxy Nexus.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game nothing is wrong with it, except i wish you could change the card faces... they are a little creepy with the spider...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What can I say but this app is everything I hoped for and more. Easy to use, offers all the translations I want, &amp; is free. Even if it weren't it is the one app I absolutely could not do without. If I could only have one app installed on my phone, this would be it.
B002600EDK|5.0|I can only speak as a viewer,not a historian. Jonathon Rhys Meyers holds you spellbound, not only for his physical beauty and powerful acting,but he subtly transforms his body as he ages as King Henry. The expedience with which he dispatches of women...and men, that no longer service his needs or agenda are at times more truthful albeit ruthless, than the mush  mouthed liars in US politics presently. It is honestly painful to watch the roles of women in this production being used by their fathers for advancement in the king's court or thrust aside for higher reasons as Sir Thomas More does with his own family. I have Prime and so enjoy the priviledge of viewing this gratis, it is a priceless gift, I recommend this series to anyone remotely interested in human desire, corruption and cinematography.
1904994679|5.0|The youngster I bought this for loves this book. He's a book lover and approaching 10 yrs. Of age. This book has captured his attention and fits the developing 10th old personality. It's packed with unusual facts that kids love telling adults about......
B005XQLBU4|2.0|Graphics are bad. It looks like they are scaled down on my phone and are very jagged.  Sound effects are worse. Missile sound continue playing even after the level is over.  Game play is essentially the same as the original except for the added upgrade feature.  No menu to quit game.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|don't get this it is relly annoying and it doesn't have 101 games you have to buy them you only her 16
B005HSL626|5.0|Best game I've ever played you get to slice and dice fruit, vegetibles and other stuff.   PS:Don't slice the bombs or game over
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm a fan.  I'm also not easily impressed.  I read to much to be that.  But, I have to say that this one is King's obstinate refusal.  To what I don't know.  I don't care.  The characters are people I want to meet.  Not that I'd always be nice or anything.  The songs are songs that I wanna listen to again.  Derry is still a place with clowns and I'm betting King has two left feet.  But this novel makes you want to laugh, cry, dance, have some poundcake and finally OBDERATE.  \\"And if he doesn't regret it and remains obdurate, we shall just have to kill him.\\"
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Always loved these movies and their story told through Harry and company.  Having all the movies in one package also is convenient.  I will watch them over and over.
B002GYVRRI|5.0|\\"Red\\" is one of my favorite King Crimson discs, and easily, in my opinion, the very best record the band made in the 1970s. Ostensibly, it's a \\"power trio\\" lineup featuring John Wetton on bass and vocals, Bill Bruford on drums and Robert Fripp on guitar, but of course Fripp also contributes Mellotron. In addition, there are guest musicians all over this album. David Cross was officially out of the band but contributed violin; the same goes for Ian McDonald, who had been a founding member but comes back to contribute saxophone parts, as does Mel Collins. Robin Miller plays oboe and Marc Charig cornet, and there are uncredited cellists and double bassists, too.<br /><br />The result is an album as adventurous as any Crimson outing, but with the emphasis on the core trio. Among the best songs: \\"Red,\\" the title track, which is an instrumental that I would describe as brutally exuberant. There's a hard edge to this track, yes, but there's also something joyous here; I have played it over and over again through the years and it never fails to put me in a more upbeat mood. Also excellent is the frantic \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" and the pensive but very, very tense closing number, \\"Starless.\\"<br /><br />Steven Wilson's 5.1 mix of the album does it superb justice. He approached it pretty simply, but sometimes simplicity wins the day. Example: On \\"Starless,\\" he basically just puts Fripp's Mellotron in the back speakers, Wetton's bass and voice up front and mostly center, and lets Fripp's guitar and Bruford's drums float over everything, kind of pushing out into the room from the front left and right. Doing it all this way helps separate the instruments without turning them to mush or resulting in a loss of focus -- King Crimson still sounds like a BAND, mind you, but every part can be heard.<br /><br />This is a brilliant new mix of a classic progressive-rock album.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Perfect Christmas gift for the Star Wars enthusiast. Hours of great footage and all neatly kept together in one package. Couldn't ask for more! Would definitely recommend for a gift or a \\"just because\\" for someone special.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty fun little game so far! Lots of variety but some of the games are pretty annoying/frustrating. Not bad overall though!
B003O86FMW|5.0|As I said in my review of the first book--I didn't want to leave Peeta and Katniss' world. Suzanne Collins was once again able to write a great chapter in this trilogy. Oftentimes the second installment in a trilogy can be lame. In this case it was just as good as the first one.<br />Again, I admit to skimming at times because I wanted, no I needed to know what would happen with Peeta and Katniss. Their relationship was such a huge part of the story, but it was never portrayed as a typical romance. The characters are literally fighting for their lives while learning more about each other. And Katniss discovers something about herself that she didn't know until now. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I'll stop there.<br />I highly recommend this book, but make sure you start with the first one. It really is essential.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it , Nothing but hours of fun. It's the kind of games you can play anywhere and have nothing but fun all by yourself.
