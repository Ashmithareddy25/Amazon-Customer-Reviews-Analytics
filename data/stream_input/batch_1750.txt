0375507256|5.0|Simply put this book is a collection of very good short stories tenuously strung together. It is important to realise that this book is by no means easy to get into, but stick with it and you will find it hard to put down.<br /><br />It is without doubt one of the most entertaining books I have read, and after reading some of the other reviews I feel that perhaps I missed something in that I just found it a comfortable place to visit, and didn't have any need to dwell on any of the 'messages'that the book is apparently trying to convey. My my only criticism is that I wanted more, more of each story, I was left thinking (with the exception of The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish, which was a lovely tale of a man aging disgracefully in world that is no longer his) there is more to say here. There is the old adage 'always leave them wanting more', but the end of each story (particularly An Orison of Sonmi~451 and Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After) seemed rushed, but then that could have been because I was so immersed in the worlds and characters that coming out of them was a kind of anticlimax.<br /><br />I doubt I'll read a book like this again in my life, and I'm glad I had this opportunity.
B009AOFNU4|4.0|This controller is a very well put together product that shows how well the engineers at Steelseries know their products. From the nice compact controller to the rubbery grip throughout the body, this product is worth every penny. That penny however isn't cheap, the steep cost of $80 can hamper even the most veteran of mobile gaming and give off a bad taste. The extremely high battery life is coupled with excellent twin sticks (not performed well with the MOGA which felt like PSP sticks). Another hamper is the available games that work with the device. The two best games that this controller will work with at the time of this writing is both from Madfinger games, both Dead Trigger and Shadowgun:Deadzone. Now to warrant the cost of this controller over two free games isn't that great to do, but carrying this compact controller and playing both of those games felt amazing. Now for someone that is a heavy gamer and understands that some of their games won't work (looking at you Gameloft....), it's still an excellent purchase even with those games and emulators in mind. Many will see the controller as being too small, too expensive, and lack of game support to be laughed at, and I understand their reasons. I just hope Steelseries see's the flaw and try to pursue other developers to make this game pad available for their software, and also to please just lower the cost a bit to warrant a purchase from others.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I loved the Magic Mike. We had a girls night and got together and watched it. Channing Tatum looks great.

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|For the full review, please visit us at Bookluvrs Haven blog.<br /><br />A fellow reader said to me, \\"Lily, this book is going to feel like a heroin addiction. Like it or hate it, you won't be able to put it down.\\"<br /><br />And I was like, \\"Girl ... pffftttttt...\\"<br /><br />I picked up this novel before bed... and could no put it down. Read well into the night, was exhausted during the day, but picked up where I left off as soon as I got home and read until I finished this damn book!<br /><br />Yup, she was right. This book was almost impossible to put down.<br /><br />I wasn't quite sure about the dysfunction of Travis and Abby's relationship... but something about it kept me completely enthralled. Both characters apart were dysfunctional anyways. Together, they were completely co-dependent of each other, desperate for each other and could not function properly without each other.<br /><br />Weird? Ya. Unhealthy? Ya.  Why the insane attraction to Travis then on my part? Why did some of the things that he said to Abby, or did make my heart melt, even though I shook my head at how crazy other things/actions were and I wanted to shake Abby and tell her to RUN??<br /><br />He is the epitamy of the untouchable, unemotional bad boy that all the girls want to change. They want to be the one that he falls for and bares his heart too. And they flock to the broken, dark Travis. But once he gets in their pants, he sends them on their way, still unfeeling, untouched, and very much not in love.<br /><br />Then Abby comes into his life. She isn't like all the other girls. But in a way she is, because she is aware of her attraction, but makes a conscious effort to not fall for Travis' charms. And, of course, once Travis is faced with a female creature he can't tame, he doesn't know what to do with himself. They both form a deep friendship that eventually does follow the inevitable path down into love.<br /><br />Whether it's a good love or an unhealthy love, what I can say is that this was an incredibly intense love. And it was the moments of intensity that held me captivated. But there is a dark side to Travis; a side that without Abby, was destructive, obsessive and violent. Would I condone this type of relationship in real life? HELL NO. But I can't deny that I really enjoyed this novel, and their story. The writer kept me completely captivated from beginning to end. I could not, and did not want to stop reading this.<br /><br />Will I continue the series? Absolutely!that this was an incredibly intense love. And it was the moments of intensity that held me captivated. But there is a dark side to Travis; a side that without Abby, was destructive, obsessive and violent.

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Brave is a great movie. It provides a great story line about how our choices may impact others and how we need to take responsibility for our choices and our lives...all that and some good laughs along the way. What I am not laughing about is finding out AFTER the fact that Amazon Instant Video will not deliver this..or other movies... in HD to my HTPC. Don't know whether this is a licensing issue or a marketing tool to get me to buy a Roku or other \\"supported device\\". Amazon should prominently inform you of this limitation before you make your purchase. Better yet, allow me to order instant videos in HD for watching on my PC. Crazy...a $400 HTPC with no HD but I need a $50 black box to get HD...come on Amazon!

B0086DBE62|4.0|A Bit of a different take on the story. Not painfull to watch. and we enjoyed it.. Made for a good movie to kill a saturday eve. while keeping the cost down..
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Why bother about what professional critics say? They never really listen! They are always in a hurry, they have tons of records to listen to - and it's just their job! So it's really impossible for them to get it right when it comes to such a feel-good easy-listening not-so-famous-standards album as \\"Kisses on the bottom\\". For this is really an album for people who listen to music for pleasure, when they get back from work, or when they invite some friends home, or when they are in the mood for love. It's an album for ordinary, no-bullshit, down-to-earth music lovers. An album for people who grew up listening to the Beatles, but who also fancied Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Ella's songbooks or the Getz-Gilberto album. They are the ones who will get it. For this is such a nice album! The songs are great, and sound fresh. The musicians are superb. Great acoustic bass, great jazz guitars, sweet drums, perfect orchestra - and the goddess Diana Krall herself on top of all that! Not to mention Eric Clapton playing beautiful guitar in two songs and Stevie Wonder embellishing the last song with his blessed harmonica. And it's Paul McCartney singing, for Christ sake! We love him - he filled our lives with so much beauty and feeling. He is familly, really. And it's so nice to have him aging so gracefully... His voice is not half of what it used to be - after all he just turned 70, but he is still natural, and in tune, and he swings, he is playful, he loves the songs. His two contributions as a composer, \\"My Valentine\\" and \\"Only our Hearts\\", fit really well in the album's selection. So don't hesitate. Buy it, listen and enjoy. The more you listen to it, the more it will grow in you. Music history may not change a bit, but I'm quite sure this album will make your life better, your ears grateful, and your heart warmer. Long live Sir Paul! May he die of very old age, still doing his best to honor his legend and our love for him.
B00943SQCI|4.0|When it was first advertised, I said WTF and Hell No. But the trailers and reviews put a little more insite into what the movie was about, It just does not take its self seriosly. Johnny Depp was his wacky self and we enjoyed it.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This was a very moving story with romance, laughter sadness and inspiration , I found it hard to put the book down.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|It was a good read, but it seems that there was too much extra &#34;fluff&#34; that you really didn't care about that didn't really add to the storyline.

B00992CF6W|4.0|The reason why I dyed this app four stars is because it needs a few up dates to make it amazing!!!!
B009NOVCTM|4.0|The Stones got it right on [[ASIN:B00006EXDO More Hot Rocks: Big Hits & Fazed Cookies]] when they included the late, lost B-side (from the \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" single) \\"Child of the Moon.\\" It's easily one of the single greatest tracks from the Brian Jones years, and yet for some inexplicable reason, the Stones have never felt that way, pushing in into the far reaches of the \\"collectors corner.\\"<br /><br />That said, pretty much every other major track you might want or expect can be found here, but listening to the chronological order of classics will make you aware of other omissions (like \\"Out of Time\\").<br /><br />Then again, when you look at the target audience of this CD, they probably own every major Stones track at least 6 times over in studio or live versions. It's not \\"the only Stones album you'll ever need.\\" It's one more Stones compilation to add the the ones you already own, with two new tracks.<br /><br />\\"One More Shot\\" is OK...good, not great, ultimately forgettable, but \\"Doom And Gloom\\" is classic Glimmer Twins. The lyrics are textbook sick Mick wordplay, with Keef slamming them home in riff-driven glee and abandon.<br /><br />The music on the album is, for the most part, 5-star music (but I still can't stomach \\"Angie\\" or \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heatbreaker)\\").<br /><br />My take is that you should already own this music, and should purchase \\"Gloom And Doom\\" as a single MP3 (if it's available). Otherwise, it's a great addition to any classic rock library.
0439023513|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series and I wish there were more as the ending was a little disappointing.  I don't know what to read next!
B008CUVOKK|1.0|This set is partially complete due to the fact that 2 of the 7 books in the series are yet to be publishes. The reason there are 6 books is one of the books has been divided into 2 parts.
0439023491|5.0|Love it!  I read it in one day.  The movie will never do it justice but I will probably watch it anyway.

0764141201|1.0|Don't buy this unless it is for your 5th or 6th grader.  Total disappointment.  My freshman laughed when I showed him and my 2nd grader has figured out over 60% of it so far.
B007TBCTRK|5.0|Marc Streitenfeld's Prometheus soundtrack is as huge as this film's intergalactic concepts and equally as mysterious. It's beauitful with it's more mature sci-fi themes and intense moods that directly address its adult audience who've now grown up to be asking the bigger, serious questions that most others don't even think, dare, or bother to consider asking. It's darker than the previous Alien franchise without becoming lost in that deeper darkness. And it's scary too in a way that isn't cliched or predicatable, but way more in tune with what can be so scary about reality than any other sci-fi film ever created. The soundtrack conveys the immense scope of the film's conceptual vision and also the extraordinary achievement of how the entire Alien franchise's themes have been so brilliantly reconceived and portrayed by the film's director. The soundtrack's massive orchectral range and style are precisely balanced to evocatively express the film's abstract concepts and perplexing moral principals underlying this enigmatic story. I liked the film enough to also buy the soundtrack which I'm now enjoying on its own. I'm sure you will too if you liked the film like I did and still do.
B009X00E18|5.0|I have been using the Marware MicroShell Folio case for my 1st generation 7\\" Kindle Fire for about a year now, and it has provided very good protection for my Kindle. I am happy to report that Marware also is producing a case for the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\".<br /><br />The MicroShell is very sleek, very lightweight, and multi-functional. A hard back shell (made of polycarbonate) protects your device while the top cover, or lid of the case, actually folds into a groove on the back of the hard shell case, to allow you to sit your Kindle on a desk or table and watch hands-free. The case gives you full access to all the ports (on/off switch, charging port, HDMI) and grills in the back for the speakers. The lid is made of polyurethane, with a microfiber interior, to protect the screen from scratches. Finally, there's a exterior black elastic strap that helps to hold the lid closed (or open if you are holding your Kindle with one hand). It's important to use the strap to keep the case closed when not in use, especially if you accidently drop the Kindle, as the lid, because it's so thin, may fly open, thus exposing the screen to the elements.<br /><br />I have been using this product on my 7\\" Kindle for about a year now, and I can honestly say that the Fire still looks brand new. The case has provided excellent protection, and I am pretty confident that I will get the same results from the MicroShell Folio Case for the Fire HD 8.9\\". Plus it looks kind of cool, and because it's so sleek, it doesn't make the Fire look bulky. Highly recommended!<br /><br />November 29, 2012 Edit -- Be careful when inserting your Kindle Fire 8.9\\" into the case. I have found that because the case fits so snugly the volume buttons may sometime stick, causing the Fire to go into \\"Safe Mode.\\" This happened to me twice and I thought something was wrong with the Fire until I did some research online and determined the volume buttons were stuck.
B00846REIS|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Best I've read in a while. Love the characters and storyline. So glad it's a series!
1451695195|3.0|The basic message of the \\"proof of heaven\\" was that the doctor's neocortex was not operating at the time his NDE took place. All scientific explanations for the NDE rely on a functioning neocortex. So for all you readers who did not understand the proof referred to in the title, this is it. He had an NDE at a time when the \\"human\\" aspects of his brain were shut down, when it is impossible to have an NDE because the neocortex was not functioning. OK?<br /><br />That asside, I was disappointed that the actual account of the NDE experiences was sparse. Of course, I do not want the good doctor to fabricate events that did not occur. Other reviewers have said that they were frustrated that the author did not reveal more of what he discussed at the Core (god?). But like many NDE's, perhaps he does not consciously remember. Often an NDE'er will claim they learned many secrets of the universe, and it all seemed perfectly logical and simple. Yet upon returning to Earth, they could not remember! This is not unusual, and I'd prefer the doctor to stick to what he knows rather than invent conversations with God like a certain other author.<br /><br />Here is my main complaint. Perhaps this is because I am a Northerner. I am married to a Southern Lady from Virginia so I am painfully aware of the differences in culture between Northerners and Southerners that are a lot deeper than just accent!  The doctor seems obsessed with telling us how prestigious his family is, and the significant careers of his father's friends and associates. Why should I care? As a northerner, I do not care about \\"family heritage\\" or \\"family name\\" while such things are obsessively important to my wife's family. It is like they still need to establish a form of southern aristocracy to clearly establish their place in the social pecking order, whereas I couldn't care less about such shallow things as whether I sit at the A-Table at the Country Club. The good doctor also tells us much more than we need to know about himself, although I can sympathize with him. Perhaps he does this to add substance to his claims. Basically, he was a man of strict mainstream science, studied at the best schools (Harvard always causes us mere mortals to gasp and genuflect, right?). Then the illness and associated NDE changed his life totally. I wanted to know more about his reflections on the illness. Has no continued analysis of his unique case been done? Is he written up in medical journals? If his case was singular and his recover a miracle, shouldn't it be a cause for continued study and publication in a prestigious medical journal? This was not mentioned.<br /><br />Finally, what is with this bow tie club? Am I, as a mere Northerner, missing something? Does the bow tie symbolize upper-class connections? I saw the picture of the author on the book in a bow tie and I thought he looked absurd from a Yankee viewpoint. Can someone tell me the hidden symbolism behind wearing a bow tie in the 21st century? What next? A top hat and cane? Spates and a tux with tails?
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been using these for years.  Like them very much.  Prefer these to earbuds because they don't plug up your ear.
0374214913|4.0|I'm going out on a not so narrow limb here and guessing that reviews for \\"Mr. Penumbra's...\\" might divide along generational lines.  I'm an AARP type and got some enjoyment out of the technical procedural that is central to the book's theme, but the very emphasis on the great god Google and lesser IT instruments that are the secondary characters here was lost on me.  When the story veered occasionally back toward a traditional mystery, my attention span snapped back into place; when it lurched back in the other direction, I was skipping paragraphs.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Penumbra's...\\" does manage to convince the reader that there is another world out there that is populated by a different kind of mind and person and probably several years ahead of the general population in perspective and imagination.  This is probably not a news flash for those readers who locked into the storyline and gave the book high marks.<br /><br />In any event, it was an interesting experience for me and author Robin Sloan certainly earned my respect for articulating an original plot with credible characters.
0547884591|5.0|I have read the first hundred or so pages in this book. I am somewhat critical of the past books Tim has written but this book is byfar his best. The first section is is extremely dense in terms of ass-kicking material. I have read many books in the area of personal development and this book outlines the best methods to truly learn anything.<br /><br />It features all the psychology behind learning and it also includes CONCRETE steps that anyone can take and apply to other subjects besides cooking. The unique way that Tim explains the principles of learning anything is what makes this book so wonderful. I have never before understood so well what I need to do to learn anything.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this app is awesome just needs more cars. right now I still have the starter car. I wish you could get glue coins easier.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best series ever. Perfect love story and very, very exiting. This is definatly my most favorite series and book ever.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Another well done film by Lasse Hallström; I've yet to see a Hallström product that was not first-rate.  Charmig, rolig och underhållande, starkt rekommendert...
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|If you want a truer picture of life in N. Korea, this is the other side of the story. The thought of a family<br />being held accountable for the actions of one for three generations is even worse than the accounts<br />of the stalanist era. Trying to review this book is like trying to review the civil war. You have to read<br />it for yourself.. I found it to be a heart-wrenching experience and a profound story of one mans<br />tenacity and courage and a sad account of a government so paranoid as to defy understanding.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|What a waste of time. As in his other films, Mr Anderson is trying to emulate Lasse Hallström. He fails miserably once again.  This movie has neither the charm of Gilbert Grape nor the elegant humor of My Life as a Dog. Who in their right mind would finance an arrogant disaster like this?
1572814136|5.0|I think this is a beautiful deck. The cards are good sized but not too large. Overall, I would recommend this deck to others.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad Piggies is such a fun game.  There are many challenges that allow you to be creative as you make them fly.
B00981V68W|5.0|This CD is a great effort of both voice, music and powerful production. The sensual and smoky voice of Kaas is extraordinary. Along each song of this CD you feel that these songs are brand new and belong to her. No imitations and copying of Piaf's way of singing like other artist did in the past ( like Dion , Matthiew and others). Abel Korzenowski music is majestic and magical. The show at Carnegie hall was so unique and powerful. Carnegie's strict rules regarding any additional decor left Kaas alone on a huge stage which she dominated perfectly with her presence and performance. Her voice, even deeper than Piaf and more powerful than the studio album itself is just fascinating.<br />Great Album, if you like Piaf's songs or not you will live this work.<br />5 stars
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Love the dynamic of the dilemmas within this plot, the back line story, and the ultimate choices we all have to make when raising children.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Ok so Looper was a dope movie imo! It had a great story that at first takes a while to pick up the pace. Some things do go unexplained or don't make sense at first but just keep watching, it all makes sense at the end. The plot is a very detailed one with a lot of points and parts that you cannot afford to miss, you must pay attention from beginning to end or you will miss it. If you enjoy Sci-Fi with a mixture of action and drama and great story telling then you will love this movie. Both Bruce And Joseph do a great job portraying the characters. I never once lost interest watching this movie and I will definitely purchase this on blu ray december 31!!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|If you like high quality apps, get this one. It is fun and it keeps you entertained. I just hope that they keep coming up with new elements to create.
1419705849|5.0|I love the Wimpy Kid series and so do my children. The movies are already made, but it's never to late to read the books. I recommend any child 2nd grade and older start reading the series, one book at a time.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This was required reading my sophomore year in high school. Though I had tremendous appreciation for it then, I find that reading it in my adult years has allowed me to more deeply understand the significance of the message. I think this should be required reading for all of us, at least by the early adult years. It will make you appreciate your life and the opportunities you have regardless of your circumstances.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is meant for a fifth or sixth grade reader but it is still very good.<br /> I liked it a lot
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Loved this film in the theater and I love it even more on Blu-ray. While I bought the film on blu-ray entirely for the film, the extras are thoughtfully done and add to my experience. Needless to say, if you are an Avengers fan, you will find this more than satisfying. Whether you get it for the 3D or 2D experience, I tend to prefer 2D, but the 3D is as good as it gets. Happy viewing to all!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm not a big game player so something really has to grab my interest for me to play. This is one of those games.

030759565X|3.0|I follow the blog by the same name and enjoy it although find some of the recipes challenging and time consuming.  The book is the same.  Good book for the serious foodie, but I had trouble finding recipes I wanted to fix.  The meatloaf was a lot of work for mediocre results.
B001JIHGO0|5.0|I found this movie very exciting, wonderful special effects and a great story line. This movie touched on every emotion, sad for the ending where the girl dies, a roaring Hooray! for the good over evil winning again.Laughter and tears abound in this great show!!!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The 2012 Blu-Ray edition of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is absolutely Blu-Ray state-of-the-art. I've been wanted such a dream-edition of this film since Blu-Ray first came out over eight years ago. The long delay has been worth the wait and is most gratifying. I bought the only partially successful restored 1988 edition many years ago, but it failed to deliver the magnificent prints I originally saw in the theater. Finally this 2012 Blu-Ray edition stuns the eyes. It is as perfect a Blu-Ray film as I've ever seen, and a great relief it is, since I've been disappointed by Blu-Ray editions of older films many times. Not this time. The reds are particularly notable, and the color editing reminds me more of the Technicolor of the fifties, with its highly saturated reds. But still, the reds are perfectly sharp and are more stunning than garish. This has to be one of the finest Blu-Ray disks ever released.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|great game- kids and adults will enjoy this game. it is very easy to start with and then builds up to a challenging game. cute graphics too.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Marvel gets how to make movie versions of their material in a way that DC just doesn't... and the fact that this film was built to in plot threads, small segments of and tail-bits of the other super hero films - connecting them in a really smart way.  From Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk (though with different actors) - and even including bits that ensured Hawkeye and Black Widow,  were included in the world.  It's a great example of super-hero film making and I for one am looking forward to more.
B001AXU1CS|4.0|a good movie that also has a niffy added decoration - recommend for those &#34; cant think of anything to watch&#34; moments.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|LOVE the new CD!!  Awesome music. David Garrett and collaborators did great work. He sounds just a good playing live. Can't wait until he tours again in the US
1401940676|1.0|By her own account Anita Moorjani was never &#34;dead&#34;. She was in a coma. Don't know how she can speak as someone who has journeyed to the other side. I've read other near death experiences that were much more believable. She claims that we don't come from God but rather we are god. Too many holes in this story for me.
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|I REALLY enjoyed this performance.  It's not perfect, but it's very good over all and WAY better than the 2004 movie.  A musical (wether live or in film) should have great music - and to have great sounding music you have to have great singers, right?  Well, the 20004 movie does not, but this recording definitely does!  Sierra Boggess is fantastic, and the two leading guys were pretty great as well.  The acting in this was better than I expected, again especially Sierra B. (Christine).  There were a few problems with the production since they decided to film it at a concert hall rather than a theater (it was a sentimental place for Andrew Lloyd Webber).  The main one being the LED backdrops they used rather than traditional backdrops.  They would be fine for the audience (they look alright from a distance) but on camera with so many close-ups, they are pretty awful at times.  And the chandelier was stationary and never actually fell.  One particular scene that was changed for no apparent reason was the first time Christine is taken to the phantom's lair, there is no \\"Christine\\" doll in a wedding dress.  But those problems are far outweighed by the superb singing and impressive acting.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|totaly epic i love angry birds now:) it has a lot of new stuff that was not in the old angry birds i love it.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|This is a great knife.  Hard to believe the price.  I am a little disappointed in the sheath. I have had the knife for quite some time and it is still extremely difficult to remove the knife from the sheath.  I hate to spend more money on a better sheath, though...They go for as much as I spent on the knife...
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Very nice app compared to some of the other android apps. Works great with the kindle as it should. Nice looking as well as functional.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book; all the right twists, told entertainingly! Easy read, couldn't put it down. Early on, you think, &#34;something just isn't right&#34;-then he lets you in on it and it's great fun from then on.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King is a great writer.  He never has disappointed me, and he keeps getting better.  His description of what it was like in America in the late 50's and early 60's was very accurate  and no matter what fantastic concept he takes on (like traveling back in time) he always makes it seem completely plausible.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Good collection of MJ songs, quite a few I already had but the ones I didn't I was glad to get.
B000008FNB|2.0|I've never really cared for this collection. I've had this set now for many years and I just never play it. I find the set a big turn off. First of all the inserts to the cds have gold printed onto black. This makes it hard to read. On the back of the cds the songs are listed gold on black in a font that I don't care for. On the front of the cds Lindsey, Stevie, Mick and Christine offer up a comment which is again, gold on black but this time in cursive and sloppy writing. What can I say, the set looks ugly. The booklet too is more of the same, gold on black outer cover. The booklet is nothing more than black and white. There are some decent photos but the black and white does little for this collection. In the back of the booklet a discography of F.M. singles is provided but the listings are printed over photos of the band which makes it a real pain in the ass to try to look at. You have to CONCENTRATE to view the singles focusing on the singles and not the background photo. As for the collection I guess this one started out with songs from \\"Behind The Mask\\", which I've never even owned. I guess I should be thankful for those songs on this collection that I have not heard. The songs on disc one go from The Mask to Tusk, Mirage, Fleetwood Mac white, Tango. The Second and third discs are the same mix without the newer songs. The fourth disc has the oldest material. In a collection or so called box set one hopes for something better. All that was done here was a bunch of tracks were thrown together and with little regard. I guess this is supposed to be a best of collection or stand out songs from over the years.<br /><br />A better collection would have provided pictures that are in color with some real information about former band members, older albums, particular songs, an evolution of the band. Where is the essay that most collections offer? Where is something I can READ???? Trying to access this collection is a pain in the ass and I surely don't care for the mixof the songs. And why are there not more live songs, some demos, outtakes, and assorted rarities?<br /><br />This collection simply doesn't do much for fans. Most Fleetwood Mac fans have copies of Rumors, White, Tango, Tusk, Live, Mirage and I even have English Rose myself. So most of what is here is already owned by a Fleetwood Mac fan. So offer up more of the same and mix it all up and put it all in an ugly little box with an unappealing booklet and this is what I feel this collection is. Sorry, but I don't get any use out of this collection. That being said I should try to \\"air it out\\" sometime just to get a little \\"bang for my hard earned bucks\\".<br /><br />Perhaps the problem with this box set is more of the same where the members can't be counted on to communicate with others. Oh there precious egos!!
0385247125|5.0|Enjoyed this book, it would have been nice if he'd written another one more recently before he passed away. &#60;3
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Interesting story-line and an entertaining execution. It does follow some of the basics of sci-fi when humans interact with people from another world. So of course some of the script is very predictable, but this contains a couple of surprises. Overall a &#34;good&#34; not great movie. Worth a watch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|entertaining and fun.  like the Sims only quicker and easier to meet your goals so you don't get frustrated and give up.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Love this cover.  It works great and protects very well.  love the fact that it stand up and doesn't continously fold shut.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a fun game for parents and kids alike. Just have to be patient unless you like spending real $$$ on gems and bits.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Unlike the gorgeous iOS apps Amazon has released, this app has a sparse interface that makes navigation a chore. This may be because this app was developed prior to the popularity of Android tablets and so has the smaller phone screen in mind. But it now been a year and a half since this app was updated and it's time for Amazon to show some love for tablets besides its own Kindle devices.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I am greatly inspired and I refer to this book often when I need further inspiration.  I am working my way through years of stuff room by room.
0385535139|3.0|I love the books of John Grisham, but this one even when it interesting is too slow.  It made me bored before I reach the half book.
B008MZPVP4|4.0|It may be business as usual Down town but this collection of songs is satisfyingly heavy and worth buying if only to own the righteous Witchtripper, a stone cold classic with fantastic, evocative lyrics concerning a satanic ritual. The lyrics are a real highlight on this recording and the artwork has an almost seductive quality. Swirling psychedelic colours in the sky, a looming cross, a tattered reaper, the serenity and power of the graveyard. You can almost smell flesh dripping from the bones of the dead as they rise from the swamp. Good god, all they want to do is eat. You can hear something slither in the trees under that yellow moon. You can feel metal surge in the blood. You can taste whiskey in your throat. Yes, yes you can, drink it, drink it all now. Drink it all Down.

B000NDI3SK|5.0|This is a series that never goes out of style.  This was a gift to and older (like me) lady and we enjoy watching it several times.  We pick up on something new with every viewing.

1423101499|4.0|DISCLAIMER: Spoilers may follow!<br /><br />My overall opinion: As with the rest of the Percy Jackson series, I really had nothing to complain about. This book, like its predecessors, was excellently written and as fun as always. I appreciate the growth of the characters, and the complexity of the challenges they face and will soon face. I will admit, though, that this one was probably my least favorite of the series so far, but that's simply my personal opinion.<br /><br />The good: The one (and perhaps, only) thing in this book that really appealed to me was the characters. I really liked the addition of Nico di Angelo. In The Titan's Curse, he was like a five-year-old with an attention disorder. In this book, he's not only grown, but become darker. And I love dark characters. It's also nice to see that the half-blood world can acknowledge that not everyone is out to save the world like Percy, Annabeth, and...well, everyone else. While I don't think Nico will follow Luke's path, I like his self-concerning, anti-heroic attitude. It throws a wrench in the works, but in a nice way. And the fact that he's Hades's son makes him even more interesting. For me, I've always wanted to see more of Hades since The Lightning Thief. I feel that he would make a really nice addition to the plot. We'll see what happens in The Last Olympian, I suppose...<br /><br />I was sketchy about Rachel when we first saw her in The Titan's Curse, only because I didn't like the idea of Percy being interested in anyone but Annabeth. But as it turned out, I found Rachel refreshing, and a great complement to Annabeth's occasionally standoffish personality. And since Annabeth won't give Percy the time of day, I guess it's time to move on anyway. I was even able to tolerate Calypso, following that same idea. She seemed a little too sweet for me, although I did feel bad for her. I suppose I imagined Calypso should be more of Tia Dalma from \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" who was neither sweet nor nurturing. But by the end of that chapter, I was okay with her.<br /><br />The bad: The only problem I might say I had with this book was that, unlike with the previous books, the beginning fight scenes/introductory dilemmas seemed almost childish. One that comes to mind is the scene at the ranch with the cannibal horses and the poop-shoveling. That seemed completely unnecessary and a step in the wrong direction for the sophistication of the series. I understand Riordan was trying to add his trademark comical twist on an otherwise intense or problematic situation, but even I had to say, \\"Come on.\\"<br /><br />Another thing that concerned me was the alleged resolution with Pan, the god of the wild. Riordan spent the first three-and-a-half books talking about the legendary god, and he only lasted for about five pages, and then he was gone. And personally, at the back of my mind, from the first book when we first learned about Pan, all I could think was, \\"Okay...that's nice.\\" I don't feel like he was really necessary. Thankfully, at least, Riordan wrote in the side-quest/sub-plot of finding Pan in a way that did not make it feel like an extra limb that needed to be severed off. Even for being unnecessary, the flow of the plot was not disrupted.<br /><br />The plot wasn't terrible, although I didn't enjoy it as I did, the others. I felt like this plot was a lot more repetitive, i.e. running out of the labyrinth, battling some random enemy, running back inside, and starting all over. About half-way through, it just lost its appeal, and that's why it took me so long to read this book.<br /><br />And on a last personal note: Annabeth is really getting on my nerves. She won't stop obsessing over Luke, but she's supposedly in love with Percy and gets bent-out-of-shape when Rachel comes around. Stop being that stereotypical girl, Annabeth! Besides, Luke is a psycho! At least Percy isn't insane...oh, yeah. And he's actually your age.<br /><br />*sigh* Jeez.<br /><br />Why I gave it the rating I did: There really wasn't anything terribly wrong with this book, but it was certainly not my favorite. The plot was redundant and the characters were annoying (Annabeth) sometimes, but it wasn't unbearable, and I look forward to The Last Olympian.<br /><br />You can read the full review of this book and other books on my blog at christinamlegler . blogspot . com (no spaces).

B004GFN11A|5.0|The only thing missing is control of your plugins. Really good app otherwise. If you have multiple WordPress installs this is a must.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Like many others I started really getting into it and then BAMB they want me to pay for &quot;energy&quot;!  I would pay a minimal amount because the game is fun but I am not going to continue to pay to play. I don't do it on facebook and I'm not going to do it here.
B00846REIS|3.0|Too many parallels to Fifty Shades, but at 75% completion, it started to develop its own personality. Also, it seemed kind of lazy in the plot/character development. But, for a mindless read, it's not completely awful.
1416972250|5.0|Perfect condition just as desribed when I bought it. My students like the book and have enjoyed all of the series to this point.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|Wow. I always get so excited when I hear of a new release from Christina. I love her voice, the way she expresses herself in her music, and her use of experimentation in her music. There really is only one Christina and know one compares to her. I hated that \\"Bionic\\" didnt do well because it was such a good album. It took some getting used too but she was just having fun on that album. \\"Lotus\\" is is fun filled, different, laid back at times, and emotional. There is a few that have to grow on me.... \\"Circles\\" (Which is weird and immature sounding like \\"Bobblehead\\") , \\"Shut Up\\" (Reminds me of a follow up of \\"I Hate Boys\\" except less fun), and \\"Red Hot Kinda Love\\" but overrall its a great sequel to \\"Stripped\\" which is her best album to date. As you will see, I love inspirational songs and she does them all!<br /><br />Top 5:<br />1. Best Of Me - Sounds like it belongs on the \\"Stripped\\" Album right after \\"Fighter\\". Amazing self esteem song.<br />2. Blank Page - Like \\"The Voice Within\\", \\"Hurt\\", and \\"You Lost Me\\" This song follows the same beauty of lyrics, emotion, and arrangement. Its a CLASSIC Christina staple.<br />3. Just A Fool - I have to admit, I hate country music, but Blake and Christina together is SO AWESOME. I love this song and its a great second single.<br />4. Army of Me - Another \\"Fighter/Keep Singin My Song\\" follow up and extremely inspiration. How can you get tired of these types of songs especially since you have such a strong voice singing them?<br />5. Lotus - I love this intro. All though its repetitive, its beautifully written. She reminds us that her poetry hasnt gone away.

030758836X|3.0|I must say I have mixed feelings about this book. While  I feel the story here is one that beckons you to  stay up all night and keep on reading, something is just missing.  I loved the plot and the suspense, and the twists and turns, and the pacing is just awesome. But the characters lack some credibility and the ending is just not in line with the rest of the story. To say I felt cheated would be an understatement. Still, worth a look for sure.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come... as the saying goes. Very enjoyable! From the cadet point of view especially. The acting was well down. the Special effects were far-reaching during the second half, where it becomes more intense. the texture and cinematography were exquisite. Sound track was moving throughout movie. Overall I believe it definitely gives the Halo Mythos more depth and realism. It also fills in some gaps in the Halo time-line. This movie actually made me cry in some scenes.  The acting depiction of master chief was surprisingly good and the ending left me more curious than before about who the spartans were. Such mystery behind the helmet!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Great album!  I feel like I found a buried treasure!  I have told several friends and family who have now also purchased.  Every time I listen I hear something new and wonderful!

B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read and enjoyed all of Vince Flynn's books and this one is no exception. In this book Flynn uses the backdrop of the planned American withdrawal from Afghanistan to create a very plausible and readable story. The book opens with Flynn's main character Mitch Rapp tasked with finding a CIA official that's gone missing in Afghanistan and trying to figure out who's attempting to cause havoc within the CIA's Clandestine Service.<br /><br />As usual this book is packed with plenty of action and multiple interesting plot twists. What I think is special about this book is that Flynn has Rapp exploring some of his past and his motivation for doing what he does for the CIA. This kind of character development within a fast pace action thriller doesn't always happen. Flynn's other characters are also well written, particularly the \\"bad guys.\\" Like most, if not all, of Flynn's readers I've always rooted for Rapp in each book, but the villains Flynn's created in this book are so odious that I disliked them even more and wanted Rapp to deal with them even more in previous books.<br /><br />For Kindle owners: This book does not use actual page numbers but the publisher does mark the end of each chapter on the status bar at the bottom of the Kindle screen. I find this really helpful because if I want to read just one or two chapters before bed I've got at least an approximation of how long I'll be reading.
1449415881|5.0|At first I bought this to give to one of the many engineers I work with for the sake of humor it holds - humor I understand and the sarcasm I can relate too, until I realized its probably best I keep it because Dilbert truly captures how I also feel on a regular basis given the kind of work I do :).

B0015DYIH2|1.0|ok mrs. THE BOOK WAS SO BAD I COULD OF WRITTEN IT MYSELF. write it! the book was amazing and i so  recommend it
B000068VHP|5.0|Well, it may not have a super duper remaster but this is also a very NICE DR13 recording so all the dynamics are spot on. They didn't go and ruin it so I cannot fault them there even if it is the same exact thing as the 93' release with more tracks. It still sounds pretty damn fine on my hi-fi setup though it could use a fresh pass on the Analogue to Digital convertors of today.<br /><br />The hits like Dreams and Linger are here but most of the other stuff is up to par in comparison. I would give the album as a whole about a 4.3 as it is not remastered but I will give it the whole five rounding up because it is a great album and still sounds good with full dynamic range. They really don't make albums like this anymore. Come to think of it what exactly do they make anymore? The late 80s and early 90s produced some of the best bands to ever pick up guitars and then into the 2000s we didn't get a whole lot from of this stuff. Which makes going back to it all the more fun. Songs like Pretty, which seems to want to explode but never does, and others like I Still Do are ethereal rockers and quite beautiful. Sunday is another great track. All in all a very interesting debut and produced by Stephen Street of The Smiths fame to boot.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This movie featured a lot of cool action sequences that kept the story interesting. Its not the most intellectual movie, but what can you really expect from a fictional movie about Abraham Lincoln killing vampires. I enjoyed it and will purchase the movie when the price goes down a little.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book. Couldn't put it down. Stephen King makes everything so real. He is one of my favorite all time authors and this one rates right up there with &#34;The Stand&#34; for me. Can't wait to read it again.

B004WGIXX4|1.0|Too bad Natalie Portman had to act in this movie.  It was a waste of her talent.<br /><br />The story line was totally implausible, even for a rom-com.  I get mad at myself when I allow myself to get hoodwinked into watching junk like this.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|How can you beat getting all these versions of this incredible movie for only $20? Did I mention this also contains the digital soundtrack for the movie?
0062073486|5.0|I read this book when I was 13, and it may have been one of the first books I read that I've never been able to stop thinking about. The twist at the end is so genius, I've been recommending it for years. In some ways I'm sorry this was the first Christie book I read because I haven't felt any of the titles I've read subsequently have been as good, but I know that's due to this being one of the best mysteries ever written.
1572815612|4.0|This deck is excellent quality - easy to shuffle, but sturdy. I have the pocket deck and use it all the time because it is such a great size, that I decided I wanted to get the full size one too. I thought I might use it instead of my commemorative Pamela Coleman Smith deck, since that deck is thick and harder to shuffle.<br /><br />However, the art work of this deck with the colored pencil colorings just doesn't hold up to the original Smith colorings. It doesn't bother me on the smaller deck, but this larger deck just makes those differences more obvious. So, I use this deck sometimes because I like the feel and handling, but I prefer the look of the cards of the commemorative deck.
0439813786|4.0|For some reason I've avoided reading this, but when I saw it was in the collection of my library, I decided to break down and give it a shot. I must say it far exceeded my expectations. It was an interesting story, both in words and pictures. The drawings are beautifully done in black and while, though they didn't inspire me to stop and study them very often. The two mediums flow together nicely and the historical aspect was intriguing. Looking forward to getting the sequel soon.

0765357151|5.0|A fascinating exposition about what it means to be a monster cleverly wrapped into a chilling horror classic. The book is indescribably better than any filmed versions (all of which remove the meaning of the title completely in my opinion), and one I consistently recommend for others to read. It's short and easy to get through, driven by fast-paced dialogue and just enough description.<br /><br />Additionally, the other short stories in the collection are disturbing -- in a good way. Many feel like they could have easily been some of his Twilight Zone episodes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well, my cousin has a kindle fire and has 0.5.version, and I have 0.4.0 still. Awkward. Real awkward. but its a really great game!
0439023513|3.0|I loved, loved, loved the first book; loved, loved the second book; and was hoping for at least one loved for this book. Very sad this didn't happen. Even though I've now regaled my roommate with complaints about the book for an hour, I don't have the heart to give it less than three stars, just based on the first two. My advice? Read the first two and then ask someone to tell you what happens in the third (which will honestly take about three sentences to hit every plot point) or be aware that you can skim a lot of it.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This game is one of those games that gets your mind going but its not fair that you halft to pay for something that is free! Get this game if you want to pay 5$ or more to play!
B005XLN97M|3.0|This is a very flimsy toy, made of cheap plastic. It comes apart every single time we pick it up and move it. I would not recommend giving the $40 something dollars it usually costs. Instead, wait until it goes on a good sale.<br /><br />My child has fun with it and does enjoy it, and it looks good, but as a parent it's extremely frustrating having to put it back together all the time since it comes apart on a daily basis (yes, daily)! You're getting ripped off if you pay more than $20 for this toy, in my opinion.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is simple and straightforward, easy to install, and fun to play.  random deal is challenging enough to make it addictive but easy enough so that it is not frustrating.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is a marvelous movie although my wife disliked the section of killing animals in the life boat.  That is what animals do to one another!  The visuals were amazing, especially the zoo scene at the beginning.  I am a lover of 3D and this film uses it to the absolute visual apogee.  Of all the 3D movies, I have viewed this film was the best.  I noticed camera angles were always correct and lighting was superb.  This movie is not for children!  GWR
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Great for homework! Just as good as Mircrosoft Office!I would very much HIGHLY recommend this to everyone! Great investment for students or even for office work!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Great sci-fi thriller with a good plot, even if you are not an Alien fan this movie can stand alone without ever having watched Alien.  However, if you have seen Alien this does not seem like a direct pre-quel as some have touted.  It does tie the two movies together well, but leaves a lot of loose ends and questions that fans of Alien were probably hoping would get answered.  Maybe that will come with the next one???
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is so good.....all my calculations that I put in it are 100% correct! lol I know that because I put it in my scientific calculator then come to this app just for fun :D ....great app....get it!!

B004WR125O|1.0|I purchased this a year ago. Installation wasn't that difficult, using it was hit or miss. It takes a very long time for the receiver to identify and connect - sometimes it would not connect at all. The receiver is about 25 feet from the wireless router (WRT54GS with high gain replacement antennas)<br />Eventually, I took the UWF-1 and threw it in a fit of rage and I haven't seen it since....<br />Others here have suggested the TP-Link TL-WN722N Wireless USB Adapter, I'll try that one next.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|In my opinion I believe you should add some  pop to this book for it is about a dry  a read as the local obituaries.I mean , seriously I know it's a dictionary but GD WOULD IT KILL YA TO ADD SOME PICS?!?!?!!?
B002RKSZS0|2.0|I didn't expect much and didn't get much in return. Only the faux Gothic parts were fun. Only read if you are a dedicated Austenite.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really liking it so far. Theres lots of options to play with and a lot to keep track of. Especially good for a free game.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|Terrible movie. I wish I could get those two hours of my life back. It's a sad day when you see a good collection of actors partake in film so horribly done.
0425263908|5.0|It reminds me of fifty shades of grey. The book looks new. Very happy with my purchase. Received before ETA.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie, not all of it believable but fathomable none the less. I found myself easily routing for the bad guy who was also the good guy. Definitely worth the time spent!
0425263916|5.0|Received this product before Eta! If you like fifty shades of grey you will like this book. It looked brand new

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not put this book down. I cannot wait for the movie ! Travis Maddox... YUM! Yeah.. it glorifies drinking and bad boys... but I'll let it slide. LOVE LOVE LOVE
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I'm sure plenty of people found this interesting.  For me, it just didn't connect in any way.  Gave it a go based on recommendations from friends, sorry I did.<br /><br />To me, the whole thing came across as an attempt at a writing exercise, not as a book.
B004P7CMDM|5.0|Got this for my 16 year old for Christmas. Loved to 2fer deal here at an excellent price when the prices were varied. The series is good, great deal.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|my kids and I played this for months - then installed the update. after the update,  the following problems occurred :<br />crash randomly<br />energy counter doesn't increase or decrease<br />crash when collecting food<br />crash when planting potatoes<br /><br />we've uninstalled twice and reinstalled. it happens both on a kindle fire and a samsung relay.
0061743526|5.0|This is my favorite book, i bought this one to replace the one I lost. I have adored this book since I was a kid and now my 16 year old is reading it, definitely a classic, and its a book that was made into an equally impeccable movie that is true to the story with a winning cast including Gregory Peck
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought this from my sons Kindle Fire and it works perfect for it but then I realized it fits my samsung galaxy s3 and it's longer than the 1 that came with it so now I use it all the time works great I would recommend to anybody!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Fabulous movie, love Emma Stone, you will cry your eyes out, great movie to watch with your girlfriends, daughters, and mothers.
B009JTCBLE|5.0|This is the best work from this group so far....any Led Zeppelin fan would love this album.  The title track and The Circle could be be Zep tunes.
B000669GAI|5.0|I got this for my 16 year old, this music dropped WHEN I was her age, its a greatest hits so you know its good.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I don't usually rate apps, but I feel this one really deserves it. I play most games a few times &amp; am done. This one has kept my interest. The games are challenging, vary in difficulty, make me think, and are just plain fun. New games are added from time to time which keeps me hooked. It's a great morning coffee game. I got it awhile back as a faotd, but it IS worth the price &amp; if they come out with another one, I will purchase it without hesitation.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I got this for my 16 year old, this music dropped WHEN I was her age, its a greatest hits so you know its good.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|tried to use it failed.this is not the first app from amazon that did not work.they should regulate their apps that they have in the app store.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|These guys are a new modern age rock band, I found out about them thru my 16 year old, reminiscent of the Motley Crue,Kiss Poison age.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Since purchasing my Kindle for my birthday in 2011, It has become my constant companion! Being a Science fiction Fan from way back, (Edgar Rice Burroughs, John Carter of Mars, and his Venus series, as well as all the Tarzan books; John Norman and his GOR series; Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury,(so sorry about his passing)Robert A Heinlein, etc...) the experience of downloading the Wool compendium seemed a no lose affair.  I literally couldn't put the reader down! Great character development and detail, along with the relationships developed seemed to me to signal another great series in the offing.  Howly has indeed been added to my favorite authors list.<br />I purchased the next book in the series that gives a little background on the development of the silo's. The \\"prequel\\" doesn't read nearly as easily as the initial \\"Omnibus edition\\" but all the background is sincerely appreciated.<br />Cheers, Steven Emmert
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Love Lady Gaga, her style and music are unique and empowering, my 5 year old is a big fan, she spands generations of people as well that enjoy her music.
B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|I bought this mainly because I really liked Ti West's &#34;House of the Devil&#34; although the ending was a little gory to me. I was not disappointed in the least. The characters were immediately likable. Sara Paxton's &#34;I just got the beejeezus scared out of me&#34; faces are awesome. Pat Healy is perfect. There are some very funny moments, but it's also creepy and scary. And I'm a fan of listening to the Director's comments. It really adds a lot to this - they stayed in this hotel while filming &#34;House of the Devil&#34; and that prompted him to write this and to base Kelly McGillis's character (who is great) on Dee Wallace, who has a tiny role in &#34;House of the Devil.&#34; I have probably watched this 50 times since I bought it. The pace is good and it goes from fun to scary to fun to really scary so quickly. If you just liked to be spooked, this is a good one.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Believe it or not my 16 year old WANTED this for her birthday!! I got it for her because I WANTED IT TOO!! They are classic and this set has all the hits you know on it, obviously the Bee Gees are timeless.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very enjoyable and fun game. Easy at first but gets more difficult as you go! I would reccommend it to others!
0142419400|5.0|A very sweet book. It's predictable, but still very enjoyable. The ending will make you smile for hours after you finish it. A wonderful feel-good book and always puts me in a good mood. Plus, the French background is beautiful.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|This app started freezing up first time my son played.  After restarting app, the whole Kindle froze up &amp; needed restart. Then then the wi-fi stopped working. After I uninstalled app, problems went away. Do not recommend under any circumstance.
0385535147|5.0|This book lived up to John Grisham's way of weaving page turning anticipation.  He has a way of making the reader want more.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|He caught me on the first page and didn't turn me loose until the end!  Am a big fan of this Mississippi man, having read all of his previous books, and this was one of my faves.  The thing that makes Grisham so successful is his special art of story telling.  This one didn't disappoint.  I would definitely recommend it to friends and anybody reading this review.
B008XCPO2Q|1.0|This movie was so boring and thin on plot we turned it off after about half an hour. Matthew Mcconaughey was the one somewhat bright spark, but there was too little of him and too much of pointless, slow-moving nothingness to save it for us.
0345472322|5.0|One of the new self-help books - scientific books written by leading researchers in the field, such as The Procrastination Equation by Dr. Piers Steel - it's also one of the best. I recommend reading Alex Vermeer's (alexvermeer.com) reviews of the book.
B006Z00M9I|5.0|This 3rd installment of Paranormal Activity is great.  It gradually started to frighten me - and did it without cheap gore.  It was filled with real dread and the end was unexpected and stunning but I do not want to give anything away to spoil your enjoyment.<br /><br />Picture this - I was watching it alone in the living room with just a candle burning.  My husband and dogs were asleep in the bedroom.  Because that made my room look black and white, the grainy black and white of the film seemed to INCLUDE where I was sitting.  There is a subtle scene in the bedroom doorway and another with the babysitter that are unforgettable.  Some might say silly, but not when you are alone and are a person who likes spooky movies.<br /><br />It made the first 2 movies understandable.  Make certain you look at every frame of this movie - there are things lurking in the background that you might not notice.<br />For that reason, I think the grainy quality of the film works very well - because you can't see exactly and clearly which heightened the fear.<br /><br />Bravo that is can be so evil and scary without disgusting torture and gross scenes.  You don't have to have movie stars and famous directors to make an excellent horror movie - you need good writing and actors who look scared and 'into' the dread instead of just 'going through the motions'.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This is not user friendly.  I could not figure it out.  Maybe it was my age, but I can not recommend this game.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|[[ASIN:B008YWY0HK Brave]]<br />I was looking for a movie that would take me away from the real world for a couple of hours. I found everything I was wanting in the DVD Brave. I felt relaxed after the movie and loved the story. I have been off Disney movies for several years but Brave has make a great impression.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app tells me everything I need to know about my Kindle's battery health,  battery life,  and how long I can play games before my battery dies,  etc. I HIGHLY recommend that you get this app.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig has created a classic Bond that is perfect for our times.  A wonderful actor who can do more with his eyes and reactions than most actors can do with a page of dialogue.  He has a complete understanding of the Bond character and what makes him an essential hero. Skyfall works on every level, action, dramatic tension, depth of character, great actors, beautifully shot and directed.  If you prefer invisible cars, CGI, smug acting and grade-school level quips, you might not get it.  But if you want to experience that sense of magic and excitement and energetic immersion that comes with a great movie, then Skyfall is for you.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This was by far one of the most surreal true story movies I have ever seen. I am not one for having true feelings about movies, but Into The Wild has broken that pattern. Awesome movie.
B002JIEYLC|5.0|Sabotage was the first Sabbath record that I had in its entirety when it came out in 1975 vs just knowing some individual songs from the earlier albums. Everybody knows Paranoid, Master of Reality or Vol 4 but to me Sabotage is the most complex, dark and concept-type album from Iommi and company. The production was also much better than the earlier records which was welcome back then too. This remaster does a great job of making it even better, I highly recommend it for the awesomely eerie writing and performance plus the high end production on this remaster.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I really liked how all of the characters lives were intertwined. Great read.

B004I744AS|5.0|This application captivates me on many levels.  Word of the day is many times fun and interesting.  I have found myself lost in further word searches.  The birthday,  article,  quote, event of the day again keep me captivated to a point of almost being late for work.  Even when you know nothing of an event, a quiche read will find you searching for more.  I was even able ti look up Il man in the search just to see what the dictionary said.  I was surprised and elated to see an entire article filled with so much more than my imagination could hope for.  Strongly recommended for those simple minds that cant navigate computers.  This makes my mornings.  :-)  And still there's the games too.  lol. hangman, word scrabble, and...Well... I get so caught up in the fun of the word of the day and articles I forget the other game.  Hands down this is my favorite app!  :-)  Glad I stumbled across it.

B00728DYRO|5.0|It's not my first time reading this book and surely it won't be the last. I just wish the movies based on these novels could have been done even closer to the books. However, I do have all the 8 movies which I also enjoy now and then. Hopefully J.K. Rowling will soon be putting together a \\"Harry Potter's Series Encyclopedia\\" for even more delight to the readers. I'm looking forward it!
0060763280|5.0|The item was in perfect condition and I gave it a chance on the purchase because I had never heard of the writer..was worth the gamble..Thanks!
0767802470|3.0|One problem with this cut is the second side does not have the options for language, subtitles etc. The second side just begins and there are no options or selections available. It is in German only on side two.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The writing got better. The love story comes together I really liked it. The ending of book left me satisfied wish is a good feeling. A good ending is so important.
B005H29GSI|3.0|I bought the Angry Birds: On Thin Ice game with high hopes. I am a fan of board games and Angry Birds, so I was excited to see the two merge.<br /><br />After we brought it home, we eagerly took it out of the box. The packaging was flimsy at best and is terrible for storage; I would recommend putting the pieces in a separate third-party container.<br /><br />The game mechanics are fairly straightforward and work well. The first problem, though, is in the setup of the \\"castles\\" (the structures that you destroy). The pieces are not built to be constructed as indicated in the cards. (The cards indicate what each castle should look like.) They are half as thick as needed, and are hollow in places which make construction impossible without changing the schematic.<br /><br />The slingshot is great, but it is built in such a way that when using the large red bird, you have to break the rules and have it too close, or have the back hang over the edge of a raised surface so it can be pulled back far enough to launch the bird far enough.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment: The TNT box. It is advertised as actually opening and helping when you hit it. It actually just behaves like any other block. Even when trying to get it to work in controlled conditions, it will only open when pried open.<br /><br />My final impression of the game is that it is a great concept, I but not executed properly. It is great for a children's toy, provided it is not used as intended-- the game instructions just do not work with the components provided. That said, it looks like it would be very fun for some ages, provided it is used out of the context of the game's rules.<br /><br />Get this game if the price goes down below $10, but otherwise it is not worth the inflated price that comes with pre-marketed merchandise. Better to just stick with the app.

B0007QJ1MK|4.0|LULLABIES is another great album from QOTSA....after 3 masterpieces(their debut, RATED R and SONGS FOR THE DEAF), it[s hard to believe, but Joshua Homme and his incredible band done another great collection of heavy songs.....it[s more polished and i may say POPPIER than previous albuns, but still got gens like BURN THE WITCH and LITTLE SISTER!!!!! if you like SONGS FOR THE DEAF you may enjoy these HEAVY lullabies!!!!!

0790729652|2.0|Now Batman was an alright movie, but its definitely over hyped.  The series has gotten more attention now that the Dark Knight series has been in theaters, but its definitely not the same kind of movie.  The quality of the plot line is somewhat lacking, and it often leaves the viewer scratching their head.  In the final fight scene, the movie is so dark you can't really see whats going on, making it very anti-climatic.  I would have been better off not buying and keeping the old childhood memories.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I loved the show dark shadows as a kid and had been re-watching old episodes in anticipation of the movie - what a disappointment!<br /><br />Although I thought all the actors were great the plot was terrible! Way too much screen time was spent on poking fun at the 70's rather than developing good characters and interesting plots.<br /><br />This was such a missed opportunity - how could anyone lack for plot ideas with all the multiple story arcs that went on during the shows time on day time TV - Dan Curtis must be rolling in his grave - with the appropriate music no doubt.
B002ZG983M|3.0|I'm not exactly a guy whose sensitive to violence, but this movie is a bit over the top, and the plot line actually has you disgusted with one of the main protagonists (Nicholas Cage).  Its a mildly entertaining action flick, but has limited replay value.
0061969656|1.0|This is book 6 in the Saxon series and I ordered it not knowing this.

B005LAII08|1.0|Loved the movie and the animation is fantastic - my issues have been with the 3D disc. I have returned and received four replacements all with the same results. I am using this on my internal Lite-On BD Drive with Cyberlink PowerDVD 12 Ultra with latest firmware/software updates and I can play all of my BluRay Movies in 3D with my Asus/NVidia monitor and 3D glasses except this one's 3D disc which in all four attempts I have received from Amazon the 3D disc itself has visible distortion whereas the 2D version in the same packages plays fine and does not have any visible distortion. The 3D discs will all play part way through but will then seize with tearing in the video and will lock up the Cyberlink Software.

0984183523|5.0|Victor Cheng heavily touts his customers' results on his website. After reading this book and using his other material, I can see why.<br /><br />Cheng is a former McKinsey associate who has a deep understanding of the case interview process and exactly what interviewers are looking for. He has broken down the components of the interview process as follows: Quantitative assessments, fundamentals, frameworks, candidate-led cases, variations on the candidate-led case, and getting the offer. Unlike Cosentino's \\"Case in Point,\\" there are only a few frameworks to remember. These frameworks are more flexible than Cosentino's and rely more on the candidate's ability to think and analyze rather than the candidate's ability to memorize a large number of more rigid frameworks.<br /><br />On a personal note, using the tools in this book helped me ace the interview process in a professional field other than consulting. Cheng's suggestion that the candidate practice sharing their thought process in a clear, confident, and concise way is key in demonstrating the candidate's potential value to a firm.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I can't say I have ever bothered to purchase an album by any other previous Idol winner....or contestant for that matter, a song here and there but never the album. I knew before this one was released that this year would be different. Simply put because Phillip Phillips is different than any previous Idol contestant or winner. There are always a lot of great singers on Idol, what sets this young man apart is that he isn't just a singer, he is an artist and it is evident in his music.<br /><br /> Of the fifteen tracks on this album, Phillips wrote or co-wrote ten of them. The result is a unique blend of rock, soul, blues, and folk. Something fresh and new in an industry currently dominated by pop tracks and cookie cutter music. This album has the potential to become one of my favorites.I am pleased with the new trend in music more toward the singer song writer and away from the Minages, Perrys, and Gagas of the industry. It is time for a return to real music, music with a message and purity that is lacking in much of the over-produced music in today's industry.<br /><br />If you like pre-packaged music with a mindless rhythm and no message, this album isn't for you. If you like music that tells a story, moves you, and manages to be unique and still catchy then please, buy this album- it delivers. I am so glad Iovine recognized that America wanted Phillips as he is- Phillip Phillips, gray t-shirts and grey jackets and someone true to his self and his craft. I feared they would try making Phillips the next pop idol for teens- so glad Iovine got the message.
B005S0HNU2|5.0|Merlin Season 4 is a must have for any fan of the Arthurian Legends. Yes it mismatches with aspects of the legend but it does so in a loveable way, paying homage to great friendship of Merlin and Arthur Pendragon, and the politically intriguing dynamics between Arthur, Merlin and Morgana. I enjoyed watching the episodes and seeing how the writers would incorporate the legend into their 21st century teenage/young adult interpretation. Merlin combines drama, angst, action and comedy very well.

B009FZFONO|5.0|What I enjoy most about this series, is how it's not centered around the whole zombie theme. We are half way thru the 3rd season, and we still don't know how this all happened, this is a brilliant idea, because it leaves many options open for later plot twists. It does a great job of developing the show charectors and gets you into caring about this tiny group of survivors. Excellent show, not just horror, but lots of drama and dealing with human nature issues and what man can revert to when they face extinction

B004LWZWGK|4.0|Bruce Wayne: \\"You're afraid that if I go back out there, I'll fail.\\"<br />Alfred Pennyworth: \\"No. I'm afraid that you want to.\\"<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises (2012) was without doubt one of the most realistically spectacular movies around. No mere CGI extravaganza, it presented audiences with a vision of total anarchy and the complete upheaval of society. One could even say that Dark Knight Rises is the logical realization and completion of the nightmare presented in The Dark Knight (2008).<br /><br />What follows is less a 'product review' than a politico-philosophical re-viewing of the movie. From a filmographic perspective, I didn't feel this movie was ALL that much to shout about. A good sound-track, a grand plot and complex characters was, IMO, partially deflated by over-length and insufficient action. Bane and Batman boxing each other towards the end simply didn't \\"fit\\" a grand finale. Nevertheless, I've given the movie 4 stars for the political questions it taunts sensitive viewers with, especially in an era of 'OCCUPY' movement, growing global inequality and so on. A good movie interacts with its socio-political context. If nothing else, Dark Knight Rises does exactly this.<br /><br />a) Gotham, Batman & Unknown Knowns<br /><br />We can begin by contrasting the two villains. Bane is most unlike the Joker. Yet in a powerful way Bane is the fulfillment of the Joker's being and agenda. In the earlier movie, the identity of Batman was one of the central riddles the Joker was trying to resolve i.e. it was a known un-known (something we realise we don't yet know and hence want to find out). In DK-Rises, however, Batman himself was fighting to defeat a trauma (of identity, of purpose, of possibility) he had locked away for eight years i.e. it's a unknown known (something we REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE we know and hence have to undergo some crisis in order to re-know this `thing').<br /><br />For the Joker, Batman was the obstacle to chaos in the city; for Bane, Batmanand the city are synonymous. Bruce Wayne's reclusive behavior mirrored the `eyes wide shut' condition of Gotham which kept on singing the praises of Harvey Dent (an insane murderer), encouraged by of all people its chief of police. Wayne's problem from the start was that, as per Alfred's words, he wanted to fail but didn't know it. Likewise, Gotham, like any modern-day metropolis or Capitalism as a whole, seems all too determined to succeed whilst secretly or unconsciously being hell bent on destroying itself. This is why Bane treated Batman (or Bruce Wayne) in virtually the same way he treated the city: bring him to his knees, let him suffer slowly, with death coming only after a prolonged period. Bane needed Wayne and Gotham to see clearly and without any doubt whatsoever the disavowed rot at the kernel of their being.<br /><br />If there is one thing more frightful than a terrifying truth that has remained concealed from the public, it's the publicly known truth that has remained unspoken. So a big question for societies is: What else do we ALL know full well yet cannot bear to hear repeated out loud?<br /><br />b) The Good, The Bad & The Real<br /><br />Bane, in many senses, was a clear `improvement' over the Joker. The Joker threatened anarchy; Bane delivered it. The Joker tried (and failed) to demonstrate that individuals were at heart completely selfish; Bane successfully revealed that at the heart of society was an impossible trauma (even as he managed to bring Batman to his lowest depths). The Joker sought to show that inside a good man, there is only bad; Bane made it clear that what we understand as Good (e.g. the justice system) is really the Bad (e.g. the unjust political `carving up' of the city) in another form. Thus, DK-Rises shows us what we choose everyday to half-ignore : the hypocrisy of the rule of law in outlawing everything except its own transgressions.<br /><br />The Joker transformed the city's White Knight (i.e. Harvey Dent) into its traitor; Bane showed that the city itself, Gotham, was an intra-social betrayal on a massive scale. The betrayal of the people (in the form of community-wide lies, political corruption and so on), far from being a threat to the city, in fact, constituted it and sustained its being.<br />The Joker manipulated the police; Bane tore up the very idea of the police. The Joker tried to rope in the city's criminals; Bane made it a crime not to be a criminal and thus exposed the biggest crime of all: society itself. The scene in DK-Rises where a psychopathic doctor presides over a kangaroo court and sentences all the former VIPs' and public officials to death (or exile) is striking, for is it not simply the fantasmatic inverse of actual court proceedings? Don't we urgently require a \\"Bane event\\" for the very criminals who at present use the law to justify their crimes?<br /><br />And can't the scene where Bane released all the prisoners, far from suggesting the terror of a society overrun by convicted criminals, hint at redemptive Biblical notions of `setting prisoners free'? Simply imagine the words `GTMO' in the background. To the extent that political change relies on the Law, is it not apparent that no true change can happen without the death and rebirth of the Law itself?<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises hints that true transformation may need more than sincere politicians, better police, more integrated technology, cleaner elections or even a masked vigilante. True change requires a deep glimpse of the destruction that's forthcoming. True change requires a broken body and prolonged suffering in loneliness and hopelessness. True change may even mean that our bridges to the outside world (or practical escape route out of a pit-prison) are destroyed so we're forced to look inwards and face the truth we've chosen to un-know over time. A real rising requires a real death.<br /><br />In short, the movie ultimately provokes us to question what's good, what's bad, what isn't realand what it takes to make all things Real again. Most of all, it reminds us of the consequences of sticking to the status quo. What happens if we persist in lying to ourselves? What's the future like if the truly bad guys are venerated as good and vice-versa? Christopher Nolan's answer seems clear: We either continue living like a prisoner - or we face a nuclear winter.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|An excellent work. I prefer the Stripped style, but I love it. Christina and her ballads are automatic classics. I am waiting an spanish album soon.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|if tu a briny this is the best mop game ever feel free to go to my ponyville my username is Scootaloo500
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game here has made me have countless hours of fun. i have this game for pc and xbox now its on the kindle and it works great and there is absolutly no lag or any problems with the gameplay. the GUI is  better than i thought it would be, and for a portable game without a key board (its primary controller) it works great. I see people  complaining about something not being there. well this game is in ALPHA that means there are many things not going to be there that the PC has. This game is in constant devolpment like on PC and XBOX so ot may take a while for things to be added. I here people complaining about the nether reactors well thats the best they can do because they cant add dimensions on the PE. I will atmit that it is a little costy for the nether reactor ( 4 gold blocks) if you didnt know u  can mine through the obsidian that surrounded the nether core reactor and you can reuse the reacor core as many times as you want. I cant wait what they add next in the future leave your oponion on my review if you would like and i will leave it with you there.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Impacted me in knowing that the most impt thing in life is enjoyment n love.<br />Will notbe easy to verify what she say but I find it believeable. N a lot of what she describe is very close to Buddha scripture
B008JFUUIA|5.0|2 straight hours of laughing!!! Jokes are so funny. I loved that one: John:  \\"Am I right?\\" Gail:  \\"Oh John, you're so right, everything else seems wrong.\\" I can't wait to receive the dvd and watch it all over again!!!! Enjoy!!!
B009JNXK88|5.0|This is a lot of fun and reminds me of Super Meat Boy. Great &quot;old school&quot; graphics and music. Challenging but not impossible, and addictive!
0525953728|5.0|Awesome story. Everything i thought it was hyped up to be. This story is incredible if you are into Military Ops.
1936608618|5.0|Get your self some running, biking and swimming skills so you can go be an efficient beast of an endurance athlete!  The explanations of drills were clear and concise with plenty of pictures adequately demonstrate the movements.  This is a great book with some great views on how to train!
B008NABUU8|2.0|I use this on the kindle fire 1st generation and it is a little glitchy and slow. Otherwise, it's a good, fun, addicting and challenging game. I would recommend this app, but not for the kindle fire first generation.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved loved this book. Intricate and phenomenally written, I couldn't stop reading it. It is a great read of historical fiction.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I have Angry Birds on my phone and now I have it on my Kindle Fire but I have to play all the levels over again. The one thing good I was able to get through levels quickly since this is my second time.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|WORTH THE TIME TO WATCH. INTERESTING SPIN ON HISTORY BUT IT HELPS TO KNOW THE TRUE HISTORY. GO AHEAD AND TRY IT.
B007THA4FI|2.0|i have only read 30% of the book and I don't like it. there a lot of characters and I am having hard time keeping them straight. I am also not crazy about the story. I will keep reading the book because I like to finish books I started. If my opinion changes i will edit my view.
B009VB97EY|4.0|Magic Mike is an okay movie.  I am glad I waited to rent the video to watch it.  The previews are almost as exciting as the entire movie.  I would watch it again as the story line was not bad and the eye candy is nice.  I do believe they could have developed the plot a little more.  All in all a good girls night out movie.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I would advise the reader to read the first book before reading this one.  This was a satisfying continuation for that book, fleshing out the characters found in the first book.  I look forward to reading the third book, Mockingjay.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|Excellent movie with excellent casting. As a teacher, you see a lot of kids that fit this mold. Really makes you stop and think...
B004L0NGEC|4.0|great app. Ive been using this about one year. They have improved the app and it got be really better than before. So far no complaints.
0345803485|1.0|I truly think this may be the worst book I have ever read. It was ridiculous, repetitive, and juvenile. It really was just awful on so many levels.  Do not waste your money and more importantly....do not waste your time!
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|another interesting story line by mitch albom. so far have read all his books, this one makes you think how you use your time
B0086700CM|5.0|sometimes it miht trick you but its better because you know he twists and turns after your mistakes! I love the game and how you dont have to have Internet to play it c: good work
0345803485|3.0|With all of the hype this book has gotten and with an interest in the BDSM world I wanted to know if it was as bad as some claimed, or a good as others claimed. I decided on a paperback so I could resale if I hated it.<br /> So for a start I would say the biggest issue I have has is how the main character was a virgin. No woman, I don't care how talented the man is, will have 5 Orgasms her fist time being sexualy active. She will be spending that time wondering if it was worth it as she could barely walk. Nor is an untried virgin going to jump into a relationship with a man who is a Dominant, allowing him to roughly take her at every turn and spank her then move on to tools like a ridding crop. Any normal human would have run at the beginning.<br /> Second a man who is into that lifestyle, especially as deep as MR. Grey seems to be, is not going to even bother to look outside of that kink community to find a Submissive. He is also NOT going to be ok with a virgin. Mostly this is all completely unbelievable to me.<br /> The good note is, this is fiction! So it really doesn't matter all that much to the overall story. Looking for real life in a fiction book, especially a romance fiction is laughable. The story, beyond its questionable beginnings, is not too bad. In any part of life you will find that the people you know have their issues, baggage and monsters hiding in their minds. Mr. Grey is in no way exempt from this with hints of abuse at a young age and talk of a \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" who introduced him to this life and so I did feel a bit sorry for the man. As a character in this book you can tell that he is trying to win Ana, doing what he can to give her what she needs while still hoping to fulfill his need for kink.<br /> At some moments I despised the man for behaving like a controlling jerk, and at other times touched by his kind thoughts, words and actions. But any woman who has been in a relationship could say the same thing about their man.<br /> As far as a romance novel you will not be disappointed by the many and frequent sexual scenes that come up. I would say that this book, like many others, will have its following of Lovers and its haters too. Like twilight some have swooned and gushed over Edward as being the most amazing man in existence while others only saw a creepy pedophile that sneaks into your room to watch you sleep.<br /> I feel like the author did some research into the BDSM lifestyle but not enough. She touches on some things but completely disregards others. If you read this and decide you want this life, do some research first before you go seeking something that this author fails to really explain.<br /> The end result is I did like it, but not love it, and will be finishing the rest of the books.
B001F12J0C|5.0|What can I say. Anyone familiar with this series knows you can watch it again and again and remain glued to the screen.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Got the kindle version of the book with audio. The book is great! I like how the author tells his stories and lessons he learned from both rich and poor dad in managing money.
0763644765|5.0|My daughter loves this book. the colors grab her attention, the short, simple words/phrases keep her attention and get the point across. She reads it over and over and loves to get to the &#34;hooray!&#34; at the end
B00433TO52|2.0|This ebook formatting of all of Shakespeare's works seemed too good to be true.  And in this case, it is.  The formatting on the plays is not good and makes them practically unreadable.  The character names appear above the lines they speak but there's no differentiation between the character and the lines so it's very confusing.  And unless you're reading with the matching font size the lines end strangely.  Sometimes a cheap Kindle version of a classic is worth weird formatting issues but with Shakespeare it can get confusing.  If only they had perfected the formatting.  I thought having all of Shakespeare's plays, sonnets and poems on my Kindle would be an invaluable way to carry Shakespeare with me everywhere but I'll need to go back to my hard copy versions.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|If you like ridiculous amounts of awesomeness, this is the movie for you! It was funny, action packed, and just all over a great movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this book, the Wool series. It's well written, a professional author at the helm. The book navigates around the doldrums of the self-publishing world, its paper sails set well for strong winds. It's epic, lots to explore in this post-apocalyptic universe. My imagination runs wild here, unbounded. It's human, the pages inhabited with deep characters, some from the down deep. The book reads like a science fiction classic, a real page-turner. It was an immersive reading experience, a joy to read . . .
B0000AC8LR|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. Like the plot of so many movies before,Donnie Darko is about a sensitive young man. Unlike all those movies, this movie is about a sensitive young man who is seeing a giant bunny rabbbit. When i heard about it i totally thought it was a comedy. It's not. It's a riveting physocological thriller (i did use a dictionary), and i can't believe i'd gone all of those years without seeing it. FAN-freaking-TASTIC movie!<br />  A cautionary note to those who also love this move: DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT WATCH S. DARKO!!!! Not becaus it's scary or anything, just because it's terrible (I did not need a dictionary to express my feelings for S. Darko).<br />  Goodday gents and ma'ams.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|why would they put out 4 eps over several years is beyond me but they picked up where they left of minus rex on bass who is missed but down rocks the grooves lke many other wishs they could.heavy,and mood filled riff and emotional filled tunes that you chill with or rage out to.but it it's down as their best.
B001NZEHMS|5.0|Love old school Beastie Boys!  what more can I possibly say than I totally love this album and listen to it all the time
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I watched this movie because I really wanted to see his performance. I think he did a nice job. I did not connect with the perfomances. I thought this was a really awful movie
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love the new addition of Amy and Bernadette!!!  Perfect casting!!!  Finaqlly got to meet Penny's father, so when will we be able to put a face to the voice of Howard's mother?

1582701709|5.0|Can't buy the hype!  If it was this easy, we would ALL have everything we truly wanted.  Because that's all we would think about!
B0000VCZKM|3.0|Our Daughter loves the movie but the aniversary edition on DVD is in fullscreen (pan and scan). when we got the newly released Blue Ray edition it was in original wide screen. My daughter who has watched the movie many times noticed right away. \\"ive never noticed that before!\\", the fact that you can see the person the actors are talking to in the foreground instead of just talking heads, and It really adds to the production value of the dance numbers. make the Bue ray version the one to get. It was never released in wide screen in DVD format. It was only released in wide screen on Laser Disk (If anyone remembers those). Also DO NOT ever buy \\"Annie 2:a royal adventure\\" Worst sequal ever!<br />5 stars for the Movie: good family movie night again and again (for girls)<br />2 stars for the DVD pan and scan format (get the blue ray for the intended wide screen format)
1401937519|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book from Anita, what an incredible journey she experienced and what hope and faith. Took my fears away about life and death.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The format of this game makes the player think and challenge his/her memory and strategy. It probably would be a little bit more helpful if the four dragon styles had some explanation of skill style or level information available.
1611761565|1.0|I downloaded this product and could not even listen to it. The download kept reading from random pages and was completely annoying. I abandoned the download and set my mind on other things. Waste of money.
B003JTHESA|3.0|Since the early 80s I have been an Iron Maiden fan.<br /><br />And of course, I understand bands evolve over time.<br /><br />Over the years, Maiden has had changes in their style, but I still liked them.<br /><br />FINAL FRONTIER is a CD I can't enjoy.<br /><br />Many people have suggested that it takes many listens to absorb and appreciate these songs ---<br /><br />Well, I have tried to listen many times and I can't enjoy it.<br /><br />I am beginning to suspect the PRODUCTION and ENGINEERING may be a problem.<br /><br />This is a difficult CD to listen to.<br /><br />Unlike older Maiden albums that were recorded and engineered by Martin Birch, FINAL FRONTIER is an overly compressed wall of noise.<br /><br />You really can't hear what the instruments are doing.<br />The guitars are fuzzy and buzzy, the drums are distant and boomy, the trademark bass just jumps out at times and they buried Bruce's vocals in the mix at a level that makes the lyrics difficult to hear.<br /><br />Unlike great sounding Maiden albums where you can hear clean separation between all the instruments, this CD almost sounds like a LIVE recording.<br /><br />Looking back at all the Maiden albums as I write this review, I now realize Martin Birch really was the \\"invisible\\" member of Iron Maiden.<br /><br />It is probably no coincidence the classic and fan favorite songs all seem to be on the albums engineered by Martin Birch.<br /><br />MAYBE if this CD's songs had the clarity and clean sound of a POWERSLAVE album, and you could really hear what was going on , it would be easier to appreciate the new style elements in the song's structure.<br /><br />Some CD's sound so good, they just grab your attention.<br /><br />Others like this one, are an effort to listen to and just make it difficult to enjoy.<br /><br />This is probably my least favorite Maiden album that I can think of at this time.
B007X3DQGM|2.0|I purchased the kindle edition and at first it was fantastic. I could make the text and the photographs of the crochet squares, the page bigger. But then when I began crocheting a square I noticed that the beautiful diagrams next to the crochet square, would not enlarge. That was really disappointing. I have to figure out how to apply a large magnifying glass so I can read it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007X3DQGM Beyond the Square Crochet Motifs: 144 circles, hexagons, triangles, squares, and other unexpected shapes]]
B008PNBU30|4.0|3DG is one of the young bands together with Breaking Benjamin that I really like in an ocean of mediocrity. I am pleased that they are doing well and wish them the best. I like the albumand you probably will too, and I recommend it but its not their best effort.
B008JH5HCW|3.0|I expected an interesting Scifi movie, and got an action packed and funny B Movie.  Entertaining.  Suspend your disbelief, sit back, enjoy.
0425263916|4.0|What an emotional ride, seriously! I started this book a mixture of frustrated and angry. I was seriously wondering if I would be able to get through the book. It often felt like their relationship was taking one step forward, have sex, take two steps back then have sex - rinse, repeat... I stuck with it and I was so glad I did because that ending was spectacular! I am waiting (im)patiently for the end cause I need to know what the outcome is going to be. I really don't know how they are going to solve everything in the final book because overall there was little progress in their issues, right now I'm just hoping their relationship makes it.<br /><br />Sylvia really outdid herself with this one. I haven't picked up another book since, and it's been days. Still waiting on the tension leaving my body!<br /><br />Thanks to Netgalley for the ARC.
0446580848|1.0|This is a book that starts out uninteresting and get annoying boring and childish from there.  John Corey is an aging former NYPD homicide detective who has a 100% disability pension and who is on contract to an FBI anti-terror group. He second wife is an FBI agent 14 years younger than him and they work together on fighting terror.<br /><br />They are offered an extremely dangerous and trying assignment to track down (and probably assassinate) a very dangerous terrorist in Yemen, so that while Corey is 100% disabled, he's not too disabled. That's an accurate description of how NYC employee benefits work.<br /><br />Corey know that assignment will be extremely dangerous and doesn't want to take it, but \\"wifey\\" (the 14 year younger one) sees it as a great career move and effectively requires that they accept. Since she is the \\"dominant\\" personality in the marriage, Corey agrees.<br /><br />By this time I am about sixty pages into the book and about fifty of those pages are smart-ass comments by Corey to every statement made to him, heard by him or thought by him. The other ten pages were devoted to plot development.  At page sixty-one I quit the book.<br /><br />You can save yourself some time and just skip this book entirely.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Great movie. Way bettet then part one. And im soooo HAPPY to see van (the greatist action star of all time) damme back on the big screen for the first time in 13 years! And he makes a amazing bad guy( he rarely plays a bad guy). Part 3 is being made and has van damme as head bad guy in that one too!!!! So overall great movie. Great stars. Great action. Great fights. Scott adkins is great as well!! Awsome fights at the end of the movie with him and statham.
B002CGSYNU|5.0|Looks a lot like the original I received with the camera.<br /><br />Do not buy if for the newer 14-42mm lens (the one being sold with EPL-2), since it would be too big for it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyable. The plot has a surprise that I didn't figure out for sure til near the end of the book. Page turner
B008XG1X18|5.0|love the site, love that I can pin to the correct board vs. not being able to without it. yay
B003EY7IRC|5.0|It feels like I was holding a breath for five days, since I started the series.<br /><br />What a roller coaster. So many twists and turns. Even though this book was a bit of a brick to read, it didn't feel like it.<br /><br />What I liked the most, about Moning's books, is that there is no way you can predict what is going to happen. You think you know, but actually, you have no freaking idea. Which is hard to do.<br /><br />It amazed me that for the first time I didn't need to have all the answers. If it was written by any other author, it would have left me confused and irritated. In this case, I kind of was on the same page with Barrons: &#34;Judge me not by the words I say, but my my actions.&#34;. And Mac: &#34; What ever happened, happened, he is here and I know he will always be here.&#34;. And that's all that matters.<br /><br />There is still a lot of questions hanging in the air, but most important ones got answered. Moning rarely gave a direct answer. What she did was gave us readers enough information, that you yourself could put 2 and 2 together and figure things out, if you really paid attention. Strangely, I don't want to know everything. Also because there was that little threat &#34;if I tell you, I have to kill you.&#34; So I don't want to know. I'm pretty content with living my ignorant life, reading my books and not knowing everything :-D.<br />- - -<br />&#34;Who are you?&#34; He kicks off his boots, steps out of his pants. He's commando tonight.<br />My breath whooshes out of me in a run-on word:&#34;Whogivesaf***?&#34;<br />&#34;Finally.&#34; The word is soft. The man is not...<br />(Which I understood as &#34;There is only you and me, here and now, and that's all that matters.&#34;)<br />- - -<br />Ain't that just the hottest thing you have ever heard :)<br /><br />Amazing, can't wait for the next book.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|It was a relaxing adventure that had some good tricks. The stoner graphics were enhanced by the light toe tapping music.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Instead of timing u should just restrict certain game modes. Then this would be a 5 star game not a 2 star game.
B00136JQMI|5.0|Still tasty after all these years.<br /><br />Since I don't have the old vinyl, I can't speak to differences in reproduction quality, but the MP3 is excellent for casual listening or for running in background.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app runs seemlessly on kindle fire and allows users to monitor battery life with minimal effort; I definitely recommend dowloading.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|I read about half of the book and stopped. It was so different than Enders game so I am not sure why it is part of the series.  Anyway, the reason I stopped reading is because I didn't care for most of the characters.  I lost interest in Ender as well.  A young Ender is a lot more interesting than an older Ender.
B008HK3S04|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for. Just wanted something for keeping my kindle fire HD protected and this works extremely well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Some people say that this is nothing compared to this but, its not like you can take your computer n the car with you.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am half way through and I hope it picks up for a faster read. I will let you know later.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|hi I'm Julia I'm 14 years old and one thing I am so so so so so awesome so so cool.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I usually love Grisham books but this was not up to his usual. I could have spent my time better with something else this time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book has action, romance and is also sad. Great Book for teens & adult. Getting ready to read part two.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|I read it in a few days time and it was ok. I am not sure if I will reread it but it passed time for me.
B003O86FMW|4.0|So I don't think that this one is better than the first one, but it is still really good. There is a really big twist that you will fin out about in the middle of the book.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is my all time favorite action movie and I just had to have the 2000 special edition, it was well worth it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So I already read these books before I got my kindle but I love it so much I bought it on my kindle and read it in two days. You must read this! Always remember to be team Gale!!!!!!
B005F6NA5G|5.0|Have played this through several times and am enjoying it more each time!  I have other CD's by George Benson and was happy to get this one.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I loved it, loved it, loved it and I so cant wait for the third one to come out May it too far away................
B00913DPW2|1.0|This game sucks! If I could give it less than one star, I would.  Don't  waste your money! There's seems to be no clear plan as to what happens when.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|love the app but once I got to level 24 game keeps crashing or timing out making playing very difficult and frustrating. Really needs to be updated otherwise LOVE this game very addictive!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is the best. I am a big fan of his. Always happy with his books. The Racketeer was one of his best.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|There is no way I can accurately describe the brilliance of this show.  It's just that awesome. They surprise me every week and the laughs are priceless.
B000A2IPPK|5.0|Good for kids of all ages.  I was glad to have a chance to add it to the DVD collection at home.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My favorite game by far!  I have it on my iPhone and Kindle Fire. I spend way too much time playing it.
6305428042|5.0|and us oldsters. lol  Another favorite that will probably be around every year as a classic.  We like to watch it often.
B004SKJTY6|4.0|This was a fair movie. I liked it okay, although it draged a bit and could be on the boring side.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|i bought both free and paid neither let me play my music at first yeah music allday now none it blows
B007N8RULO|5.0|Fun game while the ads are an annoyance but what can you expect for free? Great graphics & sound affects.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Easy read, easy to follow. Probably not for kids or pre-teen because there is a lot of reference to drugs and sexuality.
B0090EHVMC|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie because I love the story, but this incarnation provided nothing but disappointment. The story was poorly written and badly told and the only reason the main character wanted to get trees back into the world was so he could score with the good looking girl that did actually have a moral center. The villain  of the story was really the only interesting character the movie had and realistically the writers should have had mercy on us and let this remain a half hour television show.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I always enjoy Lee Child's stories. This one lived up to his other Jack Reacher adventures in crime which of course he comes in tops
B009HV2JT8|1.0|It was a little interesting to see history woven into a Vampire movie premise, but I would have like a lot more history, a lot more plot.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This album is simply the best one yet, her voice is so crystal clear & soft! Her voice takes you into a different world when you listen to this album, My personal favorite is \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" & \\"The Winner Takes It All\\". Best album of the year! But it, you wont regret it!
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver does an excellent job of explaining statistics in a way that's intelligible even to the less math-inclined. I spent the better part of an afternoon calculating the Bayesian odds of various things happening. Good times.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm always on this app in my free time! Great for hair and fashion ideas! or if your just bored to look at things.. I highly recommend!! Love it!!
B000NY12LO|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME. WONDERFULLY WRITTEN. I LOVE HOW JODI PICOULT WROTE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ALL OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS--THAT MADE THE BOOK EVEN MORE INTRIGUING. I CAN'T WAIT FOR OUR BOOK CLUB MEETING NEXT WEEK SO THAT WE CAN DISCUSS IT. THE BOOK EVEN HAS INTERESTING QUESTIONS ALREADY DRAFTED FOR BOOK CLUB DISCUSSIONS! I EVEN LOVED THE CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR AT THE END. IN ONE WORD I WOULD DESCRIBE THIS BOOK AS--AWESOME.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|I have seen Coldplay twice, although I was unable to make the recent Mylo Xyloto tour. I am a huge fan but also a fan of live DVDs from many artists from U2 to Seal, Keane, Airborne Toxic Event, etc. If you are looking for a straightup concert DVD featuring one location, no frills live dvd, you may end up complaining like a few reviews about how the incorporation of the effects, movements, various tour locations were put in place. Personally I loved it. I enjoyed watching the DVD from the perspective of being on stage, following the band as they move around, and as a fan on the floor. Have listened to it multiple times since receiving it and I  am enjoying it more and more. I honestly didn't like the Mylo Xyloto album as much as I expected - when it came out frankly I thought it was just OK - but due to watching the live DVD I now love this album.<br /><br />I loved seeing Rhianna come on stage and perform with Chris Martin to sing 'Princess of China' and the opener 'hurts like heaven' is simply wonderful. Kudos for Coldplay to incorporate the audience in the dvd and for once again providing each fan something for attending (this time the wristbands which really amplified the view on stage).<br /><br />Pretty much all songs showed strength in how powerful it is to watch Coldplay Live. It was nice to get a glimpse of the band member's thoughts along the way of the dvd. I would highly recommend getthig this dvd/cd combo. I bought the non Blu-Ray version.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My initial assement of this ap is that it is easy to use.  I especially like the ability to select reading plans.  I also think the concept of awarding badges is interesting.  There our many versions to choose from many of which do not require Internet access.
B005LAII0I|5.0|This movie was, in my mind, a melodrama.  Acting and costumes were over-the-top, very cliche and meant to be.  (It reminded me of Princess Bride.)  Just a few innuendos (that a child would not catch) and the rest fine for an 8 year old.  These kind of movies, that young and adult can watch and enjoy, are hard to find.  No the plot did not follow Disney's animated classic, but who would want it to?  Just as the fairy tales themselves, there are dozens of re-tellings and each one has a different take on a story.  I was surprised to see how many \\"pans\\" this movie received.  We found it wholesomely delightful.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought this book was very good. I enjoyed it, can't wait for the third one.<br />2013 seams to far away.
B004SKLD9A|2.0|do not buy this version i agree with the review above. i have it and it is 2 channel only
B007HACDLK|4.0|As always this was fast moving with lots of intrigue twists and turns.  I have enjoyed all of Vince Flynn's books and this one didn't disappoint.
B007N31YZ2|5.0|I ORDERED THIS ITEM PREVIOUSLY VIEWED FROM ONE OF THE SELLERS. IT ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. ALL THREE DISCS WAS IN IT'S CASE, AND IT'S DIGITAL COPY CODE WAS IN IT ALSO. IT CAME GOOD AS NEW, JUST AS IF I BOUGHT IT IN AN ELECTRONICS STORE. BUT, A LOT CHEAPER BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT USED. WHAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND WHEN BUYING USED DVD AND BLU-RAY MOVIES, IS TO LOOK AT THE CONDITION EACH SELLER HAS IT IN AND THEIR COMMENTS TO MAKE SURE THE PRODUCT IS TO YOUR LIKING. I WOULD AIM FOR IT'S CONDITION TO BE GOOD, VERY GOOD, OR LIKE NEW. FOR THE COMMENTS, I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT HAS IT'S CASE AND ARTWORK, AND EVEN IT'S DIGITAL CONTENT, SO IT WOULD ARRIVE JUST LIKE I GOT IN THE STORE. I WOULD AVOID PRODUCTS THAT'S IN ACCEPTABLE CONDITION. UNLESS I DIDN'T MIND IT NOT COMING WITH ITS CASE AND ARTWORK, AND ITS DIGITAL COPY AND CODE. BUT, IN THE OTHER CONDITIONS SPECIFIED, IT SHOULD ARRIVE GOOD AS NEW.  I HAD GREAT SATISFACTION WITH THIS ITEM, DUE TO MY EXPERIENCE WITH PURCHASING USED DVD AND BLU-RAY MOVIES. YOU CAN TOO! HAVE A GOOD DAY, AND A HAPPY THANKSGIVING.
B009X00E18|1.0|This does not meet the standards or quality I expected from Marware.  The cover for my Fire was of much better quality and construction.  Whatever you do don't drop it, it affords little protection.
1619691809|4.0|When you find yourself laughing out loud while listening to a suspense thriller set in one of the most treacherous countries in the world, you know author Nelson DeMille has returned protagonist John Corey to the limelight.<br /><br />Anti-Terrorist Task Force agent John Corey has followed his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, to Yemen. There they joined a small team of specialists assigned to tracking down the mastermind behind the USS Cole bombing. Their job is to apprehend a high-ranking Al Qaeda operative known as The Panther. Their orders are specific in his apprehension as The Panther is an American citizen.<br /><br />As more is learned about this particular assignment, John begins to see more at work than they are being told. Turns out he and Kate are the bait to lure The Panther out into the open. John is on a hit list for killing Asad Khalil, a Libyan terrorist known as The Lion. Kate is in the crosshairs for killing a tainted CIA agent, even though the shooting was in self-defense.<br /><br />The couple soon learn they can't trust everyone who is supposedly on their side. And it also appears the allies shouldn't be as trusting either.<br /><br />Narrator Scott Brick does an excellent job bringing the various characters to life. He brings the emotions to the surface drawing listeners in as the tension builds. His interruption of John Corey and his dry wit will have you smiling and laughing despite the seriousness of the plot.<br /><br />THE PANTHER is not a story that can be breezed through. At just over 21 hours of listening time, the story goes into great details about the country of Yemen and the lifestyles of its people. DeMille's eye for details in describing the land, its people, and their customs causes the story to more slow for the first part. However, this background information and set up is necessary for the dramatic conclusion. The intense look at Yemen and the situation there helps place the listeners (and readers) in the midst of the action.<br /><br />DeMille's characters are well-developed with strengths and flaws. He writes John as a bit of a smart ass, but as you come to understand him you realize there's more to him. His wise cracks are a way of coping with tense situations.<br /><br />When the pace of the story picks up, it's a roller coaster ride till the finish. There are twists and turns that will blow you away. The suspense will keep you wondering who is really good and how just how far will be bad guys go.<br /><br />FTC Full Disclosure - This audio book was sent to me by the publisher in hopes I would review it. However, receiving the complimentary copy did not influence my review./><br />DeMille's characters are well-developed with strengths and flaws.

0525952926|5.0|The sequel to Fall of Giants, this volume seems a bit easier to follow and a bit quicker read.  One of those rare books where I was disappointed it was over. Can't wait for Book 3.
B004RE29PO|5.0|I loved this movie.  It had some elements of the thriller, like the original, but with an action/adventure angle to it.  The director's cut is wonderful.  It's just a few extra minutes of footage, but it really adds a lot of depth to the story.  Great picture, great sound.  Very highly recommended by me!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Aside from the risque parts of the storyline, really well written! I couldn't put it down and read the trilogy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The books in this series were very interesting and while at first I didn't think I could get into them, I did.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book replaced the void left after completing the Harry Potter series. Great story; really transports you into Katniss's world.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Same as the previouse book in this series, very interesting books.  I liked them more than I thought I would.

B00A31UXLW|5.0|Harry is still working on closed cases and he decides to re-open the \\"Snow White\\" case. When he was an officer during the 1992 LA riots he came upon a murdered Danish reporter Anneke Jespersen, who was found dead by a National Guardsman. Harry was never able to solve that mystery and it basically went dormant for 20 years. The fact that he never found Jesperson's killer had always gnawed at him and the 20th anniversary sets him to dive back into it.<br /><br />In the meantime he has annoyed his new group leader (O'Toole) and pretty soon the PSB (formally Internal Affairs) is investigating Harry for improprieties when he visited his girlfriend\\"s (Hannah) son in prison. Harry is no longer a regular detective as he is in his four year DROP period and he could be let go for the merest infraction.<br /><br />As Harry starts to investigate the Jesperson case, he gets more blowback from O'Toole making him think that those that sit on the 10th floor are against him and are behind the PSB investigation. This makes Harry more determined to work on the case. Harry learns that a call was made to the police from Modesto, CA on the 10th anniversary of the murder and when Harry looks into that call, it is the clue he needs to really start the case going. His partner Chu had told Harry that every case has a \\"Black Box\\" which is the one clue that can break the case wide open.<br /><br />Harry has to work the case solo and let Chu work in the background because he is afraid that O'Toole will come after Chu too. Harry is relentless at persuing all clues in his usuall direct manner. The story gets hot and heavy as Harry must quickly solve the case before he is ousted from his job and must go after the bad guys without a partner for backup.<br /><br />This book held me from start to finish and Connelly's writing is crisp. The only things that were negative about the book is he does go overboard talking about jazz songs as I am not a jazz aficianado. Also, his daughter Maddy is virtuallya non-entity and after his last book, I thought she would have a hand in helping him solve the case. None of these issues prevent me from giving the book a full five stars!
B004SIIBGU|2.0|The amazon &quot;official&quot; ebay app does not allow calculated shipping when selling. But, the google play ebay app allows calculated shipping which is needed for selling on ebay. The amazon and google play ebay apps need to be synced to be the same official app. The google play ebay app was updated in early Nov. but the amazon ebay app has not been updated.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game works well.  Acts like aphysical game not just a Sim.  Realistic play through out. I recommend for any one who likes spider. good good good.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wonderful book and not scary like you sometimes expect with Stephen King.  Once again, history with a great love story, and great examples of friendship and loyalty.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I am a big fan of the Jack Reacher series.  I like the books because they are hard to put down.  This particular novel was lacking for me though.  It didn't have the romantic part in it.  It did have good relationships though.  While I enjoyed it I would say this is my least favorite Jack Reacher novel.  Still fun but could have been better.<br /><br />I really hope that Lee Childs, the author, can inject some new life into the series.  I would rate the other Reacher novels at 5 stars versus this 4 star.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a fun, challenging little game to wade time on. no problems yet, but I have only been playing for a week
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Kept my attention and I couldn't stop reading.  I can't wait to read the next 2 in the series.  Action, suspense, and love story all in one book!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this game. the time trials are really fun and the puzzels are really fun the only downside is you only get 3 hints and once there gone you have no more unless you buy more. but its no big deal the puzzels you'll eventually figure out. plus you don't have to wait to finish one to go on.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|It really is a good movie, the technical section is very good, graphics, and sound effects are flawless, the plot is entertaining at certain points but lacks coherence because we do not know whether it is reality or fantasy, but all the answers have you, only you know how to interpret
B0019N95IK|5.0|despite it being viewed as a failure by cridics, This series whas better than DS9 and Voyager combined.The connection to the original series that it often had was the icing on the cake for me
141659521X|4.0|I knew I'd feel like this after I finished Vince Flynn's latest release The Last Man. I tried to take my time with it, but you just can't do that with a Mitch Rapp novel. Huh-uh. Just. Can't. Now I have to wait for the next one, and it's a long wait of course.<br /><br />The Last Man picks up where Pursuit of Honor left off and follows Vince's two prequels to the Mitch Rapp Series, American Assassin and Kill Shot.<br /><br />CIA Director Irene Kennedy has dispensed Mitch Rapp and Scott Coleman to Afghanistan after learning that her operative Joe Rickman is missing. Rickman is no basic operative. With his outrageous IQ and his years of experience and accumulated intel, it's imperative that he be found before the enemy extracts the secrets from him which will collapse the CIA for years to come. When Rapp and Coleman examine the scene at Rickman's residence, too many intangibles don't add up. With their former FBI tech pointing out certain characteristics regarding the safe where significant funds and critical intel should be, the four bodyguards sporting professional singular 9 mil gunshot wounds lined up on the floor with one man blasted with a 45, everything just seems \\"off\\".<br /><br />By the time Kennedy arrives, Rapp has already managed to threaten and alienate officials who think they have more power than they actually do. He suspects something he can't quite articulate. A petulant FBI Special Agent fueled by a corrupt senator has sneaked into the picture with a team to expose what he's convinced will put Rapp and Rickman away for hiding millions of dollars in a particular Swiss bank.<br /><br />Rapp's old arch-nemesis shows up unexpectedly and joins in a firefight which leaves one of Rapp's and Coleman's men dead, one injured and Rapp seriously incapacitated. Irene's got more puzzles to piece together than is humanly possible, must get rid of the FBI pest, learns the Pakistanis are split in their willingness to admit a hand in the problems Rapp faced or support her efforts to find Rickman. As if that's not enough, Mike Nash, who used to be an operative with Rapp, seems squeamish about certain orders she's issued to the point where she's going to reassess his usefulness when all of this chaos is under control.<br /><br />The intricacies of the different forces working against the CIA Clandestine Services eventually come up against the potency and reach of what Director Irene Kennedy, her mentor Thomas Stansfield, and Mitch Rapp have established over the last several years. The Last Man is a clever title that says it all about Mitch Rapp. This novel delivers a complex multi-level plot that reveals the leverage and power of political rogues, the CIA, and the corruption of some members of foreign governments.<br /><br />There are deeper issues lying just under the surface and sometimes exposed as the possibilities of life and death for operatives are examined. Justice plays its bold role as always, but there are moments when we wonder how these circumstances can possibly be rectified. With a stunning ending and a few new faces, The Last Man is a terrific adventure via various locations before all is said and done. It will be interesting to see how Vince uses the new faces and if he disposes of some of the old ones in future stories.<br /><br />I don't know why Vince's novels seem to end up with several typos, but they do. No matter. The story always makes up for them. For those who like to be warned about bad language, there is a fair share of it in The Last Man. Highly recommended for Vince Flynn fans. For those who've yet to read one of his novels, go to the beginning and read through them all for real and full appreciation. I love these books.her efforts to find Rickman.

B002ZG9846|3.0|I love this movie and have been wanting to purchase since after I discovered it on Netflix/Prime a short while ago. I see Amazon has a great deal and I act quickly. This is where it gets a bit rocky. First off, it was on back order, not that big of a deal as it showed up a week later then normal. Then I go to load the digital copy to put it on my tablet, no can do, offer expired by Lions Gate. I know this isn't Amazon's fault, but why offer/advertise the product and then only have 2 of the 3 advertised versions available. I emailed Lions Gate and they basically said \\"sorry, it is no longer available\\". Needless to say, I'm disappointed at Lions Gate more then Amazon, but because I bought it through Amazon, this is where my rating will have to show.
B001EC0OMW|4.0|If you're a fan of the genre, you already know this is a classic, well made and well acted. Chillingly simple.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I heard people complain that this movie was not the prequel they were expecting, but my question is what did you expect? I thought the writing and the directing were perfect and the visuals were stunning. The 3D effects were breathtaking and enhanced the experience. The ending left us wanting more and in a way that goes into a completely new direction. Riddly Scott created another masterpiece that will live on forever. If you were expecting aliens then you won't get your fill here, what you do get is a full story with fresh possibilities and answers.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|another great book by John his work always flows together and makes you want to finish it as soon as possible.  I try to read a serious book then a fun book and this is FUN
B000EHSVSC|5.0|I was 6 years old in '41, when I heard the announcement over the radio that Pearl Harbor had been attacked, & Pres. FDR's subsequent declaration of war before Congress. As a kid, I was able to understand we were fighting against terrible tyrrany. Now, 70 years later, the US is suffring from a self-inflicted wound that appears mortal.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So  realistic how he goes thriugh the chllsnv<br />es of middle school with a deformity. love this book. The author describes experiences and feelings so well this book made me cry.i love this book. s must read
0811869261|5.0|I have just started reading this to my 18-month old daughter.  It's a lot of fun.  There is so much going on.  I know it's the kind of book I would have adored as a child.  I loved to examine every little detail.  My daughter is still a little young to really appreciate it, but I hope she grows to love it too.  I am waiting until she is older for the stickers also.  She hasn't noticed them and I haven't brought them to her attention.  The pages are a great durable plastic which is great for the re-usable stickers and to protect from accidental oops'es.  It can be a little confusing to look at but that kind of makes it like a puzzle too (Where's Waldo or similar).
B005NFJAXU|1.0|Paying too much money for this... you can buy the SEVEN seasons (US versions) individually on BluRay for cheaper than this set. Not to mention, these are the UK versions...  If you go to the UK version of Amazon, you can buy this exact set for the equivalent of 90 US dollars. No free shipping because it's international... but I know it's not gonna add up to 50 dollars to ship that internationally.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|This version of Uno is good, but only if you are willing and have the time to play an entire game in one sitting.  I haven't yet found a \\"save\\" feature, so you can quit and come back to your game another time (like with the iTunes version.)
B005FUTBV4|3.0|I did not know whether to laugh out loud or fall asleep... I ended up doing both.<br /><br />The actors did their best in a very surreal script and like a Zombie flick, being realistic need not apply. It is a campy movie of characters whose sole purpose appeared to be outdoing each other to win the mythical \\"Best Outrageous Moron\\" Oscar. In this category they all deserved an award.<br /><br />Horror flicks I often find laughable, but this one actually tries to make a point in the validity (or mockery) of a conspiracy theorist dream film.<br /><br />There is substance, but mostly thought provoking stereotyping.<br /><br />My best advice is that if you like having a comedian who insults your intelligence with the understanding that it is all in good fun (if your smart enough to recognize this), then you may like this movie.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Season 2 was never my favorite, but it was necessary and good over all.  Gilmore Girls hijinks are always the best.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|The only thing that would make it better is a back camera instead of facing camera. I enjoy using it and will use it more in the near future.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|It's perfect. A great first season. I couldn't ask for a more witty family drama. Having already seen all the seasons, It's nice to go back and rewatch it all.
0446580848|1.0|I've read everyone of DeMille's books after falling in love with \\"The Gold Coast\\".  This one, I can't believe.  John Corey's constant sarcastic comments completely destroys any continuity of the plot (what plot?).  The characters are transparent and unbelievable.  The only action takes place in the last sixty pages after a travelogue on Yemen.  Sorry that the Panther didn't succeed in removing the character that DeMille has fallen in love with.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This is perfect. I grew up with Beauty and the Beast. This is the perfect edition. The movie is even more entertaining as an adult, now I understand all the darker undertones.
1451620829|5.0|This book is one of the best autobiographies of a rock star I have ever read.<br />Along side of No Regrets by bandmate Ace Frehley this book by Peter Criss exposes the real KISStory of the man, the makeup, the band and the hype.<br />Peter is a no bones about it kind of guy and this book proves it.<br /><br />If you are a KISS fan, if you are a rock and roll fan you need to read this book.
B00846REIS|3.0|The story line was so similair to &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; that I could almost predict what was going to happen.  I enjoyed the quick, fun read with little emotion on my part.  It was explicit and erotic.  I would definetly recommend it to anyone who like &#34;Fifty Shades&#34;.
B009329ZF2|1.0|If you like action with no story to worry about this is your movie.  I personally like some story with my movies
B006LSZECO|1.0|The first half of the book I couldn't wait for it to end.  It was disturbing and disconcerting.  The second half got a little better but the whole idea of such maniacal calculating evil had me wishing I never picked up the book.  In truth I wish I hadn't read it.
0385474547|5.0|I read the book in high school and the book helped me to understand the freedom of choice of individuals and the culturally dilemma of a complex society.

B0081KTI0E|5.0|The lighting was beautiful, the story was simple yet intriging, the wardrobe was amazing, the location was outstanding, the acting was stellar.

0761169431|5.0|Very entertaining. Good difficulty level for my 10 year old boy. It even has a few printed origami pages from which you can make very real figures (ie some of the spaceships). A great gift for star wars fans.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game has captured my full attention. there are plenty of different challenges to keep your interest.  I would highly recommend.
B0085RQLXK|1.0|Right out of frame from their \\"Pump\\" album cover photo is a downhill slope leading to a cliff. This band piled in those trucks and drove right off it. Speaking of album covers...who exactly are they marketing this thing to? As bad as the cover is, the music is even worse. I couldn't stomach more than 4 previews. I'm going to listen to Pandora's Box immediately to get this garbage out of my head.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|To what extent are the actions of an adult influenced by the events of their childhood?  When an entire country goes bad, who is really to blame?  Is it the evil does themselves, or does it go back further?  Do you enjoy a movie that keeps you thinking long after leaving the theatre?  If the answer to that last question is yes, then put The White Ribbon  by director Michael Haneke on your Must watch list!<br /> Our story takes place as an admittedly unreliable flashback; our narrator states that he pieced together the story through rumor and assumptions.  A small village in Germany in the early 1900's is the setting.  Right away we are witness to a horrible riding accident: the village doctor is tripped up on his horse by a wire strung between two trees on his usual riding route.  Several other violent incidents follow including the beating of a young boy, but there are no suspects for these brutal crimes.  Even worse, the villagers don't seem terribly motivated to find the culprits.  We then are introduced, on more intimate level, to the villagers themselves and then the horrible really starts to flow!  The town Steward beats his son while in the grips of an explosive rage.  The Preacher beats his children in the name of piousness.  Don't get me started on the Doctor!  The only island of human goodness in the film is in the form of the schoolteacher and his sweet courtship of the Baron's nanny.  But the teacher is our narrator, so maybe he's just whitewashing his own role in this scenario.  Darn unreliable narrators!  On the upside, the movie is absolutely beautiful to look at, even when you can't quite look.  The black and white cinematography not only fixes our story firmly in the past but also makes some of the horrors we witness a little easier to look at.  The director does not rely on crazy camera angles or tricks to tell the story; Realism is the word of the day here.  The scenes usually play out in only one or two different shots depending on the number ofcharacters in the scene.  There is no traditional background music; all sounds and music that we hear feel natural.  The actors in the film look like \\"real people\\", they speak like \\"real people\\", they move like \\"real people\\"; amazing acting throughout this film.  These elements come together to form a truly believable feeling when viewing, you lose yourself in the unfolding of events.<br />  The characterizations, especially of the leading citizens of the village were very interesting.  The men in positions of power were never referred to by name, only by title; bestowing on them the mantle of archetype which allows them to be completely awful within the scope of their role.  That being said, there are not many \\"bad guys\\" or \\"good guys\\" in this story.  Most of our characters feel very human: conflicted, unsure, imperfect.  Which brings me to the children: there is a great cinematic tradition of mobs of evil children in films.  Don't think for a second that our director will make it that easy for you!<br />  It is interesting to ponder the narrator's assertion at the start of the film that the events of the film may \\"clarify things that happened in our country\\".  One thinks of the rise of National Socialism in the form of Nazis, the wholesale slaughter of millions of innocent people, etc...  I have watched this film several times and I think I come away with a different take on it every time; I will leave it up to you, prospective viewer, to come to your own conclusion.  I know that there are many people who do not like movies with open- ended conclusions, and to them I say: This is NOT the film for you!  This movie seems to raise many more questions than it answers but, if you don't mind some mental heavy lifting, the rewards are great.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|The usual high standard from John Grisham - thoroughly enjoyed the twists and turns and recommend this for all Grisham fans.
1451620829|5.0|Easily a 5 star read. The most honest of all the KISS books . Doesn't leave out any details of the Women, Drugs, Money ect. Most Bio's leave stuff out because they don't want their current wife and kids to know about their debauchery and that just isn't right. No reason to go into every detail about this book. If your a lifelong KISS fan You'll want to read this book to fill in the many gaps left by Gene and Ace. Your turn Paul!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|If you get Tina Fey, you just might pee a little too. When I try to type the word \\"pee\\" into my review, my Kindle tells me that \\"pee\\" is not a word. It is...I looked it up.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I NEVER thought I'd say this, but this album is even better than their first, \\"Up All Night\\"!  I love every single song and have been listening to it non-stop since I got it over a week ago.  I'm actually listening to it at this very moment! :) My favorite song probably is \\"Heart Attack\\" just because they decided to make it humorous by adding some sound affects in there. :) This CD is different than the first, having more variety of genres.  There are cute feel-good slow songs, upbeat make-me-wanna-dance songs, etc!  I love love love this.  It's genus!  I'm not at all surprised they are getting all these excellent reviews and are up at the top of the charts.  I recommend this album for anyone who loves music.  There is something in it for everyone (or, if you're like me, you'll like it all).  It's even better that it's a yearbook.  There are cute little notes in it from the band, pictures of their tour, fans, and their life since being put together as band.  Every penny spent on this was worth it.  Loooove it!
B00884GR0W|5.0|very fun so far and I know I have barely scratched the surface. fun times for both of you. happy thanksgiving

B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is one of the best chess apps I have ever used. The player is allowed to select different levels of difficulty, depending on what his level of mastery may be. This makes the app easily adaptable to both the novice and the master of this great game.I recommend this app especially for those who want to improve their game.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is great it's addictive and fun if you don't have this app yet GET IT!!!!!!<br /><br />I play it like every 5 minutes!!! :-)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is my favorite app right now. so much fun and it is ever-evolving. I would suggest it to everyone.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i can't believe you can download a book to your device and boom! there it is... amazing! just pick out a title, download, and read, simple as that.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is awesome. I enjoy it all the time. Especially when I'm trying to kill time. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.
B009H442DG|4.0|I'm a big Grease fan so I was looking forward to this album.  I was actually surprised Travolta has a decent voice. I knew Newton-John had a great voice.<br /><br />All the songs are pretty delightful and they seem to pair off each other pretty well.  Probably why the Grease was such a great chemistry.<br /><br />Note also I don't own any other Christmas songs from either of them.<br /><br />All in all a nice Christmas album.  Merry Christmas!
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|Really? Review Lady and the Tramp? Come on - it's a classic. Great movie, great story, happy ending - what's not to like?
0465011047|5.0|Be thankful you live where ever you live, and not in North Korea. This book must be read by human rights advocates everywhere. The atrocities In North Korea that go unnoticed by most of the world must be put to light. Imagine growing up in a place where your teachers beat you and are armed with pistols. Imagine being forced to work while having almost nothing to eat. The conditions at North Korean concentration camps are just as bad as Nazi concentration camps, if not worse. Many are killed for little or no reason, such as sexual relations or eating rats or insects to survive. A gut-wrenching look inside the world's last remaining Stalinist society, this book will make you feel 10 times happier about the country you live in.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|How to make an 11 hour plane trip painless!<br />Grisham never fails and The Racketeer tells<br />a truly good story cleverly thought out.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game, but after playing for about 10-13 (actual) days, many of the things required gems, and RD costs about (I think) $100, maybe more. The game did pull me in for more than a week of heavy playing without boring me at all, though, so for that: five stars for everybody's favorite miniature horses.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|Faster to me is a great action movie with wonderful car chase scenes, great knife vs ice pick fight scene.  The characters were great too keep it simple cop, killer, driver.  This movie is truly a wild ride of a movie,  I've have personally watched it 3-4 times since buying it and I never get tired of watching it.  I hope the movie people keep making movies like this one that keeps you entertained from start to finish.  If you enjoy some good car chase scenes, fight scenes, and shoot outs with guns, then this is the movie for you.  Over the next couple of years I might watch it some more for fun of it, but I'll never get tired of the plotline or the action and acting in it.  I can see why some people say best action movie of the year because it actually lives up to that title.  Buy this movie for good evening if you love your action movies and add it to your collection.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a simple yet enjoyable game. This is relaxing and fun. The only issue is more free coins should be provided for prolonged game play.
1846070635|5.0|I had read the book, but I have to admit it was so much better hearing David Tennant doing it. He does such a wonderful job of bringing the characters to life - it's almost like getting a new Doctor Who episode - who could ask for more?
B004EPYZU8|5.0|It arrived before I expected it, and works well. It's such a great movie, I'm super happy I own it now.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|greatxapp, doing a wonderful job of keeping me organized. just wish the devs would allow youto purchase your own unlimited license instead of going with the subscription model.  I live in NYC and would like to use this app while underground in the subway, but just don't see the subscription being worth it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I LOVE SPIDER SOLITARE  ITS GREAT HAVING IT ON MY KINDLE AND I PLAY IT EVERY NIGHT IT IS SO NICE HAVING IT HANDY
B0063GORYU|4.0|really enjoying playing spider solitaire!  more complicated than regular solitaire. I can't get winning hands anymore since I put it on my new Kindle Fire hd.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|It has almost the same features as new models . The Only complaint is that the ouch bezel not always respond with swety fingers..but it s great
B008K8U13K|4.0|the PC version of this game was a horrible, rushed and buggy remake of the original sonic the hedgehog, and was very disappointing as such. I didn't expect to see a kindle version and didn't have such great expectations while buying it, but the game surprised me with the increased quality over even the PC version. the controls are much less broken, though being on a kindle they can still be a pain to get used to, a few levels were modified to make them more kindle-friendly and it runs amazingly smoothly given the capacity of a tablet for gaming.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend buying this game, even over the PC version. it is still just a re-packaged version of the original game lacking new bosses, but for $4 that seems reasonable.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Nesbo is a truly different type author.  His works are all entangling and fascinating tho sometimes gruesome.  This is the second book of his that I have read.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My grandson loves anything Star Wars....we started last year, and he loved that advent calendar, so I see quite a few of these in his future.  He'll love it.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I personally did not like this game as I found it too complicate.  Then again, I am an older person and am sure the younger, more savy generation would find it fun.  Sorry.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I've seen this movie at least half a dozen times.  I just ordered the blu-ray version.  How many movies do you have in your collection that you can watch repeatedly and still enjoy as much as when you saw them in a theater for the first time?  There are so many great scenes to look forward to and so few scenes to fast-forward through.  This is movie-making at it's very best.  The story is a brilliant one, and the script, acting and directing are highly intelligent and thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />The Swedish version was a TV series that seemed rushed and mechanical to me.  I'm not a fan of acting wherein the emotions of the characters are absent or implausibly stoic.  I found the acting wooden and forgettable.  I much prefer Rooney's Lisbeth and Craig's Blomkvist.  Rooney's Lisbeth is a conflicted and vulnerable character whose anger and brutalities are more obviously borne of an emotionally brutalized past and a physically brutalized present.  She isn't anti-social without reason or justification.  Craig's Blomkvist is smart enough and unaffected enough to make Lisbeth's trust and attraction to him plausible.  I found no reason whatsoever for Rapace's Lisabeth to trust or be attracted to Nyqvist's Blomkvist.  There was nothing about his character or his acting choices that made sense to me.<br /><br />Finally, Fincher is a great director.  He makes movies I want to watch over and over again.  His is a much more entertaining depiction of the book than the Swedish version is....in my opinion.<br /><br />By the way, I thought Rapace was totally miscast in Prometheus.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I  am a Kathy Reichs fan, and this latest Brennan adventure did not disappoint.  Once I discovered the crux of the main plot, I realized that the title was a literary allusion to a James Bond title.  Agent 00-Bones on assignment!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A 'young adult' book full of serious thems handled with a delicate, funny and insightful appreciation of challenges these teens face.  Such a sad topic handled so beautifully, this should not be limited to the young adult crowed.
B0087HT36U|5.0|A fun game that is similar to Angry Birds, but played in a different way. Lots of fun! As fun as it is, seems slow on updates.
B00003Q438|5.0|Need I say more?<br />This is one of the greatest movies of all time.<br />May not be in the top hundred, (I dont know) but I love this movie..
B00005K3OT|5.0|one of the sweetest stories to come along in a long time and what's not to love about johnny depp and juliette binoche - seriously.  great soundtrack as well -- just watch it and enjoy - preferably with some chocolate!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|it's finally on kindle fire, I had it on my dad's I-toch and now I can get it on here
B0001NBNAM|5.0|what a lovely voice she has!  i've loved connie francis for ages and, being half italian, it's great fun to hear her do these traditional/popular italian songs -- a great album!
B004LUS390|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps on both mobile and computer, and it's great to see it get some love with the Free App promotion! Drawing, sketching, coloring quick ideas.. awesome. Responds well to finger pressure, sensitive enough for on the go. Love it.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I loved this book.  I loved the characters, the writing was great, and the story was very realistic. I have read many memoirs from women in Afghanistan, and this felt like I was reading a memoir. From each woman.  It was hard to believe it was written by a man.  I didn't want it to end. Just as good as Kite Runner, and I will eagerly await Hosseini's next novel.
B005POK858|4.0|Not bad. I really didn't understand the story in the slightest, but graphics, gameplay, audio are all really well done. An excellent addition to the Android library.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay is the chilling, emotional end to the Hunger Games series. Katniss's journey is compelling and gut wrenching. The underlying message of humanity‘s ability for good and evil is complex, yet simple. Ultimately it's about choices.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|When searching for a good copy I noticed two things from the reviews: (1) a lot of options didn't actually have the ENTIRE collection, (2) TOC and organization was poor in most options. Being the first to review this item, I'll offer my opinion. I hope this helps out anyone looking to purchase this book.<br /><br />Bought on the Kindle Fire Hd. I have yet to read the entire book - this is just a review on the collection, TOC, and organization. However, from what I have read there were no errors. I'll update later when I actually finish the book.<br /><br />From what I can tell, this option does in fact offer the entire collection and is set up in the following manner. The TOC does include links to individual short stories; I disregarded them here out of practicality.<br />Volume I<br />A Study In Scarlet (Part 1 and 2)<br />(Mr. Sherlock Holmes, The Science of Deduction, The Lauriston Garden Mystery, ect.)<br />The Sign of Four<br />Adventures of Sherlock Holmes<br />Volume II<br />Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes<br />The Hound of the Baskervilles<br />Volume III<br />The Return of Sherlock Holmes<br />The Valley of Fear (Part 1 and 2)<br />Volume IIII<br />His Last Bow<br />The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes<br /><br />The TOC works perfectly fine. It may be a little confusing for some though. I'd recommend you take a look at \\"peak inside\\" option Amazon offers if you're a bit confused. There's really no difference between any other Kindle books I've bought. There are actually two TOC's - one displaying volumes and the other for content within the volumes. The \\"Volumes\\" TOC is located right being the cover (Loc 2). The Volume TOC will link you to individual volumes; then there will be a TOC for the volume itself.<br /><br />The Kindle version offers some images as well; no distortions and are a nice addition.<br /><br />I know there are many free versions out there, but I decided spend the $3. I'm not disappointed at all; if you are there is a seven day period which you can return for full refund.n return for full refund.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|this is a really easy to use editor, with tons of stuff on it. love it! I highly recommend this if you are looking for something easy to use.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I enjoy because I'm  playing against myself.  Always trying to improve my time.  I'd like them to put out out a higher level.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is great.I wish mojang came out with minecraft pe for kindle erlier.looking forward to skins and texture packs though.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I had high expectations of this book because I think Tina Fey is absolutely hilarious and in general a successful, strong-willed person.  I found this book to be surprisingly about the other people in Fey's life, even acquaintances.  I would say half of the people she mentions I don't have a clue about!
B009IJJB8G|4.0|This is a nice updated take on Sherlock Holmes and Watson. It has good stories and is well acted -- an enjoyable TV show.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a great read and provided insight into the raid to capture/kill Bin Laden. Provided some more indepth insight into how SEALs train and fight.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is amazing!! LOVE LOVE LOVE this book! I hope there is another one! Fantasic Story! I'll read it over and over!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I heard so much and read so many reviews about this book and the other ones in the trilogy I thought I would buy it as a gift for my sister to enjoy.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Great stuff Mark!  It continues to boggle my mind why colleges teach such useless stuff, and more people don't seek knowledge from credible and successful sources.  Thanks for doing your part Mr. Cuban!
B008M721MS|5.0|i think the kindle fire is amazing.but i dont know why but my kindle fire doesnt wanna let me buy any games and music.
B002VWNICW|5.0|I'm a big fan of the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice staring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. Maybe it's due to the fact that it was the first version I saw, but it's always been a favorite. (Who couldn't fall in love with Greer Garson?)<br /><br />I'm not sure if I wanted to like this version or not... but in the end, it won me over. So much so that I seem to watch it over and over again.<br /><br />Keira's performance is outstanding, she had me hooked in the first scene. For some reason it took me longer to warm up to Matthew as Mr Darcy, then again, his character does appear cold and aloof at the beginning of the film. In the end, it would be hard to imagine another playing the role; he won me over, just as he did Elizabeth. The supporting cast is just as strong, so no issues there.<br /><br />Setting aside the great acting and wonderful story, this is - plain and simple - one of the most beautiful movies to watch. Between the breathtaking scenery, as well as the lush score, it's hard not to just let the Blu-ray keep playing on repeat mode.<br /><br />In the end, though, it's Keira's performance that elevates this movie to excellence. She just doesn't strike a wrong note in this performance.
1897299192|5.0|Wonderful, so imaginative and funny like all of the other Moomin comics and books I have read.  The kids love them.
B009WJ44KC|5.0|Being a fan of John Williams this is a classic.  John Williams has not lost a beat with this one!
B008MC175A|4.0|Fun series.  A few problems with continuity from one movie to the next.  But just get over it and enjoy the story.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|This film is so obviously one of those projects of love by all concerned that it really needs no further explanation. If you are at all interested in the story of this remarkable artist, this is the definitive film biography that is unlikely to ever be surpassed. The only question left outstanding is: How did the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences not present the Best Actress award to Ms. Hayek for her performance? Highly recommended.
B0048KXRR6|4.0|Much like the first, but still entertaining and educational in the art of dealing with life.  Good ole Nanny McPhee knows her way around family relationships.
B009SIE6AA|3.0|Good CD - but disappointed there are on 4 songs different than last Christmas CD ! ! ! ! !
B005DJGMQE|4.0|First, this is a fine movie.  I liked Robin Wright's restrained acting in the difficult part of Mary Seuratt.  The movie leaves us in doubt about her guilt in the conspiracy to kill Lincoln as it must.<br /><br />I watched this movie just a few days after seeing Steven Spielberg's \\"Lincoln.\\"  During that film Lincoln gives an extended explanation that he freed the slaves during the Civil War as a matter of military necessity even though he was unsure whether the action was constitutional.  He had also suspended the right of habeas corpus during that war.  In The Conspirator Mary Seuratt is denied a civil trial and is tried by the military at the behest of Sec. of War Stanton who states he wants to preserve the newly won peace.  (The Supreme Court later upholds a citizen's right to a civilian trial according to a note at the end of the film). Stanton also works with Pres. Andrew Johnson to deny a writ of habeas corpus submitted by Seuratt's attorney in a last ditch effort to save her from being hanged.<br /><br />Part of the message from the film is to remind us, particularly after 9/11, that we have this recurring theme in our history of \\"bending\\" the Constitution when events cause our emotions to run high.  We are reminded that the rights of all citizens are protected in that Constitution.  It is a message that will always bear repeating and that was well done in this film.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I am not a dance film fan, but Magic Mike is different. It deals with a certain kind of professionals who are often attracted to the dance business for the most varied reasons. Some stay and some decide this is not for them. Unfortunately to some, the realization that this is not for them comes too late. The author makes sure to bring up those dancers' feelings, their history, their aspirations, and their shortcomings. Unfortunately, society's prejudice often hampers their efforts to pursue other dreams, and they stay stuck where they are. A really nice, poignant, and, hey, very sexy movie. Worth seeing.
B006S08RLU|4.0|Very French style movie making, excellent story telling. A little weak at the ending. The conversation is well written and the plot is well thought out.
B008K3N68M|5.0|Firstly, know that I have always been fascinated by all things renassaince - to include the art of the period and its artists, Machiavelli and the Borgias whom I have never found to be any worse  than their contemporaries. The French come off no worse than they were<br />historically.  Much of the senario is not too accurate historically but,<br />what the hell, it's smashing theatre but Juan Borgia comes across as the<br />lout he was and all the females are charming. Caesere and his sister are<br />to well played for me to quibble and Rodrigo is as dangerous as he was<br />in life.<br />The production values are first-rate and the characters represent the mores of the time well = superb direction & writing. I've seen the 1st<br />season only but I expect the subsequent seasons to be as good.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I am a huge fan of the series and have enjoyed being able to watch my favorite episodes whenever I want.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|My friends told me this is an awful movie & yet I still rented it ... how bad could it be, really?? REALLY BAD! There are huge plot holes you could walk through. This is supposed to be the prequel to first Alien movie and it does a terrible job of explaining anything. There are scenes that serve no purpose other than someone deciding there needed to be an action scene ... HERE!<br /><br />If you don't listen to your friends like I should have, then listen to the reviews ... don't rent this movie ... it's 2 hours of your life you will never get back!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand by me is one of my favorites movies. I love old movies. It is really a good movie.<br />The shipping was fast and the DVD is used but looks like new. :-)<br />Regards Flo
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Its ok but it has two problems.<br /><br />1) It takes forever to download which is an issue when you have to reinstall to start over.<br />2) It freezes and lags.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|With the shipping and how everything looks like was god. And the movie worked very good, but the movie is full of sh*** everyone told me the movie is so good and scary. You have to watch it before you watch the second one in the movies. So I ordered here and now I don't want see the second one anymore. The movie was okay, but not scary. And the quality how they made the movie look very cheap. Maybe I'm the only one who said that. But that's okay. I don't like the movie. An everyone has a different taste.<br />Regards Flo
B008673ZAQ|4.0|It picked up the story right from where &#34;Bared to you&#34; left off. If you like 50 shades you will love this book (the writing is better). This book is such a fast read that I read it in one day. It grabbed my attention from the start and I couldn't put it down. WARNING  ~ This book is for an adult audience.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Didn't go in the direction I wanted it to.  After my grandson tried playing it for over an hour he took it off the kindle.  Angry Birds, even though it was a free download, wasn't worth the effort.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|The movie is never as good as the book, but this was just about as good as it gets otherwise.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Well I would like to give this app a positive review but...  .. IT WONT INSTALL!  I would recommend this but it wont install thank you for your time and GOODBYE.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If this game got any better my head will explode. Great for playing minecraft on the go. Works great on the kindle. You should definitely get. $7 is perfect for the great gameplay it gives. Keep up the good work Mojang

B009NOVCSS|4.0|The Rolling Stones' work over the last 50 years has been divided into two periods - their Decca/London work of the '60s, owned by the late Allen Klein's ABKCO Records, and their post-1971 material released on the band's own imprint (distributed over the years by Atlantic, WEA, EMI, and CBS (Sony)).  When the group signed with  Virgin Records in 1992, Rolling Stones Records folded; the group's post-1971 catalog is now distributed by Universal Music Group, which, ironically, manufactures and distributes ABKCO.  For legal reasons, all Stones compilations until 2002 were split between the two periods.  \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\" - recorded at the end of the Decca period, but initially released on Rolling Stones Records both as singles and on the STICKY FINGERS album, are jointly owned by ABKCO and the band, and appear on both ABKCO and Rolling Stones Records/Virgin/Universal compilations.<br /><br />The first career-spanning Stones compilation was the 2002 collection [[ASIN:B00006IR69 Forty Licks]].  For the group's 50th anniversary, ABKCO and Universal have compiled GRRR!, the most comprehensive overview of The Stones' career to date, with tracks ranging from the band's first 1963 single, Chuck Berry's \\"Come On,\\" to two brand-new 2012 tracks, \\"Doom and Gloom\\" and \\"One More Shot.\\"<br /><br />I don't own all of The Stones' hits packages, but here is how GRRR! compares to the ones that I do own:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006EXDM Hot Rocks 1964-1971]]:  All of the songs from this compilation are on GRRR!, but there are two differences:  HOT ROCKS has the full-length version of \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" from [[ASIN:B00006AW2G Let It Bleed (Remastered)]], whereas GRRR! uses the stereo single edit (previously issued only in mono). Also, GRRR! uses the LET IT BLEED version of \\"Midnight Rambler,\\" while HOT ROCKS uses the live recording from [[ASIN:B00006AW2K Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! (Remastered)]].<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006EXDO More Hot Rocks: Big Hits & Fazed Cookies]]:  Five tracks from the main portion of this collection - \\"Tell Me,\\" \\"Good Times, Bad Times,\\" \\"Sittin' On A Fence,\\" \\"No Exceptations,\\" and \\"Let It Bleed\\" are not included on GRRR! Only one track from the \\"rarities\\" section (Side 4 of the original album, and the last 11 tracks on the remastered CD) is included on GRRR! - \\"Come On.\\"<br /><br />FORTY LICKS:  All of the tracks on Disc 1 (the ABKCO disc) are on GRRR!, aside from a few mono/stereo differences on songs like \\"Paint It, Black,\\" \\"Ruby Tuesday,\\" and \\"Let's Spend the Night Together,\\" plus the different versions of \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" mentioned earlier.  Seventeen of the twenty tracks on Disc 2 (the Rolling Stones Records/Virgin/Universal disc) also appear on GRRR!, but only one of the four 2002 songs is included - \\"Don't Stop.\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006EXED The Rolling Stones Singles Collection: The London Years]] and the three CD box sets of individual singles (THE SINGLES 1963-1965, THE SINGLES 1965-1967, and THE SINGLES 1968-1971) contain a lot of B-sides and (in the case of THE SINGLES 1963-1965) EP tracks that are not included on GRRR!<br /><br />The packaging on the Super Deluxe Version of GRRR! is impressive, but bulky.  The box contains a poster from a 1963 tour, a slotted cardboard insert containing a black envelope with five art prints from the band's various tours over the years, and a 7\\" vinyl EP with four early songs from a BBC radio show, recorded in experimental stereo. The EP's back cover has liner notes in the same size and font as the group's original 1963 EP, THE ROLLING STONES. CONSUMER ALERT: The EP plays at LP speed (33 1/3 RPM), not 45 RPM, as most vinyl EPs do, so set your turntable speed accordingly.  Of the EP's four songs, one, a Bo Diddley number called \\"Cops and Robbers,\\" was never recorded by The Stones elsewhere. Bobby Troup's \\"Route 66\\" was issued in 1964 on the band's first album, and a live version surfaced on the 1965 GOT LIVE IF YOU WANT IT! EP (not on the 1966U.S. album of the same name), and was issued in America in 1965 on London Records' DECEMBER'S CHILDREN (AND EVERYBODY'S).

B00992CF6W|1.0|this one reason I now hate minecraft is because after 5 minutes of use, the toolbar that lets you quick-choose items is in my screen.  no matter what I look at on my kindle, its there.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|I hadn't watched this movie in years (I'm 49 years old).  My daughter and her friends (ages 13 ~ 15) wanted to watch it, so I watched it with them.  Wow!  Even though they weren't as terrified of it as I was when I was a kid, there were times during the more intense scenes that their jaws dropped, or they covered their eyes in fear!  After the movie was over we all sat around the kitchen table for about an hour and talked about some of the scenes, and the meanings behind some of the things that happened.  I think this helped them to accept and understand that this wasn't just a movie, but a classic horror flick based on real life events.  I know for sure, none of them will ever tough a Ouija Board after watching this movie.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|Love this book, it illustrates just how flawed some of the prevailing wisdom of &#34;alpha status for owners&#34; should be done!  For the most part, my German Shepherds (2 - a male & female) are well behaved BUT there was one area in particular that I needed help with (greeting visitors) after reading Patricia's book, I put her suggestions into practice and was AMAZED at the instant results!!  I have spent YEARS (literally) and allot of money with dog trainers and training classes with very limited results. Ms McConnell explains to us how dogs interact with each other as well as humans and she backs up her ideas with many references to animal behaviorists case studies....... she emphasizes that as owners we should be our dogs &#34;benevolent leader&#34;..... her methods are sound and gentle, I highly recommend this book if you want to understand how your dog views the world!
0525478817|5.0|Yet another wonderfully written book by John Green. I recommend this to anyone wanting a good read. Would make a perfect gift.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Great movie, never a dull moment.....<br />I chose only 4 stars due to the fact that the movie suddenly<br />Ended, in my opinion the ending could have been a little more in detail, not so fast,
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I was recommended to the Game of Thrones and thought I would read the book since I don't get it on television. To be honest, I got bored with it.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I was highly impressed. I thought Daniel Day Lewis was superb. He seemed more Lincoln than even Lincoln was. He made the character so three dimensional. It was enthralling to see him play Lincoln so memorably. He really was ably supported because the other roles were played with so much verve and excitement. Everyone seemed to be really into playing their characters well. Tommy Lee Jones was simply great as Thaddeus Stevens, Sally Fields was a excellent Mary Todd, the three lobbyists were played by such wonderful character actors that they sprang completely to life.<br /><br />I wish Bruce McGill could have been used more somehow. I thought he was extremely convincing in his few scenes as Stanton. I was very moved by the scene of Stanton and Lincoln waiting for news from Fort Fisher and his reaction to Lincoln telling another story I thought was hilarious.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley was very good in his role as Alexander Stephens. I even thought he eerily resembled him. I also liked David Strathairn as Seward.<br /><br />Heck, this movie even had a great Tad portrayal in it! The scene of Lincoln and Tad at the very beginning is very, very moving. The final blowup between Robert Lincoln and Abraham is very startling in its intensity and well played by both actors. I thought relationship with his sons was one of highlights of the film.<br /><br />The scenes in the House of Representatives were superb showing the chaos of our Democratic system and that there never was really `good old days' when no one bitterly disagreed. That there was primal racism on the floor of the House of Representatives. Also, just try to tell these representatives to give women the right to vote! The lesson that is shown is the give and take that is needed to get something done with such a discordant legislative body.<br /><br />All of this greatness made me long for a `Band of Brothers' length miniseries on Lincoln with these actors.<br /><br />If a person is fascinated by America or American history the movie is truly a can't miss.

0887307280|5.0|For me, a five star book blows my mind; a four star book opens up new avenues of thought; and a three star book is fine. This one earns five stars. It is an eye opener.
B0006J28BO|5.0|I love this movie for its strong female leads. It is a great movie to inspire young females to take charge and believe in them selves.
0307887898|5.0|This book rocks. Every entrepreneur needs to read it. It is powerfully organized and to the point. Just get it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I was disappointed the plot did not follow the intrique of The Firm or Pelican Brief. It's time to write another really Great story!

B004FP1WX0|4.0|An amazing social experiment gone right. A stranger outcome than the film makers could have predicted. Truth is absolutely stranger than fiction. A must see for anyone living in this technological age.<br />.
B009CPES4I|4.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie. Excellent cast. Excellent writing. Wonderful film quality. I saw it twice and enjoyed it both times.

B007THA4FI|1.0|This is a poorly constructed story.  Too many poorly developed characters move slowly thru petty, boring lives.  JK is trying too hard to escape her children's book writer  identity. Her title choice I think was an unconscious book review.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I've been a fan of Lindsey Stirling ever since her first videos started showing up on YouTube. She is an amazingly talented young woman with unmatched skill with the violin. She stands with other great violinists and her unique combination of violin with electronic/dance music is pure originality at its finest.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A well written personal account of the experiences typical of today's often uncelebrated heroes. I really appreciated seeing behind the curtain into the world of black operations and the sacrifices of the men and women putting themselves on the line for our security.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Loved it beautiful story I told everyone i know about this great movie,i still watch it over and over love it
B004IE0NY2|4.0|I found this film very entertaining.<br /><br />Although this is not a deep film I found it very entertaining from beginning to end.... A fun adventure film with a good story line.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not finished, but anytime I pick it up, I get pulled right in to the story line.  Wish I had 2 full days just to finish.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|While I was a little hesitant to purchase the CD because Khan is no longer a part of the group, it is still a magnificent Kamelot album.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great read, intriguing plot, has some good twists to the story. Anyone reading this series should start from the start of the series.
B00417HV14|5.0|A must have if you're a guitar junkie or you want to have a live concert in your AV room- an awesome player - a great performance
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Not much to say - Fleetwood Mac has and will always be a favorite of mine and many others.  Enjoyable purchase.
B0074JOCIG|4.0|I'd rate this performance 95, and the Albert Hall performance 105.  For the price it's worth having both.  If you're just going to buy one, buy the Albert Hall performance.  Regardless, this guy is really really good.  Next best thing to seeing him live - maybe even better.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is a really enjoyable, mellow Christmas album for all to enjoy.  Rod's duets with Michael Buble, Cee Lo Green and others are all terrific.  I am so glad that I made this purchase and I have recommended this CD to others.
B009VB97EY|3.0|The dancing was good. Channing's dancing was Great! But the story was so-so.<br />They could have done without Matthew Mc.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is definitely a must watch!  You won't be disappointed, It's a Xmas classic that you can watch year round!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|You can't get by having only four!<br />Buy this one and complete your set!<br />The packaging gets better with each new issue!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I love Amazon's cloud ...  Hard to beat free, for the first 5 GB, and there's more available if you need it.  Can't go wrong.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This series is just plain amazing, I can go all the way back to the beginning and watch them over and over. I hope they keep going. It's just plain fun.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Loved it. Kept me guessing, kept me interested, kept me turning the pages.  Well written and imaginative.  I am always intrigued with the ideas people come up with.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Horror and suspense with so many twists. A friend recommended the series to me. It is gripping suspense every episode.
B000ID37RM|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. I highly recommend it. Watched it with my 14-year old son and he loved it, too.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This movie is thrilling and suspenseful and full of action. Anyone with ties to the military would thoroughly enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I don't like all the ads but its a moderately fun game and is worth a few minutes of my time.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great Movie, kids 10 and 4 really really enjoyed the characters. Great deal for $1.99 special. We will go out and buy it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have tasted some of the world Anastasia and Christian delved into, so for me it was almost like memories. If you havent, no shame there, but it can be a nice alter to your own reality. I let a friend borrow the first, and I am waiting for her to return, because I cannot wait! I am going to read them all again! And that is not something I do often, let alone back to back! Read it! I am hoping for a great movie to go along with it. And if E.L. James writes anything more, I will definetley be reading!
B005UA0FLE|4.0|I wanted something to remind me, while I am on deployment,of my childhood times. This album hit it perfectly. I am not a big Christmas music fan but I really do enjoy this album. Excellent voice and a nice flow. I will not buy anymore Micheal Bublê albums but I am happy to have this one.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Not as scary as Alien movies,(to which this is a prequel). But VERY interesting! I cant wait to see the next one. I am a die-hard Alien fan so I loved it. If you liked Aliens for the jumpy factor, this is not for you. IF you like sci-fi puzzle and a little action, space-ship to unknown kinda thing? This is for you. And you find out how those aliens were made in the first place.
0756655307|5.0|The Marvel Encyclopedia is an update to last year's book and is up to par with the previous edition. Being a long-time comic book collector anyway makes for a beautiful addition to my stockpile.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. It was great or a rainy Saturday afternoon. Gather your girlfriends and bring popcorn. Storyline is completely lacking but I do love the guys !
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Review by guest reviewer, Delaney Jacobs (age: 14)<br /><br />Book 1 of the House of Night series, Marked focuses on a high school girl named Zoey who is \\"marked\\" by a vampyre and doomed to going through the change into a blood-drinking beast as her stepfather and religious community sees it. She must go to the House of Night, a school for vampire fledglings, or those going through the change from human to vampire, and take lessons on how to be a useful member of vampire society, or reject the change and die as many fledglings do. But Zoey shows great potential and many unusual talents, being chosen by the high priestess as an apprentice and showing an affinity for the five spiritual elements. However, not everyone is as happy for her as her friends are, creating a harsh rivalry between herself and Aphrodite. If that isn't enough, Zoey is barely able to keep balance between her new life here at the House of Night and her past as a human girl.<br /><br />There are only a few flaws in the writing, mostly due to it being written by two different authors and having harsh lines where one's writing ends and the other's begin. However, this 'flaw\\" is, most definitely, made up for this by their suspenseful cliffhangers.<br /><br />Despite it being a vampire (or should I say vampyre) novel, it offers more intelligent writing and realistic romance than others books of its kind normally do. Marked isn't afraid to step outside of the box with its spiritual views, putting vampires in a new light and adding Druid and Native American influences into their vampyrific ceremonies. These vampyres are depicted as an orderly and highly feminist society with many artistically and intellectually talented members. However, not all of these vampyres want to shed light on the world, thus casting dark overtones onto the seemingly perfect beings.<br /><br />Oh, and don't worry, there will be plenty of blood-drinking.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Great movie, I have seen it on the big screen and it is just as much fun on the iPad
B0080OK7YC|5.0|Another smash in my Glee collection.  Download took a while but finally figured it out...technically challenged.<br />Great walking music. thanks
B008B1VYP0|5.0|These guys have done it again. Great talent and musical range make for another fantastic album for Maroon 5. Love the sound and the originality of this CD.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|having read other well known comedian's memoirs, I have to say:  not all comedians (who are funny live or on TV) are capable of writing a funny book.  Fey, however, nailed it!  I giggled.  I laughed out loud.  Clearly, she's bright, witty, serious and can put together a mean sentence!  i'm already looking for her next book.  i'd buy it in a New York heartbeat
B0088RQ4TI|2.0|I have read most Edgar Rice Burroughs adventure series. John Carter on Mars was a great read but the film did not capture any of the excitement the book created. Times have changed and thoughts of other worlds are no longer new.
B004HX4RT6|1.0|Not fun to play at all computer response is predictable, needs to be made into online mode. Deleting game from phone
B007UXT6T6|4.0|Cruise is good and the team cast with him was eqyally good. The actor from the lastest Star Trek as &#34;The Scottie&#34; was really good as was Renner. I also thought the butt kicking beauty was well cast. Hope to see them all in the next installmant of Mission Impossible.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|More for a younger group of people, acting was okay, storyline was good, I think it's just more for teens than for me...
B0072GPPNC|2.0|Altogether a contrived effort to conjure up a Lassie like response. Even the storybook place of origin reflects Lassie movies.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|. Even the author gives up and apologizes  for this yarn. This is his worst book and I have read them all.
1423136802|5.0|This book set was given to a young friend. She is an avid reader. To quote her thankyou note \\"Thank you so, so, so,so, so, much for the Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series. I just love them.\\" etc. etc.Excellent reading for young readers.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|perfectly cast in every way.  one character is performed better than the next and so on and so on.<br />truly a class act!  loved each and every minute of this movie.
B009YX02T8|5.0|I thought all the songs were awesome.  Makes me think I am back in the show watching it.  I cant wait for each Saga so that I can buy the songs.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I really enjoyed this. I knew it would be weird since it was Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  And it was weird!!!  I will probably watch it again.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|Great soundtrack!  Tis brought me right back to my heyday!  Kind of scary actually.  I don't know if today's youth will get it but for us 40 somethings....oh yeah!
031237674X|4.0|If you are truly interested in reincarnation, rebirth and past lives, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />A continuation of the work done by Dr. Ian Stevenson, also of the University of Virginia, this book offers clear evidence that at least some people do have previous lives. Culled from reports across the world, Life Before Life offers the reader case study after involving young children who claim to have lived before their current physical existences. At the time this book was written, 2,500 such instances had been scientifically investigated.<br /><br />The reader may find the wording a little dry but what Dr. Tucker presents here are not just the stories these children tell but also the rigorous analysis he and his team use to assess the validity of such claims. It is through that very academic presentation, however, that the startling truth of what so many youngsters have said becomes quite evident.<br /><br />Obviously, the majority of these cases arise in cultures where reincarnation or rebirth is part of a religious belief system such as Hinduism and Buddhism. The interesting thing that arises in Dr. Tucker's studies is the discovery of numerous cases that come from places where such beliefs are not predominant such as the United States and Europe. Add that to the fact where one or both parents of such a child are religiously opposed to the idea of reincarnation and you have set the stage for an even higher degree of verification.<br /><br />The stories told by these children are fascinating, and in my view, very instructive. Through these young voices I find infinite potential for all humankind just beneath the surface of our everyday reality.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|All I can say is watch this film, you will understand! Any pet lover will feel the emotions right off....till the very end...when it get's to a point you just breakdown!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I love this movie, have watched it over and over. Highly recommend it Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin are hysterical!
B000TEPED0|5.0|I'm a little late in getting on the Eric Church bandwagon.  I went to see him a few months back only because Brantley Gilbert was opening for him.  I'm not the biggest country fan so I didn't really know who Eric was.  He puts on a great show and once I was there I realized I knew a few of his songs.  After that I went out and bought Chief.  I love that album and became a big Eric Church fan ever since.  So I decided to buy his first and see where it all started.  He is a great songwriter and storyteller.  My favorite song on this album is &#34;Lightning&#34; where he takes the perspective of a guy on death row reflecting on his life and how he got there.  But this album is full of great songs &#34;These Boots&#34;, &#34;Guys Like Me&#34;, and &#34;Sinners&#34; are the highlights for me.  Eric has become one of the few artist where I can put on each album and enjoy every song.  No filler on his albums and the fact he writes or co-writes each song gets him added respect as I am a songwriter myself.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Finally Patricia Cornwell has produced another good book. Some of the last few have been ho hum. This book is interesting. Maybe she's remembering how to write!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I would give this book a rating 5 stars.This book is really good because he talks about his past and future. And I would suggest that Jeff Kennedy writes more books of Diary of Simply Kid.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved this book. It had a super plot. Not like anything you may have read.Wonder how the people at Google react to it!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I won't pay for cable but gladley will buy the shows I actually want to see. I love the convience and immediate ease of use. Only negative I can see is the slightly digitized picture when screen is expanded to full on computer. It comes thru when hooked up to the HD tv flat screen. All in all its a good price for a good product.
B004MPESSY|3.0|Liked an earlier, older version but this one is just ok to watch one time. It drags a bit in some scenes.
6304884419|4.0|I love this movie. It's a poignant coming of age story set against the backdrop of racial tensions in the 1960's. De Niro did a nice job in his directorial debut with Chazz Palminteri's script.
B0084AZXKK|1.0|This isn't a terrible book but I think the plot doesn't make sense.<br />If you are going to read it prepare to be confuced
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I'm a guy and to be honest when my girlfriend wanted to watch this movie I was not that excited. I got it for her for her bday and she loved it, and to be honest, it's a pretty good romantic movie. Great variation on the disney theme, stayed truly original throughout the film. Has almost a 90s-titanic sort of atmosphere. So guys, trust me, your girlfriend/wife/whatever will love it and you won't be too bored yourself. A great choice.
B0092QITO2|5.0|Excellent film.<br />Very interesting consept.<br />Hope they take advantage of the CGI to make more of the better SciFi Authors.<br />Michael L. Snowden
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This app is just plain boring all you do is kill pigs(disappointed).What is the point of this app???DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!
B005LAII80|5.0|I liked the dysporian view of a world gone over to No Freedom and obvious Have's and Have Not 's.<br />Even the Stalin's version was not for the goody goody types. The levety may have been misplased but, it was a good film with the adventure foremost.<br />Michael L. Snowden
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is free and when calibrated to the individual device is very accurate. It gives remaining time for a variety of activities, helping one predict exactly how long they have.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The Alien series is not supposed to make sense as far as any logical progression of events of a future history. I dought that Scott started out to Explain Anything. Enjoy the beauty of the film and the Rollercoaster ride of the story. After all the first Alien Movie was an ode to the monster SciFi movies of the fifty's with a heavy dash of the haunted house.<br />Enjoy.<br />Michael L. Snowden
B00000JMOF|5.0|5 stars for the oldies are the best yes go out and buy it now<br />before  you can't get it
0061433063|5.0|I love the Discworld series, and the Tiffany Aching arc has been a particularly interesting tale.<br /><br />A young girl just becoming a young woman, this book finds Tiffany decided what she really wants to do with her life.<br /><br />It's fun, it's weird, it's good fantasy...everything you'd expect from Discworld.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Discworld, you probably *already* own this...but if you're not then I highly highly recommend it.  Just one caveat--this is the last in the Tiffany Aching storyline, so read the others FIRST.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

B009LUBA7M|5.0|This album is more electronic and pop-oriented than Mika's earlier works... but it's still Mika.  Beautiful ballads like \\"Underwater\\" and playful tunes like \\"Emily\\" make this a joy to listen to.  I only wish it had the French single \\"Elle Me Dit\\" that Mika released overseas!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|its just stupid don't buy it.<br /><br />COUNTRY+FASHION OUT!!! PEACE! CHECK THIS REVIEW BEFORE BUYING.Ps. check office jerk its awesome!!  bbbbbbbbbyyyyyyyyyeeerrr

B009WO7NQO|2.0|I wish angry birds had one app that was like $5 to $6 dollars that had all the angry birds themes on it. that would be awesome because if you love all angry birds apps, its harder to install all of them!I would totally buy that app!Wouldn't you????
B00A12VW86|3.0|It does not come close to American Idiots album. Was really let down and will not be recommending it to anyone.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent Story, typical twists and turns that Grisham puts in his books. I would definitely recommend it. Has an ironic ending.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Love the movie. They went with the same people as tv show, added a little more fun to the movie.I think it  must see.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Cute story about a girl coming of age.  Pixar always does an outstanding job entertaining both children and adults alike.
B00006AW2O|5.0|I do not agree with any of the negative reviews. I presently own over 2,000 cd. this cd would be in my over all top ten of all time. I was 15 when I first heard this album on the radio. it was on WMCA in new york. the next morning i got on my bike, rode 4 miles and purchased the album. the outstanding tracks are around and around, the hits time is on my side and it's all over now. it also contains a fantastic re-make of the drifters under the boardwalk. This album showcased what was to be the greatest group of all time.<br />Jimmy G
0062082353|5.0|Having known Chris for a number of years before he wrote the book, I am very pleased.  Reading the book is as though you are listening to him talk. No editorial managing of words. It is him talking.  The interjections from his wonderful wife are perfect. You get a true sense of the stresses they endured by his 'calling.'  No super secrets are released, just the real gritty world he lived in.  Buy a copy or ten, given them as gifts to those who understand or may.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|I would give it five stars, but my husband thought the cast was too big, so some of the interesting story lines weren't given enough time to develop. I agree, but I could have just watched it for longer! I appreciate that the movie showed several different sides of pregnancy/&#34;expecting.&#34; It is such a crazy journey, and varies so much from person to person. But many things are hilariously relatable, and this movie captured that well. Such a fun movie! Probably more fun when you've already been through the experience :)
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I created an entire ppt presentation for class using the program. a free app well worth the download. i would recommend this
B0015DROBO|5.0|Extemely twisted tale of well everyone involved is in there own reality. Enjoyed it because it has the sense of realisam most books do not. To thge characters I mean. You could probably picture people in your neighborhood from the characters.
B0011Z78R6|5.0|Hotel California is one of the classic, must-have albums of the past four decades of rock. It shines well through the passage of time when other artists and albums have come and gone. It sounds as good today as it did when first released in 1976.
B00466HM28|5.0|Got this and I'm using it with garage band, it was recognized and every time I use it there is more it seems it can do
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I loaded this so my grandsons would not argue over the I Pad on Saturday mornings when I babysit.  It was a big hit on Thanksgiving Day on the 30 minute trip to their other grandmothers.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|How can you go wrong with Rod Stewart singing your favorite Christmas carols.  It is sweet and sexy!!  The best of both!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I haven't read it yet, but this is the first book i downloaded.  My Orthopaedic Doctor recommended that I read this when he saw me with The Hunger Games.  I hadn't been able to find it in the book stores I frequent.  This was part of the reason I bought my Kindle in the first place.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Very well done!!  Allows me to check my Google calendar or any Google calendar easily.  Easy to set up.  Easy interface.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think this will be fun for the grandkids and I can see from playing briefly that it might become addictive for me too.
B009S8PEHY|2.0|I don't understand why this old rocker wants to be Tony Bennett, please Rod go back to your blues roots and team up with Jeff Beck.....leave the crooning to the old crooners......
B008QMMEOE|1.0|There were only a couple of puzzles included. Many more were visible but when they were touched a pop up indicated it would cost $1.99 per puzzle. It would have been ridiculously easy for my 2 year old to smack Authorize purchase and no way to restrict access to the free puzzles. I immediately uninstalled it.
B000002B30|4.0|Not much for Greatest Hits collections, but with \\"This Hard Life\\", \\"Murder Incorporated\\" and \\"Blood Brothers\\", i picked it up.  If you love Springsteen get his full length albums, not just the Greatest Hits.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Jo Nesbo is one of the best of the Scandinavian mystery writers.  I would rate 5 stars to all of the books I have read and this is no exception.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Walking dead is a great show, it just keeps getting better and better! It's not just a show for people who like zombies. Careful though it is pretty gory.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The first of the trilogy dealing with WWI and the Russian revolution.  Great characters, great insight into history through historical fiction.  I can't wait to get to the second in the series.
0143120530|3.0|Very interesting insights. I just feel a little bit lost to where the book its going right know, so I leave it for a while, readiing it a bits at every night. I am not quite sure just yet if i like it or not.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of different fun games for all ages. Games are pretty easy for older children but younger ones may need occasional help.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|it makes you think about time, how it absorbs you and control you!  Perhaps we all should let go of this obsession and just enjoy the moment.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Helping my 5 year old with critical thinking skills, she is getting better at this game everyday.  I love that it is fun and helps to develop the brain!
B005K01VZS|5.0|i have recommended this book to all my family and friends. i always like albom's books for his simplisticity of writing style and yet able to capture your emotions very well.
B0047685I2|5.0|This movie has to be one of the most beautiful stories I have ever seen .  The actors and actresses are by far the best one chosen to play these roles. Very moving and enjoyable to watch.  I have watched it more than any other DVDs in my collection.  Great job putting together such an extrodinary movie.  I will treasure this movie for ever.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|the book is read by the author himself and is easy to listen to.  he made the subject interesting and well supports his theory
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I got this app at first for my sister because she loves marvel and I thought it would be nice to get it for her.  I then thought what the heck and started playing it and I its really fun.  I can honestly recomend it to all people who like this type of game.
0756404738|5.0|The speed at which I read is pretty average I'd say...the amount I read at a time when I sit down though is usually very little.  It's hard for me to site through much more than 30-40 pages at a time...I've always got to get up and go do something else.  Needless to say a 1,000 page book can take me well over a month to complete due to this...A Wise Man's Fear only took me a week and a half to get through.  I couldn't put this book down.  Patrick is such a great writer that I want nothing more than to read the next page.  Sometimes you read these 1,000 page books and you feel a sense of accomplishment getting through it and you kinda wipe your brow and take a deep breath as if you just went on a long journey and was glad to finally be done with it...not this book...I can remember at about 800 pages in I looked and felt sad that I was nearing the end...I did not want it to finish, I want more, I want to keep reading, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Anyway, I won't go into detail about the book as there are hundreds of reviews on that already but this book and the first one are two of the better fantasies I've read, plain and simple.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I got completely lost in these books. Became like a family member I spend so much time reading them. I was amazed at the detail. My only critic would be...way too many characters to remember. AND....where on earth is book 6???? :(
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I tell everyone about the show no matter what type of person. There is a character favorite for everyone.<br />The only thing I don't like is having to wait a week for the next episode.<br />When the season finale comes on, I'll probably watch the whole series again<br />starting at the very first episode just to keep me occupied until season<br />4 comes out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So i got this expecting it to be good...........WELL WAS I EVER RIGHT! This app was amazing and extremely fun but not as fun as the pc version.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|This was strictly a wife gift.  I'm not crazy about his music, but she loved it so that's what counts.
B001LM1456|4.0|A good companion to Thor, Captain America, Iron Man and Avengers.  Had some twists we did not expect that kept it interesting.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Stop cheaping out! I will never download in HD. I want those bluray discs! Too many shows are trying to get off on the cheap by only offering HD quality DOWNLOADS and skipping the bluray discs. COMMUNITY is another example of networks milking fans for low def dvds and refusing to offer HD bluray sets. Disrespecting fans this way will only hurt you in the long run, networks bc I will stop buying dvds box sets entirely until blurays become available. So stop trying to rip us off! GIVE US THE HD BLURAY SETS!

B005CKPQNE|5.0|Instant classic. No program has delved into the warped chess game psyche's of Gus, Walt and Jesse as this season 4 has. Truely the best TV has to offer. Enjoy.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Duh, it's Adele. Wow voice. Great songs. I can't believe I have to write more words in order to submit this.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show continues to be excellent. The acting all around is fantastic and the show is so well written. I love it!!!!!
B009VB9VKY|3.0|I like the actors in this movie, and had high hopes when it started. It just didn't utilize their talents well.
B00889SFNO|5.0|I so enjoy these three women, I love the songs in English or Ukrainian ( even though I* dont speak a word of it.  This is mostly english.  Love the videos of these girls and the spoof of mama lover too.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexanders account is the best I have read or heard about. If anyone has a doubt about Heaven, read his book.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Oh jeez lets get hooked! Birds+ Star Wars too cool. Best way to waste some time waiting for de plane boss
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|*** WAY TOO MANY SPOILERS***<br /><br />Visually, Prometheus is a stunner. The CGI and photography look fantastic; you get your money's worth in that regard.  The same can't be said for the script and characters, which are dumber than a bucket of dirt! Here's why:<br /><br />1. Peter Weyland, who funds the expedition, appears at the beginning of the film via recorded video, introduces himself to the crew and reveals that, by the time they see this, he would be dead. Near the end of the film, he re-appears, but in human form. In the ship. Right there. In the ship. The question arises: Why the hell would Weyland appear to be dead, hide in his own bloody ship - HIS OWN SHIP!! - then casually re-appear an hour or so later in the movie to ask the Engineers to prevent his death from old age?<br /><br />2. Before heading out on their mission, Shaw informs Jackson, expedition SECURITY, that this is a scientific expedition and that no weapons are allowed. Why was Jackson included for the mission then? If he's not allowed to carry weapons, how will he defend the team in case real trouble arises on an alien planet on which no humans have ever set foot? What's he going to use? Karate? The Judo chop?<br /><br />3. Fifield's tantrum upon finding the first dead alien. Why would Weyland choose a wimpy geologist - who just \\"loves rocks\\" - for an enormously expensive and potentially dangerous expedition to an alien planet gazillion miles from earth?  Surely the suitable candidate for such a mission should be robust and prepared for any sort of emergency, including finding dead weird stuff he's never seen before! But instead, Fifield scampers off back to the ship, taking scared-stiff biologist Millburn along with him! Where did Weyland find these wimps?<br /><br />4. Why is David, the programmed and therefore supposedly obedient and smart android so ill-disciplined? He opens alien doors without asking permission (\\"oops, sorry\\"), he touches the stone cylinders without thinking (\\"sorry\\"), he inexplicably and intentionally poisons Holloway with the black liquid (not sorry, I presume). Why doesn't he test the stuff in a lab first? He's android gone wild! And yet, towards the end he helpfully and sincerely assists Shaw to find another ship! How touching. Aw[...]<br /><br />5. Before the storm arrives, why do Millburn and Fifield wander around aimlessly in the caves? They're lost, see. And they're smart, too. They're scientists. Why then, don't they ask help from Prometheus who could EASILY guide them back to the ship via the mapping system which, only recently, had mapped out the entire cave?!<br /><br />6. Fifield and Millburn are scared of dead aliens. Apparently, Millburn is not scared of live alien snakes. What does he do when he's confronted by a threatening alien snake? He pets it of course. Fifield just stands by. And watches. Why not? Makes perfect sense. The snake then kills Millburn. Even better.<br /><br />7. With the help of a medicinal apparatus, Shaw performs abdominal surgery on herself to remove an alien host - a squid.  Shortly after, she stumbles into a room filled with crew members. Nobody notices her exposed stomach with surgery staples the size of door handles. Nobody bothers to ask her: \\"Excuse me, but WTF happened to you?\\" Nobody. Amazing huh? What's more remarkable is that a mere few hours later she dashes around like an Olympic athlete, trying to get away from a ship, completely pain-free and mobile. Oh yes.<br /><br />8. Why doesn't Holloway raise the alarm when he realizes he's infected by some weird bug that's crawling around in his eye? You know, have it looked at in the lab by his fellow SCIENTISTS? Seems like the smart thing to do, right? No. The smart thing would be to not tell a soul and become so ill that you REQUEST to be doused with fire and die a horrible, painful death. But of course!<br /><br />9. Why does Shaw, who remains a professional for the most part of the film, suddenly act like a petulant child towardsthe end when the group and Weyland confront the Engineer? Why yell and scream like an irritable toddler at the Engineer? Doesn't make one bit of sense.<br /><br />10. Shaw convinces Janek to ram himself, his two pilots and all of Prometheus into the Engineer's craft. It takes her only a few seconds to persuade three other human beings to give up their lives by turning their spacecraft into a giant fireball. And they happily oblige. Just like that. No questions. No discussions. Really? REALLY?!?!?!<br /><br />11. When Shaw and Vickers run from the falling alien spacecraft, why do they run in a straight line? It's obvious to everyone and their mother that, if you just turn right or left, just by a few meters, that you'll avoid the craft and save your life. But noooooooo. Eventually Shaw realizes this. Not Vickers. Turns out she's not only a bitch, but a stupid one, too.<br /><br />See? If you break it down, this movie is just unbelievably f***ing stupid. Roger Ebert awarded this film four stars. Ironic, since he's always been an ardent crusader for films with intelligent scripts and characters.  Strangely, I do recommend this film. Grab your popcorn and soda, but DON'T switch your brain on.  Unfortunately nobody told me. But now I can tell YOU, you lucky devils!
B009NCM248|5.0|Once again one of the most prolific singers in hard rock/metal hits a home run. This disc is the first of two concepts cd's and is what  you would expect. Some of the songs are of the Slipknot vein and others have the melodic Stone Sour sound that gained them many more new fans. I love it all and if the second one is as strong as this one it will turn into a hall of fame double disc set.
0062183591|5.0|I read Dr. Ariely's book as part of a Forensic Research and Analysis class requirement.  The class is part of the Carlow University Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics program.  The program is the first directly fraud-based program of its kind in the entire country.  The program website is [...].<br /><br />This book shines an incredible light about the prevalence of dishonesty in the world.  Through a series of interesting scientific experiments, Dr. Ariely will make you re-think about common assumptions you've ever had.  People can rationalize why they should cheat/steal for a litany of reasons, but an eye-opening result of this book taught me that people in general, will only cheat a little bit.  This book shows ways in which people will steal less, such as a moral reminder, and it even draws a correlation between the amount of cheating people who wear counterfeit clothing will do.  This book touches on the level of cheating when individuals are monitored, as well as how much people will cheat when their cheating can benefit someone else.  Dr. Ariely even explores the link between an individual's creativity and the amount which they will cheat.<br /><br />While Dr. Ariely's experiments are conducted in a lab setting, which can potentially limit their usefulness or applicability in real-world scenarios, the book is so interesting that is definitely worth reading.  For someone pursuing or already in the field of fraud and forensics or someone wanting an interesting view into the human psyche this is a must read.  In general, this book will give you a tremendous insight into human behavior and will make you question even the way you have acted in your own life.
B009E3EY38|5.0|What more can be said about these  legends. They don't disappoint and you can feel transported back to their hey day.  Love the blu ray and the sound is mixed great.  The behinds the scene stuff is a great addition.  Jason Bonham does an amazing job filling in for his dad and looks truly emotionally touched during the experience. An instant favorite in my collection!
B008JAGZDE|4.0|They tried to have enough humor & female nudity compared with the first one there are quite a few moments to worthy more viewings & enough time had passed to come up with a good script unlike no.2.
B009ZTLPJM|5.0|Soundgarden is one of the bands that came out of the &#34;grunge&#34; Seattle scene that I think transcends the label and time. This new disc is no different and I am sure that 15 years from now this one will sound as relevant and new as it does today. I love the way the base is more in the forefront on the bonus tracks.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|Cute show for my kids under 7!  I liked that we had 48hrs to watch.  That way we were able to watch it more than once!
B005K17RU0|5.0|works well with my kindle fire. doesn't crash or lock up my tablet. very easy to use. highly recommend this app.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Best movie of the summer action all the way. Robert Downey is a great tony stark<br /><br />Black widow is fantastic
B001A4LYN2|3.0|I really liked the performances here, but the movie was not as engaging as others have said it was. Perhaps on some technical or deeper levels, maybe, but in terms of entertainment or as theater, it was a bit lacking, minus the classic Day-Lewis scenes. So, in my opinion, see it for Day-Lewis ridiculously good acting...don't come for great entertainment.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Great movie for whole family, enjoyed the fun and humor in the story, Moral taught to the young. A must see movie
B002R27J1W|5.0|This is an oldie but a very good goodie.  I first saw it about 1968, shortly after it came out, and though the planes and autos give it a dated look, it is still (as of 2012) a very gripping story of poor-blind-girl-tries-to-defend-herself.  My wife had never seen it before 2012 and was enthralled with the twists and turns of the plot.  Great film, and the online viewing process was nearly flawless.  Well worth the rental price (2.99) and not having to leave the livihg room to rent and view this movie.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|For all of you music lovers who have been addicted to GOOD music for several decades, Mumford & Sons gives us another reason to keep looking and listening. I can hear the influence of many artists that are all a part of the greatest music of all time.
0312084986|5.0|James Herriot's self deprecating humor and warmth is unbeatable.  Even if warm fuzzy loveball creatures are not part of your life you'll love these heart warming stories.
B00992CF6W|5.0|&#34;Grandson loves it, that's good enough for me&#34; I can't figure it out but the kids all know how to play it.
034580404X|2.0|This book is the English of a college freshman level.  Teenagers enjoy this more than adults, I think.  I am sorry I bought it
B008MEM24S|5.0|I am a Phineas and Ferb fan and thought this would be great fun.  It is.  I really enjoy the graphics and colors.  I use this on my Kindle Fire and find it simple and easy to play.  My 8 year old daughter has out scored me on every game!  I am glad that you have to think when you use the game.  Funny to think physics and geometry are put to use in order to solve the game.  :-)
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|At first I thought I was reading about the New Tricks cold case team but fortunately Rebus broke ranks as started to play by his rules. A really good read.
B004SBX112|5.0|I was instantly addicted.  I actually downloaded it for my 8 year old daughter but upon inspection (being the diligent parent here), I found I was instantly challenged.  Love it!
B009B50QOU|4.0|While I don't love it as much as 21st Century Breakdown, it has grown on me. Another good one for the morning commute.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I really enjoyed this film, but I can see why it was not a box office hit.  The acting is superb, but the plot is less than compelling  For some reason, I lost interest on both viewings near the end.  Maybe a tighter progression into the engineers storyline.  The premise is fantastic, the search for the origins of humanity and the engineers that built us.  I loved the staging and look.  If you haven't seen it, buy it.  It is worth two viewing just to get the full effect of director Scott's vision.
B009FRG8IW|5.0|Awesome song list from beginning to end. It's been playing in my truck since I got it. Great music for my work commute.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|MANY WOULD FIND THIS BOOK GOTHISH,<br />BUT IT IS A BRILLIANT TALE, NOT A LIGHT READ, BUT<br />ENJOYABLE AND HEART RENCHING NON THE LESS.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Interesting view of those who choose an unconventional direction in life and the price they pay to be free.  The price they pay is significant and this movie helps to understand the costs and rewards.
B005JE1KHE|5.0|THIS BOOK IS FILLED WITH UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND TURNS, SO AS TO LET YOU SIT BACK AND<br />RELAX AND NOT TRY AND FIGURE OUT THE BEST ENDING, AS WHATEVER IT TURNS UP WITH WILL BE BRILLIANT..<br />A SENSATION!
B00992CF6W|3.0|its a good app but if you get it you cant uppdate it and you cant play with friends if they have a difrent update
1451695195|4.0|I believe just about anyone would be interested in reading this book due to it's unique subject matter as well as the professional status of the author/doctor/patient.  Most all of us, regardless of religious affiliation or not, question the &#34;eternity factor&#34;.  I'm not sure I believe the doctor's dreams to be factual simply because I myself have had some rather unique dreams that were in &#34;another world&#34;.  However, our existence, our planet and other galaxies...all of it is--simply-stated--too awesome to not believe there is more to life than death itself.
0345803507|5.0|I love reading this finally book in series because, it answer all my unanswer questions the first two books left me. After, reading the series I never would have guess that the last book in the series would have end like this. But; I wish that the author would do a spin off series or do more books from the series but; on other characters like Taylor, Kate, Elliot, Mrs. Jones, Mia, Ethan, Ray, Jose' Sr.and Jose'.Only thing that was drawback for me is book that it didn't do scenes of Ana and Christian's Wedding, Or Scenes of Ana further along in her prengnecy, Kate and Elliot's Wedding, or them annoucing that getting ready to have their baby, and Mrs. Jones and Taylor's Wedding, Jose finding someone to fall in love with, Mia and Ethan finally starting their relationship.Other then that this book and series became, my must read and guilty pleasure of 2012. Also, makes me cann't wait to see what new books the author puts outin upcoming years.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|Sin lugar a duda otro acierto en el sonido de korn, un lujo de disco y un disfrute total de todas sus canciones, un momentazo melodico y un exito del 1 al 13 para mi uno de sus mejores discos
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Tim Burton and Johnny Depp did a wonderful job bringing the 1960s gothic soap opera into the modern world.  I think both the fans of the original show and the kids and grandkids of the original fans will get a kick out of this over-the-top campy dark comedy. Trivia......Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper who also appears in this film are distant cousins.  Wonder if they know it?<br /><br />This film is not really appropriate for kids younger than sixteen because it has some gory and raunchy qualities to it.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I have watched the whole series from the beginning.  Love the characters along with the culture in England during both wars.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I was very please with this product.I bought this for my father as a birthday gift, we both love them.The picture was amazing and they sound great. Amazon you never let me down.
0788859544|5.0|Wonderful story and great music. So happy I can share this with my twin toddlers! This DVD was used but it was in  condition. I an so glad I didn't spend a ton if money for a brand new copy.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|The game is great but the price is a little high but I got it when it was the free<br />app of the day but it's really addictive and I play it all the time.
B0051QIGP4|4.0|This is a very different album. If you are a fan of Lady Gaga, this is a must have. I am enjoying it.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I bought this film in my pursuit to collect all the classic animated disney films that I loved as a child. It was great then it is great now.
B002X02V02|4.0|The songs are very loud and harsh. I do not recommend it children. I am growing fond of this artist, and would encourage you to purchase it.
B0045XICB2|1.0|The acting in this moving was amateurish.  The plot is boring and the storyline is very predictable.  I do not recommend wasting time on this movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We love this game. It is very addicting. The whole family has been playing it even my husband who does not play games.
B0077ZNCE2|1.0|Breaking dawn was a major disappointment and waste of time.  The picture quality was not up to par.  HD quality subpar.
B0095R76EW|2.0|This movie really tried hard to be a comedy. But, the funny scenes aren't enough to carry the rest of the film. We finished it out of pure stubbornness, but we all lost interest pretty quickly.
B0014BC3C2|5.0|This film makes you think, question, and question some more. When I read its reviews on IMDB, I saw all out political arguments over the issues portrayed. Evidently the filmmakers did something right. It brought passion out from the viewers.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|got my notification to  my phone andwas able to get great deals locked in without being tiend to a computer at  home.
B000001ESJ|5.0|If you like Rush, you will love this CD. It is one of their classics from the 70's, with long guitar riffs, epic storylines, and powerful vocals.
B000I9X67W|4.0|Entertaining.  Love the music.  It takes me back to my high school and college days.  I love the musical aspect of this movie as well.
1401223176|4.0|Good story. This is, of course, the story that brings Jason Todd back from the dead (or is he?) in a psychologically twisted scheme to get under the Batman's cowl. The relationship between Batman and Catwoman has never been better and I would have liked to have seen it played out more in the regular series after this storyline. Good story and very detailed artwork.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i'm not much of a game player but i enjoy this game its very realistic , kudoos to the author
B00571F26Y|5.0|Read it. Sure makes sense. I am willing to try. What's it going to hurt? Weight LOSS and better HEALTH????
B000244FDW|1.0|My favorite is the 1939 version.  The A&E version is great.  I liked the Kera Knightly version.  This one is flat and boring.  Everyone is shrill.  And Elizabeth has zero appeal.  Just awful.  Oh, and the sets stink.  They spent the equivalent of my child's weekly allowance on this junk.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book held my interest . Leaves me wanting to read  more of the story of Katness. Fist book I read on Kindle.  Love it.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Terrible camera. Do not waste the $2 on it. So grainy and cumbersome to take photos and videos backwards! You would hope that Kindle would find an easier way or do not bother calling it a camera or video app at all. Only good for Skype
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Love the series, love the actors too! The storyline is awesome and I like it when the story continues on. I love the speed and the fast cars, even the comedy between Dom & Brian & Roman and the whole crew. The freindship and trust between all of them is what I truly enjoy. I believe its what makes this a great story and thus a great series.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Enjoyed it , good entertainment for the holiday. The message is what matters in a good film and this one had an excellent one.
B002413TY2|4.0|Great flick! I love this series. So much action. I love the Audi better than the other cars he drove.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The only reason I kept reading was to see whether she ever smartened up. Unfortunately not! The characters were shallow and sick. Needless to say I won't be investing in the other books.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It is not working well on the 8.9, which is very frustrating. You can only see a few posts and then it won't go any further. Please fix!
B0015DROBO|3.0|This is a book several of my friends recommended and others said to stay away from. I'm glad I read it, but several gruesome scenes could've been omitted. There seemed to be two stories merged into one which left me frustrated with the ending.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love Mahjong.  It's fun to play against the clock.  Sure keeps the mind sharp  This has a lot of different configurations and levels.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|Great mix of worldwide music sounds, with the classic sound of Paul Simon. I would recommend it for any Paul Simon fan.
B006H5120E|5.0|The 3-D images were magnificant.  It was very clear and precise.  Great story.  Always good to watch and now even better in 3-D.
0374214913|3.0|This books is written is first person and relies heavily on the reader's saavy about computer technology and interest in characters who work in that field. Sloan seems to be ambivalent about the relative merits of humans vs. machines, although humans win by a nose in the end.  Just as the story starts getting weird, Sloan grounds the characters in all-too-human (and somewhat middle schoolish) antics and romantics.  Just as the story seems to wind down, Sloan injects another plot twist that leads us to the inevitable, predictable ending. This is in some ways a cautionary tale about holding back the forward momentum of machines as complimentary resources, countered by a weak case for the smell of good old-fashioned paper-and-ink printed books.  This was my first exposure to author Sloan, and I feel cautiously optimistic about reading something more by him.
034580404X|5.0|This story is captivating. One you start reading you cannot put it down. I loved this trilogy so much that I have started to read it a second time! I can't wait till E L James comes out with another book.
B00979CS50|5.0|This terrific new album by Neil and Crazy Horse has a great retrospective sound and feel in the lifetime of the great artist's career. Looking through sonic reflections, he finds a fondness of a time when hope and ideals of 'what could have been' united a generation. And there is a bitter acceptedness of today that winds in and out of the water.<br /><br />I've listened and been a fan since the early-70's. I can hear so many sounds inkling throughout my years with Young's music. \\"I used to dig Picasso\\"... Drifting Back, at 27 min, practically makes a person challenged to let go of their personal electronic devices for a bit and listen to words and music the way we used to, with minds that are distracted by nothing else.<br /><br />Crazy Horse is the power grid that Neil arcs his guitar across. Lengthy jams, distortion... its the journey, not the destination, that matters. This album merits many many replays, it has a very welcome place in my ears and mind.
B009YU62H2|3.0|Chris Cornell is one busy musician these days, and his wealth of projects is starting to bleed into each other. King Animal starts with the most memorable Soundgarden track in history with &#34;Been away too long&#34; (it WILL be stuck in your head nonstop), and then goes into &#34;non-state actor,&#34; a track that longtime fans will instantly recognize as being composed by guitarist Kim Thayil.<br /><br />There are several other great tracks, but as an album it feels uneven. The back half, especially, is more reminiscent of Chris Cornell's solo work than classic Soundgarden -- not necessarily a bad thing, just not what you'll be expecting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|it's a free game, so it has ads @ the beginning of each game...BUT the game is accurate &amp; fun, and the graphics are really good!  get it!!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Almost excellent prose and a darn good story about a brother and sister suffering the aftermath of their parents one major mistake...robbing a bank.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Multiple plots co-occur, but none is really focused on long enough to be engaging. This movie would have benefitted from a bit more detail and dialogue. Didn't do justice to what otherwise was a good idea.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The animation was amazing. However I didn't care for the moral/message of the movie. It was ok to view but We won't  be purchasing the DVD for our personal library.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The perfect Wes Anderson movie. All of his aesthetic flourishes come together elegantly in this hilarious movie. If you don't like watching adolescents and adults speaking in wry deadpan as they go about their quirky adventures, stay far, far away. If that description instead appeals to you, then by all means click &#34;play&#34; now.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|I loved Michael Fassbender in this.  He really steals the show.  Noomi Rapace is also very good.  I didn't know when I started watching it that it was to be part of a trilogy,  I can't wait to see the next one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great sound effects and challenging while trying to get prizes.  Love it when the phone vibrates and the animations when you get special coins!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The characters are nothing like the book and in fact they are almost unrecognizable but I may like them better in the movie.  I love watching how they are find thier way to living in such a different culture.  Bill Nighly is wonderful and so is Tom Wilkinson.  Throughly enjoyable movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Totally recommend this season. Super intense and unpredictable twists. 5 stars all the way. This season was a little &#34;bloodier&#34; than previous seasons, but worth it!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Everyone should see this movie! It makes you laugh but has a good moral also. Chevy Chase is hilarious. Classic in our family.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|I read the pre-views which lambasted the producers, the band, and Mike Love for making a tour DVD that represents less than half of the set list.  And to an extent I agree -- however, there are enough deep cuts and vocal re-arrangements to keep hardcore fans like me excited and satisfied and plenty of radio staples to please the more superficial fan.  I'm now watching it for the first time, and I didn't plan on writing a review until just now, as their celestial performance of \\"All This Is That\\" concludes.<br /><br />For the militant hardcore fans, is there a redemption possible in this DVD's production?  Absolutely!  I encourage the producers to release a two-disc, unedited version.  Heck, why not?  McCartney has done it with live CDs, and I imagine others have done likewise.  Biggest rip-offs = no \\"Disney Girls\\" with Bruce, no \\"Getcha Back/It's OK\\" with Dave, no \\"And Then I Kissed Her\\" with Al, no \\"Please Let Me Wonder\\" with Brian.  As to the production value of the film as it is, just think about the wonderful live DVDs Brian Wilson has released over the past decade -- quality is consistent with those releases.<br /><br />This is not a waste of money and, although it's lightweight, it IS a good concert film of the tour.  MORE DEEP CUTS!  MORE COWBELL!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like this app. It is extremely convenient and helpful. Works well with Kindle Fire. I recommend it for quick calculations.
B00009W0U4|4.0|As a fan of Monica Bellucci I really liked this movie. I had seen a few of her movies and her enigmatic personality comes accross well in this movie.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|Chopin's music is sublime, and Lang Lang is extraordinary. This album will wrap you up like a warm cozy blanket.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|If you are in your &#34;golden years&#34; you will be able to relate to the trials and rewards shown in this movie!
B00782O7IY|5.0|Just an enjoyable film. You'll  love Uggi. And the end is a great surprise. This film really deserved the Oscar.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|New twists on the way the birds work are fun!  Enjoy figuring out how to make the best use of the new qualities.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|If you missed the reunion concert, like me, this is the next best thing. These guys will always be fabulous.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game can occupy time, and shows you how to get around any obstacle. The colors aren't too bad either.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|i was surprised at this movie as it was very good.. i think it had a great story line and the plot was solid. as far as the acting goes i thought all characters did well and were portrayed accordingly. it did well in the era it was cast and,as far as i could tell,stayed true to the time line. the monster was done well and was shown enough so you could believe it was real and not penciled in after filming.. all in all i like the movie and would see the sequel if they did one[and they left it kinda open for a follow up]...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very doubtful in buying this one! Don't usually read about military things. If I had had the time I would have read it in one sitting-<br />Yes it was that good! Loved it!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|As is often the case, I liked the books better! But this movie is a good beginning to this fantasy series.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I have only read about half but really have enjoyed what I have read. Took it with me to a doctors appointment-didn't realize I had<br />been waiting for 2 hours in the waiting room because the book had me hooked.
B00015YVDG|5.0|This is a nail biting thriller!!! This to is an oldie BUT the story line is excellent, the cast are amazing together and the acting is impeccable!!!
0316227706|5.0|Besides being beautifully (and amazingly) photographed, Seth's appreciation of dogs, and their welfare, comes through in this wonderful book. I never tire of looking at it.
B004BDJS9Q|5.0|This is a great movie that I would recommend to my friends.  Good story, good cast, outstanding music.  Must see
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I Wanted more to see! It was great, but missed out on  so much detail from the books ! Di
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Great movie I wish I had saw if at the movie theatre to get the full affect of the film.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|A very cool game!  You will love the imagination that you have to use to make those piggies move!  Awesome!
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|I cannot speak for the longevity of this product as I only received it recently.  However I have tested it out and it works as described.  Very bright, easily lights up a room so you can see without having to carry it around, and you can satisfactorily read a book if you're close to it.  My mother wanted to buy one too, but it has sold out since I purchased it.  Hope they get more in stock soon.
B007SSDDWE|1.0|I was charged but I was never able to view it. Now it's not available to me I'm not sure who to contact to get this problem resolved.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This series is not just for kids.  It is great reading for adutlts too!  Rick Riordan writes so you feel like your are experiencing what is happening in the story.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We watched this on Thanksgiving with family from 1 to 85 years of age.  It did not hold the interest of the small kids and they were scared by the bears fighting.  The 20-30 age group and older adults enjoyed it more.  The movie was beautifully filmed in very vibrant colors.  I liked the little red haired girl!
B009OJ01HA|5.0|If you like thrillers that keep you in suspense for the entire movie then you must see this movie. The acting is great and the story line is gripping. A must see!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|You really can't go wrong with a pixar movie. I was very entertained and it kept my attention. Felt like a typical storybook tale. The animation was spectacular. The detail they put in the main characters hair was phenomenal. I definitely give this movie a thumbs up :-)
B00932ANQM|4.0|The movie isn't an instant classic but it is still much better than the average love story. My hardest part of this movie is watching and eating for Efron to break out in song and dance in remembrance of his old high school musical days.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|remember when carnivals had these machines with real quarters?!! this game is the greatest game I have ever played in my life.
B000TEMRIU|5.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the essential Smashing Pumpkin's album. Billy Corgan's musical genius is evident throughout this work.  It is unforgettably the last strong album of the Smashing Pumpkins.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We LOVE this movie. This was the first movie that my daughter went to see in the theater (when she was 2). How CUTE is this! It's VERY bright and colorful. It's child appropriate and also some silly adult humor in there as well. The songs are great and catchy. We actually just bought 4 additional copies of this dvd for gifts while the lorax dvd was on sale for 3.99 :)
B007M45PMU|4.0|The Lumineers have a distinctive sound that plays off of country, folk and pop influences. Their sound runs from dreamy to toe-tapping on some songs.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|HAHAHAHA! HILARIOUS MOVIE!! Must see! My husband and I laughed so hard while enjoying this movie! We ordered ours on Amazon Instant Video for a great price :)
B0096Y94PI|5.0|This biggest selling album from Michael Jackson is packed with hit after hit.  I was never a MJ fan until his death in 2009.  I actually started listening to his music and discovered a hidden gem that had always been in plain sight. His soulful lyrics and catchy riffs makes anyone who can hear stand up and listen.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|It's the same movie I had on vhs. The quality is a lot better, I appreciate the digital copy AND i also got an $8 coupon for Peter Pan and pre-ordered it.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|The movie started off with much hope but then the 2nd half got very plotty and draggy.  In the end it was an okay movie with great animation.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|Let me start out by saying, I cannot stand the chipmunks.<br /><br />BUT, this is actually the only movie out of the 3 that I can stand. My daughter and I can watch it numerous amounts of times and it keeps both our interests.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love this app if i could pick it would be in the top 10 this is the funnest app ever
B000W91RUG|5.0|We love this series.  The product was in perfect shape and we are enjoying watching it. I am now ordering the rest of the seasons.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|While the overall plot and special effects were good, I found it hard to understand what the characters were saying at times.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Wish there were sequals to this movie.  I loved it.  It was action, comedy and an actually good story line.  Now I am going to buy Firefly.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|have to uninstall and reinstall often for it to work on Kindle!  wish there was a way to find advanced skilled players?
B008HTQ28K|4.0|The Rackateer.  A page turner of note with a delicious twist and all the legal jargon required to make it typical Grisham. A winner.
0307888908|5.0|Great book which speaks to the necessary reinvention of many of us...Particularly those of us &#34;digital immigrants&#34; who may have come up through technological careers, who now are considering &#34;what's next?&#34;
B005UDD1R6|5.0|This app allows you to control all of your media needs. Unlike other apparently you can only do music and video.  But you can also do pictures. Very good app
B00A11AN6O|3.0|I still like syncing pictures with some other cloud services but I use this one.  The layout is not bad but it could be better.  Overal a &#34;MEH&#34;.
B008458O3S|5.0|One of my favorite things about this game is that it comes in very small chunks--one level at a time, take your time, figure it out and if you only have time for one little level, no problem! My kids like to play it too (obviously they don't understand all the harder levels, etc, such as those that include color blending and crossing, but they like to build tracks anyway :)
B00124BNF4|5.0|Sure David Byrne is kid of an a-hole in respects to this band, but they made great music.<br /><br />From the &#34;World Music&#34; sounds to the straight up New Wave tracks this album has them all.<br /><br />Worth a listen.
B008ASLNN2|5.0|This was a good movie.  My son and I enjoyed watching it. (why do they have a word limit on these?)
B009YU62H2|4.0|So there are a few ways to look at this,  money grab, nostalgia, or old rockers trying to recapture the old days.<br /><br />I can't argue that any of them are wrong.<br /><br />The end game of any review of this album should be this,  it is Soundgarden,  nothing more and nothing less.  They used their established sound and cranked out a solid album of Rock and Roll.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great writing, this season has you on the edge of your seat.  A character from the first season is making an interesting come back.  Great show for fans of zombie movies and scifi.  Could be too gorry for some.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|It doesn't give enough protection.  It should have more padding inside.  I don't know what else to say except it is too flimsey.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|Fans have waited a long time for Beth Orton to release another recording; I know I have. If you're hoping for the Beth Orton that peppered folk with electronica so successfully on previous recordings then you will be disappointed. Beth Orton shows herself to be the same master of her craft that she ever was, but her latest offering is a soundscape tied together with strings and a mature beauty that stands up on its own.<br /><br />Sugaring Season begins with &#34;Magpie&#34; and it's a strong start to the album. She remains true to her contemporary folk roots on this one; punctuated with her characteristic voice, driving percussion and feisty lyrics. &#34;Silence me and I won't be here anymore.&#34;  The second track &#34;Dawn Chorus&#34; skips along and flows like honey to your ears. Orton always seems perfectly comfortable in her skin, brave enough to be herself and you can hear that in this recording. She delivers with ease, hence what she brings you is pleasing.<br /><br />The third track, &#34;Candles&#34; has some gorgeous strings providing an atmosphere that is a bit deeper and darker- they paint the landscape with shadow and it fits. &#34;Something More Beautiful&#34; is my least favorite song on the album. She is unapologetic about the raw emotion she puts into this song, rightfully so, but the strings are a bit overwhelming in this one. &#34;Call Me The Breeze&#34; is the kind of song that deserves an unrestrained airing through the open windows of a vehicle cruising down the highway. Perfect traveling song.<br /><br />Track #6, &#34;Poison Tree&#34;, based on William Blake's poem, has an old Gaelic folksong feel to it. She is joined here briefly with backing vocals by Sam Amidon, and it's too bad he doesn't sing this as a duet with her because their voices work well together. &#34;See Through Blue&#34; is a whimsical little waltz that'll put a smile on your face. By contrast, &#34;Last Leaves of Autumn&#34; is an absolutely beautiful piece of music; soulful and tender. &#34;I'm hanging on like the last leaves of autumn, But one ray of sun and I bleed into one, I would light up the sky in one burning mist of flame, If I could light up the sky in one blinding mist of flame...&#34;<br /><br />&#34;State of Grace&#34; is another beauty- gentle and joyful, uplifting and affirming. &#34;And I put my stake into the ground, In a state of grace this time around, And in the selfsame circumstance I do the same again, I would do the same again, I would do the same again.&#34; The final track on the album, &#34;Mystery&#34; will immediately plunge you into quiet reflection whether you want it to or not. Gorgeous.  In total, &#34;Sugaring Season&#34; is a real treasure to be savored. Enjoy!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|For all the Lincoln haters who have been posting about him in light of the newly released film--Read this.  Well written and informative and applicable to today.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My kids and I all loved this newest tinker bell movie, they haven't taken away from anything from the first one. The animation is still great quality and a great story too.
B001MKQS4O|5.0|As for the film, no problem to watch. As for the story, entertaining and sometimes troublesome because prior to watching this, I read &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; by Truman Capote, and to top it off I'm from Kansas. Even though Capote was the writer and not a character in the book, Hoffman's portrayal of Capote is palpable. I recommend this highly.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have read this book twice and both times found the insights very profound.  I think had Mr. Stein chosen any other character but the dog, it would not have had the impact of the profound insight into the human soul.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next 2 books.. its a great start to this series. Bring it on Suzanne Collins
B009LHJYA0|5.0|I would recommend this album to all Ill Nino fans!  It's heavy and very well written.  I can't wait to see these guys back on the road.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Without a doubt that was the dumbest movie I've ever seen. The plot was ridiculous, the acting sub par and time spent that I'll never get back.
B002W0GN20|5.0|This Album has all of my most liked CCR songs. Fans of CCR will enjoy playing this Album very much.
B004RZGUBM|4.0|Excellent therapy for those who need to curb their impatience and to learn to savour gigantic sentences. Interesting to encounter Dickens' idioms, which are mostly anachronistic but occasionally startlingly modern. Dickens' characters are flat and static, and his women in Pickwick are uniformly silly cardboard cutouts, but in other ways his writing is still a joy. The kindle edition is fine, notwithstanding the occasional editing error, but for the illustrations being too small to see properly. This is a pity because they date from Dickens' times and would add useful and interesting detail.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. Thanks to all who work on this. Very easy to use. Very intuitive. All the best things in life are free.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very captivating story!<br />I cannot wait to see the movie! Hopefully its just as good as the book was to read
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watched the first episode and it turned into a Walking Dead-a-thon. I was HOOKED. Now in season 3 I'm still hooked. Lots of twists and turns. And unlike it sounds it's not ALL about zombies. It's more about the people and there are zombies there.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Wow!<br /><br />This is one of those movies that’s a little hard to review without being silly. Is there any point to this film besides entertainment? Nah. As somebody says in the film, “There is only the mission.”<br /><br />But what a ride! The movies is chock full of great set pieces. And as with The Avengers, the storytellers at the helm know exactly how to pace an action sequence, even when it has multiple elements and takes place in several different rooms. This was a vast improvement, in my eyes, over the third Mission Impossible movie. I recall one really excellent sequence in that one where the team has to infiltrate the Vatican. The rest was your standard action movie - things blowing up, people chasing other people. MI4 is basically structured around three main missions and one prologue mission. Plain and simple.<br /><br />Thing is, these aren’t your standard sequels. These movies get made when the stars align just right, I think. They’re like the Bourne films or the Bond films. A central concept or character holds down what is essentially a very long, very high budget television show. So the success of the film is going to hinge exclusively on the creative talent behind it, executing something fun. And this film does that. The opening title sequence is great fun - I don’t know, I got a kick out of the movie foreshadowing everything that was to come. The stars are great - Simon Pegg is the most inspired cast member as the comic relief, but Tom Cruise can still hold his own as a cool badass, and Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton are excellent too. And the climax is great - the music screeches to a temporary halt as those various elements I mentioned struggle to come together at the last … possible … moment!<br /><br />(Somewhere before I said that Michael Giacchino is the next John Williams. He may not have scored The Avengers, but I didn’t notice that film’s music nearly as often as I did in this movie. There’s some really excellent work here.)<br /><br />Of course I wish I could have seen this on the big screen, where the IMAX photography that took place on an actual skyscraper in Dubai would really have popped. But this is still way, way too much fun for what it is.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|I thought the previews for this were hilarious.  It was terrible.  Although I like Sacha... And every other thing he has made was so AWESOME.  But I'm sorry I didn't even remotely enjoy the Dictator.  Not sure what happened...
0061124958|5.0|Bought this book for my daughter's class project and she fell in love with the story. The book came in excellent condition.
B00846TTDG|3.0|It was good but just seemed really patriotic.<br /><br />I don't know... I probably wouldn't watch it again.  Wouldn't discourage anybody from watching it though... Not a bad movie.  Just wasn't really a movie for me.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|I saw Taken2 before seeing this one. This was great, Taken 2 was even better. I'll probably watch it again.
B0054NRC6S|5.0|We have been seeing this happening in corporate America of recent, not only with corporate executives, but with blue collar workers also.  Great actors, good story line, and the ending is what a lot of us dream of.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Brave:  Typical Pixar--superb animation and graphics, great storytelling, and excellent vocal acting.  Don't miss it.  This will be added to my archives.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham did it again.  Good book with some interesting twists to it.  As my title says, &#34;I was sad it ended&#34;, as I enjoyed it that much.  Now what to read?
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game plays as it should. Instructions are easy to understand and game also has several options for changing the look of the game. Love the stats section!
B0077ZNCE2|2.0|This movie was terribly acted and the story left much to be desired. Very slow paced. I guess it keeps pace with the others in that regard.
B0013O123Q|1.0|Unless you enjoy watching a woman being raped and beaten for 10 or more minutes, this is not the movie for you. Clearly this is one of the directors that hates women. And why this actress agreed to be degraded in this way is beyond me.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It was the first movie we rented, and we will be renting one again! The clarity was great, and the convenience, unbeatable!
B001N3OJEG|4.0|This is a really good flick. Hadn't seen it in a while. Acting, story, everything still entertaining, very atmospheric. See it.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Easy setup, nothing to learn.  I was skeptical, but this is a &#34;must have&#34;.  Would gladly pay for this one.
B008220B0C|5.0|This really gives you a look into her life and I loved it.<br />I think that this also showered off her talents and music perfectly !!!
B001XVPBL8|3.0|Loved the movie but it just felt like 3 episodes combined into 1, the series is great but this as a movie doesn't fly in my honest opinion. if you are interested in watching the show i recommend this since its the starting point but for no other reason.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I think that she is exploring her new life and were she fits in pop and this is surprisingly a really good CD. I love it!!!
B000HF0ILY|5.0|Although this story is very similar to &#34;Shane&#34; I'll still give it 5 stars. You can't beat a good old fashion western. No real standout lines but it rates up there with High plains drifter. Can't beat the price either.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|It was a good movie but not  as good as Dragon Tale. Definitely not the kind of movie you'd want to watch again and again.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Simply put, a masterpiece from the kings of the concept album.  Great to hear Thomas' crunching melodies return as they have been missing for the last few cd's.  Oliver and Shawn prove to be great additions while Casey continues to keep the beat of Kamelot.  Finally Tommy Karevik displays a unforgettable performance on this disc and proves Kamelot will be just fine without Khan (trust me I was one that was concerned).<br /><br />All you do in life comes back to you....
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|unmm... this should be free! it is on websites! if you wanna play this game it is on almost any game website
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This is an excellent updated version of the original series.  Very well handled.  I love the fact that you can toggle back and forth between the original screen shots and the updated versions while the show is still playing.  The kids really get a kick out of seeing the differences in current tech renderings of space as opposed to that of Gene Roddenberry's day.  Either way, I am very pleased with this set!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I had this item on my list for over a year. Yeah, I read the good reviews and all that, but I didn't think you can get anything decent for under $20... well ya know how it is.<br />I finally ordered two of them to try out.<br /><br />Plugged it in to my vide/cam and the sound was PERFECT. There are no background pickups and no echo pickup in the room as well. The mic was about 10\\" from the mouth, clipped on the t-shirt. The clarity and richness this product just blew me away. I also plugged it into the Tascam field recorder to see if all is good and ditto, same results. I was monitoring with a headphone (Bose QR-15) so I can not hear any ambient noise and only the recording. BTW if you're serious about hearing what you record and not the ambient, do try the Bose QR-15. Sure it's $200-300 but it's worth it.<br />I spent over  $1K for 'cans' and none is better than QR-15 for my video gigs.<br /><br />I love this lav mic and will be getting more for all our radio transmitters.<br />Note: I read many complaints about this mic and it has nothing to do with this product, but the connections and how it's used. The unit is well made with quality craftsmanship for the housing of the unit, but the 'tie'-clip will break off at first try. Bad plastic and design. Hey, it's only a few buck to get a better tie-clip.
B00A12VW86|5.0|In my opinion DOS has some more experimental experiences that make this record unique. Comparing to UNO, I needed more time to get used to songs like Nightlife for example, and I really appreciate their effort to try something new.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing TRE!
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this version before I saw it the first time in a theater.  It's just beautiful, though, and true to the Dickens original.<br />The animation is very well done, and the actors do a wonderful job with their voice parts, especially Jim Carrey as Scrooge.<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B000067CPX|5.0|Not much to say. The album is great, shipment was super quick, quality of item rec'd was just as stated.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|This is a tory both children and adults can enjoy. I recommend it to anyone who feels too overwhelmed or busy in their life.  It will cause one to examine and evaluate priorities.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I expected this to be a bust when we rented it, however, it was surprisingly interesting!  There is actually a decent plot and while the Depp's character is a bit over the top (as they always are, which is one he's on of my fav. actors!), it all blends together to make for a good movie.  The only reason I rated it 4 starts instead of 5 is because there are two sections that have some VERY strong sexual innuendo and content that seemed out of place and ruined the flow of the movie a little.  This movie would have been just fine w/out that.  Overall, the movie was great though.
B00ABWKL3I|3.0|This season has its strengths and its weaknesses.  First, the female cast members have not defined themselves.  There is the Minnie Mouse look alike who is most irritating.  And the blonde child...who is evil like Sue and Santana BUT there is nothing to like about her...the element that made Sue and Santana characters defined and enjoyable to watch.  As for the males, the writers are trying too hard.  At least the leprechaun is gone...what a bad decision he was.  Blaine...please decide is he Howdy Doody's illegitimate son or sexy preppy...I would go with the sexy preppy. Now Finn...this guy has come into his own...perfect. The only male with energy on screen is the cross dresser...why isn't he there always...and he should have been Rizzo...period.  All said, I still like the show but I dread when a new episode arrives...because I do not know if it is gonna be a good show or bad.  Season 3 and 4 are fifty/fifty.
B0088TG252|5.0|I'm not big on movies, but my friend insisted we watch this. Great movie, kept my attention the entire way through.
1451695195|5.0|Don't we all sometimes wonder about the Afterlife? Just reading of someone's expericing Heaven gives me so much hope.<br />I would recommend this to anyone.
B0054SMID0|4.0|First Matthew McConaughey movie I have Liked. Super solid movie and just gets better. I can see why the girls like him, he has talent. He should do more movies like this.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My daughter got this app for me. Haven't tried it yet, but I'm sure I'll love it.  The fast download was very nice.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This was my first JoJo Moyes book I have every read, I am now onto my third on, loving it
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|For the genre of writing, this book has everything. Odd but brilliant characters playing out a surprising story line. It is much richer than can be translated onto the Big Screen. Stieg Larsson was a great fiction writer. I enjoyed being transported to Stockholm and the Swedish countryside.
0316227706|5.0|Everyone loves this book and it's become a favorite coffee table book.<br />I recommend this book to all dog lovers.
B0088WGBC8|5.0|Amazing action flick that will keep you on the edge of your seat! I always love Denzel Washington movies and he does not disappoint in this governmental conspiracy movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|my friend convinced me in to getting this game now I cant get off of it. on survival there is an advantage in the lite version... you get unlimited blocks provided for you. but it makes the game more interesting. on creative there should be animals but there is not. but unless your like me and die in the most impossible way... you do not have any enemies. on creative you can do more because of unlimited blocks. all together awesome.
B004HX4RT6|3.0|Wow I have not played chess in years so I started on easy and believe the difficulty is way to high. I know how to play but this is not fun if I cannot advance my skill and strategies.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|The dance revue shows are very entertaining, and Channing is incredible to watch, but there is very little story to the movie.  I'm glad I watched it once but wouldn't bother watching it again.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I loved this game one of the best turned based reminds me of Command and Conquer. They have since fixed and now can play once again on my Samsung Infuse. Great game and publisher for listening to their customers. I look forward to more of their products.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|LOVE,  LOVE,  LOVE,  LOVE,LOVE, LOVE,LOVE, LOVE,LOVE, LOVE,LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE&#62;//////Love not  much you can say but Love,Them Beatles I love them
B008WCP2PG|2.0|The best parts of this movie are in the previews.  I expected a better product and story.  The storyline is very weak.  Just a lot of beefcake!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|wooohooo! my 6 year old loves this game and i confess to playing it a bit myself in between his games!
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|This guy has an unusual voice but after hearing the CD at a friend's house, I felt compelled to buy it myself. It is not the usual sort of music I like but I find of late that unusual voices attract my attention greatly.
0739378341|4.0|I think anyone who likes a mystery should read this book.  I could not put it down because of the twist in this story.
B0037RDPEG|5.0|I read this before I watched the movie so that I had all the information.  It is def a good read about a woman who is discovering herself.<br />so much for the movie......
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|yes I would recommend to other even tho I had seen it before somewhere else but i can't remember where.
1582701709|5.0|My entire family wanted to read this book.  Interesting information on what these people say and write.  Every author had a story to tell and how they invoked the secret to become successful.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This was a wonderful adaptation of the Snow White story, I watched it 4 times. I would give it a two thumbs up! way....up.
0876391277|5.0|The pallet of sound is one of the major goals of the professional musician. Not only does it make improvisation or playing a melody richer and more expressive but it also gives us identity and sets us apart from other musicians.<br /><br />The author presents the different effects very clear and simple and explains step by step how to achieve the desired effect.<br /><br />In my particular case this book has helped me many times as a saxophonist but also as a teacher as I was not always able to put some effects I could play into words.<br /><br />SAXOPHONE SOUND EFFECTS comes with a play-along CD that makes practice fun. This book is ideal for extending vocabulary and for deepening the sonic palette of your saxophone, I recommend it one hundred percent.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|So many funny and well developed characters. There is kid humor and laughs for just the adults. &#34;It's so fluffy I could die!&#34; Is a favorite of ours.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Nice entertainment while you are waiting for for your fav TV show to come on.  Not rocket science, but you do have to stop and consider angles and ricochets.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Excellent movie, acting was superb videography excellent.  Reminded me of a time when integrity ruled & a man was known by his word.
B00005JPS8|5.0|It's in good condition. It had no scratches and came with the original works for the case. I got what I asked for.
B002C4YYEU|4.0|This movie I seen before and I liked it so much that I bought it I on DVD and now blue ray

B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Bank robbery and murder.  Read the first sentence of Canada and you know this is going to be an interesting story.  Dell Parsons, now 65 years old is about to unburden himself of the story of his fifteenth year, the things that he saw, the things that happend to and around him, and the secrets he has held for these fifty years.  You think your teen years were tough?  This kid's parents robbed a bank and were caught and sent to prison.  He was sent to live in the middle of nowhere with strangers that were mysterious and dangerous in thier own right and may, themselves be haboring violent pasts.<br /><br />So, pour a cup of coffee, light a fire in the fireplace, and take a deep breath.  This story is going to take some telling.  Do not give in to the temptation to use the fast forward.  Dell, will occasionally meander, occasionally philosophize and, from time to time, spend a little too much time in introspection and self analysis.  But the journey, as long and circuitious as it may occasionally seem, is well worth the time and effort.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Product Work's Amazing! Looks New . . .Arrived On Time. Can't Wait To Watch It. No Scratches Or Marks on Disc. Thank You!

0761169253|5.0|Hello! Austin Kleon's book is a great read for when you need a bit of a creative inspiration to jump on things. Fun, Quick, Good read, but do SOMETHING, anything after. I dont consider myself an artist but the inspirational advice in it are tools that can apply to anything you need to put your heart into.
B008VNIBFO|5.0|This is Billy Wilder's greatest film and very possibly the greatest film about hollywood ever made. It might possibly be the greatest drama ever made and, in my mind, is greater than  films like Citizen Kane and Gone With the Wind. The blu ray version must be seen projected (requiring projector and screen) which amazon sells for a great prices. If your under 40 and just getting into classic film, put a home projector system together and make this your first purchase. All go blu ray when you project.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Did not see that coming. A great movie to watch with some great action and also a little drama included.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Good movie but not a great movie as it has an ending (or beginning) that is a little difficult to interpret. I saw it in Omnimax 3D and the reason I purchased the 3D blu ray is so I can see on my home theatre (DLP Link 3D system) & see how well home projection  measures up.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|After reading a lot of reviews I feel that I need to shed a little light on this \\"series\\".<br /><br />let me say also that I have not yet read the 5th book (just finished the 4th), but I am pretty sure there is a method to this madness.<br /><br />(the reason I say this)<br />1. this is supposed to be a 7 book series (keep in mind that book 4 and 5 could still possibly only be book 4, which would mean that 3 more books are due(( at the least 2 though .)))<br /><br />2. Martin takes forever to release a book. Most of the new readers just started reading the series because of HBO and probably have no idea how long martin takes to release a book (i want to say it took over 6 years for book 5 to come out from book 4 (( it was supposedly already written.)))<br /><br />3. given the facts of how long the series is and what book 2 was like compared to book 3. (forget book 1 because that started the whole game.) it is not a far thing to consider book 4,5,6 is only a set up for 7, 8. (or 4,5 for 7)<br /><br />in conclusion of some one that has not even read book 5, I know already not to expect so much, due to what I already know, but what I do know already is that the resolution should be something amazing considering book 3 and the build up thus far. When that will happen though and if it is even worth picking up this series to read till it ends I can not answer. (because they take to long to come out, one might need to read the whole damn thing to refresh their memory.((which means reading books 2,4,5, all over again, ((( you think they were tough the 1st go around, just think of a 2nd.)))))) What I can answer is something Martin already said in an interview as towards the end of the series. Which is it will not be a happy one as much as it will be bitter sweet.
B009AZZEU2|1.0|Wow, what an awful album! Are the people who gave this album 5 stars on a really good drug or something? After hearing this album, I put in Down On The Upside for comparison. There is NO comparison! I actually liked a couple of Chris Cornell's solo albums, and the FIRST Audioslave album was outstanding! This album, however, is truly atrocious. Chris, please just stop making music! When I first listened to this album I thought the first three or four songs were pretty good. It went downhill fast from there. The next six tracks ranged from unremarkable to downright dull. It wasn't until Worse Dreams that the band actually sounded like Soundgarden again. The next song is Eyelid's Mouth, which starts out promising, but soon resorts to the same boring drone that makes up most of this album. The final track Rowing is a turd that just keeps rowing, and rowing, and rowing, and rowing, and rowing, and rowing, and rowing, and rowing, and rowing, down the road...just like this band. The difference between Pearl Jam and Soundgarden is that Pearl Jam has staying power. Soundgarden burned super bright and then fizzled out long ago. Matt, please stay with PJ!
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game. When I am bored I will play this game for hours. This is my favorite game and it costs you nothing. Great buy for any age. It keeps you on your toes.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This movie is fantastic- I do wish I could play it on my wii though! As for the movie and the way you can buy it and watch it on your computer though- top notch
B009KKLQKO|1.0|The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Tour was great. I saw two of their concerts in Southern California, including the Hollywood Bowl concert, which hopefully was recorded and will be released in it's entirety.  UNFORTUNATELY, this \\"Live in Concert\\" is NOT that product. This video is an attempt to rip-off the fans by giving them only a fraction of the actual concert.  It is a rip-off, and a disgrace to the legacy of the Beach Boys!  Do not buy.
B008BDZOXQ|5.0|Awesome seller! EXTREMELY Fast shipment. Exactly as described :) Thanks

B009YU62H2|4.0|When the single &#34;Black Rain&#34; came out, Soundgarden fans rejoiced!  However, with that song being a leftover from the Badmotorfinger era (and really would have been a perfect fit on the SOMMS EP), the &#34;Live to Rise&#34; single from the &#34;The Avengers&#34; soundtrack was a better indication of what we could expect from a new 2012 Soundgarden studio album.  Although I like the &#34;Live to Rise&#34; single well enough, it did temper my expectations for all-new material.  Then &#34;Been Away Too Long&#34; came out and I wasn't blown away, although there was never a doubt that I was going to buy a new Soundgarden album.<br /><br />Luckily, the second track is &#34;Non-State Actor&#34; and then comes &#34;By Crooked Steps&#34;... now that's what I'm talking about!  Then things mellow a bit for &#34;A Thousand Days Before&#34;, before the instant classic &#34;Blood on the Valley Floor&#34;.  I'm a little scared about &#34;Bones of Birds&#34; - although it is a catchy enough slow-tempo tune, I fear it will be the next &#34;Black Hole Sun&#34; that gets played so much on the radio that it makes me cringe.  Instead, in terms of singles, I hope they release &#34;Taree&#34; to the airwaves - I can't ever see turning the station if it was playing.  After that, I tend to skip ahead to the foot-tapper &#34;Worse Dreams&#34;, which leads to the next instant classic &#34;Eyelid's Mouth&#34; (with Mike McCready!).  Lastly, we have the gem (with the bass line that should never end!) that is &#34;Rowing&#34; - nothing I would have ever expected and yet it is my favorite new Soundgarden song since 1996.<br /><br />Now, is this some definitive, be-all-end-all album?  No, I wouldn't say that, but I already have my &#34;best of Soundgarden&#34; playlist with 28 prior songs and now I can FINALLY mix in a few new tracks from &#34;King Animal&#34; to keep it fresh.  Keep it coming guys, the music world wasn't the same without you, don't do that to us again!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I enjoy a good action movie. The movie was better than I thought it would be. I would like to see a part two.

B0025KW29U|4.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a 2008 Musical Tragicomedy. The film was written by Joss Whedon and his two brothers Zack Whedon and Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen. They wrote this tragicomedy during the Writers Guild of America strike in 2007-2008. It was directed by Joss Whedon. The musical tragicomedy is only a 42 minute film, which made it small, inexpensive, but yet professionally done.<br />  Dr. Horrible Sing-Along Blog is about Dr. Horrible (Neil Patrick Harris) a super-villain who has a PHD in horribleness, who wants to get into the Evil League of Evil, Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion) Dr. Horrible nemesis who is a superhero and Penny (Felecia Day) who Dr. Horrible is madly head over heels for who is a volunteer for the caring hands homeless shelter.<br />  The film begins with Dr. Horrible talking on his video blog.

He says \\"the world is a mess\\" and \\"I just need to rule it.\\" One of the e-mails asks him who is \\"her\\". He is then interrupted by his friend moist (Simon Helberg) who's powers extend to dampening things. Horrible then receives a letter from black horse (leader of the Evil League of Evil), telling him that his application for entry will be evaluated, and will be watching him for his next heinous crime.<br />  Dr. Horrible then sets off to steal a case of wounderflonium for his time stopping freeze ray, where he uses a remote device to control the van. Penny who is on the same street as him is trying to get people to sign her petition for turning a condemned building into a homeless shelter. She runs into Horrible asking him to sign his petition, but the remote requires his attention and he acts uninterested in her and her cause. Penny leaves, Dr. Horrible is conflicted, but ends up stealing the wounderfionium telling himself \\"a man's got to do what a man's got to do.\\"<br />  While trying to control the remote control device, Captain Hammer shows up stopping him once again from doing evil. Captain Hammer and Penny meet and they start dating, which then really makes Dr. Horrible want to really dive deep down to his evil temptations.<br />  The one thing that Dr. Horrible makes a mistake of doing is his video blog where he tends to share his evil plans. The first plan he had to get him into the Evil League of Evil got ruined, because Captain Hammer and the police watched his blog and was waiting for him.<br />  As the film comes to an end Dr. Horrible finally has Captain Hammer right where he wants him, Horrible ends up freezing Captain Hammer with his freeze ray. Dr. Horrible soon to be victory ends up back firing, the freeze rays battery ends up dying. Horrible notices it and he says \\"that's not a good sound.\\" Captain Hammer then breaks free and hits Dr. Horrible. Hammer then grabs Horrible death ray gun, but it ends up back firing throwing Hammer across the room. Penny ends up taking objects to the chest and dies.<br />  Dr. Horrible then ends up getting pinned for Penny's death, which changes everything for him. Captain Hammer is now devastated by the loss of his fight with Dr. Horrible not the loss of his girlfriend, and Dr. Horrible gets into the Evil League of Evil.<br />  This short 42 minute internet musical tragicomedy film was very entertaining. Not only is it entertaining but also a romantic love comedy, along with a super-villain superhero comedy. So if you are looking for a good entertaining short musical tragicomedy film to watch pick Dr. Horribles Sing-Along Blog. The actors and actress all do a very well job in playing each of their parts as well.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I'm about half way through this book and it is so hard to read in the sense of what this poor girl went through. I always wondered why she didn't escape somehow or make the neighbors know she was there, but now I understand the control her tormentor had over her at such a young age. I hope she is doing well now.

B005IQZB14|1.0|I ran out of time...only got half way through it before my book club meeting.  It's still sitting on my Kindle, half way through.  I'm sorry she had such a tough life, but did she learn anything?  I learned enough not to finish the book.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|BEST SHOW SINCE SEINFELD!  Great writing and superb acting and characters make this the best show on TV by far.
0449011909|5.0|full of action intrigue blood and guts, My kind of book!!! Can't wait to sttart the next one..loved the reader.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Its angry birds at its best. Angry birds seems to adapt to many different themes and that keeps your interest and makes them more enjoyable.
B008XG1X18|4.0|its great I am always stuck on it not sure if its my kindle bu it gets slow to load pages
B009FZFONO|5.0|One of the best TV series I've ever watched...always leaves you wanting more after every episode.  For a zombie series, I am very impressed with the quality of acting and the realistic feeling in every episode.
B00992CF6W|4.0|my 12 year old  loves it!!!  His 19 year old brother who attends college also thinks its great! Its great especially for using on the  KINDLE! great updates and super fun levels!
0780648838|5.0|fast service and good product.  Was shipped very quickly.  Loved the product and speed. Really good service and good product
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Awesome story and animation. I really loved the Scottish scenery and characters- very authentic. Love the strong female protagonist! Great for all ages.
B007712XAU|5.0|This is a great great series and I loved the product and how quickly they placed the order.  Good job
B00270WH3Y|5.0|This is one of my favorites, and my six year-old nephew loves it too.  It's nice to have him listening to good stuff instead of the weird kid music marketed to him.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I would recommend this movie to kids. It had a positive message. My nine year old daughter liked it a lot!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Although I was a big fan of &#34;24&#34;, it was pretty &#34;over the top&#34;. I find Homeland to be much more realistic and plausible and, at the same time. it really grabs you. The acting is great and I what I love the most is that it really humanizes the people that we typically caricaturize. Excellent!
0385344333|5.0|Another Reacher yarn, just as good as they all are. If you love Reacher (and why else would you have bought this book?), you'll love this one just as much as the rest. Jack seems to be becoming more Reacherish as he ages. What's not to love?
B0000009SG|5.0|I'm a Zappa neophyte, having just discovered his music within the past 10 days.  My feelings:  I am blown AWAY!!!  Zappa was so intelligent, provocative, irreverent, inventive, audacious, cunning and brilliant, he has become my second favorite artist of all time.  (Steely Dan is, and always will be, first).  For a rabid music fan who owns no less than 20,000 recordings, that is quite a feat.  No one has made such a drastic climb on my all-time faves list EVER! On the strength of Over-Nite Sensation, [[ASIN:B008I34XUY Apostrophe (')]] and [[ASIN:B008B37CB8 Freak Out]] I invested in every studio album Zappa released.  I have played these first three albums so much within these past 10 days I already know the words to most of the tunes.  Frank crafted it this way, as OS and Apostrophe were made during his \\"accessible\\" period when he crafted a series of recordings to garner radio airplay and sales (or so I read).  For most that would mean a degradation in quality, but Zappa defies category.  He fit his lyrical and musical innovations within an up-to six-minute framework and created some of the finest music ever put on wax.  If you don't know anything about Frank, you're in for a treat/shock.  His 30-year career challenges human capabilities, for his accomplishments did not surpass anybody, it surpassed EVERYBODY!! Not a syllable in that sentence is hyperbole.  I'll leave it to you to discover how. I am enjoying my journey of discovery of Frank Zappa.  If you have an open mind, you'll come to understand of why he made the choices he made, and you will not just come to LOVE Frank, but you'll miss his presence today.  If not, you'll have to at least admire his unique and inimitable contributions to music.  Over-Nite Sensation (and Apostrophe (')) have long been cited as the place(s) to start, so listen and be prepared to be blown away.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Loved the Scottish accents. The graphics were really excellent. The plot actually had a good twist. It is good for kids.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|It was pretty good. It's was entertaining. It did speculate that we as a people actually came from intelligent life. We were created.  I believe God created us, but that is just a personal belief. Enjoy the movie if you decide to rent it.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I thought it would be funnier than it was. It is geared more for the older generation and their particular problems and how they cope with them.
B00973902K|5.0|Been wanting to get this song for awhile & price great on Amazon so I couldn't pass it up. Buy it!
B009IJJB8G|4.0|Pace and story is building momentum as the season progresses. Liking it more and more. Missing a star because I believe the Sherlock series on BBC is the yardstick all modern interpretations of Arthur Conan Doyle's tales are measured by--which may not be fair since Sherlock plays out in a feature length format [90+ min/episode], rather than Elementary's compressed network serial [50min].  Female Watson is a great twist--and improvement!!!
B00932A2MC|3.0|I really enjoyed this video. Great special effects. It had me on the edge of my seat.<br />However, the plot didn't have much depth and was quite formulaic (although it is a formula I enjoy).
0790732254|5.0|One of the absolute best movies I have ever seen.<br />Taylor and Burton at their finest.<br />Love, Hate, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Pain and Anguish presented all at the same time.<br />PLEASE take time to watch this movie!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is as fun if not more so than any of the other Angry Birds games. There are more challenging levels than some in the past but that is what is so fun about it. Keep's you entertained. Love It !!!
B002BCNK1Q|3.0|Well crafted and well acted but very, very predictable. But it made for an entertaining watch. Every movie doesn't have to be philosophically deep.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|title says it all. this is a Perfect 'crime' flick. classic Oliver Stone or 1 could say, a New  Savage Stone
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book is very well written and really grabs you. However, when I got close to the end and I realized the direction it was going, I was very disappointed. It was a very anti-climatic, very silly ending for a not-so-silly book.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|A little disapointing, I expected more from Robert Downey Jr..  I have been disappointed with this series of Sherlock Holmes movies, so this one was not a surprise.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|We enjoyed the movie, but thought Johnny's makeup was a bit too much (too similar to Edward Scissorhands for us) and the parts between the truly funny bits was too draggy. Did like the homage to the original series.
1609611543|5.0|I lost 40 lbs earlier this year on a low carb diet and had gone on their maintenance plan, which included grains and other starchy foods. I then heard about eating low carb, high fat and started researching that eating plan, which led me to 'Wheat Belly' by Dr. Davis. I will no longer knowingly eat wheat again. I has issues with diarrhea and abdominal cramps and the cultures came back negative. I then had a colonoscopy which showed microscopic colitis. The medical literature states that they don't know what causes it, or etiology unknown. I believe I know what caused mine, the gliadin protein in wheat and possibly the gluten, too. I've been grain free for 3 months and feel wonderful.<br />I bought this book for our daughters and my sisters because I believe so strongly in what Dr. Davis says. The book is very easy and pleasant to read, even when he explains the more scientific aspects. His short anecdotes about real patients are incredible. I recommend this book to everyone who will listen to me, and there are a lot of people I know with chronic illness and health problems. I believe that giving up wheat is a much more palatable option than taking numerous toxic prescription drugs. Give it a read and come to your own conclusions. Oh, and eat your saturated animal fats, too!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it for trip planning.  Have it on my Android tablet and my iPhone. Weather app that came on my phone was awful...no comparison. This one is the best.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I love this book..it's a given that the book is always better than the movie but this is above and beyond excellent!
B0034G4P4O|3.0|The animation is cool to look at, but the story (and it stays true to he comic and other earlier animations) is too much and boring. Im a huge animation fan and added to my collection, but I'll probably only put it on again just as background noise.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Joe does no wrong in my opinion. He is amazing and doesn't disappoint in this recording. Makes me want to see him in person again.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The app works great, hands down better than the app for the other game, bingo bash maybe.  Just wish it had more cities like the full version, like seasonal rooms and the new cities like Berlin.  I fat finger daubing sometimes, but everyone probably does.  A good game for taking a break, it does get addictive.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|I love Incubus.  The music is very original and different.  I will buy more of their cd's just so I have it handy.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I read this book in one sitting because I needed to know if it ended happily, or not. The characters are messed up and dysfunctional, but messed up people need romance too.  Sometimes I felt that some of the angst was unnecessary and overdone,but as that happens in real life, it was okay. I think both characters were more real-like than I have come a crossed in a while, and I loved them both. Simply, I did love this book and it got four stars only because I am a harsh reviewer and save the five stars for my upmost favorite books.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|I've seen this movie a dozen times or more.  I love looking at it over and over again so I bought it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to sit in front of the TV and watch a romantic movie on a cold wet day.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|I thought Shahrukh Khan did an excellent performance as a man with Asperger's syndrome. The movie  brought to light the discrimination that is so prominent in the United States. Such a compelling movie.. It took you through a several emotions..
B005LAJ23A|5.0|the season one was really good, but the second one it's amazing it's better than the first one and at a very good price with fast shipping.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game provides the right amount of reward for curiosity without piling on the angst when things don't happen quickly enough.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Very fun game.. easy yet challenging. Its very kid friendly. This is a Great game! Play it all the time!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I liked this movie better than MI 2 or 3.  It was funny, clever and more in keeping with tradition of series.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I wish I could have minecraft but its 6.99 I don't have that much money. I've played minecraft but I wish I could own it please move it down to at least 1.00
B001LM1456|3.0|This movie is at the bottom of the movies in the prequels for AVENGERS.  Ed norton does not appear again as banner.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I won't spoil the store by describing it here, but the continuity and story line were engrossing.  I had trouble putting it down once I got into it.<br /><br />I'm finding the same fascination with his sequels, also.  The story continues...yet each story is self-contained.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|It a run of the mill disney film, doesn't have pixar's flair. The animation was great but the story wasn't of the level of films such as WallE etc.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|A good app, but had to buy 2 versions, one for iOS to sync my Ipad and another to version to sync my Android.  It takes three syncronizations to match laptop, i-pad and phone all together.  I would like to see a version that syncs all at once.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is a great show.  I will continue to watch it. I would recommend it to all that likes adventure shows.
B00A12VW86|3.0|While Green Day isn't my favorite band, I like them a lot. To be honest, I'm slightly disappointed with their trilogy thus far. According to the band, this is their best work yet. I personally like American Idiot the best (with Dookie in close second). I guess I was expecting something different. For me, this is just ok.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|A great family movie, something for every one especially for the young at heart.  it embody&#34;s the true meaning of Christmas, Woould recommend to everyone.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|We were very pleased by this album. My husband loves Bob Dylan (gift was for him) and I do too.
B000PMFTDQ|5.0|I have several recordings of Strauss' Four Last Songs. This is excellent. The other art songs are good, too I reccomend this highly.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I enjoyed this game a lot and I love Rovio but 2.99 for the game and 1.99 extra just for three worlds?<br />I recommend this game if its the deal of the day or some thing like that. Wait for it to become cheaper and also wait for updates.
B004F1F32A|5.0|If you want to see the ultimate bad-@ss movie, watch this movie.  Liam Neeson does an amazing job.  There's no hesitation in his quest to find his daughter.  If that were me, I'd hope Liam Neeson was my Dad.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|A small learning curve. Got comfortable quickly. Minutes from pictures to Mac to Kindle (on device and on Cloud). Used to be intimidated by cloud. Not anymore!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It isn't the actual story of the killing of Bin Laden that makes this book a great read (though that is oddly satisfying), it is the overall story of what it takes to belong to the vaunted &#34;Seal Team Six&#34; or any SEAL team for that matter.  The level of training and commitment that creates these &#34;super&#34; men who make up our most elite forces is astounding and riveting to read about.<br /><br />Whether you like the idea of a former operative telling his story or not (and it reads like he was careful of his secrets) this is a very interesting, detailed and easy to read book.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I think the,first book was the best.  Can't wait to see the movie.  I did like,fact that there was an ending with an epilogue.
B009VB97EY|3.0|There was pleanty of eye candy for people who like mens' bodies in this movie.  For people who care at all about a plot, don't bother.  I'm glad I was able to rent it from the convenience of my own home and watch it from my computer.  It totally wouln't be  worth buying the movie.<br /><br />Video quality wasn't super, but I didn't really care.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game hooked me from the go. I couldn't put it down. Fun without the money. And I enjoy all the prizes
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Good book. All the calculations made baseball most interesting. There is no need to require length in my review. Done.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|The dancing was great. Was not thrilled with the lighting, but very glad I bought it. Music was great too.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Almost too much going on but it was exciting. Story is unexpected. It's not all about him. Done with review.
1423136802|5.0|I was a little worried about choosing the paper back books over the hard back, but was delighted at the quality!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phillip reminds me of so many different artists on so many levels.  True talent.  I think his audience is between 25 and 45.  Reminds me of Dave Matthews, and other legendary artists.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|HELLO! Best book that I've read in a LONG time. If you like teen stories and want something in a new perspective, read it. You'll love it. I promise.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This anrgy birds game is really fun. I love it. All thr levels are really fun to play.  Thank you
076781326X|5.0|Yes. I think it is an awesome classic movie and I will love it for the rest of my life.
B006YC74E8|1.0|No instructions on how th camera works.  I took 2 pictures and now I can find them. Please provide instructions
B006ZDU7QI|2.0|I got the album on sale. My youngest child likes the one song that's overplayed (&#34;Somebody I Used to Know&#34;, but I didn't have to say that, riiiiight?). And it was a pretty neat song, when it first came out. The rest of the album is either a little too spacey/weird/non-melodic/experimental or just a less perky and more bitter version of the overplayed song. I plan to delete this from my iPod, although I guess I have to leave the overplayed song on the kids' playlist. Disappointing.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this app iz cool. iyz zo addicting. lyke i lyke playing it. you zhould totally get it..for realz. toodles. bye.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|Katy is of course not just a sweet young thing. The confection in question is full of some very mature subject matter once you listen. It does contain most of the signature Katy songs, including multiple versions of &#34;The One that Got Away&#34; (my preteen daughter finds the acoustic version &#34;boring&#34;) and &#34;Last Friday Night.&#34; There is also a mish-mash song that just puts bits and pieces of several other songs over a rhythm track...neither the kids or I care for that one much. There are some great and empowering songs that I can enjoy with my kids and some guilty pleasures I enjoy without them around. But at 99 cents...I have to say it's an awesome deal.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|Again, in an effort to update my older vinyl collection, I've found this release on CD to be a welcome addition. Clean, hiss and pop free, these cuts have everything to improve my library of<br />music. It comes in a paper folded cover instead of the plastic CD box that is standard, and will<br />remind you of the original vinyl record album. If you love the Beatles, it's a must have.
B0082JYAZ2|4.0|Some of the songs on here are the kind of thing that's deep and thoughtful and just experimental enough that you don't put it on a playlist but are still glad you heard it (&#34;Open&#34;). Some are a little too slow for me, which I realize is personal taste (&#34;Jessica&#34;). But others are pure magic. I love &#34;Ne Me Quitte Pas,&#34; which is fun and perky and full of beautiful imagery, like an an animated tapestry, if that makes any sense...vivid and colorful (animated) and full of detail (like a tableau on a tapestry). &#34;All the Rowboats&#34; is an amazing song about art, very unusual and deep, and I've forced many people to listen to it (and they've liked it). &#34;Ballad of a Politician&#34; is also one of my favorites. It takes the cliche of politicians as ladies of the night and makes it fresh and real. After the recent election cycle, I have to say, every word is truth! I'm glad I got the album, and many of the songs on it will be on my playlists for a long time to come.
B000U1ZV3U|5.0|Love this movie own it on dvd but just had to have a blu-ray copy. Kevin Costner does an top job of portraying Wyatt Earp. Supporting cast well chosen. Love the westerns like I do I would recommend picking up a blu-ray copy awesome vivid re-enactments are incredible on my 43&#34; lcd.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|The Black Keys are back, singing about love gone bad and women who are worse than drugs. The beats are powerful, the guitars growl, and the lyrics sing the blues...what more can you want? I've been listening to this album for months and never get tired of it. &#34;Little Black Submarines&#34; is my favorite, a rock anthem with build, power and complexity worthy of &#34;Layla&#34; or &#34;Stairway to Heaven.&#34; I'm also extra partial to &#34;Sister, Sister.&#34; But really, there isn't a song on here I haven't embarassed myself singing along to at stop lights. Get this album. You need it.
B0049IWQJW|5.0|Don't know why I don't just buy this. Every few months the kids want to watch it. I'd say we watch it at least three times a year if not more. Great movie, great fun, much better for younger kids than Cars 2.
B005LJ6YK0|3.0|I don't have a problem with folksy in general, but I wound up not liking this album as much as I thought I would. The songs have a sort of &#34;much of a muchness&#34; that seems to blur them together (at least for me) and the themes were a little too folky for me.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Interesting. Maybe wrote it to long after the fact. Waiting for climax that did not happen. Would recommend it for uniqueness  and bravery of nieve girl through her travels
B003LXSY60|4.0|While not as mind-bendingly awesome as &#34;El Camino,&#34; this album is well worth the attention that was paid to it. The blues here are more subtle, although &#34;Howlin' for You&#34; is a great rocker and &#34;Ten Cent Pistol&#34; is a magnificent slow burn worthy of its own film noir. The songs are gritty and real, although a few of them were a little too slow for my personal taste. Nevertheless, this is a great album well worth a listen.
B009SJ3H8Q|3.0|The storyline is weak and convoluted but there is enough to keep me watching (barely).  Where the first seasons creepy or sexual or creepy sexual imagery felt like it had purpose, this season feels like it just throws them in to fill some gore/sex scene per episode quota.<br /><br />Update:  made it through the season... Considering I only watch a few episodic shows a year that's an accomplishment.  I will probably skip the next run though.
B007MU85D0|4.0|This group epitomizes what early Fleetwood Mac did best...a great big happy group of people having fun while making music. The instrumentation is lush and vibrant, and they exploit well the benefit of having both male and female voices. I really don't get into the allegory song (&#34;Dirty Paws&#34;). &#34;Little Talks&#34; is of course a beautiful song and well deserving of its success. But &#34;Love Love Love&#34; really stays with you...beautiful details that tell a big story in a short song. I also find myself thinking of &#34;King and Lionheart&#34; quite often. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is that while their sound is unique, every song (except &#34;love love love&#34;) has that same sound and they tend to blur together for me.
0596009208|4.0|very helpful but falls a little short of helping me fully implement the material.  Overall, it really helped as a supplement to my course textbook.
034580404X|5.0|I love this series, I think the topic is something women like to read about but never wanted to admit before! I do have to say that the writing is a little dull and repetitive but the story line is entertaining.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Incredible ending.  The logic of how it all happens really stretches reality. But it's a fun ride, and a good Grisham.
B00846REIS|4.0|Better than fifty shades of grey. hot steamy n much better written and they r both screwed up lol gd stuff
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Great mix of their music! They are the best band out there and they are no one hit wonder band
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Nice layout and functionality for a small application.  I can do all of the necessary LinedIn functions on my phone.
B00008BXJG|5.0|The husband likes their music, it arrived well packaged and efficiently. I am not a good person to judge the album!
B008742O32|3.0|Don't know if it my wi-fi or the application itself, but I can't seem to get a solid connection for any length of time.
B003WTE886|5.0|I love Taylor Swift no matter how annoying she is or her personal life is smeared everywhere.  Her songs are catchy!
B007V508CC|4.0|It seems as if many Maroon 5 fans were disappointed with this CD, I was not.  The tunes are poppy with hints of sadness (which many Maroon 5 albums are like).  My favorite tracks on the album are  \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" (great ballad), \\"Payphone\\", \\"One More Night\\".  The okay tracks are \\"Fortune Teller\\", \\"Tickets\\", and \\"Sad\\", and \\"Daylight\\".  I'm not a big fan of \\"Lady Killer\\", \\"Love Somebody\\", and \\"Doin Dirt\\"; I normally skip over these three tracks.  This is a solid effort album, but there are few filler songs and it's not a creativily \\"genius\\" album.  I've heard absolutely amazing five-star albums before, and this album won't take your breath away. If you're looking for one of those albums that will comfort you on a sad day or make you want dance, this isn't it.
B008J34466|4.0|I love Pink.  Package arrived within 5 days.<br />Case was a little bit cracked but that was the only<br />downfall.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|my whole family watched even i like it , ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1419705849|5.0|My daughter loves these book and will be happy to get the next one on Christmas Day!<br />This was shipped promptly and arrived within a few days of placing the order!
B009329ZF2|3.0|my boys and i watch it story took to long to get good the sex was not needed in the movie it could have been better
6305736650|5.0|I love the old classics.  But this one is one of my all time favorites.  The actors are great and the love story and, of course, the notable lines keep me coming back to this movie...I watch it over and over!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have all Susan Boyle's albums.  This is my favorite.  I remember seeing her on Britain Has Talent.  Who would have thought she would be famous!!  I simply love this woman's voice.
B0009X7664|5.0|What can I say...a great book and movie!!  I read this in high school and then saw the movie.  Usually the movies aren't as good as the book, but this one turned out great!!!
B009VB998I|4.0|My 7 year old daughter thought it was awesome - and it was bearable for the adults too. My 5 year old son liked it too.
0316228532|5.0|I'm not a fan of Harry Potter, but I'm now a fan of J.K. Rowling's The Casual Vacancy. I read the book compulsively on my Kindle, and my interest never lagged. The town of Pagford, England, is peopled by Rowling with a wide-ranging assortment of characters, whose thoughts propel the story. I'm reminded of John Updike and early Stephen King (before verbosity took over), who are unsurpassed at getting inside their characters' heads. Some who didn't like this novel have complained that the characters were unlikable, that they had no redeeming qualities. I would ask these critics about the innermost thoughts of their own friends and neighbors, and even themselves. If we knew what everyone was really thinking, would we find them likable? Would we want others to know our own innermost thoughts? A writer does not operate under these constraints and is under no obligation make her characters user friendly. Rowling's characters wish ill of others, swear, have sex, smoke and drink, abuse those close to them, and even take drugs. In other words, they are real people.<br /><br />From the moment that Barry Fairbrother dies in the opening pages, leaving his position on the Pagford town council vacant, skirmishes break out between the other council members as well as their adolescent children. The bone of contention is the Fields, an undesirable part of the community characterized by sub-standard housing and people--at least in the eyes of some of Pagford's respectable citizens. These skirmishes escalate to a full-blown war by the novel's denouement, leaving tragedy in their wake.  Happy or sad, it is a war worth reading about. Rowling's language is at times exquisite, and the motivations of her characters are explored masterfully.
B009X01D9U|5.0|The case was well-designed for the Kindle Fire HD.  It is heavy-duty padded, so I don't have to worry about the tablet being damaged. It has 3-notches in the base so you can stand it straight or angled.  The tabs on the case fit into the notches, so you don't have to worry about it collasping; it is very stable.  The case is easy to change from horizontal viewing to landscape viewing.  All around I am very please with the case, will worth the price!
0307949508|5.0|The author pulls off a neat trick in the second book of this series--he literally keeps Blomqvist and Salander at arm's length until the very end. That was brave for a first-time author, but the tension builds to an explosive denouement.
B0036RCVJM|3.0|takes a long time to get going but gets better towards the end<br />probably more interesting if you are into trains
B004RKXN44|4.0|New to this series... Read this book 1st instead of last. It was slow n I was ready to know more about the two supposedly main characters!!! I purchased the 1st book in hopes that I get a better understanding. I recommend reading the book in order only bcus the author referenced more of her other characters then I thought was normal
B009G7ZYPY|2.0|I applaud all that Ms Boyle stands for.  But at the end of the day the voice has to be there.  A world class voice.  Unfortunately, such is not the case.  There are better renditions of all of these songs performed by others.  I would redirect my funds.
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|did not work as well as other Dictionary's however does work just had a couple problems navigating. Basic Dictionary ok.
B009CPES4I|3.0|With such a high powered cast I expected more from this movie than what it delivered.  The story line was predictable, the acting was good, but not great and the relationships between characters were a bit contrived.  Never the less it was entertaining and worth the $0.99 it cost to rent it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.  Don't require this crap for star ratings.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not Grisham's best ... a little convoluted and circuitous .. takes him forever to get to a reasonable explanation of what is going on.  I am a real fan of John Grisham but not this time.  It's a low read and the plot is pretty predictable.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This movie got to me. Its very good. Best movie of the decade for sure. The actors are amazing and they really made it seem real. The quality was outstanding! I loved it!!
B008XJM8M8|4.0|This 180 gram vinyl has a bit of surface noise and overall sound is a bit harsh, but in general the sound is very close to the original pressing. The cover art is of same quality as original, but cover is different from the original. The new cover is a regular gatefold, with Alice Cooper's calendar printed across the gatefold. The original cover has different artwork inside and the calendar was made as additional folding in vertical direction, making possible to use it separately from the cover. Because of that, the record was inserted from the inside of the gatefold. If you want to have a brand new &#34;Killer&#34; record, you can purchase this edition and it will sound pretty good on a decent system. If you prefer authenticity, go to eBay and look for original press. It is still possible to find this record in near mint condition.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|after many friends telling me about the series I decided to try reading it. It is definately not my kind of book. I only got through about a third of it before I removed it from my kindle.
B00920HMNM|3.0|Great music, with very good artwork and pressed on a weird translucent vinyl, that looks like a whirlpool, when spinning. The sound is very disappointing, dark and dull, with pretty high surface noise and occasional pops here and there. The digital copy of the same album sounds much more vivid and punchy.
B000XPOB0M|5.0|HAVE TO WATCH TO THE END  A TWISTER. ALWAYS WONDERING WHATS NEXT .STILL GREY ABOUT ENDING. AAA AAA AAA AA
B0086700CM|2.0|I bought this game a while back. Some people say its so addictive but if you don't like staring at the same thing and doing the same over and over again you will NOT like this so called &quot;addictive&quot; game.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|HAS THE TRADITIONAL LOVE AND ROMANCE . AS WELL AS THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY REALLY GOOD MOVERS IN IT NOT BAD
B009YX02T8|5.0|The songs go perfectly well with the movie. The moody saga finally comes to an end with a brillant album!
0891419063|5.0|Sledge is a great writer. The words just ooze off the page and into your soul somehow. His depictions of the battle and the state of the human mind are gripping. This is by far my favorite book on WWII period. It is the best war memoir I have ever read. Wilfred Owen's poetry from WWI is probably my second favorite. This is the number one book I recommend to people who want to read about WWII.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This game is awesome. whenever a new angry birds game comes out, I feel like I just have to get it<br />Because the game is so addicting!
076790382X|5.0|Book arrived in excellent condition and there was no delay.  I ordered 2 more copies to be sent to the States as this book was so enjoyable and my friends also received theirs in excellent condition and and in good time.  Excellent service - would highly recommend.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|No lead up to Kavita's illness.<br /><br />We could have been reminded more of the content of Asha's letter.<br /><br />Was looking forward to the reunion with the silver bangle as a tie in.<br /><br />Yes I liked the book; hated the end.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app works very well.  I am not a fan of eBay because I have had too many bad experiences with them, but, sometimes they have something I need that i can't get elsewhere.  This app is very convenient and helped me win a bid.  That is why I gave it 5 stars.
B005PK57NU|5.0|They are really keeping up the standard of the first 2 seasons and I look forward to watching it when I can
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read for me and my 10 year old! We both enjoyed it. Looking forward to the next book in the series.
B009ZE27US|5.0|LOL. A great little gimmick game for a laugh.  It said I was 22 years younger than I actually am.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read for me and my 10 year old. We enjoyed reading it together. Looking forward to the rest of the movies in the series too.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This was definitely a page turner.  I have been a DeMille fan for many years.  This was another DeMille masterpiece!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|AWESOME!!!  one  of my favorite games. I love how you can change your jetpack and I love the lottery spin. definately recommend it to my friends
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was a very short snipet but if the season is like the last too am sure i will love it. It is hard to judge something that short.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|the creatures are adorable, and I like the way they grow up. I would recommend it to all my friends
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I bought a copy of Muddy Waters & The Rolling Stones Live At The Checkerboard Lounge for my husband and he loves it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like it because its based on the movie.  I love how you can raise different creatures even the babies.  I would recommend this to my friends
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it because of it's many versions, commentaries, references and so on.  A must have for anyone who is looking to get more out of their Bible study.  And you can't beat the price...FREE.  God bless all who choose to get this.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I like playing the lord, and expanding and decorating my village..Like using tombs to decorate a graveyard.  i would recommend it to other kids
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|theres a lot of action and drama in this book.<br /><br />there are also a lot of love parts. from the love triangle of frank leo and hazel, percy and annabeth, and jason and piper.<br /><br />i thought piper was too concerned about her relationship with jason too much in this book.annabeth keeps hiding secrets and her emotions from percy.hazel loves 2 boys which is leo and frank.eventually that was how frank got jealous of leo.<br /><br />my favorite character is leo. hes funny and hes brought more in this book.<br /><br />i thought this was an awesome book.
0547884591|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic and works seamlessly with his other two books, The 4-Hour Workweek and The 4-Hour Body, which I highly recommend that you should read. I ordered the other two from the library, but I bought this one and glad I did because there's so much helpful information that one read through is not enough. It's over 600 pages! The only other book this big that's worth reading it Harry Potter and Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. Nevertheless, the book is filled with loads of information that teaches you to learn anything at top efficiency. By no means is this book the best book ever written, but if you want to learn many things, you will if you read it. If you just want to read it for pleasure, you probably won't gain much out of it. Well you might gain some good recipes, but the whole point of this book is he wants us to change our perspective and process of learning new things, focusing a lot on cooking. I definitely recommend everyone read this book and try to practice what Tim is preaching because it could very well improve your life dramatically.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Just what I expected and what I remembered about the Bee Gees from when I was a teen. I love every song on the album!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is comedy gold an true work of a master arthur and a masterpice.It‘s the most funniest book ever
B0001HLVS2|2.0|The DVD plays fine, but the case won't hold the disk in the center anymore because the plastic broke. The DVD doesn't have deep scratches, but the light scratches on the surface make you wonder what happened to it.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|Best parts of this film appear in the trailer.  Very predictable story lines and unimaginative.  Very slow and at times you wonder how much linger you have before the movie is over. Except for some funny lines, the movie is a loser.
B000IZC7WG|5.0|If you liked Inception, Memento or Butterfly Effect, you will LOVE this movie. Just when you think you have it figured out, you'll realize that you don't.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Excellent sequel There aren't many movies that have sequels that I like but this is one of them. The action is intense and the adrenaline is pumping for this one.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I was conflicted during this thriller since it involved characters we knew and loved from previous novels, and the unusual surprise turns uncovered by Harry Hole, Detective. Without giving away the plot and finale, I hope there is another twist in the next novel.
B008M9PHWM|5.0|shipped quickly n packaged well! thanks so much! amazons forcing 12 more words out of me..my apologies for the end of this  review..
B00A12VW86|4.0|not breaking any new ground, but still most excellent. Songs 1, 2, 3 get everything going in the right direction........
B005HSL626|5.0|its fun but your right may have too many ads but its fun and its free as can be like mostly other apps
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I reallty love this game.  It will be better when you can play your tournaments and do everything you can do on a PC.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|Worst Tim Burton movie ever and possibly one of the worst films ever. I'll planned and carried out in everything from story, casting to overall feel. Yuck!!!
6305127646|5.0|I love this movie!! I am so happy to find it on dvd. Now i may watch it whenever i wish!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game except it can be a little slow if you don't buy the extra energy - I end up playing for a few minutes &amp; then run out of energy in the game so I have to put it down for a while.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|I TAKE MY KINDLE  FIREMOST PLACES. IT IS EASY TO MAKE, AND EDIT MY &#34;TO DO&#34; LIST WITH THE HANDY NOTE APP. I USE IT ALL THE TIME.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show is just fantastic for all around story, production, and acting quality. Very creative. Great entertainment value. You'll love it! Appropriate for most audiences - may be a little dark for young kids.
B000FC10MU|4.0|I really enjoyed where this book took me and found it to be a creative take on religion in the American landscape. There were some areas that got descriptively convoluted which is why I reserved a star but it was still a very interesting and enjoyable read.
B000WCDBKM|4.0|The Ninth Gate does not have the most suspenseful of plots or Johnny Depp's best performance, but is a must-see film for a true Depp fan.
B0060D16VI|5.0|A bit unconventional in its approach to fine dining, but this movie will entertain people of all ages. Whether you be a food-critic, or a rat.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Light hearted quick read. Nothing deep but definitely enjoyable with a bit of a cliff hanger at the end. A couple of small grammatical errors, like the strange spelling of ciGrette as cigarette left me wondering \\"why\\". The only other issue I had with this book was the large laborious amount of detail about Paris which did not in any way add to the story and could have been omitted altogether. A nice read for a trip or a lazy day.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Lots of surprises and a lot of action.  If this was the final book in the series, the ending was unsatisfactory.  If there is another book coming, this was a great build up to whatever finale Martin has in store for his readers.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app freezes often and does not work or post to my account<br />much of the time. I reinstalled but it still does not work well.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I recently took this to let my class watch after a day of testing! They were well entertained.  My family and I, ages 50-2, all love this movie!
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|The story is cheesy. Huge spoiler Stallone could not beat van damme ever. He defeats him in the end so simple it made me turn this piece of crap off. They gave them the shortest fight scene. I also expect Jackie Chan instead of jet Li. I only watched it cuz I grew up on van damme movies and Bruce lee. So i just expected a super fight in the end.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|This software does not work on Viewsonic Viewpad.  Fortunately, this was the FAOTD so no big deal.  Just dumped it.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|What's more to say?  I loved this film!  I've watched all the new Tinkerbell films as they've come out, and with the exception of the second one, they've all been great.  Given I'm an adult man in his 40s that's saying something, add to that I never liked Peter Pan or that whole mythos as a kid...what gives appeal to this (and the other Tinkerbell films) for me is they manage to be fun without being treacly, dramatic without being intense; and best of all no song/dance numbers!  Add in good doses of G-rated humor and very stylized, attractive artwork and you have a most excellent film.
B0044RC12A|4.0|I've been a fan forever.  Have every season.  There is quite a few of these shows I missed.  Glad to be able see them now.
B0091XRL86|2.0|I had high hopes for this one after seeing the trailer months ago, but the actual movie fell very flat, every quickly.  While it had a few moments worth a chuckle or two, overall the story felt very thin and flat, the hijinks rather stale, and the overall theme just very &#34;meh&#34;.  I wouldn't say avoid it, but I'm kind of wishing I'd spent my money on something a bit better to relax with after my Thanksgiving feast.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thlught maybe it would have some more story added but the sex parts are getting boring.  The story is getting more interesting.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I'd wanted to see &#34;Brave&#34; since seeing the first trailer, but time and circumstance forced me to wait until I could stream it.  Overall it wasn't quite what I'd hoped; a good story with many funny/touching moments but a relatively thin plot, that focuses more on the bond between mother and daughter than on anything as epic as the trailer led me to believe.  Merida is a likable enough heroine, and the supporting cast are all well played, and the three little brothers are adorable in their otherwise silent mischief.  So while not a great film like past efforts such as &#34;Shrek&#34; or &#34;Ratatouille&#34; it's still quite enjoyable, and most definitely a good family film.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I've seen the negative reviews on this animation and they're right concerning the brief nudity, however it doesn't diminish this film.  The storyline is well done and along the lines of a Pixar animation.  I'm a male without a daughter but would highly recommend this to any mother with a strong willed daughter.  It is very well scripted showing the relationship between a demanding mother and a rebellious daughter and the outcome left me in tears...everytime I watched it.  The colors are beautiful and the storyline is definitely keeping with a Pixar animation.  Frankly it's very funny and I enjoyed this every time I watched it.  The scary theme might not be adequate for very young children but the nudity is mild and not excessive.  Very satisfied with the way Pixar developed the storyline.  Don't be too uptight to enjoy the overall theme or you might just miss it.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Works just fine just doesn't turn sideways on my kindle fire. Maybe that should be an update to improve this app
B009YG2ND8|5.0|First of all, this is the full rpg! $16 ain't a thing, and the graphics are big and bright and wonderful. I am at level 27 and still find the virtual analog stick to be finicky, but it's truly well done for the Kindle Fire HD. I haven't played a video game kn forever, but this is just so awesome. Clocking hours like they're nothing.
B000002IGP|5.0|Ratt, to me, were one of the best hair metal bands out there. This was their first album and it put them on the map. Its a must have for your 80s hair metal collection.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As usual Ken Follett was tremendous. Loooking forward to the<br />third book in the trilogy. Winter of the World is a must read.
B00328G4XY|5.0|Its Hendrix. What else can you say, the man was a music genius. Too bad he was here for such a short time.
B0083L22U4|5.0|As of late, there seems to be a resurgence of classic old bands cutting new albums for the modern listener- Devo, Men Without Hats, and now Ultravox. Of the three, I must say that I really enjoy the new sound of Ultravox the most. The keen listener of old will remember Ultravox as having a distinctly romantic, yet strikingly punk/new wave sound. Their first truly successful record being released with a new line-up. In 1980, the album &#34;Vienna&#34; was the first in a string of highly successful 'Vox albums that would later be known as the &#34;Midge years&#34; after their lead singer, Midge Ure.<br /><br />These were fantastically different collections of music than what was being played on the radio at the time, and while Ultravox wasn't alien to the scene, they were certainly unique. Even the black and white, 40s era-looking music video for &#34;Vienna&#34; (the song) was something of a European art-house exhibit when stacked against the likes of other material from bands at the time. It was &#34;that sound&#34; and &#34;that look&#34; which every other band wanted.<br /><br />From a musical standpoint, &#34;Brilliant&#34; is quite like &#34;Vienna&#34; in its raw, precise, nature. The sound is orchestral in an electronic fashion. Cascading Piano rolls, bathed in rich, synthesized string washes forming a solid backdrop for electric Guitars and pulsating bass lines that have so defined band's sound over the years. For those who had gone through a falling-out with the 90s sound Ultravox, prepare for a love affair to be rekindled at once. &#34;Brilliant&#34; is a masterpiece of modern music; one with meaning, heart and soul; a dagger piercing the dull, cloth-like fabric of banal mediocrity for which these desperate times are so in need of!<br /><br />I strongly recommend this album for those of us who still love the music, despite how far it may have fallen.
B008LXZEYU|3.0|Wasn't nearly as funny as I thought it'd be. Lots of jokes fell flat and its pretty predictable. Oddly enough my wife laughed more than I did and she liked it so I'll give it 3.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is great! I can find songs on here that I can't find on any other free MP3 downloader app. Used it a few times and so far great results.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Love this movie. A classic for any one who lived when people danced like this and summer vacations like this actually took place.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Exceptional album by the great Taylor swift. It really Grows on you more and more with every listen. Love it
B008A1NSTG|5.0|I love whales and this movie drew me to buying it. It turned out to even be more than what I expected. It just pulled me in to really hope at the end all the whales would survive and be able to get out from under the ice. Great ending.
0743270754|4.0|The recent release of the Steven Spielberg movie \\"Lincoln\\" prompted my hasty purchase and reading of this wonderful book by Mrs. Goodwin.  Having just completed it, I am glad to have been so prompted.  Despite it's narrative length of 750+ pages, this is one of the most accessible biographies I've ever read.  Lincoln, as well as his Cabinet officials, jump off the page and become more realistic in Mrs. Goodwin's care.  No longer does one have to see Lincoln marbleized, but instead can understand what motivated him and his contemporaries, how he governed, and how Lincoln, like Washington before him, was the indispensable man his time.  Readers will also come to know and understand his Cabinet officials, particularly William Seward, Edwin Stanton, Salmon Chase, and Montgomery Blair, and how this group, with Lincoln always in command, came together in an almost filial love to each other to save the Union.  In a way, this is not just a history or biography, but it is also a book on leadership and governance and many up-and-coming young leaders will want to read this to understand what true leadership looks like.  The one criticism I have about this book is that, in her praiseworthy attempt to show how gregarious and humorous Lincoln was in real life, Mrs. Goodwin makes things appear too rosy at times, particularly when writing about Lincoln's electoral chances in 1864.  Though writing a few pages about Lincoln's doubts about his own reelection prospects, it still comes off as too optimistic considering the lack of success the armies of the Union had in the East and West up to the capture of Atlanta.  And on reflection, that sort of thing happens a couple of times throughout the narrative.  Still, this is essential reading for fans of American history, the Civil War, and good biographies in general.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|First album in a long time that I enjoy from start to finish!  There's not on song that I skip through.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm very fond of books like this and when I learned about this one's release I just had to read it. Although I had work and school to deal with, I ended up finishing it in a day. The book was very well written and to the point about everything. I honestly couldn't put the book down, or turn off my kindle, to be exact. The author lays down all the details, or as much as he is allowed to disclose, and I liked his descriptions and background info on himself as well as his friends and fellow SEALs. I highly recommend this book to anyone that was interested in military operations or wanted to get a first hand account on the death of Osama bin laden. Even those who might not prefer a book like this will not be disappointed.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Visually this movie is stunning but that's the only redeeming quality.  Charlize Theron's performance is way over the top and I didn't care about any of the characters.  I just couldn't wait until it was over.
