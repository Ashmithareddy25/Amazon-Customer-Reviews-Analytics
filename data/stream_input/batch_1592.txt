B008XG1X18|5.0|happy that they finally have this for my kindle fire.  it's. super easy to use, I just wish they had the &quot;pin it&quot; thingy in the toolbar or something so that I wouldn't have to download every picture I want to pin and some times it force closes but other than that it's great and I love it!

B005LAIHPE|2.0|I give this movie 1000 stars for it's fantastic CG effects.  Akin to Transformers and the multi-gun canons that appear out of the alien ship, the various gadgets popping out of the alien space suits reminds you of \\"Iron Man\\" and how Downey Jr. maneuvers his suit. It is all so visually appealing you completely forget everyone of the actors.  Except Alexander Skarsgård, who unfortunately dies instead of his arrogant brother Taylor Kitsch who is fantastic in John Carter, but who's bad guy, joker guy and Officer in the Gentleman take on Navy Officers falls short of delivery in this Sci-Fi flick.  Taylor come back as John Carter or Gambit.  The Aliens are perfect in the since they didn't take them to the extreme.  They are much like us and how maybe we could have looked or may look in a million years from now. Another viewer wrote how Rihanna was \\"VERY good\\" with her acting skills; I wonder what movie he saw...... it couldn't have been this one since her take on being Petty Officer Cora Raikes is her trying to be Dirty Harry in a bad wig ..... just plain ridiculous.  She was ineffective and like what we all wish cancer was .....benign. All she did in what was too much time on screen, was run around the ship going no where and push a button now and then.  I especially like the parts when she's the one pulling grown Navymen off the ground after they had to fight, as if it's her getting them out of the frey, saving there life. A FANTASTIC SINGER and performer in everyway... just NOT IN CINEMA!  Then there's Liam Neeson, while his screen time is even shorter than Skarsgård he just stands there saying nothing and commands everyone's attention as much as the Aliens.... he just can not be bad. It's mindless fun and while it is so very slow in the first 20 minutes, once the Aliens arrive it's fantastic entertainment......... until they are destroyed then back to oh so boring.  Not enough bang for your buck, wait till it's on sale.

0345404475|5.0|Blade Runner is my favorite film; I first saw it in a Classics class as the story of Roy Batty paralleled legend of Achilles. I actually heard a lot of negative things about the novel it was loosely based on, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" Many reads told me that the author, Philip K. Dick, was a poor writer with brilliant and trippy ideas. After reading \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,\\" I respectfully disagree. While Philip K. Dick's philosophy and ideas were more compelling than his writing, he was a very talented writer and this novel deserves high praise. Is it radically different than the film? Yes but they both paint fantastical future worlds with different themes and epiphanies for the characters. There are many exciting facets of Blade Runner that are absent in the novel, but the novel features unique intrigue such as the sub-culture of \\"chickenheads\\" and the propaganda of \\"Buster Friendly and His Friendly Friends,\\" which are unique. Blade Runner is future film noir while this novel is more of a meditation during a man's middle life crisis in a wasteland. I think the novel and film should be appreciated on their own terms; one cannot read this novel hoping it will be very similar to the famous adaption.<br /><br />The novel takes place in a futuristic world where the fallout of a nuclear holocaust has made much of the planet uninhabitable and the global population fragmented. The protagonist, Rick Deckard, lives in the San Francisco area, which is less affected by radiation than most of the world. Mankind has advanced in space travel allowing for off-world colonies that only the wealthy or well-skilled can live luxuriously. The poor, working-class, sickly and unfortunate remain on polluted Earth. Rick Deckard, a reluctant bounty hunter, makes a living hunting down outlawed robotic-humans called androids. Androids are nearly human in every way except their making and lack of human emotions especially empathy. Like many humans still on Earth, he is obsessed with superficial consumerism, particularly the status symbol of animals since the nearly extinct creatures are so incredibly expensive. Many middle class people buy electric versions of animals as a cover for appearing to have an actual, much-coveted pet. As his distant wife becomes hooked on electronic, emotional transmitters called empathy boxes, Deckard faces an existential crisis as he hunts down androids including a rebelling new group as well as searching for inner peace.<br /><br />As Deckard is assigned the task of hunting various androids who are illegally on Earth and are either in hiding secretively or hiding in plain sight by assuming human identities. Androids are treated as unwanted contraband on Earth and as slaves on the off-world colonies. The lack of feelings by androids leaves them to coldly cruel acts at time, such as when they pluck the legs off a spider just to see what will happen to it. One of Deckard's tasks involves testing a suspected android through interrogation using a physiological detector called the Voigt-Kampff machine. This turns out to be a trap by a corporative competitor who wishes to fool people into believing that the Voigt-Kampff produces faulty results and is not reliable.<br /><br />Deckard is further sidetracked at one point when he is brought into a bizarre, almost unreal police station where he is interrogated and accused of being an android himself, which could be possible since newer models of androids often had false memories installed unbeknownst into them. He later surmises that this surreal office must have been a set-up run by androids. The sometimes sociopathic personalities of his fellow bounty hunters as well as the brutal nature of the job leads Rick Deckard to ponder what difference is there between his current self and the empathy-less androids he hunts.<br /><br />Deckard continues to obsess materialistically over finding a deal for buying livestock, even if he could not afford it. Deckard findsoccasional inspiration in his esoteric New Age religion, Mercerism, which guides him to the climax of his philosophical and spiritual journey where he speaks to what appears to be the prophet Wilbur Mercer. Mercer's specter warns Deckard of the hypocrisy of people, the world and Mercerism as well as letting him know that Mercer is not human. When Deckard realizes that one of the escaped androids whose partners he killed sought revenge by killing his pet rather than dazed wife; he realizes the cheapness of material possessions. The novel's most prevalent theme is accepting somber knowledge over ignorant bliss; the ability to appreciate the reality of the situation even if you wish it were not so. This is demonstrated at the very end when Deckard spots a toad, Mercer's patron (and now-extinct) animal, but finds acceptance in knowing that it is electric.<br /><br />Philip K. Dick's novel provides insight on what people can act like without empathy and our relationship with reality while painting a fantastic portrait of a bizarre, dangerous world of the future. The sub-culture of chickenheads in a desperate wasteland is interesting but the fictional religion of Mercerism, complete with a self-admitted false prophet, is fantastic in its fascinating possibilities. The emphasis on empathy and shared experiences of suffering blends and ties together the morality of caring and the immorality of sadism. Deckard's epiphany is paired with a brilliant and wise message from Mercer, one that highlights the insight Philip K. Dick had on the human condition, from the fact that salvation does not exist:<br /><br />\\"You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. At some time, every creature which lives must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work, the curse that feeds on all life. Everywhere in the universe.\\"<br /><br />Is this true of our existence?

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is a must read.  I loved all 3books.  This is the best series of books I have ever read.  The story was good and captivating.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|The book started out with an interesting story.  However, it became mundane and tried to philosophise by using a parable-type of story with confusing sentiments, working in circles around what the writer was trying to espouse.  I grew tired of it before the end, but was reading it for my book club.

B008RTE09S|4.0|This film was a stinkin mess when it was aired. My Dad made better home movies. And who knew it would be followed up by a chronicle of their break up? Among the many points categorically established, however, was that as a band, they were quickly becoming Paul's back up guys. The walrus was indeed Paul. As Ringo stated in the Harrison film, he and Lennon were always hiding from being called into the studio, and George took their absence to find the time he needed to explore and assemble tunes that would be rejected by L & M and then form the core of All Things. Harrison was finding the backbone to pursue his own interests as well and was learning how to keep Lennon & McCartney at arm's length.<br />They were a band and a business without a manager at this point, less than fully committed to marshalling on, and yet, for all that, the tunes they came up with were brilliant, musically, sonically and technically. It was a time when they were re-writing how to score a number 1 hit. To that end, this is mostly an extended and sloppy series of music videos.<br />I have the usual prurient interest in seeing the bits that were left out, but more importantly, hearing the music in blu-ray. The film can't help but be better having been re-authored for blu-ray, but it will be the enhanced depth and detail of great songs, at least from my youth, that will carry the day. Sure, it's a guilty pleasure, but even their nadirs were the sort of high points other bands dream of achieving. Let's all get up and dance to a tune...
0062073486|5.0|This was the first Agatha Christie book that I had ever read and I absolutely loved it. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down until the end.<br /><br />The story was written in a smart way, the characters were varied and credible and the suspense became more and more  claustrophobic as I was getting closer to the end, a genius, completely unexpected, but very logical end.<br /><br />The plot is based on a song with puerile, funny lyrics on the basis of which more and more shocking crimes are being committed:<br />Ten little Indian boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine./Nine little Indian boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight./Eight little Indian boys travelling in Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were  seven./Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six./Six little Indian boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five./Five little Indian boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four./Four little Indian boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three./Three little Indian boys walking in the Zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two./Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one./One little Indian boy left all alone; He went and hanged himself and then there were none.<br /><br />Ten persons - Philip Lombard (ex-soldier), Vera Claythorne (ex-governess), General Macarthur, Emily Brent (\\"an elderly woman\\"), Doctor Armstrong, Tony Marston (a rich young man),  William Blore (a retired police inspector), Thomas Roger and his wife (cooks) and the Judge Wargrave - are tricked into coming onto a deserted island, near Devon, by someone called U.N.

038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is arguably Vonneguts greatest work, although I haven't read them all.  It's about the end of the world, and starts on the anniversary of the end of the world for the Japanese, the day the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.<br /><br />Our protagonist, Jonah, is writing a book about the end of the world.  He ends up interviewing the offspring of the father of the atom bomb, Dr. Felix Hoenikker, an eccentric, seemingly uncaring father who, unbeknownst to most, also makes \\"Ice Nine\\" before he dies.  Ice Nine causes everything to freeze.  It precipates the end of the world.<br /><br />Before Ice Nine takes over, and freezes the world, Vonnegut takes us on a whirlwind tour of the hearts and minds of a slew of zany characters, from Newt the midget, son of The Father of The Atom Bomb, to a secretary who disdains anyone who \\"thinks too much,\\" to a philanthropist who turns out to be the complete opposite, to a zillion others (almost too many) in between.  We are taken to the island of San Lorenzo, a Carribean banana republic run by a paranoind, eccentric dictator that is totally at the beck and call of the USA, and that is where things really get weird.<br /><br />This book is divided into 127 very short chapters, which makes it not only easier to read and remember, but also made it easier, I'm sure, for Mr. Vonnegut to write.<br /><br />One of the main points of this story, if I understand correctly, is that religion, in this case \\"Bokonism,\\" is pretty much a hodge-podge/hocus-pocus bed of spectacular lies.  In the end, the founder of Bokonism, Bokonen, admits himself that it was all a complete joke, not to be taken sersiously (how can anyone take seriously a religion where people make love by rubbing their feet together?), but I won't spoil it by telling you what happens in between.<br /><br />Mad scientists and their nervous secretaries, midget kung-fu, foot sex, countless hungry, skinny, stupid natives, one beautiful, \\"healthy\\" native, fat businessmen here to save the world, steep jungles, waterfalls, underground bomb shelters, earthquakes, tornadoes, fire and brimstone (don't tell Vonnegut I said that), horse faced flute playing enfent terribles, and much, much more.  Oh, and I almost forgot.  Ice Nine.

I purchased the audio version and am completely disappointed.  After listening to the many references back to Brian Tracy, felt used.  They are just selling each others material.  There was one time I tracked the time it took them to explain the benefit of momentum - 10 minutes - should of been done in 2.  Tells stories of himself and how he works on his relationship with his wife - goes on forever without ever getting to the point, because there is no point.  He treats the symptoms not the cause.  No matter if it your golf coach, marriage counselor, or business mentor you need the fundamentals.  If you had a golf slice, he would have you aim differently vs helping you with the basic fundamentals.  Invest in Napoleon Hill's Law of Success before this.

The main characters are so relatable in fact, that you get caught up and it feels like you're experiencing the events along with them. It brings you through tough times and happy times, and in the end it shows younger generations that no matter what they're going through in life, they can always overcome their obstacles. The book really challenges you to think positive in every situation you go through from there on out. I saw the movie, and although it couldn't have been more fantastic and now one of my favorites, you should all see it but read the book first! As in any situation reading the book will always be a greater experience. I was lucky enough to meet the author of the book, and he's a wonderful, talented, smart, all around nice guy.

0345803485|1.0|Okay, I originally vowed not to read this, as I heard it was terrible.  But long story short, a friend of mine made me promise to read it, so unfortunately I did.  Wow.  This was one of those times where I wanted to find the author and demand a refund of my wasted money and lost brain cells. I don't know how this book ever got published, let alone the popularity.  You'd think it was the first erotic novel ever published.<br /><br />Okay, I'll talk about the erotica first.  If you want to read about sex, there are SO MANY other books out there that are better - better written and with better sex scenes.  I don't read romance novels, but I'm sure there are plenty of bodice-busters that will float your boat.  And if you want super steamy stuff, there are plenty of those available as well.  I understand that part of the appeal of this book is that you can read it covertly on an e-reader.  Well, you can do that with most books these days.  Look up \\"erotica\\" in the Kindle store and you will have enough reading for a lifetime.  Or just Google it; there is plenty of erotica for every interest to read online for free.<br /><br />Then there's the writing, both the sex and the rest.  It's awful.  The sex scenes seem cut-and-pasted.  As for the non-sex stuff (which is most of it), it sounds as if it is written by a teenager - a young teenager at that.  Granted, the protagonist is a college student and I assume the author is trying to sound young.  But it reads like a Young Adult novel, which is fairly annoying if you're, say, an adult.  Worse, it's kind of creepy because you feel like some kid is telling you about their weird sexual exploits.<br /><br />As for the plot (and by \\"plot,\\" I mean that stuff in between the sex scenes), it's, well, again very YA.  You might enjoy it if you're a young teen girl.  As for the characters' relationship, it's just terribly unbelievable.  Here's this young, inexperienced girl - who is a virgin nonetheless - and she throws herself into this S&M relationship with an older, rather unusual man.  It's all pure fantasy.<br /><br />If you're reading it just for the sex (you know, skipping all the \\"other\\" stuff), you will be at somewhat of an advantage, since the \\"plot\\" and non-sex writing is terrible and would appeal mostly to young teen girls.  However, you will also be disappointed, because you will see how the sex scenes are all pretty much the same.  Honestly, I can't see much of anything positive to say about this book.<br /><br />If a middle school girl made a porno, this is what you'd get.  I can't imagine a man reading this, no matter how much sex was in it.  The immature writing would be too annoying.  Plus, I think guys are better at finding hot stuff to read.  Apparently women aren't, or they would find much better places to read it than this terrible thing.<br /><br />If I could give it negative stars, I would.&M relationship with an older, rather unusual man.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I am an artist and a business owner. My business is my art, and my art is my business. I'm in a very different line of work than Jiro, yet I was inspired so much by this movie to stay true to the artistic integrity of my work, despite the many other pressures of being in business.<br /><br />I feel there is too much attention and reverence in America on business owners who have dumbed down their art for the sake of profit and \\"success.\\" The current paradigm in the world of American business education is that one must either be working \\"in\\" the business, producing its products and services, or the one running the business, behind the scenes - with the latter the obvious choice for which is encouraged. Businesses like MacDonald's these days are hailed as the epitome of success.<br /><br />This documentary was inspiring because it brought to light a very different paradigm. It brought to light the paradigm of the artist/business owner who puts his craft first, while also maintaining a successful business. It was nice to hear how a man like this thinks & operates. It was nice to see him in front of his customers doing what he loves, as well as behind-the-scenes, teaching his apprentices how to make the best sushi in the world.<br /><br />Aside from the content, the quality of the cinematography and overall production helped make this one of the most engaging and visually stunning films I've seen in a long time (or ever). The visual poetry and music matched the level of artistic integrity that Jiro places on his work - helping to capture the energy and excitement that Jiro has for his craft, and helping to transmit that to the viewer.<br /><br />In short - it was one of the best documentaries I've ever seen - both for the content and presentation.

B007R3B4RG|4.0|Start with one of the Best album covers ever. Awesome, Ya know.  now these are songs he did but never finished before his untimely death 11 yrs ago. they are now finished with help from his brother and others. there are some Very strong songs on here and a couple weak ones but overall it's wonderful to hear his voice.  an array of guests stars give a boost to this cd.  this album really grows on you.  my favs include \\"Going nowhere fast\\" , \\"Seven days of gloom\\" , and Cabin fever\\" . as with his 1st solo album, it's just great to hear Joey's  Voice.  for Ramones fans and all rock fans.  Enjoy.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|game is ad free, runs great on HTC one v. people say there are ads... only thing it has is promos on pause for angrybirds. no ads. so worth the .99 cents if you don't want to play with the ads.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|One must have software for all multi-device user. And a nice propousal for reducing the use of real world notebooks.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|this is actually an amazing app. I'm an academic and reading pdfs on the Fire has became second nature with this app. nice library, easy highlighting and note taking. smooth flipping pages, searching words, etc. it is enhanced for dropbox whoch makes everything easy. however, here are some suggestions for the developers:<br /><br />1. When a Pdf is in the device it is saved with a very weird name and the search function for files outside My Folder doesn't work well which makes finding new files quite hard.<br />2. It is VERY hard to export annotations. one has to select each annotation from a list in order to send it as text. if I read a 200 page book and have 300 annotations, was it that hard to put a Select All button? really do you expect me to click on each one of them? the export annotation function is useless since it converts them to a type of file that is basically not readable by any program<br />3. the selection feature sometimes is a bit too sensitive and one needs to pinch several times before getting it right.<br />4. continuous highlighting from one page to other would make things much easier<br /><br />I guess that's it. in general this app is FANTASTIC! I totally recommend it.

I'm thankful that Jurek shared his story.  Changed my life.

B00913DPW2|3.0|The game locked up on me halfway through so I just gave up on it.  It was a good game up to that point.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|the best app I have I use it exclusively for all my feeds and social sites highly recommend that you download too
B00008PW3Q|3.0|OK - I listened to this again and it is not as bad as I originally thought.  The title track, Say You Will is very good and there are several other good songs.  Unfortunately, there are several terrible songs too that really bring it down (especially the unlistenable Red Rover!!) Limiting the album to the best 12 songs here would have made this a really terrific listen!!
B006JPS1OM|4.0|this app is so cool. four star because the full version has more chapters and places to go. but there both cool :)
B00006JL1Z|2.0|Wow this should have been one of the best collections of all time.  There is enough great Fleetwood Mac material to fill at least 2 CDs -- but for some reason they included many bad versions of really bad songs (they don't have many bad songs after all) and left off many graet ones.  Where is Angel (their best song) and we certainly don't need the live version of Lindsay Buckingham ruining I'm So Afraid.  And how could they include the really bad obnoxious live version of Big Love?  It is horrible.  Since when is What Makes You Think You're The One the best of Fleetwood Mac - IT IS TERRIBLE.  The live version of Go Insane is unlistenable (and isn't even a Fleetwood Mac song!!!!!)  Other bad songs include:  World Turning, Family Man (one of their worst songs), As Long As You Follow, No Questions Asked, and Skies The Limit are really really really BAD.  This should have been awesome instead it is very very mediocre and unlistenable at times.  What a shame!
B001F290E4|5.0|This was recommended highly to me and it certainly delivered.  If you like Seal and/or soul music, you will be happy with this one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the Book!! Loved reading it on my Kindle. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves an adventure story.
B001AVCFJM|1.0|Star Trek for people who don't care a damn about Gene Roddenberry (and who would probably ask \\"Jean who?  What's she got to do with Star Trek?\\") or intelligently made SF by those with something to say.  This is Trek for educationally challenged 13 year olds who think CGI spaceships blowing up with much sound and fury is \\"like way cool\\" and if they were to watch, say, the classic episode Balance Of Terror, wouldn't be able to understand why Kirk doesn't just stop talking and blow the Romulan ship to bits.<br /><br />It's Star Trek for the lowest common denominator in which Kirk is an overgrown adolescent, Spock looks like he should be at high school, and most of the other characters are nothing like the great originals.  Most?  Well, fair's fair - the actor who playes Bones is indeed the real McCoy.  He's wonderful and the only thing of merit in the whole mess.<br /><br />\\"What can Star Trek learn from Star Wars?\\" asks director JJ Abrams.  Not a damn thing as his abomination of a movie proves conclusively.  If you watch this horror, don't get nervous if the ground starts rumbling.  That's not an earthquake, it's the late, great Mr Roddenberry spinning in his grave.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|These Guys are pure Gold! It's a very light hearted cheeky movie about a group dealing with a zombie infection. I love it when a movie can be watched over and over again...and somehow gets funnier. Good Movie must add to your collection.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|It is more than my expectation.<br />Pinseeker target mode works very well. I like that!<br />Considering the price I offered, it is much more!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The writer is in desperate need of a thesauras, but I still LOVED the book. Made my husband read it too! He enjoyed the book also. We have both agreed the writer should go back to middle school english though.  I am re-reading it for the second time! Can't get enough.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Don't waste your money or your time purchasing this movie.  After reading Suzanne Collins' trilogy, I eagerly awaited the movie.  Being an avid reader, I am well aware that the book is ALWAYS better, but there are times when the film adaptation can truly hold its own.  This is not one of those times.<br /><br />First, I was disappointed by most of the selection of actors to represent the characters (Peta, Gail, President Snow don't offer compelling portrayals of the books' characters).  Secondly, the film was unable to portray the desperation and oppression of the people of the Districts.  This coincides with the failure to represent the all-encompassing omnipresence of the Capital (ie., the government).  Without these two elements, the reasoning behind the Games themselves and why the citizens participate and sacrifice, is lost.<br /><br />The greatest disappointment was the lack of character and story development.  It appears that neither the writers nor the director read the books.  Audiences have proven, that provided the plot and action are well done, we can enjoy a 2+ hour film (ie., Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Batman, etc.).  Trying to view this film from the perspective of a person who has never read the book was a bit difficult, but I still think the movie is lacking.<br /><br />After all the hype and a few cleverly edited trailers (and the fact that there was a fair amount of action in the books), I thought this movie would have some action scenes.  Aside from a \\"running sequence\\" when they first arrived at the Games location; there was only a short action scene with the introduction of the muttations near the end of the film.<br /><br />This movie as boring and disjointed.  It lacked subtle nuances that could have made it more cohesive.  I wonder if the author had any part in writing the screenplay.  I certainly hope not because this film was a wicked butchering of a really good book.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Works well for a free application.  Monitors the batteries current state and has a few other options for battery life monitoring and management.  All in all; it's free and it works.
B00466HM28|1.0|This is a very, very poor controller. First of all, I received a defective unit - the knobs ceased to function completely after a few days. The included customization software is extremely wonky and finicky - oftentimes it appeared to fail to interact with the controller altogether. As you've likely read in other reviews, the pads are terribly constructed - they have no give whatsoever and must be be pummeled to get a response. The USB jack moves in worrying ways when you plug it in (I've read in at least one other review that it's very flimsy). Additionally, if you're trying to use it with Ableton Live (and possibly with other production software, I didn't bother testing) there is a huge issue with latency that makes real-time use nearly if not completely impossible, rendering the unit pretty much pointless. Ironically, this controller comes with a substantial coupon for Ableton, which is incidentally the best part of this product. The use of the word \\"professional\\" on the packaging of this product is a joke.

B0090EJR1K|5.0|A Dictator named Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen) from the Country of Wadyia comes to visit America.  Aladeen is a brutal dictator that has oppressed his people and never makes any apologies for it, as no one would dare to oppose him.  Unbeknownst to Aladeen, his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) is plotting against him, as he has his own ambitions that will never be realized so long as Aladeen is in power.<br /><br />Finding an unlikely cohort in the security that was hired to protect Aladeen (or so Aladeen thought) Clayton (John C. Reilly), Tamir puts in motion a plan to remove Aladeen from power.  The plan goes horribly wrong, though the desired outcome is achieved and a bewildered Aladeen finds himself in the streets of New York City.<br />While Aladeen is trying to regain his status, he meets Zoe (Anna Faris).  Zoe manages an eco friendly grocery store.  Aladeen begins to work at the store, never losing his will to regain power.  Along the way, he runs into a former Scientist in Wadyia \\"Nuclear Nadal\\" (Jason Mantzoukas).<br /><br />Nadal begrudgingly agrees to help Aladeen regain his power, though at first neither of the two have any idea whatsoever how to go about accomplishing this task!<br /><br />Aladeen continues his daily routines otherwise, getting to know his boss and also new friend Zoe on a more personal level.<br /><br />The movie cascades through various situations through just outright silliness and LOTS of crude language.  However, while at first glance some of the language and situations may seem offensive there is a method to this madness!  Through various misadventures, misunderstandings, as well as dumb luck - Aladeen finds himself with a chance to regain his former status and life.  Aladeen's Uncle Zamir however has other plans.  Ending as absurdly as the story began, you will enjoy the conclusion and the movie will end with you wanting to see it again.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|Hmm....THIS GAME IS GREAT!!!!!! :) i suggest getting the bakery story as well. Btw the storm id costs nothing but if u want a bunch more gems u have to pay for it. U can still earn about one gem at a time by completing the medals. It does have a wall for messages sometimes ppl might post wierd things but you dont nessecairily have to post messages. as what i heard there is a parent lock so if you have a little kid playing you can lock the buying of coins and gems. coins are the easiest thing to earn. you just have to have food out for ppl to eat and u earn aboit 2 to 4 coins ata time. It allows u to visit random ppl and tip u can have nieghbors and give out ur storm id so ppl can be ur nieghbor. as a nieghbor u can gifft and give out mor tips ti another neighbor. U can get cool apliances as an icecream machine in either one of the resto or bakeo story. This game is bad if u dont have alot of time on ur hands because u need to check food and ITS ADDICTING! to change ur bake or resto name u hav to pay 10 gems. yes some tings are over gemed like a blue counter for 15 gems. HOPE THIS HELPS<br />  :&bull;)

1558908382|5.0|A professional assassin has decided to go home for his high school class reunion in his home town of Grosse Point Blank Michigan. He is at a low time in his life as he has just failed to deliver on a contract and another hit man is after him. Martin Blank (John Cusack) goes home and looks up his old girlfriend Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver) who he deserted on prom night to join the army.<br /><br />Martin becomes involved in battle with two hired assassins who want him dead. Grocer (Dan Aykroyd) is a master assassin and he wants to join teams with Martin to form a company to do large scale killings. They try to act like friends but it is easy to see that there is no trust between them. Another assassin is out to kill him for a past job.<br /><br />While at his class reunion he begins to reconsider his life and how different it might be if he had stayed at home and simply married Debi and had a family....<br /><br />This is a hilarious film with a lot of comedy and action combined. The plot has more twists and turns than a mountain road and it will keep you laughing. It is filled with excellent actors and they do a marvelous job of portraying their roles. You will like this film and enjoy the comedy scenes. I know that I did. It is a five star film.

0525478183|5.0|*Review published on Mundie Moms on 8/31/2012*<br /><br />I finally listened to my friends Heather W. Petty and Stacie (from Whimsical-Ficery) who have over the years &lt;s>tempted, prodded and begged&lt;/s> suggested that I read any and all of John Green's books. Heather, in particular, challenged me with a warning that John writes the kind of fictional boys I love. I, of course, did the least sensible thing ever and nodded and ignored their suggestions.<br /><br />Then in the Summer of My Contemporary Reads (yes, I'm still on that kick), I picked up Paper Towns and didn't put it down except to go pick up the kids from school and refill my iced tea glass. Oh Quentin, darn it, Heather was right. I adored him, immediately. I related to his do-the-right-thing-always (and his resulting anxiety) personality. And I will admit that his infatuation with Margo had me worried. Margo - starter of all-night revenge sprees, expert runaway, next-door-neighbor. The mom in me disliked her. The reader in me loved her. John builds such a delicious, believable tension between Margo and Q that yes, I fell in complete love with the two of them.<br /><br />John's writing flowed so beautifully as he pulled at the back story string that linked Q and Margo and threaded it expertly into the mystery of clues Margo left behind (yes, I obviously loved the theme of paper towns and the use of \\"strings\\" to explain relationships). Then there's the small matter of the ending. No spoilers, trust me. But, I did tweet and text and tell everyone I knew that they should read the book because the ending was \\"whoa\\". The ending suited the story so perfectly and it was filled with \\"whoa\\". Not an elegant critique on my part and yet, that's the only word I was left with after turning the last page. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.<br /><br />If you haven't picked up a John Green book, do so. It's everything you've heard it would be - funny, sweet and filled with \\"whoa\\" moments. I'm almost done with An Abundance of Katherines which should tell you that yes, yes, yes Heather and Stacie you were right...I adore John's stories.h should tell you that yes, yes, yes Heather and Stacie you were right...I adore John's stories.
0307730697|5.0|I cant say enough how everyone should read this book. It takes you on a tremendous journey full of highs and lows that will leave you exhausted but highly motivated when completed.  It makes you want to be a better person. All young men especially should read this book. It is clearly not just another SEAL book. Its a book about personal and spiritual growth.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Always my first choice when I have a few moments of waiting time like at a medical appointment or waiting for my kids to finish practice.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I personally did not think the ending was bad.... I thought it very clever and a good way to end it. I personally did not like either character, so it didn't bother me for it to turn out like it did. They both kindof got what they deserved! I will read her other books soon and I look forward to seeing the movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not stopping reading.... When I finished the third book I wished it had more....<br /><br />This book was really good!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I Loved this book! The characters are interesting and the story line kept me reading. I am not much for fantasy books, but this one is one of those books you do not want to put down.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Battery HD is my favorite battery monitoring app so far. I find the interface attractive. The app will tell you the time you have availabe with the current charge for different activities you may use it for like reading, playing games, watching videos, etc. It will also tell you how long it will charge back to full strength. I particularly like the voice warnings of when the power is  low or when my Kindle Fire is fully recharged. Battery HD is decent good looking app that is helpful to have.

B0088X7YU0|4.0|[[ASIN:B0088X7YU0 Starship Troopers: Invasion [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I thought that this was a pretty good story line for continuing years after the first Starship Troopers movie. Unfortunately, I had also thought they'd be reprising the Roughnecks CGI series as well and half thought this would blend the two stories together (movie and CGI series). Not the case.<br /><br />On its own, independent of the CGI series, it brings an interesting twist to the Starship Troopers universe and offers a good story that takes place years after the first movie. Unfortunately, it is a move completely independent of the universe within which it takes place as there is no explanation as to how things have been going in the bug war since the first movie.<br /><br />The CGI effects were good and I did like the characters, but not really the story lines about the characters getting involved with each other.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of the first Starship Troopers movie, this is a movie to get instead of Starship Troopers 2 or 3.<br /><br />Eric
B005FPT51K|1.0|We really wanted to love this monitor. It actually came recommended by some close friends and was high on our wish list of \\"nice-to-have\\" baby gadgets. So we decided to \\"splurge\\" on this monitor. The concept--using your smart phone/tablet to view your baby from anywhere you can get wifi--is spot-on and likely to be a big money maker for someone but this is not the product that will corner this market. The camera itself seems to be high quality and well built but it's all the software quirks that make this product pretty much useless. For starters, the App for iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod) that is required to use, view, control and setup the camera is clunky and far from user-friendly. I am in the marketing field and have seen my fair share of ugly/unusable apps but this one takes the cake. It almost feels unfinished--but in a state that should never have been released to the public, certainly no \\"working beta\\" version since it barely works.<br /><br />Here are the issues with the app:<br />1. User interface is unappealing and clunky (like it was created in a very foreign language and *poorly* translated)<br />2. Difficult to locate settings and features--what should be straightforward is hidden in sub-menus, etc.<br />3. The software lags a LOT. And by lag I mean the time it takes for you to see/hear on your device what is caught on camera as well as the time it takes for your movement command to control the camera. On average we experienced a lag of 30+ secs but at times as much as 1 minute. Example: I set the alert feature to alert us when there was movement or sound in the room but even after jumping up and down, clapping and screaming in the room, the alert didn't hit my phone for at least a minute. In fact I had given up on it working and was in another room when it finally went off. This is a huge deal to me, I mean what is the good of a monitor if it doesn't monitor in real-time? For the rest of the functions (moving the camera, watching video) the lag was super annoying.<br />4. Hard (if not impossible--I didn't get it to work) to set up camera/wifi/router to allow camera to be viewed and controlled outside the home. Half the reason we got this was to be able to look in on our baby when my wife or I traveled. Setting up your network to allow this is not easy.<br /><br />Issues with the camera:<br />1. The camera has limited tilt. It was impossible to look down enough to get a good view into the crib<br />2. No speaker on camera unit. This means you have to attach your own external speaker to enable two-way audio. This is a very inelegant solution if you ask me.<br /><br />Due to our disappointment with this product we ended up returning to Amazon within a week or two and thankfully we received a full refund. We ended up buying a simple audio monitor made by VTech for $100+ less and love it. Here it is: [[ASIN:B007NG5UF4 VTech Communications Safe & Sound Digital Audio Monitor]]<br /><br />It just works--which cannot be said for the iBaby Monitor.

B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This is the 11th installment in the Reacher series. Jack is his typical self. Here is shows possibly a bit more sentiment than normal. He becomes more real in this novel.<br />Being a numbers addict, he cracks a code in a bank deposit which starts the wheels turning. He hears from one of his cronies in his old army unit of a dire need to help others in trouble after one is tossed from a helicopter at 3000'. The story moves on well from the start.<br />The characters are very well developed. The story and the way it unfolds are believable as well<br />In this installment we meet and see the personalities of his old unit's members. We also have Reacher relying on their help a great deal. A nice twist since he usually carries out vengeance alone.<br /><br />If a fan of Lee Childs' Jack Reacher novels, this is a must read. It's sometimes difficult i the novel to discern who the real bad guys are. It comes together nicely in the end in true Reacher style

B007MAETA8|1.0|This CD is bogus. The identifying information comes up on my computer as Fiji (artist) and all the songs are listed as something other than what is on the packaging.  Songs about island life and such.  I am requesting a new John  Mayer Born And Raised CD to replace this fake duplicate.  The music is John Mayer, the packaging says Columbia, but the CD is recorded over someone elses CD, not a new blank.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I love mystery games.  It was difficult, but I was able to solve with some help from the hints.  The graphics are beautiful.  It did keep freezing up on my Kindle Fire.  All I had to do was exit the game and go back in.  It didn't bother me that much, because the game was so good.  More games like this, please!
0345803485|1.0|I join many others in saying this was a VERY poorly written book. The publishers should be fined for allowing this book to be printed for the waste of so many wonderful trees. The main character of this book is supposed to be an English major yet you would be hard pressed to fill ten pages with her vocabulary. I agree with another written reviews that it sounded as if the book had been written by some teenager - and that is insulting most teenagers I know. After the tenth Holy Shit I had to start scanning the book in order to finish it. Will never be suckered into buy another book on the best seller list without reading others comments first!
034580404X|1.0|The protagonists of this trilogy are named Ms. Vagina and Mr. Penis. There are a number of minor characters, all of them variations of the main ones. The main female protagonist, Ms. Vagina, is continually getting aroused. Sometimes Ms. Vagina morphs into a face and then the face is always blushing. When it gets tired of blushing it starts flushing. When done with both the face is always biting its lower lip and whenever this happens Mr. Penis responds. All the three books are just detours from this main theme. What a waste of my time and money!

B008QE9VJI|1.0|It's kind of become a joke when Tim Burton puts out a movie.  You can predict the actors without blinking.  He needs to diversify!  As a fan of the classic series and all it's campy, over-dramatic, long drawn-out plot lines, this was the poorest excuse for a tribute!!!  I grew up watching this on reruns in the late 80's.  I now own the entire original series.  I almost walked out in the first ten minutes.  My spouse said I had this look of pure disgust through-out the whole thing... except when I managed a giggle at Alice Coopers expense.  The fact that all Tim Burton did for the original cast was to give them a walk-on, was so disrespectful and half-assed!  I often wonder if the screening of this film killed the good and great Jonathan Frid!?  It was an insult!!!  The only thing that Burton got right was hiring Danny.  Danny Elfman is the only person that managed to capture the essence of the original!  Avoid this train-wreck and give the original series your money and time!

B000LCJ4AE|5.0|Back in January 2008 there was quite a bit of news in Stephanville, Texas about a huge UFO that was sighted.  Credible witnesses from pilots and constables and so forth witnessed the phenomena and even today you can see their interviews on YouTube.  This event covered by newspapers such as the Dallas Morning News piqued my interest in the subject and so I bought Lt. Col Phillip Corso's book which offered to explain what was going over America's skies over the last 70 years.  The conventional theory is that many of these sightings are either weather balloons, swamp gas or the planet venus.  Corso in his book has a different explanation and his view was that the Army Air Force (AAF) had did indeed recovered an extraterrestrial craft in July of 1947 just outside of Roswell, New Mexico where the AAF kept B-29 squadrons with the capability to deliver the atomic bomb.<br /><br />According to Lt Col Phillip Corso once the AAF had some idea of what they had aquired and that it was significant and that it was appeared literally out-of-this-world and was technically extremely advanced they put an extremely tight security lid on the crashed vehicle, removed all traces of it from the crash site and used the weather balloon explanation as the cover story. Another theory was that it may have been an advanced reconnaisance craft from Stalin's Soviet Union to spy on America's nuclear capabilities.  The Government needed time to find out what the craft really was.  It was the time of the start of the cold war and we had just finished world war II and the thinking at the highest levels was that the American public was not ready for a \\"massive reality changing\\" event that would upset most religious and cultural beliefs and viewpoints.<br /><br />Lt Col Corso was working directly at the Pentagon in 1959-1960 under Lt. General Trudeau (American leader of Pork Chop Hill fame) at the time.  Lt General Trudeau had the responsibility of directing the Army's Scientific Defense Research and Lt Col Corso was the point man to exploit and ensure this \\"find\\" would be put to the optimum use to gain technical knowledge. Apparently all of the armed forces (Navy, Air Force also) reportedly got artifacts from the crash to ascertain through study and testing and through reverse engineering processes at research labs around the country. As an inside joke the file cabinet that held the reports and items from the crash was referred to by Corso as \\"the nut file\\".  Secrecy in where the artifacts originated from was kept very tight.  The artifacts were sent to various research labs around the country.  They were to be given these various artifacts under the name of \\"Foreign Technology\\" to hide the origin of the parts. Funding was provided from Army R & D to find out how the artifacts worked and then once fully understood then the new technology was used to generate useful products.  This research effort to understand the \\"Foreign Technology\\" took many years.  What were the some of the results of the government funded research efforts ?<br /><br />According to economist and former FED Chairman and Economist Alan Greenspan (in his book The Age of Turbulence) the three biggest drivers of the American economy in the last few decades were: Integrated Circuits, Lasers and Fiber optics.  Also other spinoffs were improved night vision capabilities, advanced composites and velcro. These are the technical areas that Col Corso claims were the benefits of the crash in New Mexico in 1947.  Pretty heady stuff.  Is Corso's book credible ?<br /><br />His book is fascinating and he proposes a neat theory to explain why the Americans seem to always have the great breakthrough's in technology.  It raises the question:  Are we smarter than everybody else in the world in creating new technologies ?  Or did we have some help from \\"out there\\" ?<br /><br />Lt Col Phillip Corso is an excellent writer and writes a convincing story with no hard evidence except pictures of him and Lt Gen Trudeautogether in a formal picture. There are pictures of UFO's from other sources but what sells his story is his background.  Lt Gen Trudeau doesn't appear to be the type of person to suffer fools gladly so either Lt. Col. Phillip is giving us the straight story on how an alien space craft from apparently the Zeti Reticula Star System (about 39 light years away) was knocked down by a combination of a massive electrical storm and intense radar frequencies from one of the most secure and closely guarded areas in America (V-2 and atomic bomb testing area) or he is extremely delusional.  In my opinion Col Corso provides a convincing story but doesn't provide hard evidence.  How could he ?  It is classified. However you can Google his name and see his track record and see for yourself if this is the type of person that writes well written books on fantasy.<br /><br />The Day After Roswell is fairly technical so if you are looking for an easy book to read this will probably not be a good choice.  But from a technical writing standpoint on several complex and technical subjects it was well written.  Some of my friends whom I sent this book to and who read it told me that they could not sleep well after reading it.  It was very convincing.together in a formal picture.

B001F290E4|5.0|This album demonstrates Seals influence of his style, I was as always pleased with this CD. My favorite song is A Man's World, I feel James Brown was proud. There isn't really nothing I could say more about this CD that others on here haven't already said in a positive way. All I can say is buy two one for home and one for the car.

B00005RYL2|4.0|For centuries, a group of immortals from all around the world are required to fight each other in swordfights, which are won only when one of the combatants is beheaded. Connor Macleod [Christopher Lambert, in what is very easily his best performance to date], a centuries-old immortal in present-day New York, meets up with his arch nemesis The Kurgan [Clancy Brown, who steals the show in every scene he appears in] to do battle in order to finally claim The Prize. This movie is a joy to watch for many reasons: The interesting story, The beautiful scottish scenery in the flashback scenes, The entertaining swordfights [especially the duel between Connor and The Kurgan in the finale], The awesome Queen songs which are heard all throughout the movie, and the great performances by the cast. Although Christopher Lambert is not a good actor and not a good choice for a leading man, He somehow is able to make his presence work in this movie [Despite the fact that he's obviously a french man playing a scottish character] and he actually makes Connor a very likeable character but it is Sean Connery as Connor's mentor Ramirez and Clancy Brown as the treacherous Kurgan who are the real stars of this movie as they both immediately take charge of any scenes either of them appear in. Over the years, this movie has become a bonafide cult classic and i'd reccomend this movie to anybody who likes fantasy films, action films, and sword films. Note: There are a few differing versions of this movie out there with extra footage that's normally not seen in some prints of this movie so choose wisely when purchasing this movie on DVD or Blu-Ray. Followed by four sequels, two live-action tv shows, an animated series, an anime feature, and an upcoming reboot.
0307951529|5.0|There are enough case studies of successful endeavors in this book that it will spark the motivation you'll need to task a risk. You don't have to quit your day job in order to reach for your goals and the ideal plan puts the only investment at around $100 or so. The book is about creating a plan for freedom and passion more than making boatloads of money but who would complain if the boatloads of money happen to come your way like in the cases presented in Guillebeau's book, \\"$100 Startup.\\" Don't wait for your ship to come in ... swim out to meet it. There are successes which the author brings to light... businesses started on a shoestring that are bringing in $50K of income, sometimes for just part-time endeavors. Will your dream become a reality? Probably not as long as you keep thinking about it and doing nothing to make it happen. Check out this book! I give it 5 stars... what about you???
B006225RN0|1.0|Duncan Macleod [Adrian Paul, The star of the successful Highlander TV series] and Connor Macleod [Christopher Lambert, In his final appearance in the Highlander saga] are up against an evil immortal named Jacob Kell [Bruce Payne]. Considering the year this one was made, i'm very surprised that this movie actually made it to theatres [the last in the series that would]. Unlike the first three movies, This one is not really about Connor but more about his brother Duncan [the hero of the TV series] which didn't really have to be a bad thing [even though it did turn out to be for reasons i'll state in a little bit]. This movie seems like an extended bad episode of the TV show and everybody in this movie seems pretty lifeless and bored [even the usually reliable Christopher Lambert seems tired in this one]. It's too bad Donnie Yen didn't really get to do much in this movie because with his martial arts skills, he could have injected some much-needed excitement into this mess of a movie. The greatest mistake this movie made [spoiler alert] is having Duncan behead Connor [who deserved a much better farewell]. At this point, Highlander was pretty much finished and had run its course. But alas, They just couldn't let the series die as yet another sequel, This time a made-for-cable one called Highlander: The Source, Was later released in 2007 [which i will NOT be watching, for free or otherwise].
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I bought it based on the high reviews and was not disappointed. I loved the characters in the book and the flow of the storyline. It never got slow for me and I was sad to have it end. I eagerly await the next book and will be picking up more books from Mr. Anthony Ryan.

B006LSZECO|2.0|what a disappointment, i only gave 2 star cause of how great it was in the beginning, all the twists and turns, i was praising the author, the book, the story, but at the end, it was dragging, too much, and the ending itself....horrible.
B000YAA68W|4.0|Very interesting and insightful story, especially for those who don't really understand or know too much about the Iranian Revolution. This animation was moving, yet disturbing. If you want an idea of what it's like to live in a repressive society, this is a good film to start.<br /><br />Definitely not for children. A dark film, leaves you feeling how precious freedom and family are.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|Really the only real criticism I have would be that the books r not really separate. They are one long continuous read which makes it hard to find a particular page or event. It would be nicer if separate.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|the game is awesome. battle interchange is simple, yet requires skillful execution. the only problem is that the game is 'free'. the later upgrades in the game require ptp, and cannot be obtained otherwise, unless you complete offers. this eventually makes the game way too hard to play free. still, great while it lasts.

B005LLSLPE|1.0|i just wasted $21.99!!! Amazon VOD is the biggest piece of garbage i have ever seen. After watching the first 3 seasons of SOA flawlessly of course i want to see season 4. Perfect Amazon VOD has it available.. so i purchase it click to watch it and get about 12 minutes into the first episode and it locks up... so i try to restart it and nothing... try to download it... wait 20 minutes for it to download... try to watch it and it says i'm not allowed... wait not allowed??? i'm not renting the show i BOUGHT it. SO again i try to watch it ... made it 14 minutes and locked up... I WANT MY MONEY BACK..... i have used amazon for years and never had an issue, but they need to stay out of the VOD playing field. Before anyone says its my connection,its my network... blah blah... i just watch netflix every night for the last 3 weeks straight without any issues... not even a flicker.. I will repeat I WANT A REFUND.... PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!
0307719219|4.0|In March Daron Acemoglu (Introduction to Economic Growth) and James Robinson (Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy) released their latest book, Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty.  The duo initially present various theories explaining just why some countries prosper and others do not.  The authors approach culture, the weather, geography and simple development ignorance.  They then present a model which they contend best describes this economic behavior.  They present historical examples from over hundreds of years to illustrate their basic points.  The book is well over 500 pages so there may be more here than the general reader will want to digest.  Sometimes the books seems to meander a little bit, but that is just a personal impression.  Ultimately, this is a valuable book particularly in this election year.  In sum Acemoglu and Robinson say its institutions stupid.  I'll not give the details of their message away, but it will make you pause if you are from the USA.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|...but fans won't be punished with this purchase.  Good, solid album.  Has that complex \\"evolved\\" Rush sound that the band has developed over the last few years.  If you've been catching the last few Rush video programs on cable, DVD, or Blu-Ray you'll know what I mean.  (Think of the \\"Far Cry\\" live performances.)  It's wonderful, thought-provoking music to which you'll want to listen again, to pick up what you missed the first time.<br /><br />Recommended for all Rush fans: young, old, and to-be.  Delay yourselves no longer.

034580404X|1.0|I made myself read the second book thinking there has to be something to this to be so popular, am determined to read the third, but I have never read anything more boring and badly written.  Nearly every page has someone \\"hissing\\" or rolling their eyes.  The author's vocabulary is that of an 8 year old.  Inner goddess, oh please, can't she think of some other description of her deepest thoughts? Mention a time or 2 but on every page, I don't think so.<br /><br />So when someone starts panting, I skip the next 3 pages.  Yes, it takes that long to describe in minutest detail what 2 over sexed people do to one another, aside from the spanking, etc.  Does any normal human orgasm just looking at a guy?  Or stuff objects up their nether parts for fun? Oh please.<br /><br />My opinion is that if this is what women today can't get enough of, they missed Literature one A in high school.  It's also a sad commentary on what interests women.  I'd refer them to Marquis de Sad, same idea but written well enough to have redeming features.

B0014YVC6W|2.0|Almost all motion pictures are made to please the audience. A film needn't have a happy ending to be pleasing; people are looking for some form of emotional connection, and this can include (for example) a hero who dies in the process of achieving something worthwhile.<br /><br />But it's rare to see a film that so obviously panders to the audience's desire for the superficially appealing as does \\"Short Circuit\\". It's coldly calculated to push all the right buttons.<br /><br />In terms of acting, directing, & production values, \\"Short Circuit\\" is in no way a bad film. The two-star rating is for the way it so blatantly sucks up to the audience's desire for cheaply obtained emotional reactions.<br /><br />\\"Short Circuit\\" is strictly a kiddie film, with little of any real interest to adults.<br /><br />The running commentary (by the director and writers) is one of those rarities -- a generally interesting narrative that largely avoids the self-congratulatory smugness and pointless anecdotes that mar too many commentaries. It is far superior to the film itself.<br /><br />Technical Stuff... The image quality is generally good, though a bit softer than one gets from the very best BDs. There are one or two white specks here and there, but that's about it. The transfer, however, is at 1080i/30, rather than the preferred 1080p/24. This is hardly surprising, as Image Entertainment is the publisher.
B000HF0ILY|5.0|One of Eastwood's best! Right up there with The Outlaw Josie Wales. Outstanding. What else can I say? Top Notch.
B006JD48NM|4.0|Really, there should be nothing wrong with this film, in fact there is not but I did find it unfortunate that 2 major highllights to give the uninformed viewer complete understanding of the brilliance of this man would want to see, were sadly not mentioned. First, while shown in the finishing credits, nothing in the film shows the heroism of Senna more than when he rushed to the crashed car of Erik Comas during qualifying for the 1992 Belgium Grand Prix in Spa. Comas crashed in front of Senna who, by his weaving clear of the carnage stopped his McLaren and ran to cut the engine of Comas' car. Senna stayed on the scene, in fact many other cars continued past without stopping, while tending to the driver until medics, notably Prof. Sid Watkins could get there. Second, the famed driving dominance of Senna (in the rain of course) during the 1993 European Grand Prix in Donington Park, UK. What could illustrate better the incredible talent of Senna than his drive in those torrential conditions that day than that? He was driving the underperforming McLaren-Ford racing the dominant Williams-Renault combination of Hill/Prost to sheer brilliance, winning the race by lapping the complete field except the second place Williams of Damon Hill who incidently Senna finished more than 1 minute in front of. While I can undertand the editing process, these two notable rememberances can be found for the viewer on YouTube should they want to watch. My last comment is I found the subtitles difficult to read for some reason but really the film is the best there is right now on who was clearly the greatest.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I heard about this book after fox and Ridley Scott got the movie rights. I must say that this was instantly added to my list of favorites. The writing was top notch and the world-building was just excellent. I know there are a ton of other reviews on here praising this book, but that only wanted me to get on here and sing my praise. This book had me throwing caution to the wind. I found myself unable to stop myself from reading. If I was at work, every free second was on my phone stealing pages here and there. I just love it when I can be so impressed by a story like this. Now I love sci-fi and that says a lot. My only wish is that I could go back and read it again without knowing what happens. Cannot wait for more.
0425263908|4.0|A huge improvement from FSoG. Although I was seriously worried about Eva every time she said her chest hurt I kept thinking a heart attack was in the midst.<br />I find it difficult to criticize a book about an abused woman. As a woman I feel rage toward any men who dare abuse a woman. So this is just a humble opinion not a critique.<br />So much in this book. It's the story of a young magnate and a nice wealthy girl who fall in love thanks to many sessions of steaming sex, and secrets of abuse they happen to have in common although, we never find out what his secrets are, we only get hints.<br />I very much like the girl in this story. Thank God she wasn't another Ana Steele or I would have puked. Eva just happens to be this nice girl with absolutely no saint delusions (opposed to u know who). I must say I got scared at the beginning when we are told Gideon owns this and that and I'm like *please don't be another Christian* but he wasn't. Although he does talk too dirty in my opinion. (I could have done it without him using the word c***).<br />As the story progresses Gideon goes above and beyond to make the relationship work like inviting Eva to his house where he has never ever taken another woman and oh my god first thing she spits out is the rape bomb. Horrible timing Eva. But as if that wasn't enough on another occasion he invites her on a date to make up for a ruined first date and once again she throws a \\"lets go to therapy together\\" bomb. I was like Jesus!<br />Then he pretty much dumps her and she still finds the courage to attend to his family reunion. Obviously she forgot the meaning of the work dignity at that point. And there was also that bit of info about him never attending this particular celebration but guess what, he happened to be there this one time to torment her.<br />They reach a point towards the end where they agree to the whole Dom/Sub deal and I can't help but wonder if this is a wise decision because we all know they're both survivors of some kind of abuse and how is violence going to work for them?<br />There was so much wine in this book It made me thirsty.<br />Loved the Mexican restaurant scene. Laughed like crazy and also the bonding time between Magdalene and Eva was hilarious.<br />Over all I think the first half was good, the second half not so good.<br />I don't understand where he found the time to recreate her bedroom in his house or fill drawers with clothes for her, that is just creepy.<br />And what is Cary's story?f some kind of abuse and how is violence going to work for them?<br />There was so much wine in this book It made me thirsty.<br />Loved the Mexican restaurant scene.

B008N1LL42|2.0|The beginning of this movie had to much time trying to build the characters up. I almost got to the point of just turning it off. Even when the aliens started attacking I was still not into it. Finally the climax was getting closer and I really REALLY! enjoyed the last battle. But then the ending was to overdone as well. I feel like everyone was just trying too hard in this movie. After hearing all my friends tell me how good it was I'm very disappointed.

B0053O8AQE|2.0|A new show which seemed promising but fell flat. The show reminds me of the smash hit Alice but 2 Broke Girls is no Alice.....the show isnt funny and the punch lines are too raunchy for my taste. Again you can find this dvd cheaper if you look around. Let's hope Amazon lowers the price on this dvd. Do I recommend this dvd...no. Instead pick up the first season Alice.

B002ZG9940|5.0|This is a brilliant movie. Everything is perfect, but some aspects stand out.<br /><br />First, the astonishing performance of George Clooney. \\"The American\\" shows his extraordinary talent much better than the movies usually associated with him (like \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" and even \\"The Good German\\").<br /><br />Second, the fact that \\"The American\\" has three female leads played by European actresses Irina Bj&ouml;rklund, Violante Placido, and Thekla Reuten. The first one is given very little screen time due to the nature of the story, but her character and what happens to it is crucial for the rest of the movie. All three actresses are excellent in their roles, and, as an extra benefit, they are all beautiful in rather non-trivial, at least for the American audience, ways.<br /><br />Movies with three female characters playing pivotal roles in the story are rather rare for the big USA studios productions (in contrast, \\"The American\\" is produced by fairly independent \\"Focus features\\"). All too often we see an otherwise good or even great movie with female characters serving only a decorative role or totally absent (love stories excluding, naturally). As a rare exception, John Frankenheimer and David Mamet realized the need of a female lead even in an action-thriller and added such a character to the original story and the original script. The result is \\"Ronin\\" (in which the female lead is played by Natascha McElhone), another perfect movie.<br /><br />Third, the superb cinematography and the Italian beautiful scenery. Italian scenery is another character in the movie. In order to fully appreciate this, one should watch the Blu-ray (not the DVD) version.<br /><br />And, finally, the directing by Anton Corbijn, who come to director's chair very late after achieving fame as a photographer (in particular and may be foremost, as a photographer of such music bands as U2, Metallica, Depeche Mode), is outstanding and refreshing.<br /><br />\\"The American\\" is an action-thriller, a character drama, and an art house film. This may be too much to swallow for many viewers, and, apparently, many are concluding that it is neither. Inability to put a genre label on it leads to some discomfort (but not necessarily to a complete rejection). An audience with precooked assumptions about what a thriller or an art house film is ought to be will be disappointed. But an action-thriller does not need to be like \\"Die Hard\\" (any of the installments), and an art house film does not need to be \\"Sundance-like\\".  Jean-Pierre Melville's classics \\"Le samouraï\\" showed this already in 1967. \\"The American\\" is often compared to it in order to understand the movie, although Anton Corbijn, apparently, took more motivation from spaghetti-westerns of Sergio Leone (directly referenced to in \\"The American\\").<br /><br />If you are tolerant to more than one type of movies, you can enjoy \\"The American\\" either as an action-thriller, or as a character drama, or as an art house film. If you are sufficiently mature and open-minded to appreciate all genres (the art house fans need to realize that the art house is also a genre, and not a title of nobility), you will be able to appreciate this movie to the full extent.<br /><br />The usual complaint about \\"The American\\" is that it is slow and boring. It is indeed slow, but this slow narrative is packed with subtle details, changes of mood, and, of course, the beautiful scenery, which underscores mostly unspoken thoughts of main characters. It is boring only if you don't pay attention to all this. Another complaint is that this movie is a European movie. It is. Why not to try to watch and enjoy a European movie with George Clooney?<br /><br />The most obvious reasons to see \\"The American\\" are George Clooney, three beautiful actresses, cool characters, beauty of the cinematography, and, of course, the enigmatic story. In addition there is a good chance that you will recognize a masterpiece in it.haracter drama, and an art house film.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|Finally!  Phone and iPod charge off the pioneer adapter-controller.  I did NOT need additional power on CableJive adapter.  Very happy!  Charging is slow, but might be faster with additional micro USB 5v hooked up to side port of the CableJive!  Awesome product I am happy say I did not have to build myself!  Now how about a cheap dock with a pure 30pin pass through?  So I can still control with head unit and mount in sight!?  Awesome!  Could be cheaper but works!  Haven't tried schooshe passport. But this product works.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I liked the free version of this app enough to buy this premium version. So far I am moderately pleased. There is one feature I would like to see, I know you can set the volume for a &quot;track&quot;, but I would like to adjust the, volume of each element in a track I make
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Whilst weight  training for the last 35 yrs i have read many ,many books and articles on the subject.Mikes book is a well researched and written addition to the genre,with a clear explanation of nutrition and the overload principle which is the mainstay of muscle hypertrophy.He avoids making wild claims about packing on 20 lbs of pure muscle in 4 weeks and stresses that bodybuilding is a gradual process that takes months and even years.His recommendations for the ideal number of sets per body part (6 to 9) fall comfortably between the injury prone one to two sets of the heavy duty crowd (mentzer,yates etc) and the insanity of 20 sets recommended by the man himself Arnie.I read the whole book in one sitting and am applying his principles (which are easy to follow) to my own workouts.I emailed him after I finished the book with a few queries and I am very happy to say he answered the next day.Good luck to him and to all who take up the challenge of being bigger leaner and stronger.<br />peterv<br />melbourne australia

B008CP6RWU|5.0|I wont go into detail because there are already some really great reviews, but this was a wonderful emotionally powerful game. I don't think I have ever experienced anything like it. I highly recommend.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The best note taking tool there is. Too bad security at work doesn't allow!  But I use on Kindle,desktop and laptops at home.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Tho it took a little time for me to understand it and set it up, now I would shed a tear if it were taken away. Puts my apps where I want them. You can add one or several labels to each app so they appear on that label's folder. You can also label other labels and other items. So I have my &quot;Real Life Tools&quot; folder,  which includes links to the Finances and Shopping folders. I've even replaced the phone's app drawer with a link to FO's Applications folder, because I found it to be better organized (you can do this with Go Launcher).
B005LAIGN2|3.0|We've seen it all before countless times.  The handful of determined black men in the military determined to succeed despite the stupid racist whites and the enemy!  Hollywood never seems to get tired of this Politically Correct theme.  George Lucas of Star Wars fame puts all his movie touches into this glorified epic.  The bad Germans die by the planeful including ME 262s that were virtually unstoppable in the air!  Yet here they go down before the Red Tail heroes!  The Red Tails always die slow and dramatic taking Jets and Destroyers with them!<br /><br />Like many reviewers I found the actors likeable, but the dialog was typical Star Wars gung-ho stuff.  The production value was first-rate however, with accurate WW2 aircraft and sets.  Political agenda tends to favor distortion of historical facts in order to fit the confines of multiculturalism that is so important in the States these days. History suffers as a result.  No one wants to take anything away from the combat record of the Red Tails, but it would be nice if movies like this could be a little less effusive, and a bit more down to earth with the facts.<br /><br />That said its a worthwhile view for the dogfight scenes and special effects.  Hollywood entertainment at its best, with history along for the ride!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing book!  I read all three books in two weeks.  I just couldn't put them down!  At first I was a little put off but they are definitely worth the read.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|We read this book for our book club. We all enjoyed it. I am  a dog person so I really could relate to Enzo. Some of our members thought that maybe there were some parts where Enzo understing of  things was a little unbelevable. I think dogs are very much in tune with their owners. This was an easy to read enjoyable book. We had a good discussion about many issues the story presented. We all expressed that the grandparents weren't exactly the typical ones. We had a lively discussion about them. This is a good book in that there are many interesting issues that it covers.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a great book. The best part was how cheep it was on my kindle.<br />Thank you amazon !!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I'm only 11 and I use my dads Kindle and when I saw this and tried it, it was so relaxing after hearing my little brother scream at the top of his lungs and soon made me fall asleep. I recomend to anyone who has trouble sleeping!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I played the scratch game and I rarely get anything good.And you have to pay w/ real money.Its wool unfair!!!!:(
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is a really fun movie. It's not often a comedy as fresh as this one comes along. If you're already a fan of Family Guy then there is no reason why you wouldn't like this because it's exactly the same kind of humour and has most of the cast of Family Guy in it at one time or another. Mark Wahlburg is great as ever and has great comic timing. Mila Kunis is always funny in my opinion too, but it's the bear that steals the show. This could easily have been a one joke movie that became tiresome very quickly but it doesn't. The gags come thick and fast and there's even a plot that involves Flash Gordon!<br />Very funny and well worth watching.
B004A7UVLC|5.0|I never write reviews but what the hell. Sherlock is a great series. If you're a fan of House or Doctor Who or an admirer of Steven Moffat I'm pretty you will adore this show. Though I recommend that you be patient and buy the physical DVDs. I bought Sherlock season 1 and 2 on Amazon instant video because I'm impatient but you dont get any of the additional footage and outtakes on instant video like you do with the DVDs.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is definitely a must-read for anyone that is serious about transforming their body. Whether you want to use Mike's program or not, the book is still incredibly helpful.<br /><br />The book breaks down everything into simpler terms. From nutrition to workouts, the book explains why and how it works. I fully recommend reading this book before starting any diet or workout plan.

B000V39KDO|5.0|\\"THIS...IS....SPARTA!!!\\"<br /><br />so many great quotes and dialogue in this movie.  really good storyline.  i love how it engages the audience with what I would call \\"male Drama\\".  Brotherhood, community above self, honor, loyalty, verbal quips and some sarcasm of male humor in really not so funny situations if taken out of context.<br /><br />It's a guy movie all the way.<br /><br />The guys are ripped, so women interested in seeing some buff bods would enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like playing it when I'm just waiting for time to pass. And I like the challenge of beating some of the games.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I actually started reading the book at a Nickleback concert on my Kindle ... It started a bit slow, but as previous reviews stated it really get's moving and a can't put down book quickly. I can't wait to get the next one...after I get the kids settled in the new school year!
B0085776BG|1.0|Very disappointed. Too Much CGI. The actors' were boring. Watch Lawrence Fishburne in The Tusgegee Airman from 1995. Its much better.
159448385X|5.0|I bought this book for myself but my wife saw it first and she started it and is really into it.  I can't wait to read A Thousand Splendid Suns.  I love the author's first work 'Kiterunner' and his second novel seems to be just as good.  My wife hasn't stopped talking about it.
B005ZMUTZ4|2.0|When I purchased this product I expected it to be HD quality but that wasn't the case; they rent it in HD but if you purchase it they do not provide the HD. I previously purchased Scooby Doo in HD and that was provided in HD so my expectation was not met and I would be hesitant to purchase epic titles such as Toy Story due to Amazon possibly not providing HD quality.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Ok, I just don't get all the glowing reviews for this book.  I admit I read it in it's entirety in a day, it was an easy and somewhat \\"engaging\\" read based on the plot.  However, I found the characters so...unrealistic.  It was very difficult to connect to these characters.  More importantly, knowing this was YA readng material, I was extremely repulsed by the sexuality within this novel. I mean, teenage girls are the target audience here, and this book fully condones premarital sex and actually glorifies it.  I particularly recall discussions of sex and \\"riding him all night\\" or something to that effect. This book just left a bad taste in my mouth and didn't sit well with me.  Aside from the in-your-face-sex, I just didn't find anything \\"believable\\" about the characters. The long sappy drawn out rambling self- reflections of these characters were so incredibly over the top. All of it. I just didn't connect.

B008U7ZPHS|4.0|Well I was anticipating the arrival of MOA and I was not dissappointed. I was a bit starteld by Franks personality though. Pipers chapters were mostly bland, and some bits of Percy was a bit boring like his dream visions. A liked Jason more though. Not as a chapter ( because he did not have one ) but as a person. Leos and Annabeths chapters saved it from becoming , god forbid, a normal , OK book. Im not saying Percy was a filler, I liked his. Some , not many were not entertaing. So 4 stars. Peace Out.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|My 1-year-old daughter enjoys this snail quite a bit.  She enjoys batting it and hearing the music (I think she's enjoying learning about cause-and-effect and also being able to make something happen by herself--music and lights).  From the description, I wasn't sure how the snail rolled--I thought maybe you could set it to roll by itself.  It turns out you have to push it, and on carpeting it doesn't go very far.  But overall it's one of her favorite toys, even though it doesn't do much!
0345803493|3.0|I was taken with the main characters (sub)text of a damaged man from childhood neglect and abuse and totally inexperienced partner and how the unbarred libido and the remarkable, unrealistic, number of orgasms the virgin character Ana experienced with her oh so beautiful lover Christian.  Curiosity caught me with the question, \\"What is the secret or trick to this level of satisfaction in lovemaking\\"?  But too I had to ask who has a partner that bothers with that level of foreplay??? No one or the 1% of lovers, especially seasoned ones in marriage.  So what kept me reading? First it was learning new approaches to the \\"act\\" that are not in the \\"Kama Sutra\\" or in the \\"Joy of Sex\\" but might be worth a try, or not.  But what really kept me reading was the story line, the mystery and suspense novel and love story that dealt with this unlikely couple coming together and working out their differences and obstacles, not the least of which included her partner's baggage including but not exclusive to his controlling impulses, or his damaged personality--missing an adolescence due to abuse, as well as his childhood, etc.  But I was turned off by the repetitive cleanliness and kissing her hair, and smelling their luxurious smells, bla bla bla.<br /><br />But take away the massaging of his wealth and his oh so Adonis type looks and body and her oh so pure heart and impulses and intentions.  And I wonder how the subtext of great sex and adoring struggling lovers deal with the flawed Adonis whom is damaged deeply and in heed of her healing love, if it were trailer trash for the main characters without the money and the oh so sumptuous clothing, yachts, helicopters, gliders, multiple homes, servants, personal shoppers, etc. What if instead of inhaling his sweet scent of lavender and his special body wash and his \\"scent\\" she smells his beer and tobacco, and instead of his muscles he has tattoos????  Would we all be so whetted in our appetites?  And the sex, is not titillating in itsvarious forms, including (b)anal forms, and restraints and spankings and \\"pink\\" in its various permutations. Reality is that most men would not be bothered with such foreplay and just lubricate--usually with a rubber-- instead of making sure their partner is ready and fewer still can tell what a real orgasm feels like!<br /><br />I found myself finally skipping over the oh so predictable 4-6 pages of sex scenes to the text about the drama and their relationship.<br /><br />Most women have to muster up the courage to teach their lovers how to make them ready and please them with the right kind of foreplay.  Our character had not that problem but just baggage and its manifestations and opulent wealth.  Truth is we deal with the former ardently and hope beyond hope we don't have to broach the topic since it is taken as an affront more often than not by our partners to his masculinity!!!<br /><br />Women's libbers could not have liked this book.  Other than noting organisms like we all wish we had, and are fantasy not real life, in spite of the toys employed.  And we're annoyed by her succumbing to all of the 1950s stereotypes of a woman and a wife and ultimately male not female fantasies of us.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Big \\"Alien\\" fan! I was more than ecstatic when I got this in the mail. It's absolutely LOADED with features. They setup a wicked awesome system for inter-movie extras you just have to see to believe. You also only have to go through those opening screens (like all the warnings and copyrights)  on the first disc, not during the subsequent discs. In short, well worth the buy!
B005LF9OCE|5.0|It was nice to be able to purchase and see it the same day, but I really would like to have the DVD's.  Watching them instantly was good, but I don't have anything to go back and watch again, if I wanted to,other than that it was ok.

B000FBJHT4|5.0|I simply had to write something as I read some of the 1 star reviews, I mean everyone has the right to write a review, but I simply can't believe such st...d reviews. If you are a fan of UFOs this is the Book, I mean THE Book.<br />There is really lack of books written by such high positioned army officials, most of the books are written by researchers which go mostly by speculation and guessing, if this is true, and in my opinion it is, then this is no 1 book.<br />1 star reviews with some more than stup..d remarks go by guessing what aliens would and wouldn't do, can't believe it,  upon their assumption of alien mind and intelligence they judge someones first hand account.<br />Just goggle Philip Corso and you will see that he had a real army carrier, you can watch his youtube interviews and if it gets you interested buy the book.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|if all you care about is having all 8 movies in a convenient and compact package this is the perfect buy for you. I have purchased many box sets in the past that have all the little bells and whistles in it. I found that I payed more than double what I payed for this for something I only watched the extras once and then found out that i could find those extras online. I wish I had found a deal like this for all of my prior purchases. I love this set. It has all 8 complete films and in a convenient a little over one inch wide case. as compared to taking up about 5 inches of shelf space. Yay to not having to buy more shelves. I love this product.

034580404X|5.0|The first book was naughty but I expected it coming in from reading some reviews.  The second and third books didn't seem as naughty.  I can't decide if it was because the shock had worn off or what. I didn't think they were any naughtier then some \\"trashy\\" love story novels already out there, I think it was written better then those are!  I really enjoyed the books and couldn't put them down.  I wanted to find out what happened next and just couldn't help myself.  I loved the end of the third book very much.  My imagination of picturing what the characters must look like was fun too!  I encourage any ADULT to read it.
B004LROOUK|3.0|This is a good general guide for Japan, but don't get the Kindle download!  The maps and images are unrecognizable and the publishers are so afraid that you will copy them that they don't give you a size you can even read!<br />  What good is a travel book without maps??
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was very fun to read. Once you start, that's it, you're addicted. It even inspired me to try some new \\"tricks\\"of my own! ;) I'm pretty sure that they'll film a movie based on these novels. I'll definitely be first in line to purchase my ticket! :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love, love, love my kindle, perfect for reading, facebook, checking emails!!  Had a error message on the Draw Some app.... Marmalade...etc....  too many controls.. blah, blah, blah.  Finished the game on my android phone... Kindle worked fine when I went back to it....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I Enjoyed this trilogy very much. I wish there was a fourth book. Hadn't read a book in quite awhile, glad I chose this one
076115678X|5.0|I loved this book and it enlightened me on how to make my hair wayyy healthier!!  I would highly reccomend it! I have lent this book out to a bunch of my friends.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing it and I love just being able to tap the  cards . very easy to play can't wait to try the different levels.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game...play it every day...thanks for adding the dictionary...really helpful when computer comes up<br /> with words I don't know.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is soooo additive!! the beginning levels are so easy but it gets incredibly challenging. wish their were some new levels!!
0425263908|3.0|This was definitely a quick read, entertaining, etc, but it felt like it was literally trying TO BE shades of grey.  it was very very similar, even used similar language.  the behavior patterns that the couple has is exactly the same as in 50 shades, and frankly gets boring and is so unrealistic.<br /><br />good for a mindless beach read.
B0011Z31V8|4.0|This cd has a good selection of Prince great hits.  I have really enjoyed this cd and would recommend any Prince fan to buy it.
1594744769|3.0|WARNING THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:<br />I kept hearing about Miss Peregrine's a lot and well since I work at a book store, decided to buy it and take a look for it myself. The title and cover alone grabbed me and the plot seemed to really peak my interest. For the first few pages, I was totally engrossed in the story - I loved Jacob's sarcastic voice, his relationship with his grandfather and family, and the creepy tone there was...until it hit a predictable snag and took a turn from haunting mystery to a magical fairy tale.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, it's not like I don't like fantasy books but I was really expecting and hoping for this to be a scarey read, and it was at first. But once *SPOILER SPOILER* Jacob enters that loop and goes back in time, I honestly rolled my eyes and stopped reading it for a few weeks *END SPOILER END SPOILER* Then the middle of the story draaaags for a while and becomes a bit repetitive. The peculiar kids did this, the peculiar kids did that, look at what the peculiar kids are doing now - and Jacob is impressed and awed every time. I did find the peculiar kids interesting characters though but I wasn't really all that interested in Miss Peregrine herself - I found her a bit boring and a stereotypical headmistress - nor was I interested in Emma, well, like at all. I found her to be a bit of an annoying brat and the *SPOILER SPOILER* romance between Jacob and her moved way too fast and was predictable. In fact I was surprised at how fast Emma seemed to drop her decades of love for Jacob's grandfather the second time she hangs out with Jacob. Not to mention I thought it was pretty gross that Jacob even liked her, I mean she's basically in her 80s! * END SPOILER END SPOILER*<br /><br />Then the story gets confusing with a bunch of information tossed at you about time traveling, loops, birds, monsters, and other stuff that I already forgot. The story finally starts to progress and get interesting towards the ending but for me I think it was too late. Not to mention the villains seemed a bit too...villainous? If that makes sense. All in all, I had high hopes for this book was a little let down. Not a terrible book but not a great one. Since I'm such a bookworm though I'll probably buy the next book.I think it was too late. Not to mention the villains seemed a bit too...villainous? If that makes sense. All in all, I had high hopes for this book was a little let down. Not a terrible book but not a great one.

B002RVZV9K|5.0|Although I'm not a fan of The Edges' work, the mix between these three musicians is amazing. A must see for any guitar player, musician, or fan of rock and roll.
030758836X|5.0|I just finished Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and found it to be an enjoyable read with plot twists that kept me turning the page late into the night. I had a hard time putting this book down and doing my chores, errands or even sleeping for a few nights! This is my first novel by this author and I will be buying her previous novels. I found the book to be well written, intense, and packed with the love, hate and upheaval that can happen between 2 people when they spend their lives together. Was there cruelty? Was there spite? Was there laughter? Were there tears? Was it human? Was it inhuman? Yes! And it was very frightening, the lengths they went to in order to hurt one another. But finally, a book I could read without predicting every twist and turn and feeling sure of the ending. Thank you for that! As for the ending of this story (no spoiler here), many people were disappointed. I found it perfect.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|We did not care for all the stuff you had to do.we just want to play games.don't want to buy this buy that.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I am able to charge the battery in time. It let's me know visually when I am getting to low for a movie or texting etc... great app.....5 stars
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|easy to play and has plenty of challenges.<br /><br />I use this game to kill boredom and it satisfies this excellence.<br /><br />great 15 min killer.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was well written but for all of the twists and turns throughout the book it left me asking myself \\"why did I read this book?\\" The ending left the reader without closure, only frustration and was wishing I had spent the time cleaning out my sock drawer or doing something productive.
B008BDZP3K|5.0|My favourite Zappa album.  This reissue is from the original analog master, 1969. Make sure that your copy has this detail written on the back cover, if that's what you're after.  Zappa's 80's remix is interesting in itself but it's great to finally hear this original mix on CD - thanks to Gail Zappa. I can listen to this music again and again, and hear something new each time.  The playing is top class and Zappa as always assembled great musicians to play his work. There is a certain 60's TV/movie soundtrack cheesiness pervading the album, and yet it works brilliantly!  I need both versions but for historical accuracy casual fans should probably go for this edition.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Love Bruno mars in concert. This album hads a few different types of songs but it is so worth it. Some remind me of james brown type of music. Love it.
B0087WRGVY|5.0|Wow!  Great rock album I just downloaded from Zune Marketplace.  I felt compelled to write a review here simply because the music is top notch.  Sure I must be lost in 80's metal but this isn't 80's at all!  One of the most enjoyable albums in recent memory.
B008VBYN80|5.0|this game is simple to understand simple to play very enjoyible and can be played by almost any person with an apitite for adventure. great look and play type and well made.
B0063IH60K|4.0|the graphics are so clear!!<br />sometimes is fun to have a relaxing game of solitaire<br />I recommend this game!!<br />get it!
B005LAJ22Q|2.0|Four DVDs in a box with a brochure-ish thingy and a coupon.. DVDs are good. Cannot wait to see the next season. I wonder if the virus is reversible and how much longer Glenn's gonna be alive. If he's dead, I'd stop watching. LOL
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a great game and an easy way to pass the time. just waiting for the kindle version to get updated so I can keep going
0756405890|5.0|Over the years, I've become less and less interested in the \\"high fantasy\\" genre, as the novels I would pick up all seemed formulaic, bloated, predictable, boring, and about 500 pages longer than they needed to be. After hearing so many good things said about \\"The Name of the Wind\\", I finally decided to give it a shot, and it was definitely a good investment of time. This novel is gripping, very well written, and generally resists the tired tropes of the genre.<br /><br />The one thing that sets this book apart is the depth of character for the protagonist, Kvothe (spelling? ...I listened to this book on audio). He is such a fascinating individual, and his mastery of such a wide range of skills makes him an extraordinary character. Musician, bard, actor/player, magician/sympathist, swordsman, demon wrangler, and \\"kung fu\\" master (expounded upon in the second novel, \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\"). But rather than just say \\"he was really good at so and so\\", Rothfuss does a marvelous job of explaining how Kvothe acquired each skill at such a particularly high level of mastery. He does this by telling convincing stories from Kvothe's past, which are layered to create his fascinating character. Furthermore, it's clear that Rothfuss did his research. He either knows about these things, or he consulted with those who did. For istance, his details about musicianship are authentic and complex, clearly the result of hard earned knowledge, not invention (I'm sure some creative liberty is taken, but not a whole lot).<br /><br />Just about any reader should enjoy this book, but fantasy fans will love it- even though it's fairly light on the \\"fantasy\\", in favor of character. Listening to it on audio was particularly enjoyable, in my opinion. I felt like I was being told a great story by a bard at the local tavern, as we sat beside the fireplace with mugs of ale in hand ;)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Although fireproof is my favorite, this one is right there with it, loved it. This movie challenges us all that, when it comes down to making a very important decision in your life that will be the most important decision you will ever make, the question comes up, \\"Will you do the right thing?\\" Or, will you just do what the majority of people would do? This movie shows both sides of that decision, and the consequences, or rewards that come with it.
B000FUF6QS|5.0|You need to see the Wickerman to appreciate its unusual story.  The basics of the story is a British police officer goes to a remote island to check on a girl reported missing.  A set of bizarre incidents turns things around and when he thinks he is making prograess he finds himself in a very desparate situation.  To say anything more would spoil the story.  Edward Woodward does a great job as the policeman.  I cannot attempt to describe the story as it would only make the whole thing sound silly, so you will just have to buy or rent it to find out.
0345803485|1.0|I thought the book was awful.  Poorly written---poorly written.  And oh yeah, it was very poorly written.  Having said that I want to know what happens but will not read the final two books.  But trust me, unlike most movies from books, the as yet unproduced movie will be far superior to the book.  It has to be.
B002ZMZBD2|1.0|I just threw my money away by buying this CD. I wasn't warned that CD is Encoded so it will not play on a computer CD player without forcing you to go on the internet first and forcing you to download their programs. Hey, I just want to listen to the music I already paid for. I don't want to be abused and bullied and risk my computer. I am going to return this.
B00003CXD5|5.0|That is why I purchased and watched this movie.  I figured if a new director I liked LOVED this movie, I should check it out.  [...]    He watched every night with the cast and crew while making \\"There will be blood\\".  He wanted to create something more direct than his usual fair.    It is a fabulous movie and an excellent watch.  It is a John Huston movie which I am a huge fan of and he does make a brief appearance in the movie.    The most fabulous thing watching it was Bogart's darkness he brought to the role.  I had never seen this side of him.  I was more familiar with Maltese and African Queen.  He was fantastic.    Also this version (the 2 disc special) comes with a mini-doc on John Huston.  Which is another great watch.    Hope this helps push you over the edge or save your cash.
B006R1T40I|3.0|I am a huge Bonnie Raitt fan. Have her entire catalogue and have been listening since the 70's. She lost me about mid 90's right after Nick of Time though continued to buy every CD she's put out since then. Slipstream is  really good and very listenable. She can really play and sing a ballad like no one can and it is evident in Slipstream. I find this CD very enjoyable like Luck of the Draw and Longing In Their Hearts. They were good CD's too, i just tend to be stuck on her early stuff like her debut album, Bonnie Raitt, Give It Up and Homeplate. Definately a worthy purchase.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|its great even though i use it to pass my time of boredom :) i was told about this app. :)<br /><br />could have more effects
B008MEM24S|5.0|Even though it is based off of Where's my Water it is still enjoyable and has some new twists that make the game play different.
B0088X7YU0|1.0|Bad CGI, equivalent to an old video game intro.<br />Bad voice acting.<br />Bad plot and story line.<br /><br />Bad everything.<br />Adding a nude shower scene makes it bad for kids.<br /><br />I liked the Starship Troupers movies, I like animated films.  I did not like this at all, it was painful to watch.<br /><br />Buyer beware.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. Love the big numbers. When you want just a plain and easy calculator to use, then this is for you.
B0083WLKBA|5.0|Splendid from start to finish. Didn't want it to end. Can't wait for Season 3 to air and when Season 3 becomes available on DVD I will be purchasing it for sure. This is a must-have Series for anyone who enjoys Period Drama. All involved, acting, writing, directing, etc. are A+++++ and at the top of their game.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|i kind of like it i mean it is okay it could be better and it could be orse so i llind oklf like itl you the truth

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This summer I have read 15 books including Fifty Shades books, Nicholas Sparks, and a variety of others.  I read it 2 times, and could read it Over and over again.  It is by far the best book I have ever read, and highly recommend it! I can't wait for Walking Disaster!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|graphics are wonderful and game is challenging. makes one have to think. I am 64 and really enjoyed this game. brisket manor bored. me but not this game. need more like. it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This software is awesome. I have it installed on my Kindle Fire, my Sanding Galaxy Exhilarate, and on my laptop and desktop computers. I can enter notes on any one of my devices and then access it anywhere. I am always making notes to myself and I use to just text myself but using Evermore is so so so much better! !
0385474547|4.0|This book was an easy read for the summer. It is interesting to read about an African clan's changes through the eyes of a warrior, and was thought-provoking.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I was impressed with this app considering it was free. Not always up to date, like it says right now it's sunny when it's actually about to rain, but i can't complain
B0034G4P7G|2.0|The subject is certainly promising: a youngster creates one of the most successful companies of our day.<br /><br />The problem is with the script and casting. The characters are mostly unlikable. The central character is so conceited that he does not condescend to attend classes regularly, and pays no attention when he drops in. The same arrogance characterizes him everywhere. The male Harvard students show similar arrogance, though to a lesser degrees. As for the female students, they seem to be in school just as groupies for the sex parties.<br /><br />The directing/scripting calls attention to itself away from the story through the gratuitous use of flashbacks and the mannerism of having the characters speak very fast.'<br /><br />The subject deserves a better treatment.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|One of the best stories I've read lately, David Baldacci also can make me want to keep turning the pages and not stop reading.  kk
1400049628|5.0|I had heard good reviews from my friends, and could never get my hands on the book. So I bought this to read and pass time. The book is a solid read, the animations remind me of the ye olde animations from the 70's and 80's cold war info. The book gives a overview if the fictionalized zombie apocalypse would ever occour, and also give detailed accounts of fictional events.  It is a great read and worth the money
B0063IH60K|5.0|I commute daily - about a 50 minute ride each way by Express public transportation. The Mobility ware Solitaire game gets me thru the ride in no time! It is really fun to play and keeps the ol' brain from growing stale during a normally boring ride. I love it!
0486275590|5.0|This has got to be my favourite book i read as a child. RLS is a genius and through his work it inspired me to write my first fiction novel on the Pirates that where in my area many years ago. [[ASIN:B008GNLJOY The History of Pirates in Wallasey & The Hector Hornsmith Chronicles (The Tales of Hector Hornsmith)]] every child growing up has got to read Treasure Island it is a must.
B000JSI7BM|5.0|Am a guy and i have to say its one of my favorite top 10 movies.  The order came in one day early and it was in excellent conditions.  Recommend 100%
B005HSL626|4.0|I will recommend to get this app then delete after a while. The adds pop up a lot but I still like the app.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like it a lot it has helped keep me from running out of battery life and keeps me enjoying my kindle
B003BWERF8|3.0|I love using this with my iPod Nano 6, unfortunately (big disappointment) I cannot.  I use my ipod all day working, and with the wireless option I cannot even make it till mid-morning without the battery being almost dead.<br />I will keep this bluetooth adaptor for times when I only need a charge of less than 3 hours.<br /><br />Am a little surprised that iPod nano is not bluetooth already.  This will probably become obsolete in a year or two.<br /><br />update- on occasion this bluetooth seems to \\"mess up\\" the ipod.  It syncs immediately, which is great, but several times it has caused the shuffle to stop working and replays the same song until I skip to the next one manually, and the next song, etc... I have had to reset the ipod two or three times since getting this only a few weeks ago.<br /><br />Update:  every time I use this adapter it messes up the \\"shuffle\\" feature, and I am forced to restore the ipod nano to factory settings.  Pretty much of a deal breaker for me.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|awesome app! custom sounds simultaneously enhance the mood! love love. love it! please add more sounds when. you can and I'll give 10 stars!
B0063IH60K|1.0|In a word, HORRIBLE.  My guess is that the ads weren't always this bad, hence the stellar rating.  Every time you deal the cards, you get an ad, including video ads.  I even got one for Windows 7, which is ironic given that this is an Android app.  I put up with that for about 4 games before I'd had enough.  I would have paid to get rid of the ads, but there's no paid version of this app, so I removed it and got Solitaire+.  It's only $1.99 and looks and feels a lot like this game with no ads.
6304806434|3.0|As an action movie, this wasn't too bad. It stars Nicolas Cage as a military man who has just been discharged and accidentally kills a man in a drunken bar fight while defending his pregnant wife. Even though it's manslaughter, he still gets a harsher sentence because, as the judge tells him, \\"with your military skills, you are a deadly weapon and are not subject to ordinary laws.\\" 8 years later he is paroled and eager to see his daughter (with whom he has been corresponding via letters) for the first time;unfortunately, the plane home gets hijacked by the nastiest criminals you can imagine.<br />John Cusack and Colm Meaney make decent good guys trying to get him home, and Cage makes a good hero. The action and explosion scenes are terrific, and Malkovich is top-notch as the nasty lead bad guy in a good cast. You might want to see this one.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Why are people saying it erases your progress? All you'd doing is basically starting a new game except without ads.  Want your golden eggs? Go back to the one with ads.
B0034KZE9U|1.0|I am so disappointed in Crocs. Not just this pair, but all their shoes now. I have been wearing them since they began becoming popular in Boulder, CO in 2004 and the material used has changed since then. It is more plastic-like now. But even with that, I wouldn't be giving such a bad review, however this is the second pair I've had that have shrunk and warped by being left outside.<br /><br />Once it shrinks, you can't get it back...useless.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Just like the description said, its a game that is similar to mine craft but with ans awesome RPG twist. I would recommend this game to my friends and family! The Game used to freeze when you were digging but that problem is solved now. I have yet to find anything wrong yet.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|If you like birds, then you will absolutely LOVE this movie. It was hilarious from start to finish with the perfect cast, especially Owen Wilson as Bostwick. It got me into birding and thinking about doing a \\"big year\\" myself. There were several hilarious scenes, and the shots of the birds were beautiful. I think this movie says a lot not just about birds but about life itself.
B000087JI1|1.0|Appearantly movies have different regions they can be played in. In order to play this movie I have to have the type of player it requires. To come to find out this type of player is illegal to buy in this region! How can someone not of informed me of this when placing the order? As for the movie, seen it before and absolutely love it!
1607050072|5.0|FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LOVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND INSPIRING THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU ! THE DESIGN'S AARE VERY CUTE AND EASY DIRECTIONS, THE PHOTOS ARE GREAT TO LOOK AT TO GET INSPIRATION TO PUT YOUR OWN TWIST ON A PARTICULAR ITEM. SOME OF THE REVIEWS WERE NOT GOOD, BUT THAT DIDN'T SWAY ME, IF YOU LISTEN TO THEM YOU MAY MISS A GREAT ITEM AND LOSE OUT ON SOME VERY CREATIVE FUN IN THOSE EVENING WHEN THE SUN IS NOT OUT AND THE FIREPLACE IS ON. SO TRY IT OUT AND HAVE A LITTLE WHIMSICAL FUN.
B004W2UBYW|2.0|I was expecting more but I guess this book just reflects Jobs life.  He never really addressed any of his behavioural issues.  Hence his appearance and disappearance on the Apple scene and his behaviours around the whole situation just seem repetitive and not too exciting...surprising since he is such a guru!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I Bought this DVD directly from Amazon.  It is an excellent quality video.  Love the show.  Have all seasons in my cabinet.
B0088TG252|4.0|The story wasn't anything spectacular. This is just one of those situations where Denzel Washington made the movie better for me. The thriller started off with Matt bored out of his mind and looking for excitement. When he met Frost, he got more than what he bargained for. Frost takes Matt through ups and downs and makes him question his loyalty to the very country he serves.<br /><br />My heart was definitely racing through the entire film, but the ending sent me over the edge. I don't know if I'd watch it again, but I did enjoy the experience.
B0091P6590|5.0|The second season is even better than the first, never dull, and always engaging. From start to finish this show is amazing.
B0086700CM|4.0|Sometimes the controls are a bit sluggish but overall this game is highly addictive.  Would definitely recommend.  Havent tried the social aspects.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|A awesome app from halfbrick! I knew halfbrick from fruit ninja, but this is even better!!!! I love this app!!! GET THE APP! TRUST ME!
B008ETOSYI|5.0|I thought it was an excellent movie! Believeable characters, interesting plot, great locations and very entertaining! It's a wonderful romance, without overt sex or foul language. All in all very well done with a sweet ending!

B007XKEY6Q|4.0|works great for my kindle. do not like all the ads but its free what you expect?  it is fun and entertaining.
B003BWERF8|5.0|If you have an old school iPod like I do, and hate the cord around your neck trying to garrote you or jerk the audio jack out every time you bend over to tie your shoes (I refuse to use those armband things), then this is for you.  It pairs easily with both my sets of Bluetooth headphones and audio receiver and sounds great.  No batteries or charger, its powered by your iPod.  Its also a \\"Luxurious White\\" color!<br /><br />Two caveats:  its really tiny, smaller than an SD card, its real easy to lose.  My first impulse was just to leave it in my iPod all the time (except when charging of course).  Unh, unh, unless you want to say early bye-bye to your iPod.  This sucker will eat your battery whenever it is in.  It will go into pairing mode and will not allow your iPod to go to sleep even if you try to turn it off manually.
B0061S073A|1.0|This app is totally useless if the Kindle belongs to your child.  The app must be manually started after the device is shut off and  - Hello - what kid is going to willingly start an app that restricts their own device?<br /><br />I wanted something that would relieve me of having to physically confiscate and hide the Kindle to keep my child safe, but this app is so easily hacked.. better to say it hacks itself every time the device is turned off..<br /><br />Total waste of time and a massive disappointment.  I wish I could give it 0 stars but 1 is the minimum allowed.
0817439390|5.0|I thought I should review this book here, because I have recommended it many, many times over the years, and beginning with the original edition, have purchased, and given it away to an aspiring photographer at least 3 times over the years.  I have read the few 1 star reviews and have been surprised.  Most of them don't like the book but give no specific, concrete reason why.  Those that do, seem to feel \\"cheated,\\" because it doesn't say \\"beginner's guide\\" and maybe tells them something they already knew.<br /><br />I went back and read the narrative on the Amazon site for each addition.  If you read it carefully, it lays out what the book is going to cover.  It is not intended by the author to be an Ansel Adam's look alike (Ansel already did that as well as can be done, and I'll be the author has read it :-) ).  This book is aimed squarely at someone who is new to a camera that allows you to control the aspects of exposure (for most shooters this means an SLR/DSLR) and wants to know how to do that successfully and correctly.  It is not an in-depth, theory of exposure book.  It is aimed at an audience who needs clear, plain, easy-to-understand explanations that they can take and work with right away.  I have always thought Peterson hit the proverbial home run with this book.  Whenever I have someone start asking me questions about exposure, etc. who is not an experienced photographer, I recommend this book.  I will keep doing so.<br /><br />And, every few years or so, I get out my highlighter and read it again, myself.  Many successful people believe that basis of success is knowing the fundamentals of their craft and practicing them.  Having shot SLR/DSLR cameras for 30 years, I am still surprised to sometimes find (or remember) a gem of wisdom when I go back and read this book.<br /><br />It is not the most sophisticated book on my shelf, but it is a \\"go-to\\" book in many circumstances.  In my view it certainly does what it suggests it will, and what it was intended to do, and does so in a way that has helped many photographers become better at what they do.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|...exactly what it purports itself to do, seems to do it all quite accurately.  Have yet to have anything negative to say about it.
B004J2TPSI|4.0|This Bluetooth audio transmitter is almost perfect.  If you have your audio device in almost any kind of cover/case that causes the RCA audio jack hole to be recessed a little you are gonna have to take that sucker off to use this.  The audio jack just doesn't extend far enough to use without taking the cover off.  If you look at the product photo this seems obvious in hindsight.  I have to do this with my PSP, iPod (old school).  I have to turn it 90 degrees to the screen on my Nook and Kindle Fire if I don't remove the cover.<br /><br />I was trying to avoid the entire cord thing so thought this would solve it until I tried to use it.  A similar dongle with a short cord for the jack would probably work better.<br /><br />Otherwise this works perfect:  pairs flawlessly.  Only other criticism is it only charges with the old style USB cord, not a microUSB.

B002F6FQGK|5.0|I recently saw Florence + Machine live in Denver. She epitomizes elegance, passion, beauty, and skill. Lungs is an enchanting album and it seemed that she would have a hard time conveying it live, but she didn't. She is even more mesmerizing live. Buy Lungs. Buy Ceremonials. Then buy a ticket to her show the next time they come through your town.
B005ZMUXDC|3.0|Tangled is great, kids watched it before we entered disneyland every day  (yes they were up that early).  Unfortunately, it did not download direct on my laptop and had to stream it from Amazon... which was not so great.  Netflix had no stutter, but Amazon kept dropping and having to restart.  Finally downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and works great.

Much more than just a dictionary - there are a few word games, word of the day and a few mini informational articles like &quot;This day in history. &quot;  I use it often.  Also saves words you've looked up previously. I don't know I like that but I just do :) I learn something new every time I use it!

0307887448|2.0|I can't believe there are so many good reviews for this book.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!  (And I'm sure the author would snub my 2001 reference).<br /><br />**SEMI-SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />Actually the book is FANTASTIC up until Wade finds the first key.  The real world the author creates is an interesting and dark place.  I was hoping the story would keep pace after this but instead we meet<br />1) A villain who has the personality of a boss from an 80s video game without the cool sprite to go with it.<br />2) The dialog with Art3mis is painful.  Young love, good--teenage love, not so much.<br />3) I thought it should have gone wide rather than deep with the pop culture references.  After the second half of the book it's just excruciating to read if you didn't grow up in the 80's. I was born in 1983 and I felt like the author was basically turning his nose up at me and my love for video games in the 90s.  It's a bit like reading The Wasteland without any footnotes.<br /><br />**BIG SPOILER ALERT**<br />The ending is terrible.  I guess this means a trilogy of books with the red button getting pushed at the end.
B001O1O71C|4.0|In this fictious book a yong boy named Bruno moves with his family to Out-With ( Awshwitz) because his father recieves a job there....Bruno is terribly lonely there..then one day he meets a small boy his age on the other side of the fence wearing stripped pajamas..at first Bruno doesnt get why he is so sad all the time..the two boys build a relationship and talk almost every day but then something happens to them wich i cant say.<br />  i think this is a must read tho this is really a young adult book due to the content i dont mean inapropriatenes just the theme( the Holocaust) it really all depeands on how u look at it, the Holocaust was such a sad a brutle time tha it might not be right for kids i am a teen and found this story a bit sad. all and all i think this is a great read.
B007NKLTZK|4.0|Former \\"Genesis\\" guitarist Steve Hackett teams up with bass player Chris Squire, previously with \\"Yes\\" to form a new band and this new album. Added to the mix are Roger King on keyboards, Jeremy Stacey on drums and Amanda Lehmann on backing vocals. The track \\"A Life Within A Day\\" includes extra string instruments. Most of the cuts include programmed orchestrational sounds reminescent of \\"Yes.\\" Hackett and Squire perform the lead vocals.<br /><br />The version I have includes a separate DVD that has 3 audio choices. A standard stereo mix in Linear PCM 48 kHz 16 bit sampling, a DTS 5.1 Surround or Dolby Digital 5.1. Both surround choice are well done and for me improved the grandure of the music in general. A CD is also included. The discs are packaged in a nice compact book-like package. I found the music very satisfying especially played on a big system. If you are going to listen through earphones or headphones, the stand alone CD may be a better option. The musicians are very good, but some of the songs become a bit repetitive. Yeah, I liked the whole package.
B00843TZJ2|4.0|I went to a their concert in St. Louis and loved the show so I am purchasing this today.<br />I agree that Stills voice isn't what it use to be but he's still one of the best on guitar.

B005LAII3U|5.0|Let's get this out in the open. This update to Total Recall is an EXCELLENT film. Is it a remake of the original? NO.<br /><br />If you are expecting the original Arnie movie, then go watch that. It's an excellent film. But this is a totally different movie.<br /><br />Don't expect it to be like the original it is not. As much as I would have liked that, it simply was not meant to be.<br /><br />However, this film is highly entertaining (despite the cast, most of which I can't stand normally) and well acted, edited, directed, etc.<br /><br />I put a special emphasis on the special effects. They are highly interesting to look at, well done, and are almost a movie in themselves. I almost liked checking out the sci fi<br />backgrounds as much as watching the onscreen action. VERY NICE!<br /><br />I can't think of any other way to tell how much I liked and appreciated this well done gem. EXCELLENT!!<br /><br />5 stars, and 2 thumbs way up!

B0053KWDES|5.0|Paired this amp with an iPhone 4 & a set of Audio-Technica ATH-M50 and WOW. The detail and low end is jaw dropping. I've tested this amp along with a pair of NOCs400 earbuds and I found the sound there to be improved as well, but the improvement with the cans was nothing short of stunning. The EQ and gain settings are handy and the build quality of the amp seems to be high. The amp came with a small 3.5 to 3.5 connecter, a USB charging cable and a thick elastic band. If you're looking for a headphone amp then look no further.

1439127700|5.0|This is one of the most interesting and fascinating books I've read in some time.  The relationships and interactions of former presidents with each other and with the sitting president since the inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower give insight into their character and their unanimous belief in the protection of the presidency.  Revelations about Nixon are no surprise to anyone old enough to recall his time in office.  Some of the tales that are a bit surprising revolve around Hoover, Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Ford, and Carter.  Great reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in American politics.

B000QCS8TW|2.0|A Game of Thrones is such a joyless tale, all gristle and dry bones.<br /><br />Is it realistic? Not a chance, though it pretends to be. It's purely pessimistic. This is what you would be left with if you sucked all the redeeming qualities out of the world. It's basically, at its heart, a story of disillusionment.<br /><br />Some say he is a good writer, and he is in many ways. His prose is run of the mill, but his dialogue some of the best I've read. It isn't on the nose, and he slips in story in very subtle ways. However, he skips scenes he should show, and only tells about them in flashback, and he pulls away from scenes at the end just to trick the reader, which is just plain bad writing in my opinion. His characters start out as cliches -- the tomboy, the damsel, the spoiled prince, the slow giant who can only say his name, and while some of them pull away from those stereotypes, it takes hundreds and hundreds of pages for them to do it. But the worst thing about the characters is that they are mostly just a bunch of petty and foolish people, no one I would ever want to know, and certainly have no desire to read about. There are a couple interesting characters, and he does give them multiple motivations that sometimes conflict with each other in surprising ways, which is one of the commendable things I can say about him.<br /><br />Confusingly, some have even taken to calling him the American Tolkien. If it were not such an affront to Tolkien it would be quite laughable. What about him is anything like Tolkien? Certainly not the rape and sex scenes, or anything else I can think of. Does he buck tradition? Sure, but not in any way that enriches the tale.<br /><br />If your looking for plot, you should know that this story contains only the inciting incident. Most writers get further into their story the first chapter or two. Maybe the story is epic enough to warrant this, but that really depends how he handles the middle and end of the story, which I definitely won't be reading.<br /><br />If you're a pessimist, enjoy for fill. Otherwise you may find it a meager feast. Notable only for its subtlety, dialogue, and surprising characters.won't be reading.<br /><br />If you're a pessimist, enjoy for fill.

B006ZAZ31U|3.0|If you are looking for a book on the inner workings of SEAL training, special ops or the process of earning the Trident, you are in the wrong place. In no way is that meant as a deterrent. This book is written well & gives a whole new angle on the \\"SEAL\\" story. It takes a while to get going but it basically takes you step by step through the subjects life with all the warts. It is a very moving & inspirational story of one man's drive, passion, tenacity & loyalty to almost everything & everyone he encounters. This, at times, comes at the cost of self preservation. I think the biggest thing I took away from it was that no matter your circumstance, background, upbringing, education, physical limitation(s) that we all have the ability to overcome. I gave it 3/5 stars because only a small portion of the book really gets into the operations side of SEAL & NSW which is why I bought it. Having said that, reading about this man's journey & the sacrifice our operatives & their families endure makes me so very proud to live in this great nation.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Rachel Joyce does a phenomenal job of exploring the pains hidden within the human heart in The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry.  This book captured the emotions that people hold in, usually thinking they are alone, and allowing it to eat away at their core.  I enjoyed traveling with Harold to see Queenie, and uncovering truths along with Harold.  I certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys loving people for who they really are.

B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is a very entertaining game. It is in the same mold as a hundred hex board games before, but the presentation and online play make it a cut above the competition. The graphics are pretty, and you can suspress the animations once you get board of them to speed the game. The three available races are mostly balanced, with a slight &quot;rock paper scissors&quot; effect to their respective special units. The community is relatively small, but there always seems to be a game to be had when you want it. It is a battery drainer, so you're best off playing on a device with a long bat life like the Fire.

034580404X|2.0|Yesterday I finished reading the \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" trilogy.  I am dumbfounded as to why this \\"Twilight\\" for adults is worshiped by women worldwide.  The parallels between the two popular series are quite apparent early on in \\"Shades\\", and in my opinion \\"Twilight\\" was not exactly well-written but the stories are entertaining (and I am just old enough to appreciate \\"Twilight\\" more for the vampiric lore interpretation, not so much heart pitter-patters over Edward, whom I actually do not like - I am more of a Mr. Rochester and Rhett Butler kind of gal).<br /><br />Spoiler alert!  We have a meek and clumsy heroine, who meets an unbelievably handsome and wealthy male.  They are inexplicably compelled to one another, and despite his warning he is not good for her and dangerous, she stupidly insists she can handle herself and keeps coming back for more.  They fall in love, marry within months, and become pregnant shortly thereafter.  The pregnancy is a shock, but despite the young age of the mother is almost instantly embraced and nicknamed by her; the father being a combination of revolted and terrified, and closing himself off emotionally from his new bride.  Somewhere in between, a danger is randomly introduced a good chunk into the stories, and is cleanly and conveniently finished off before the happily-ever-after conclusions.<br /><br />The biggest difference in the series is the \\"mature\\" content, namely sex, although both series do parallel here again briefly during the honeymoon phases when the respective bride awakes with bruises and the groom is ashamed of himself.<br /><br />\\"Shades\\" however deals with much more intense and mature content.  We're not just referring to some sexy sex scenes, but a man that was horrifically abused as a small child and carried with him into adulthood violence, desires to punish, and a will to dominate in and out of the bedroom.  And of course, copious sex scenes that I admittedly grew quite bored reading after the first few and found myself skimming those paragraphs thereafter.  These scenes appear every few pages but honestly I don't think I missed much.<br /><br />In \\"Shades\\". we find our heroine, a young woman with no previous relationship or sexual history, incredibly reluctant and afraid to participate in this man's well-disclosed lifestyle, but finds herself willing to do almost anything anyway to get and/or keep the man.  Obviously, I have a huge problem with this.  Her parents should have raised her better.  I am hardly a prude, but reading the first sex scenes that involved whippings and other tortures were enough to make even me cringe and wished I could drag the heroine out of that room and talk some sense into her.<br /><br />During the weeks of their \\"courtship\\" for lack of a better word, the man's childhood traumas are shared with the heroine, who does in my opinion react appropriately and provide encouragement and loving support.  However \\"Shades\\" expects the reader to believe a man with such a past that is in his late twenties is recovering from his twisted, violent ways because of our heroine in a matter of months, and is \\"all better\\" because of her (although he can never let go of his over-protectiveness).<br /><br />I care not what two consenting adults do for pleasure in the privacy of their own rooms, but the reader was invited into this bedroom (and bathrooms, cars, planes, sexual torture chamber, etc.) so I will pass judgement.  The heroine's rightful hesitancy and putting her better instincts aside for the chance to obtain a man are just outrageous to me.  Man or woman, most of us have dated that \\"fixer-upper\\" and it probably did not work out, for a reason.  Although in most cases I find no reason why an emotionally ill person cannot eventually develop a stable and loving relationship, the ability to do so should come from oneself (and therapy or whatever), not based on the other partner being a sexual panacea.<br /><br />Domestic violence and unsolicited sexual acts have always been a hot point for me.  Sure, it's just fiction but quite frankly I am concerned that this unrealistic story may encourage that abused partner to stick it out for a little longer and try to cure the relationship, or someone to attempt a new relationship they are uncomfortable with because hey... in \\"Shades\\" it all ended happily.  Any man or woman that insists you \\"have to\\" or \\"cannot do\\" something because of their own issues is just not worth having around.<br /><br />Unoriginal storyline, mediocre writing and excessive repetitive sex scenes?  Not recommended.  A lot of people are going on about how the book is not about kinky sex, but about the \\"journey\\" of recovery.  Through sex.  In a few weeks.  Years of trauma healed.

She finally had to concede it is a GUY humor thing----yes it is, guys will love it, gals will be iffy.

1612183956|3.0|This is a little oddity of a book. When two federal agents go missing, Ethan Burke is sent to find them. Upon entering town, he is in a violent accident and ends up in the hospital. Only this hospital is weird and quiet and a bit \\"Truman-eske\\" (the Jim Carrey movie). What is going on? He escapes the hospital and finds an odd town he's in. No one believes that he's a federal agent, no one knows about his accident or the agents that are missing. Everyone seems like they have this \\"perfect life\\"...which is eerily not perfect. Ethan finds that something awful has taken place over the years and that is stuck where he's at.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Twin Peaks, you will probably like this book. Not really my cup of tea but it was interesting to see a book with a scenario like this
0312641893|4.0|When I first heard about Cinder, I wasn't sure that it was something I would want to read. Cinderella meets cyborgs? It seemed a little out there. But after hearing so many good things about it, I decided to give this book a chance, and I am so glad that I did. Cinder is an incredibly inventive spin on a fairy tale and one that will keep you captivated from beginning to end.<br /><br />Cinder is one of the most well-respected mechanics in New Beijing, but she also has a secret - she's a cyborg. She does everything she can to hide this from others, including always wearing gloves and boots in the market. Her family knows the truth, though, and her stepmother constantly uses Cinder's nature against her. But things begin to change the day that Prince Kai comes to the market. Because not only does Prince Kai come, but also the deadly plague that is sweeping the country strikes those near to Cinder. When her stepmother blames Cinder for her sister's illness, Cinder finds herself handed over to the government to be a research subject for an antidote to the plague. But everyone involved in that research will learn more than they bargained for. And on top of everything else, Cinder's struggles with her family and the plague research, there's still the matter of the prince and the ball...<br /><br />Cinder is nothing like your usual fairy tale retelling. The basic tenets of Cinderella are there - the wicked stepmother, stepsisters, a prince, a ball - but the similarities end there. Cinderella was merely a starting point for Marissa Meyer; she expanded the tale into something new and wonderful all on its own. I really enjoyed Cinder's character, cyborg nature and all. Then again, I really enjoyed all of the characters (wicked stepmother and stepsister aside - those two I wanted to strangle). And Iko, even if she was an android, was such a great best friend. I loved how this story had multiple layers, encompassing not only Cinder's struggle with her family and the plague research but also political crises and the hardships that Prince Kai had to endure. Because Prince Kai...who wouldn't want a prince like that? He loved his people and was so dedicated to doing what was best for them. From family tragedy to political unrest he had to deal with more than any teenager should. And yet, with his kindness, he completely won my heart just like a real prince should.<br /><br />There are many surprising twists and turns along Cinder and Kai's respective journeys, though one important plot twist is fairly obvious early on in the story. Despite that, the many layers and especially the sci-fi elements kept me intrigued and made it nearly impossible to put this book down. The only thing I did wonder about was the setting - it seemed that New Beijing could have just as easily have been any other city if the Chinese names and appellations had been omitted. Because I love foreign settings, I was slightly disappointed by the lack of vivid setting, but everything else in the book more than makes up for that.<br /><br />Cinder is a great debut novel from Marissa Meyer and one that will keep you turning the pages because you just have to know what happens next. I can't wait to read the next book in the Lunar Chronicles!rch but also political crises and the hardships that Prince Kai had to endure. Because Prince Kai...who wouldn't want a prince like that?

8590379825|5.0|This is the book that I exactly wanted. This book assumes that you have some previous exposure to programming and therefore doesn't waste time explaining what loops and conditional statements are.<br /><br />Instead it quickly shows the syntax and moves right along.<br /><br />A great time saver for those coming from other languages.
0451169514|4.0|This is only the second book of King (after The Dead Zone) I have read and I must confess it was difficult to stop reading. I really liked the children characters, specially Richie!!! I loved the suspense and I was really wanting to see what was going to happen in 1985 when It came back. Some people are shocked about the sex scene of the children at the end, I found it original, it did not seem to me to be an orgy but really a sharing. However the extraterrestrial nature of It and its \\"animal\\" need of feeding in a 28-year cycle did not seem to me very compatible with the mind games it plays with some people and the role of the Turtle did neither. At the same time I found very original the fact that things that were most of the time visible only to the children were real enough to get them (and some adults) killed.<br />I was kind of nostalgic at the end because after so many things shared together and so much talk about the strength of their friendship, the fact of forgetting everything and everybody (including those lost) looks very sad to me.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I was surprised by how good the book turned out to be -- true and wholesome, unadorned and yet complex. In fact, the first pages were so unadorned, verging on bleak, that I nearly put it aside. Knowing the plot, however, I decided I would soldier on until Harold made his decision to walk -- and I urge you, dear reader, to do the same. Because by then I was hooked.<br /><br />There are so many unexpected twists, so many snapshots of small things that are beautiful, that, having just put down the Kindle after reading it all at one go (despite the work waiting), I know I will be back again, to read it in bits, savoring the undertones of sentences, the shapes of paragraphs.<br /><br />I am not certain how to go on with this review without being soppy and sappy, without saying something utterly predictable and boring, such as \\"This book echoes my faith in the basic goodness of humankind.\\"<br /><br />The thing is, though, that it does.<br /><br />Dear reader, choose a day when you don't have deadlines, when you can sit -- preferably in a park -- and give yourself over to the language of the book. And when you are done, replay it in your mind, as I am doing, writing the review. You will surely not regret it.<br /><br />Archibald MacLeish, in his \\"Ars Poetica\\", wrote: \\"A poem should be palpable and mute / As a globed fruit...\\" This book is not mute, but it is palpable. Its rounded warmth is still quite present within me. Thank you, Rachel Joyce. Thank you, Harold Fry.

B005UBNKZG|1.0|I was so excited to build this new computer after work. When I opened all of my stuff, the only thing missing was the CPU. I got the box and opened it, but only the fan and heatsink were inside. The CPU was no where to be found. Will update this when I actually have a CPU to review about.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred a few years ago, and I still use it to this day. Maybe not consecutively, as it is probably supposed to be used for, but it still works. When I first bought it, I wasn't avid on exercising, since then I am much more fit but I still pop it in the DVD on those days when I don't have much time for a good workout.<br /><br />The content within the DVD is great, I love Jillian - she's the best drill sergeant you can ask for. The workout are relatively simple to follow but pack a punch if done correctly and efficiently.<br /><br />Overall a good purchase for those beginning to workout or those in need of a good and brisk workout.
B006M4F67A|5.0|The graphics are very sharp. Game  runs flawlessly. Really enjoy it. Easy to download and play. Works well on my Archos tablet.
B00007GZR5|2.0|The movie was really awesome but the only thing I was very disappointed was that it was not closed caption.  I had no way if I was buying a movie that has already closed caption or having subtitles.  Neither were on it.  But I do love the movie and I had someone interpreting to me the whole movie.  I would like to see in the future that there is a symbol that shows \\"CC\\" so that any hearing impaired will be willing to buy without worry!  Please!!

B00873GRU4|5.0|Hugh Howey has created a disturbing post apocalyptic story that deals with individuals living in confined societies in a broken world. A world that we know only as much as the characters do, which is frustratingly little ( who is behind the big brother voice on the radio??). There is a lovely disclosure at the end of each of the books, that just makes you want to keep reading. My favorite is at the end of 'Wool 3', it was a real high 5 moment and something I just never saw coming. I hope that there are more books forthcoming in this series, I know I will be reading them. Overall it is a well written series with plenty of depth, and one really great idea driving it forward. Well done.
0156027321|4.0|I was putting away some books at the library one day when I happened to spot  Life of Pi, a fantasy adventure book by Yann Martel on the shelf.  The cover was interesting and the synopsis made the story seem unique.  It was about Pi, who is an adult living in Canada reminiscing about his childhood in India to a writer who comes to his house.  Pi tells the writer of his journey from a somewhat well-off life in India to his fight for survival at sea when the Japanese freighter he travels on sinks.  Interestingly enough, Pi ends up sharing the freighter's lifeboat with a Bengal tiger, a zebra, an orangutan, and a hyena, who were animals from his family zoo.<br /><br />When my brother mentioned to me that Life of Pi had been adapted into a film and would be out possibly in November, I realized I had better get started on reading this book before the movie came out!<br /><br />To be honest, I don't know if Life of Pi  is for everyone.  It's not a terrible book or anything, but it is slow paced and more drawn out than other books I usually read.  My brother started reading the first few chapters, but after that, gave up, unable to finish it.  And let me tell you, in my opinion, the book moved along faster in the beginning than it did in the later chapters.<br /><br />Despite all this, I did finish the book and I do appreciate the reading, but I don't know if I could ever read it a second time since I found myself skimming through some chapters very quickly.  I don't blame the author though, but I get impatient after reading about someone being on a boat day after day, learning how to survive for the longest time ever. I guess I get bored easily, but alas it's a great peace of literature nonetheless.  I value the uniqueness of the plot and I feel for the character Pi, and at the same time I grew to love his boat mate, a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  One thing that was hard for me to imagine even as a reader, was how a tiger could actually have his own area and senseof privacy on a lifeboat and how a young boy such as Pi could create an elaborate system to purify sea water.  You really have to use your imagination with this book.  And to think that in the beginning of the first few chapters, I thought Life of Pi was a nonfiction that had been wrongly labeled as fiction!  Hah!<br /><br />Another aspect that I enjoyed about this book was the description of Pi's life in India, which included the zoo his  father owned and that he grew up in, his family life, his relationships with others, exploration of life itself (particularly when it came to religion), and his identity at school.  I really liked the short story behind his name, Piscine Molitor Patel and the struggles he went through with it in school.  Those who have unusual, hard to pronounce names, or names that can be easily made fun off can relate to this!  Pi's parents are also interesting characters, particularly his father who definitely has an uncommon and somewhat disturbingly funny way to teach his kids a lesson!  What a way to learn new parenting skills...<br /><br />In the end, Life of Pi left me feeling a little empty because I felt as though I wanted something more to justify the journey I had gone through with the characters; but in a way, the ending made sense because it made the story the narrator told even more compelling.  I guess it's because I'm such a huge Richard Parker fan.
B005GHN2GG|3.0|This book was loaned to me through Lendle.<br /><br />I want to preface my review by saying that I suspect I might be in a reading funk and a lot of books are not capturing my attention like usual.  However, saying that, I still consider 3 stars to be a good book, but not a great book (4 stars) and not a knock-my-socks-off book (5 stars).<br /><br />Characters:<br />Martise of Asher is a slave whose master (Cumbria of Asher, a member of Conclave) has her spirit stone (a spirit stone contains part of a person's spirit so they are bound to however owns the stone).  She is sent to Neith under the guise of being an apprentice of Conclave to aid Silhara in translations (she is really there as a spy for Conclave to find a reason to have Silhara killed).  Silhara is also supposed to help Martise unlock her power (which no one else has been able to do).<br /><br />Silhara of Neith (aka Master of Crows) is hated by Conclave and feared by everyone else.  He is a very powerful mage who has refused to pledge allegience to conclave.  He is brusque and slightly scary at times.  The god, Corruption, has set his eyes on Silhara to be his way into the world.  This is bad and Silhara is trying to resist while also trying to find a way to kill Corruption, but in the meanwhile, Corruption is taking his toll on Silhara's body and mind.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-I didn't like how the author made Martise so \\"plain\\".  It was said at least a dozen times how unattractive he is.  This is a personal preference that I don't like my heroines to be ugly.  They don't have to beautiful, just not so unattractive that that is the first thing anyone says or thinks about her.<br /><br />-***Spoiler-ish***: Silhara, in his quest to rid himself of his desire for Martise ordered himself a prostitute.  I didn't mind that, but he went way way too far with the prostitute for it to be endearing that he didn't end up having sex with the prostitute.  And the only reason he didn't was because (oh how to put this genlty)...his equipment wouldn't work because this beautiful prostitue was not Martise.  I found nothing in that situation to endear Silhara to me.<br /><br />Overall, I would say this was an enjoyable book.  I read the first 40% fairly quickly, then I had trouble getting into it until ~75% then I sucked it down quickly again.nlty)...his equipment wouldn't work because this beautiful prostitue was not Martise.

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Awesome,  awesome game!!! My kids love to watch me play it, and help me with the final spins. But everytime I close the game down, &amp; open it up later I find that I lose some of the items I have purchased. The green check is there indicating I have it, but if I want to equip it again, I have to purchase it again. I don't know if it's part of the game, but it is annoying. But other than that I could play the game for hours. Challenging enough to keep me interested, but not too difficult to get me frustrated.
0307887448|1.0|Wish it was better written. Very sad when an outstanding concept is ruined by clunky, cliched writing. I considered not finishing the book--but persevered. Wish it was worth it.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|Powerful.  Moving.  Wonderfully written, produced, directed and acted.  You'll look a long time before you see child actors doing a better job.  This one will touch you deeply.  It's a keeper!  Many years ago you could go to a movie and come out feeling you had been a part of the story; even surprised that you were back to \\"reality\\" as you exited the theater.  This is one like that--a long overdue feeling.  Well done!
1843913720|5.0|Allan Karlsson climbed out of the window without any particular destination im mind.  He just wanted to escape the party celebrating his 100th birthday.  Not a slave to fashion, he wasn't even wearing shoes, just some brown slippers.  He made his way to the bus station and got on a bus with a stolen suitcase.  Then the fun really begins.  Not only do we learn about what happened after he climbed out of the window, but also about many of the adventures in his very long life - all of them highly improbable, zany, and hilarious.  Especially ingenious is the way the author connects Allan with some of the famous historical people of the 20th century, among them Harry Truman, Mao Tse Dong, Josef Stalin, and Lawrenti Beria.  And you are going to love Herbert (no, not Albert) Einstein, not to mention his wife Amanda.<br />This is a wonderful, crazy, fun-filled book.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|I've been assured by people whose opinions I trust that the books are better than the movie.  I would hope so - and, apparently, never before in history has this been more true.  This movie fails completely.  It's a humiliating portrayal of women, with a whiny crybaby \\"hero\\" with no apparent survival skills - and please don't tell me she was a hunter or archer.  Well, maybe she's the ignorant Hollywood version of such.  It offers no redeeming hope for a better life in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world.  Who would even want to survive in this world?  Even if you successfully kill twenty-three of your fellow young people, your \\"reward\\" would be to go back to poverty or live among the apparent LSD zombies in some far-away city?  Even then, the \\"powers-that-be\\" decide to throw artificial fire, bees or beasts at you.  Action movie?  Absurd, invalid tactics.  Love story?  Hardly; just a weird, undefined \\"relationship\\" between the two leads.  I could go on, but I would recommend you only read the books and maybe consider the sequels to this movie if someone like Spielberg or Eastwood decides to take on the project.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|Anyone who likes their history accurate will be very disappointed in this movie. By the way, the book by Phillipa Gregory is not much better. The three main actors are beautiful to look at, but that is about all. As other reviewers have done, I recommend \\"Anne of a thousand Days\\" and \\"The Tudors\\" starting with series II, if you really are interested in the life of the Boleyns'.

0385040253|5.0|This book is considered the Bible of knots by sailors as well as decorative craftsmen. It is exhaustively researched, well written, and painstakingly illustrated. It contains information from the time when ships were ships ( no stinking motors) and men were men with nerves of steel.<br />  The book arrived as advertised, in like new condition, packaged well, and on time. This was my first Amazon purchase, and I look forward to the next.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|To be honest at first I only bought this book becuase it was in the $3.99 or less book category and it seemed interesting from the discription. But serioulsy you have no idea how happy I am that I have found and read this book. It literally has a little bit of everything in this book from romance to gambling to fighting you would never expect it to have a bit of every emotion in this book but it does. It is amazing and I hate to reread books and I am about to read it again for the third time! I cannot wait for the new book to come out!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Fun game if it worked. Draw Something does not work on Kindle. Constantly crashes and causing every player to wait for other players, therefore not playable. Extremely poor support. Wrote on their site but no response. Uninstalled, but icon would not erase from Kindle device or cloud, and could not be re-installed.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Very fun. Not impossible without spending real money.  Getting to play as the zombies doubles the game.  Simple, addictive, and worth the download.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I wasn't expecting to like this album as much as I do.  It's kind of sexy, Lana Del Rey's voice is sultry and hypnotic.  I love it.  Makes me feel like I'm in a different world when I listen to it, I love her husky tones.  My favorites are Born to Die, Blue Jeans, Radio and Million Dollar Man.  All of her songs tell a love story.  Really a great album, I wish there was more!
B007P6VLRS|1.0|this a sad excuse album that i feel the pumpkins rushed to fill out another album. this is nothing compared to mellon collie, or siamese dream. the songs are just too poppy and funky with its strange vibes and crazy buzzes. needs more grungy guitar! bring back the grunge SP!
B00139XTG4|5.0|I was profounfly touched by the book's philosophy, and examples.<br />For me, it is a must-read. It would be great if everyone understands the limits of human knowledge and pays less attention to mathematically-heavy but inherently faulty attempts in future forecasting.<br /><br />Though, in many cases the book is overly lengthy and re-articulates the same thoughts. I was also tried by author's intention to be a bit old-fashioned and academic. Yet, I more than agree to bear these drawbacks of such necessary and brave work.
0345803485|1.0|I heard so much hype about the series that I felt compelled to read it just so that I am in the know.  After the first book, I was extremely angry and since I hate starting something and not finishing it, I read the second book which made me even angrier, and by the third book, I was just numb.  I do not know if I am feeling this way because I am relatively close to the stage of life that Ana is in but it makes me angry that the books made it seem too easy.  Life is not that easy and perfect!  First off, I do not know what world she lives in but all of her closest friends are gorgeous, smart, rich, mature, and good.  All the guys she knows go to Harvard, Princeton, or Yale and they are all head over heel with her.  She has a best friend whose parents bought her a condo and she is living there almost rent free.  I would really like to know where she hangs out because what is the chance of that happening to anyone?!?!  Then she meets this billionaire who is not only young and drop dead gorgeous but has the hots for her and then he eventually falls in love with her.  I have more chance winning the lottery than for this to happen.  The writing is sub-par and almost childlike with no depth to the characters.  The books rely solely on the erotic scenes which got very annoying and boring as time goes on.  Who has time to have sex a million time a day and she has an orgasm every single time.  Again, I want to know what she is on to have such luck...Ok she has to endure Christian's possessiveness but for such a catch, I think anyone would tolerate minor flaws which end up not being flaws anyways.  They live happily ever after at the age of 22 and 28 and have lots of babies and money and will save the world!  I feel so emotionally drained and frustrated by these books that I wished I didn't read the books at all.  Now, they are going to make movies out of this and torture us even more. The books were horrible, I can't imagine how bad the movies will be.  Don't waste your timeand money, do yourself a favor and read something else.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a great game and it says what it means, ad free!

If it bothers you soo much well pause the game look to the right corner and click the pig and poof .. pause menu &quot;ads&quot; are gone!! OMG its amazing!.. -.- People are so stupid! Ravio you did a great job and I love this game!&lt;3

006145205X|1.0|Book starts off great with seemingly good solid logic. However Ridley goes off the deep end. The guy wants to downplay scientific theory's effect on the industrial revolution as little or none at all. He goes on to suggest science has little influence on technological innovation, that is comes from \\"tinkering business men instead of thinking boffins, by hard heads and clever fingers\\". He basically dismisses Issac Newton, his contribution to calculus and its impact on engineers. He makes an attempt at discrediting James Watt's degree in mechanical engineering as having little effect on his improvements to the steam engine.<br /><br />He gets even more ridiculous, saying that innovation in Silicon Valley comes more from the coffee shops and garages than the Stanford Labs. Then to really make himself look silly he asks \\"for which scientist would you give credit to the search engine\\". How about Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who actually developed Google in a Stanford Lab while working on their Ph.Ds. Then they go on to hire a bunch of top Ph.Ds (aka Scientists)to keep on improving the search engine.<br /><br />It's completely insane and completely wrong. For any part of the book to have credibility I would have to fact check it completely, because if he can miss by so much on the roots of technology and innovation then odds are the book is filled with errors and bad logic. I'm angry I wasted time on this book. I say that with a smile on my face, because I just can't over how off he is and how much I enjoyed the first part of the book. Hopefully my time spent on this review will spare others.

1466401885|5.0|When i started reading the first chapter of this book i almost put it down without continuing. I couldn't remember buying it on Kindle but kept going on only because i thought i must have read the blurb and like it at some point in the last month.<br /><br />Once i got a few more pages in i was glued to the book and couldn't bring myself to put it down. I read for 6 hours straight that first night (which was Wednesday). I finally pulled myself away at 2am in the morning and only becuase i had to be awake in 4 hours for work. The next day dragged and i almost tore myself away to read the rest of the book.<br /><br />This book has such a fantastic dynamics, character chemistry and builds the story and character's in such a way that it keeps you wanting more. At times i found myself welling up and at other times i was so stressed and just wanted them to 'work their shit out' but overall i was entangled in such a way that i just couldnt stop reading.<br /><br />To say i loved this book would be an absolute understatement. It was gripping and compelling and romantic and funny and had just the right amount of cheeky-ness.<br /><br />Highly recommend it and have just started re-reading it because i just don't want to leave the world created in this book. Book hangover at its best :)

On the other hand, love Peeta...great casting, as for Gale...well, he was in very few scenes...another disappointment.  If you hadn't read the books, you would have no idea who these characters were.... nothing really tied them together, til the flashbacks....I liked the movie, will get the next too, but wish they would make Katniss look like a 17 yr old.
0812993292|4.0|Most people have favorite genres. It may be a few genres or a lot but we all have types of book we enjoy reading. There's a comfort in the tropes of familiar genres. Reading outside of them is an experience itself on top of the value of the book. I consider myself a many genre fan. I shy from historical fiction and non-fiction but outside of that I'm open to anything. My reading history however shows a sharp preference for Science Fiction and Fantasy. Reading The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry was first and foremost an experience I haven't had in a long time.<br /><br />In many ways my reading rather mirrored the pilgrimage. It started off slow as any journey most. It had uptimes and downtimes and moments of doubt where I wasn't sure I would be bothered to finish it. This sounds like a negative criticism and it isn't. It's a positive one. It's why I enjoyed the book so much. While Harold was discovering cities from a completely new perspective I was discovering chapter upon chapter of a narrative style the likes of which I was not at all accustomed to reading. It was fascinating and compelling.<br /><br />The tale itself manages to be so successfully not clich&eacute; I kept reading chapters as if they were scenes from a movie. Assess which parts would work on the screen, which parts would be cut. Changes that could be made to make the picture more palatable to a wide audience. All because I somewhat desperately want others to share the journey of Harold Fry with me. It's a fantastic journey about breaking out of the ordinary. It's a picture of faith in it's most fundamental form, capped off realism that doesn't detract from the faith but tempers it into something new. Harold is an interesting character watching him grow would have been an interesting story by itself but Harold also has to react to unexpected change and interact with people from his new perspective. While that aspect of the story isn't as fleshed out as his personal growth, it served a realist function and doesn't reduce the rest of the story. Quite frankly I don't see what else you could ask for. Even at it's most slow and most depressing the story never really dragged my mood down. It was just constantly uplifting. As a reader, I felt invigorated with Harold as he learned more about what he can do.<br /><br />I've never heard of the tale of Harold Fry before. I never knew of the original radio play or the expanded epic comedy. That aside I can and do easily recommend this book to anyone who wants a good story.<br /><br />I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads.and doesn't reduce the rest of the story.

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|1. The game is very simple, but you find yourself getting sucked into it and playing all the time. 2. Sometimes it seems like the game just wants to make you lose, which isn't that great. 3. The achievements were great to get and added a lot of variety to the gameplay.
1907444033|5.0|A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO ADVISING ON TAX CREDITS, INCLUDING OVERPAYMENTS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you're a tax adviser, or possibly a family law practitioner dealing with clients plagued by tax problems, you should acquire this book, recently published by Spiramus.<br /><br />Distinguished by its accuracy, completeness and straightforward language, this is an excellent work of reference would also be more than useful to the general reader keen to understand more about how tax credits work... how to claim... and who is entitled to claim in the first place.<br /><br />In case you didn't know or need reminding, LITRG is the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, described here as `an initiative of the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) to give a voice to the unrepresented.'<br /><br />Tax credits have not been without controversy and although the UK Coalition government apparently aims to set out a new approach to welfare provision within the next five years, several million families still claim tax credits.<br /><br />All of which mainly explains why numerous tax and welfare advisers have had to acquire an understanding of tax credits in order to advise their clients appropriately.  This book therefore aims to explain clearly, yet in detail, the law and practice of tax credits, for the benefit both of tax specialists and welfare advisers.<br /><br />Within its approximately 350 pages, the book covers the full spectrum of issues pertaining to tax credits, from the history of rules and concepts - relevant ones that is - to the vexed area of overpayments.<br /><br />Speaking of which, if you check out Appendix 4 you can read the full text of the HMRC leaflet on overpayments.  `An overpayment means we've paid you more money than you're entitled to...' it begins cheerily, before going on for another ten or so pages, about the ramifications and procedures.  Small wonder, then, that the powers that be in these matters have been criticized of a number of things, including `poor administration'.<br /><br />All pertinent commentary on tax credits, including working tax credit and child tax credit is included in this useful text. The section on overpayments just mentioned comprises two chapters which explain why overpayments might occur, how to avoid them and how to challenge them.<br /><br />There is considerable emphasis on rights and remedies available to claimants confronted with wrong decisions.  (The aforementioned leaflet is, after all, about how to deal with the HMRC's wrong decisions).  There's further useful advice on how to conduct appeals, disputes and complaints, plus commentary on how an adviser should deal with HMRC, based on the experience of the authors.<br /><br />In line with the aims of this publishing house, this is a practical and professional publication which no tax specialist or welfare adviser should be without.  The book is stated to be up to date as at 1 June 2012, with further updates available on the relevant websites.at be in these matters have been criticized of a number of things, including `poor administration'.<br /><br />All pertinent commentary on tax credits, including working tax credit and child tax credit is included in this useful text.

0525478817|2.0|Ok so I got this book because everywhere I turned this book was popping up and it got phenomenal reviews on amazon and was all over Barnes and noble etc etc.  Normally when a book is as hyped up as this one is it does not disappoint.  Well this book is the exact opposite.  I'm the type of reader that flies through six hundred/ seven hundred page books without a problem and I enjoy books with substance which I figured this book would have.  I have been reading this book for three weeks now and it does not seem to end.  This book is so awfully boring plus I guessed what happened before getting to the end.  Nothing really happens in this book it's just a day by day count of totally unbelievable teenage characters.  No teenager I know talks or thinks the way these kids do (well maybe hipsters) but whatever.  This book really disappointed me.  I was expecting this great emotional roller coaster ride of not being able to put this book down and all I felt was blah is the chapter over yet?  I'm just highly disappointed by a day by day encounter of two teenagers.

B004XE0P5E|5.0|I am one of those who prefer Bon Iver to Emma, though I am a huge fan in general. This music is special and the word that gets to the center of it is haunting. Haunting tends to wash a bit both ways and the power of the music here is partly charged by this melancholia that can be overpowering. It can be hard to listen to if you are going through a change in your life of any type: this music will inevitably take you back to where you were, even if it were only one month ago. Yes I do hear Bruce Hornsby in here as well as threads of Neil Young and even the Beach Boys from around Smiley Smile time. And what's bad about hearing any of that? Since when is hearing echoes of Hornsby bad? What's tough, if not bad, is that this music gets right into one's soul. And it occupies a space that sometimes I am wary of visiting.
B0016OOS16|5.0|I debated over getting this for over six months but I am very pleased that I finally decided to get it.  It takes a bit to get used to and figure out preferred settings but can be very useful if you just get past the initial frustration of learning to use it.  I would recommend this for any 3D modelers.  Although I like the portability of this 3D mouse I think I will probably upgrade to one of the pro models for the programmable buttons so I don't have to switch between the keyboard and mouse as often.  Quality of this product is very good, take the plunge.

Next time I tried the squeal or noise was very loud and made the conversions unacceptable for playback.  I have shipped it back to the company today with a cost involved of $20.00.  I presume they will repair or replace since it is under warranty.

030758836X|3.0|Others summarized the plot well.  The beginning is very gripping and original, but the second half--and especially the ending-- are not believable and not satisfying.  It is almost as if the author's agent read the first half, saw it was a sure bestseller and movie, and rushed the author to finish it with much less attention to detail than she began it.<br /><br />Warning to the many readers who prefer books with a sympathetic hero or heroine--look elsewhere.

0307341577|5.0|Oh.my.goodness. Every once in a while there is a book that thrills me in every way, shape, and form. Listen here my friends and when you're done, go out and buy this book  Dark Places by Gillian Flynn! I will warn you, the title is exactly what the book is. This is no subtle beach book to be read in the shade on a lovely Sunday with a glass of lemonade. (I know that's my normal routine). This is a search your soul and thank God that you're good and not this kind of evil book. Too dark? No, just the right amount.    First I will start by how I found this gem of a book. If any of you have a Nook and have looked at any of the best-seller lists out there you may see the title \\"Gone Girl\\" keep popping up which is this author's latest. So, I kept seeing it and finally added it to my wish list. Of course once I did that, Barnes & Noble was oh so kind to suggest more titles by this author. This book was her 2nd written and out of the 3 total, had the most interesting plot to me. I will be reading her debut and her newest because this woman has TALENT! She has a gift with words that fellow writers like myself can only dream about. Yes, I can tell a story, and I hope one day someone out there will want to pick up what I'm putting down but Flynn has a mastery for the mystery novel.    The story follows Libby Day, a low-class, low self-esteemed young woman who is really down on her luck in life. When she was a young child, she was the only witness to her mother and sisters' murders and her brother was the one accused of committing the crime. Libby helped put him in jail by testifying against him. Years later, as she runs low on funds, she entertains the ideas of a \\"fan club\\" (of the totally creepy nature) that is convinced her brother is innocent and will pay her to investigate the night all over again and see if she will recant her testimony.    The pace of the book goes back and forth between present time and the day of the murder and is told from different family member's points of view. The anticipation builds as the real story unfolds as to the who's and why's of that terrible, unforgettable night. Libby must decide if she wants to keep searching and go back on everything she had already come to terms with or just let it rest and let her brother rot in jail when he may not be as guilty as he originally seemed.The ending? Amazing! Not at all what I was expecting. I can't say much more without giving it away. The best thing about this book is the way in which Flynn writes. The descriptions, the conversations, the different personalities coming through in the characters. Everyone was so unique and had individual voices. It's not easy to tell a story through different mindsets and this one flows effortlessly. Bravo Gillian! Bravo! I cannot wait to read the next one.    Final Verdict? If you don't read this, you are seriously missing out on a great book. I made my husband read it next and am so anxious to hear his report.

B007549YM4|1.0|The opening scenes for The Divide show us a firey nuclear hell unleashed on New York City, a mad dash to get out of a building, and finally we see a lucky few manage to force their way into a basement before the door is slammed shut. The stage has been set for what should be an interesting couple of hours. Maybe a dozen or so characters, seemingly a random bunch that just happened to make it into the same place at the same time.<br /><br />Unfortunately The Divide quickly begins falling apart in many ways. First, within apparently a few days of the total nuclear destruction of New York City an (theoretically) US government agency of some sort has set up shop outside the basement door. This agency is not FEMA out to find survivors and ferry them to safety; no, armed with machine guns, they are out to confront survivors and take by force any children among them, then kill off any adults.<br /><br />Although the sole child in the group is grabbed, injected, bagged, and wisked away from the group, the machine gun armed thugs in futuristic hazmat suits apparently have had almost no training in handling automatic weapons or finding and killing targets. What should have been meat on the table for these thugs turns into a catastrophic loss as they lose two of thier own, including weapons and the suits, for the loss of none of the survivors.<br /><br />The survivors, as well as the audience, wonders what the heck was that all about? So one of them suits up and ventures out. What we find is that this government agency appears to be conducting some kind of disections, tests, or experiments on children. It is near impossible to figure out what they are doing exactly, but what ever it is, it is barbaric, making these government agents seem like some evil aliens from another world. Predictibly, the survivor's disguise doesn't hold up long and he makes a mad dash for the basement, dropping and leaving the machine gun along the way.<br /><br />The government agency apparently decides that welding the door shut from the outside is the best way to keep the rats in the cage, so after this point in the story that door is never opened again. With all of the rats in a well sealed cage and limited supplies with no foreseeable way out, the survivors quickly degenerate into subhuman beings, driven by animal-like instincts and little regard for any kind of community spirit. We are shown torture (both physical and mental), and reapeated rape or attempted rape. Eventually this all leads to a predictable sole survivor who seems to be the one keeping a shred of humanity in an insane environment. This survivor's final act is to shed that last bit of regard for others and purposely abandon the last few to a horrible fate.<br /><br />In the end, the viewer will feel both robbed and cheated. Robbed of two hours of life. Robbed of any explanation for the actions of the mysterious government agency. Cheated by the director's insistance on repeatedly having seeming rational characters make irrational decisions for no plausible reason. Granted, this does happen in real life from time to time, but almost every character in the film repeatedly makes gratuitously bad decisions. It is also hardly believable that a group of somewhat average people would degenerate so quickly into psychotic excuses for humans. If the basement was located in the bottom of Rikers Island prison instead of an average apartment building, this story in this movie might have been a bit more plausible.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Took a couple of tries to get it to download, but it finally worked.  Great content, of course, especially with the Tales of Mystery.
B0009K8L5W|5.0|Really great music, low price. Pies Descalzos is still a Classy album. Shakira's work with impoverished children through out the world is a great reason to support her and her work by purchasing this album. Plus I'm a little old school, I prefer having a physical CD when purchasing music. I can convert it later to a mp3 format for my Android and computers.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Like so many other reviewers, I loved the first few books and found this one to be mind-bogglingly long-winded, pointless and boring beyond belief.  Each time I started a new chapter (and picked up the story from the perspective of another character) I kept hoping the pace would pick up but it never did.<br /><br />What a letdown!
B003UYUP58|4.0|The Emperor of All Maladies is a beautifully written, exquisitely detailed account of the entire history of cancer, even though it's not a subject everyone chooses to learn about.  Often I had to stop midsentence to marvel at the precision, the amount of detail and the remarkable evidence of the quantity of research that must have gone into this book.  Yet. it is truly a page turner!  I regretted having to read it in short segments due to time constraints.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It isn't totally awesome but I think it's quite fun.  Plus,  you can't lose the pieces.  I might like it better if there were more complex puzzles.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|$2.99? Are you kidding me? This was easily the best book I've read in a long time. I'll make it up to you, dear author, by adding yet another five star review to the hundreds you already have. I also promise that when this book is available in print, I will buy it, adding it proudly to my bookshelf with my other favorites of all time.<br /><br />In the meantime I will wait as patiently as possible for the sequel. But please don't make me feel guilty again by asking such a ridiculously low price. Your work is worth much more than that.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is a very well written book.  I am not quite finished yet, because it is a very long book.  But it holds your interest.  I litterally cannot stop reading.  Great book!
B0006AVKW6|5.0|I was always a fan of the movie so I figured I should read the book. I prefer the book mostly because it gives the story more substance and the other short stories are remarkable. It's nice to have a book with some substance rather than a cheap romance with a gimmicky plot :)

0374214913|4.0|What I loved about this book:<br /><br />The writing<br /><br />The characters - fun to hang out with, sometimes a little exaggerated but ultimately believable; they're not 3-dimensional but not cartoonlike either. They're quintessential millenials -20-somethings who live comfortably in the tech world and relate easily to each other.<br /><br />The setting - since I work on the Internet myself I loved the way the characters casually used technology to get what they wanted<br /><br />The environment - The author vividly portrays each place. I could visualize the bookstore, section by section.<br /><br />The first part of the plot - The premise is awesome. Here's a 24/7 bookstore, loosely tended by part-time clerks, and something mysterious is going on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this strong premise calls for a compelling explanation. Why do mysterious people show up and check out books? How does the store survive on few or no customers? Why are some shelves off-limits to the clerks?<br /><br />The explanation was hard to follow. There wasn't much at stake. I'd expect the store to be a front for something with real stakes. I'd expect some real villains hovering in the background.<br /><br />These points might be considered spoilers<br /><br />Even with the explanation, it wasn't clear why this bookstore had to be open 24/7. It's not clear why Clay hung on to this job or why he couldn't get another job or at least go freelance. I know lots of Ruby programmers who are keeping very busy.
0307719219|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  The biggest issue is that I believe that while it's conclusions are sound, there are other important factors that are not adequately considered<br /><br />Essentially, to simplify the premise, the authors demonstrate that  the difference between successful and failed nations boils down to governance. Whether the government is \\"inclusive\\" or \\"exclusive\\" in the sharing of power, wealth and opportunity.  This is pretty obviously a sound conclusion and I think the authors do a good job of making their case.<br /><br />What I am concerned about though, is that most situations are not so clear cut. There is a continuum of governmental \\"styles\\" with the current trend moving toward being less inclusive regarding the opportunity to produce prosperity and more toward being \\"entitlement\\" oriented.  What happens to a nation when the governments takes on a Robin Hood role? Won't a nation also fail if there are fewer and fewer individuals producing prosperity and more and more who are consuming instead of producing?<br /><br />The conclusion of this book is good. It just doesn't go far enough to be of any help in today's society.  It does explain the problems in many third world nations but does not address the industrialized world. As such it is a very interesting academic exercise with insufficient relevance to today's most pressing issues.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|definitely fun but I dont really want to spend money or give my credit card information to some random company either.
1476712042|5.0|I read this after 50 shades of grey and I really loved it. It's a really good roller coaster of emotions book. After reading this I read Easy by Tammara Webber and equally enjoyed it.
0345803485|5.0|I thought the books were perfect!  It's nice to be able to sit down and slip into a book you get totally lost in.  The story between Christain and Anna leaves you constantly wanting to know what they'll do next, what their next adventure will be, what the next step will be.  Unfortunately I read these books entirely to fast and wish there were more.
B00884GR0W|1.0|This is a more violent and less interesting knockoff of Minecraft. Controls are lagging and difficult.  It is hard to move your character and the focus is on fighting and not on building.
0525423656|1.0|I liked the first book but this one was much less interesting and too much focused on teenage romance. The setting did not lend itself to interesting details about this society as first book did.
B007ZKY7XO|1.0|I have never started a line in front of a venue 3 hours in advance until I heard Scissor Sisters. When I heard they were opening for Lady Gaga that year, I thought, \\"Well, that's what happens. Junk-radio bubblegum boring music gets to headline while brilliant, under-valued artists get shoved into their shadows...\\"<br />\\"You make a day go by, just like a breeze.\\" No, that's not from some cheap hallmark card rip-off, that's a line from their song \\"Best in me.\\"<br />No song on this album sounds anything like what they used to be capable of. My husband and I were so excited about this album, and as we sat and listened to the first song, and then the next, and the next, our smiles faded. Eventually, we just had to turn it off. Is someone from the band missing? Are their lives just too simple and boring now, that they have nothing interesting to make a song about? The lyrics are worse than the Black Eyed Peas now. Horribly disappointing. One positive review on here said that the album needed to be listened to more than once; that it all flowed together. So I listened, and relistened, and relistened. Still sucks. The band was so familiar, with such a witty way of delivering their message. The message now is clear - we need everyone's money now, sorry.<br />Good-bye Scissor Sisters. You were so substantial and fulfilling; now you are just fluffy cotton candy.

B0084IG8TM|1.0|To start off, this movie is the very essence of terrible film.<br />While I did expect the film to come a bit short compared to the book,<br />I was rather depressed by how lack luster the movie actually was.<br /><br />For starters, the film appears to be aimed at an age level population of like 7-10, when in fact, the books are aimed at a young adult population, which I'd say is anywhere from 13-17. This fact makes it seem as though the movie was aimed towards the young family movie genre, when it shouldn't have been.<br />The violence is minimal, the terror behind the games is missing, and the blood and gore associated with the book is not there.<br />While I did not expect some slasher film about blood hungry tributes, I was definitely expecting a bit more edge and violence.<br />I also understand that to fully experience the true wonder of the book, the movie would most likely have to be rated R, and it's totally understandable that they minimized everything, but for a PG-13 film, I felt as though I was watching a G movie, with instants of small violence.<br /><br />I guess it all comes down to taste, considering a number of my friends love it (but aren't huge action/violence/explosion film fans).<br />I personally don't think it delivers however,and while there are some strong points, they're overshadowed by the poor acting, horrific dress, and completely minimal plot.
0375507256|5.0|Book far exceeds expectations. Arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />A challenging read in some aspects, but if you review certain parts, it amaze
B002L5KL5G|5.0|I was about 11 years old when I first saw this movies. Because of this movies a can remember what I was wearing, doing before I started watching it, and what I ate while I watched it.

B008MEM24S|5.0|fun to play and challenging at times. and of course Perry makes it that much more fun to play and enjoy.
030758836X|5.0|I am a reader who used to love mysteries but find myself bored with almost all of them now (same old...same old). \\"Gone Girl\\" was fresh and totally fun. This murder mystery did combine a who-dunnit with a fascinating relationship story. There are alternating narrators each chapter - Nick, the husband of the woman-gone-missing, and Amy, the missing wife. Amy's narration is done through diary entries written over the course of their relationship. There are so many details that made this unique for me. I liked that Amy's parents were famous for writing a series of kid books, Amazing Amy, based on an idealized version of their daughter. I like Nick's relationship with his twin sister. There are lots of things that made this novel fresh and fun. There are twists and turns as the novel turns blacker. One detail about the end did not sit right with me, but I won't be a spoiler and specify that. Overall, I have not enjoyed a mystery this much since the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series
B001BKTEZA|2.0|If you want to get started by reading the sample, don't waste your time downloading it. The sample consists of the introduction, written within the last 10 years. It is not the beginning of the book. Disappointing.

B000MD9UJC|5.0|I have several Mini Maglites that I stopped using because I bought several small cheap 7 and 9 led flashlights that were brighter. I bought this to add life to my old maglight. In testing side by side with my cheap 7 and 9 led flashlights this is slightly brighter and the adjustable focus allows a slightly sharper and brighter beam or a wider beam which makes this better for walking at night. It is also a little brighter but not the focus range of the original bulb.  A good upgrade but I wouldn't buy a new Maglite just to put this in. You still have the feature of turning on and off with the lamp head.  The switch allows you to leave it at the focus of your choice. If it doesn't work the first time just turn the led 180 degrees. After 2 years I have had no problem with the switch. I would have gone thru several of the original bulbs by now. Also several of my cheap flashlights (2 for $5) have now bit the dust. If I can find my other Mini Maglites they get the upgrade.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This CD hits all the marks. It's classic Jason Mraz form, but this album is different. You can hear the emotion and passion he has for the album in his vocals. I'm impressed and a forever fan. I normally don't purchase albums, but I actually think this was worth every cent.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|After seeing the concert I realized that it's been a long journey since Scoundrel Days.  Morten's face shows the long way and so does it's voice, however the passion and love for the music is still much there.  This disk is a summary of memories and would be much appreciated for the people who's been along the way.  If you're a fan then it's a must.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is fun and challenging!  but wish it would leave the answer once you get a perfect, so I could look at the pattern.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Great video recording from a show in 2011 just a week before I saw Joe in my town.  What an incredible talent!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I run on a kindle fire and I cant find a place to download it for free. any advice? please help asap as I love this game
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This application is  pretty accurate, I am thinking of upgrading to the version that doesn't have any ads. Other then the ads seems like its pretty good, however it does seem to use alot of the battery its self.
1401235417|5.0|When batman started to go crazy it was like what the fudge Is happening. In a cool way then I was like this book was awesome when the pages started to go sideways then upside down to show batman isn't all there so this had a great story and pretty good art work this is a must buy can't wait for volume 2 and the dark knight & the dark knight rises was awesome, kPop 4 life (bigbang & Fx)
B00005JKG9|5.0|DVD was in excellent condition and shipping was a breeze.  Great item, Very happy with both the quality of the product and the discription that was provided to me when ordering this Movie
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I think any book that gets people to read is a credit to the author.  Not saying this trilogy is great, but the act of getting so many people to read again is awesome!  Remember what the Harry Potter series did for our children when they made their debut?  It got them interested in picking up a book!!  This is what E.L. James has given to women (and men?)  I ordered the physical books, simply because after reading the sample, there was no way I could have enjoyed the books in any other form.<br /><br />This is a love story, plain and simple.  A strong dominating love story between Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. In between this love story, the pages are filled with how shall I write this delicately?  Sex so passionate; a room of pain filled with every sex toy made to inflict pain or pleasure  (we aim to please Ms. Steele...) to take you from the gates of pleasure to... well tears of pain?  These books were not written for the prudish, or the squeamish.  I read the trilogy as I read any other work of fiction, for pure enjoyment, and oh how E.L. James delivered in this trilogy!<br /><br />Sometimes we need to bring some excitement into our very busy lives, and this trilogy had women um, rediscovering their husbands after 4 or 5 years?  E.L. James, please give us another book, written from Christian Grey perspective!!!
B00821BLX4|5.0|This adapter ring bayonets in place, will accept 40.5mm filters and includes an Olympus lens cap, all of which make this a useful item, whether or not one gets the converter lens. FYI, if using the converter, remove any attached filter as it will vignette with a filter in place.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game!  Appropriate for all ages.  Beautiful graphics and fun mini games. The goals are both challenging yet not too difficult to reach.
1451696205|5.0|This is one of those books you read, get to the end of the book. Close it with some regret because it's over. And then go back and start at the beginning, and immediately read it all over again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Get this game you have to get it for kindle only is a awesome game :) if you get is you will be stuck to the game I just got it and it and I'm on level 6 and it told.me.to rate so here's my rate :) * add free*
B0063IH60K|3.0|the game is ok it often deals &quot;random deals&quot; that are actually unbeatable so you might find yourself constantly asking for another random deal but other then that it's really enjoyable and I love the fact that you can submit your own picture for a background instead of the usual green background
1609611543|5.0|Wow...What an informative book! It will certainly change how you view that french bread and crumb cake. Dr. Davis writes clear and precise technical information we lay people can understand and retain. The book is riddled with humor and case histories sending home the important health messages we all need. I have purchased 6 more volumes for friends and family that have issues pertaining to this information. It's a fast read that will wake you up to important health concerns.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|sounds are so beautiful and relaxing love it must try this app one of my favorites. makes me want to sleep
1466401885|5.0|Great Book! I couldn't put it down! It keeps you wanting to read and read. I highly recommend this book.
B0086700CM|4.0|Even a sixty five year old can enjoy this.  I got hooked the first time I played it.  I now challenge my grandkids.  We sit side by side and see who can go the longest.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app really helped keep charge of my kindle and see how much I have left. it also keeps me alert.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I enjoy this game a lot. I tried the other Oregon trails (which I purchased for 4.99) I ended up deleting it and feeling like I wasted my money. But this version is a lot better and I enjoy it more.
B00866JL96|3.0|While I really liked this movie.  I am really disappointed with the quality of the digital copy that comes with the DVD.  I am not someone who gets everything in super HD quality,  I have several movies in digital form and all of them are standard definition and I they have been fine.  This digital copy is HORRIBLE it is actually pixilated. This is the first digital copy I have bought that requires the Flixer player so I am not sure if it is the player or the digital download.  If you really want the digital copy I wouldn't get it this way.
B008MEM24S|5.0|so much fun. great time-killer. very well put together. thank you Disney for making such a unique game that actually uses your mind.
0375507256|5.0|A compelling read, I was drawn to it after seeing the five plus minute movie trailer and hearing the trio of directors of the movie explain how challenging it was bringing these six interlocking tales to the big screen, and then try to craft a movie preview that would make sense.<br />The trailer was beautiful, but the book was fascinating.  I can see why it was so unlikely that anyone would even dream of making a movie.  We are introduced to characters in different geographies and different periods of time, though each story is connected to the others in what appears to be small, insignificant ways, though the impact of what happens in each tale affects the others in ways that aren't immediately apparent.<br />Except for the story at the middle of the book, each tale is split in two, with the first half of the book moving forward in time, until we reach the distant future and a world that seems, in some ways, to share more with the tale that reaches furthest back into the past than all rest.  The second half of the book sends us in reverse, concluding each story while it goes further back in time, tying up both loose ends and tying each story together in so many small yet significant ways.<br />This was both an intriguing and challenging read, and one which stick with me for a long time to come.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This DVD set is probably the best purchase I have made in several years. It is about 2 hours long and keeps your interest the whole time. Because I became a fan of the Eagles from this DVD, I went to a local Eagles concert. It was exactly the same as the DVD.Stay home and watch the concert on your T.V. Yow will love it.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Don't understand all the hate at all, this is a very good alien invasion movie!  Some want to bash Rhiana, but she is very good in this movie.  Look it's just a fun ride, and I love the big guy who went toe to toe with one of the aliens.  It's just a very good and entertaining movie, I'm getting the blu ray!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Very handy if I am running low on battery and I need just enough to get me through until I can fully charge. Accurate in its times given for standby and music playback.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|I enjoyed this album from Maroon 5. It's hard to write a review, since what I like won't be what you like. Still, I enjoyed the bounciness of the songs and the range of different moods without being too broad and scattered, as some albums can get.  It sounds like Maroon 5 without being too cookie cutterish with the music.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I am totally addicted, and I didn't think I would even like it. The only think I don't like is that some of the quest require friends and you can't skip them.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is such a fun hale I play it all the time I love it so much you sould really get it
B008ETOSYI|2.0|I waited on pins and needles for this to come out on video.  I never got to the theater to see it.  I finally rented it today and sad to say, I was not impressed.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and while I knew Hollywood would take some liberties, I was disappointed in how much was left out.  Mainly, the dog plays a much more pivotal role in the novel.  Being a German shepherd lover, I was looking forward to seeing this beautiful dog showcased in a main role.  But Zeus played a minor character, used only to explain his presence at the dog kennel.  The very essence of a shepherd, utmost devotion and ultimate protector, were left out.<br /><br />Several of the scenes involving the ex-husband were not included.  This would have gone a long way in explaining what scum he was. Not to mention, the picture included some more details in the book and made the fact that he found her way more believable.<br /><br />Finally, I just couldn't buy into Efron's character.  I'm sure he's a great actor.  Honestly, I've never seen him in anything else.  But he seemed so stiff to me and not a natural for this role.  I felt Schilling acted circles around him.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't pay a movie ticket price to see this.  I'm only out $3.99.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I really liked Rick's writing. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I'm anxiously awaiting to read the next book in the series.
1840220767|3.0|It's a beautiful book but huge, hard to just sit and read but is a great coffee table or set-out book.  I think I'll order the books l at a time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|An interesting concept, and it keeps you turning the pages... not exactly the height of literary genius, but entertaining nonetheless.
034580404X|5.0|The books in this trilogy are well written and are an easy read. I recommend these to the most avid readers!
B007MJSYF0|4.0|I watched this movie to confirm if it was what hunger games was taken from. Both have children and teens as the fighters, both have total Government control giving the people no rights or freedoms at all. My final conclusion is that this movie is better than hunger games and that both movies are uniquely different.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Mr. McDougall does a great job balancing a good story with the argument that we as humans are designed for running. The book doesn't come off as a self-help or self-improvement style book (although it is likely to help and improve those who read it) and it doesn't come off as a sales pitch for the barefoot running trend (although his arguments  may lead you to conclude that's the way we're meant to run).  A quick and moving read, \\"Born to Run\\" is a good choice for both new and experienced runners.
034580404X|5.0|I must say....it was a very steamy book(s) to read.  While I do beleive the author needs to strengthen her writing skills (i.e. lots of repetition, some phrases not crafted well, etc.), I fell in love with the character Christian Grey.  He is most definitely the fantasy that most women would love to have in their lives.  I'm so glad I read all three because I don't think anyone can really appreciate the journey of both characters unless you read from the beginning of the trilogy to the end.  Looking forward to E.L. James' next book
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun!. I feel like km helping but I know im not . I was sk glad to see this game on the App Store for free.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|The graghics are good. However, the sound and music are great! The updates keep the game fresh; especially for the Kindle Fire.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This thriller is the literary equivalent of a roller coaster ride. The story unfolds in chapters that offer alternating perspectives of a husband and his wife, who went missing on their fifth anniversary.<br /><br />The husband is the prime suspect and he certainly seems guilty. At first. Then you think he's in the clear. Or not... And is his wife truly a spoiled, overindulged rich girl? Or is she a long-suffering soul trying to reconnect with a distant husband? Or something else entirely? You'll second-guess yourself throughout - it's that kind of book.<br /><br />Flynn pulls you into the story quickly. But every time you think you've figured out what's going on, who's doing what (and to whom), the shift in perspective in the next chapter makes you realize that this is no simple missing persons case.<br /><br />As you are drawn into the book, any allegiances you have for a particular character shift with each chapter. It all seems so basic at first, but as the characters reveal themselves nothing is as simple as it seems.<br /><br />I stayed up late to finish this book - it was that good, and I had to know how it was all going to end. It's one of the most fascinating and unexpected books I've ever read - the ending left me stunned.
B00475BUVM|2.0|I loved this movie and I really thought that it would look awesome in 3-D, so I purchased it. Wow! So unimpressed with the 3D. We actually took it out and put in Wrath of the Titans, and man, what a difference. When something is really supposed to be in 3D, you can tell. Clash, I'm afraid has dissappointed me greatly. Depth and quality of 3D is very important. The 3D in this is flat and distorted. 3D features that are supposed to fly out at you become distorted and digitally grainy. What a shame because it had such awesome potential. If you want a great 3D movie, get Wrath of the Titans. That will make you say, Whoa. Anyone who writes that this version isn't too bad obviously has not indulged in marvelous 3D films on a 65\\" flat screen in the comfort of their own home or something, because they are dead wrong. I feel let down by the 3D. Awesome movie though.
B0083H6AQA|2.0|I'm at a loss to describe the 5 star ratings for this film. I mean, really, 5 stars? That must be one heck of a fabulous film! But no, it really isn't.  I saw this before it was ever released in theaters during a sneak preview channel I have. I was excited to see it for a couple of reasons. 1: I love any film with a corset, and 2: The all-star cast. So first thing's first-the scenery, imagery and costumes are beautiful. Very authentic looking. However, the actual film is quite a snooze-fest. There is no life in it, no spark. Like a bland meal, it leaves you wanting something better. It's a pity really because it's brimming with stars, but they just wander aimlessly throughout the film.<br /><br />Rob Pattison gives a respectable performance as a young man who arrives penniless in Paris, and quite quickly, through a string of luck and good fortune weaves his way upwards through society. In fact, he has no qualms about seducing anyone he feels he needs to, to get ahead. That includes Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci, and the almost-always flawless Kristen Scott Thomas. Aside from the poor accents, these actresses all look fantastic here, but lack personality. It's quite puzzling and I can only attribute the lack of interest to the dry-as-toast script, and barely-there plot. Rob Pattison doesn't have much to do here besides smolder, and flatter-which he does quite admirably, but his character's charm quickly wears off and he becomes just another pretty face with not much else going for him. It was frustating because he CAN do better, given a better director and script. Just look at Water for Elephants as an example.<br /><br />I was left dissapointed and bored especially after the rushed, stupid ending. For all those hoping for a great period drama, don't bother with this-there are so many other, better options out there.
B0084PB97G|5.0|This is a great album and a one of a kind voice. I love this new trend of contemporary artists hooking up and producing older ones. I loved listening to this album. [[ASIN:B007M45XL8 Locked Down]] is a another great one this year from Dr. John produced by the Black Keys guys, and then the new Jimmy Cliff [[ASIN:B008H22178 Rebirth]] is produced by Tim Armstrong of Rancid.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great for weather on the go. Very easy to use and understand. Great graphics. Recommend this appt highly. Hope you like.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My kid cousins (under 10) have been loving this game and always talk about it. I finally decided I would get it and try it out. It is really fun and makes me laugh! Young kids love this game and as a woman in my 30's, I also find it fun, entertaining and a mood brightener. Good time passer and stress reliever!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Surprisingly, I enjoyed this book.  It is not the usual type of story I really enjoy, but once I got into it, I kept going and have finished book two and currently reading the third and last of the series!<br />Good luck to Ms. Collins.  Only wish one of my own books would be \\"Catching Fire\\" as hers have!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I got this as the &quot;free app of the day&quot;! I loved Angry Birds on my iPod touch, but on Kindle, I don't really want to spend money on apps, only books, so this was great! ADDICTIVE AND AWESOME!!!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I was abroad when this book was been reviewed on radio and my husband said that everyone was talking about it, so I was really looking forward to reading it.  As the chapters were rolling by I was waiting for the story to develop but it never did.  For me it was very disappointing.  I really wanted to know more about Christine Grey's past and why he was so controlling.  The writer started off creating two characters with a plot that could have been really interesting but I felt that she got totally stuck on the S & D part and let that take over every chapter.  I later read that these were her first books.  I am not surprised. I also saw an interview with her and she said that she got most of her S & D knowledge from the internet and it made sense to me.  I have since asked other people who had read the three books if the story gets any better and they all said no, but the sex gets rougher....I would rather a good story myself.!!!!!!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|MY USERNAME IS yourmomisallama GET ME AS A NEIGHBOR PLEASE!!! Look, I know everyone's frustrated about the &quot;buy gems&quot; thing,  but there's a simple solution: just don't use the gems in the first place! If you're THAT upset, just make omelletes over and over, as they won't tempt you to use up gems. But aside from that, it's a really fun app!!!
034580404X|5.0|This book is very interesting! It definitely keeps you on edge and wondering what's next. The price was great too!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I loved this movie-thought the recreation of the 1970's as far as the look& feel of<br />the era was dead on. as a fan of the original series i liked this  one also-was it campy?<br />yes but in a good and appropiate way/Love Michelle Pfeiffer-she could read the Yellow Pages<br /> And i would still go to see it=thought the rest of the cast was good-plan to purchase when<br />it comes out.
030758836X|3.0|I loved the first 3rd of the book. Loved the way the story was being told. Nick from present tense and Amy from her diary in past tense.<br /><br />Then came the Part 2 of the book and it just progressively got worse from there. The story started getting so far fetched that there is no way any of it would actually happen in real life, which I can live with. The worst was the ending, if that's what it's called. It's more like just where the book stops as there is no good ending to it.<br /><br />Overall loved the way the story was told. As for story it's self, started off good and ended up horrendous. LOL
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Stop complaining about losing your progress! You should've backed up your game before installing this one. If you have all the levels at 3 stars just download Angry Birds 3 stars app.
0757302661|5.0|I finished the book a few weeks ago and liked all the tips and suggestions. I find myself using the breathing techniques during the day when I feel stressed at work even. I am only 7 months pregnant, but will write an update after my birthing experience to relate how I was able to utilize the techniques during the process.
1451608659|2.0|I was excited to buy this book, as I was a huge fan of Moceanu's. I was very disappointed to find that the writing is just awful. It was like it was written by a boring suburban housewife with the aid of her simple child. I don't see how the writers could have made such an interesting life so dull to read about. It would probably be fine for someone who reads at a second grade level. I left my copy in the dentist's lobby.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|its awesome it's just the graphics for the kindle is bad if fixed the thers 5stars comin up!!! great game by the way
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Well made tv show with good actors and an interesting story. After reading a few negative reviews I decided to get on and review. It is definitely one of the best shows of the year. If you enjoy suspense, drama, and some decent action; give it a shot you won't be disappointed.
B007PS0X0W|4.0|I'm a fan of Underworld and Kate Beckinsale, so normally I should give the series 5 stars. But I can't this time. The reasons are below.<br /><br />The good:<br />1. Lots of actions<br />2. Selene is a powerful vampire, the most powerful perhaps<br />3. The enemies have personalities, not just mindless lycans<br /><br />The bad:<br />1. No romance<br />2. Supporting characters aren't that interesting<br />3. No vampire vs vampire battles<br /><br />In my opinion, the second installment is the best. Then the first. And then this one. I don't care much about The Rise of the Lycans because there's no Selene.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am already a fan of Ken Follett's writing.  He has done a great job of describing the war or wars.  His characters are almost real to me.  I am anxiously awaiting the next book!
B008Y2WEFU|3.0|SPOILER ALERT:  If you haven't seen Season 2, and you want to see it, and be surprised, read no further.<br /><br />BE has done, in two seasons, what it took The Sopranos about four seasons to do, for me:  I now strongly dislike, or hate, all of the major characters in this show.  Every single major character is scum.  Jimmy's mother practices incest, as was hinted at in the first season.  Jimmy commits patricide as his mother urges him on, following his attempt to strangle her.  Nucky is Nucky, which means he lies, cheats, steals, and murders anyone who gets in his way, all the time trying to stay clean, in the eyes of the law.  Margaret is scum.  She is a hypocrite of the highest order, as was Tony's wife, in The Sopranos.  The main FBI guy is scum.  He takes protection money, murders anyone getting on to his ways and, all the time, wrestles with his conscience as he fails to walk along the path of the righteous.  On and on and on and ----- Also, there are so many damn sub-plots going on at one time, in Season 2, that it is gets to the point of absurdity.  Too many characters doing each other, in all ways.  I can't stand the show, just as I came to hate The Sopranos.  I am having the same problem with BE, though, that I had with TS:  I have been caught up in the story line and now I have to see this series to its end.  Hopefully it won't run for as many seasons.  Maybe, just maybe, I'll let it go, and read the episode synopses once Season 3 is finished.  At least I'll save $36, that way.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|After hearing about the lauded Angry Birds for the last couple of years, when it was offered as the free app of the day, I decided to take a chance. Very unimpressed. If this is the great experience of the casual market, then I don't want any part of it. Poor, inconsistent controls and annoying menus loaded with merchandising and storefronts for their branded garbage. And that's in the paid version. I dread to think how bloated with ads the ad-supported version would look. If you haven't played this game after all this time, do yourself a favor and stay away.
B000244FDW|1.0|i can't believe anyone liked this version of jane austen's wonderful novel.  the character's were flat and wooden.  it was painful to watch. i fast forwarded through much of it, because it was just too boring and didn't fit with my thoughts of the original story.  for example, after jane returns from london and is talking about missing bingley, she is laughing - it was ridiculous to me.  lizzy didn't have any sparkle or wit, she was dull and one dimensional. others have commented about how superior this darcy was to other versions, and i cannot understand this. colin firth and matthew macfadyen (he was the one of the only good parts of that version) did a much better job as darcy.  i couldn't stand this one.  yuck. save yourself the bother and skip this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great way to kill a few minutes here and there, or settle in for a marathon session. Easy to understand, hard to master.
030758836X|4.0|I really liked the suspense of not knowing what is happening. I didn't necessarily like the end third of the way she chose to end it, but it made sense with the rest of the book. It definitely kept me guessing of what is really going on!
B005COO1X6|1.0|FIrst off, I want to say that I'm a huge Stephen King fan. When his books come out, I'm aways first in line. That being said, this was a major let down.  I had such high hopes for it.<br /><br />A boy is exploring an rest stop that has been long shut down.  He finds some alcohol, drinks some and passes out. That's just the start. It seems there's a car there that is more than just a car, it's car that eats people. That's all I really want to say about the plot. I can't give to much away.<br /><br />The problem is that it's so repetitive. Car one comes to a rest stop, and the \\"haunted car\\" eats the owner. Car two comes, and the car eats the owner. Car three comes, and eats the owners. Over and over again. It was very tedious to read.<br /><br />I also didn't like that fact the the kids in the book swore so much.  When I say kids, I mean kids as young as six year old swearing. It just didn't feel right. Like I said, I love King's work, (It is my favorite book) but this was a major let down. I can't even suggest you get it from the library.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this game. Updates with new puzzles come out regularly without deleting previously completed puzzles. Various levels of difficulty keep it fresh. The controls are smooth and easy and the zoom function makes even larger grids workable. I've since downloaded the Color version as well and love it just as much. Highly recommended for lovers of brain teasers and puzzles.
B0073U2FB2|1.0|I enjoy a good post-apocalyptic sci-fi flick.  The key in that phrase is \\"good.\\"  This one is garbage--nothing unique in a niche of the genre that is growing a little tired (the post-apocalyptic stuff).  This wants to be a nuanced Independence Day, but it's nothing even close--forgettable characters, forgettable aliens, nothing compelling about the plot, and cheesy dialogue at every corner.  The story revolves around a hopeless trudge through a alien-infested wasteland, and that's exactly what I felt like I'd accomplished when the credits rolled.
031620157X|4.0|Okay, so I'll be honest.  I first signed up to read this book just because I am a huge Gleek and knew that one of the characters that I loved from the show wrote the book.  And then when I got it and saw that it was about fairy tales, I had mixed feelings.  On the one hand, I LOVE fairy tales (heck...my wedding was princess themed at Disney World!) but on the other hand, I have read so many retellings that I didn't like.<br /><br />Right away, I knew that I would enjoy this story.  Once again, I have to be honest.  The book was written for middle grade kids, which I usually don't enjoy.  And I don't think that the actual writing was all that great.  But as for the story as a whole, I loved it!  I loved the idea of these kids falling into the fairy tale land.  And getting to meet all of the characters that they'd grown up loving (and I still love)!<br /><br />I was totally Alex when I was younger, but with slightly more friends.  I was the girl that knew all the answers and would never be found without a book.  And I was obsessed with fairy tales.  If I had fallen into a fairy tale land, I'm not sure I would ever have left.  I loved reading this version of my favorite characters too.  I loved that Goldilocks was kick butt.  And that the princesses were so sweet.  And that there were so many mention of fairy tales, that there were even small ones mentioned.<br /><br />Do I think this book is going to win any awards?  Probably not.  Am I going to be picking up the next book in this series?  As soon as I can possibly get my hands on it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great story about love and healing. About giving your self to someone completely and trusting them with your heart and life. This book definitely is fiction because finding true love does not always heal or change people. For me the sex scenes were good at first but then is was just the same old thing over and over and really who comes on command! There was also mystery and suspense. This book has it all. I read all three books.
B007TBCTRK|3.0|Great for creepy atmosphere, but the absence of a proper theme really is kind of a let down. I love the Alien series atonal, experimental soundscapes, but compare Prometheus with the Aliens score...every scene of Aliens had it's own memorable theme. Prometheus is pretty scanty on the meat and potatoes and heavy on the dressing. Still fun to listen to for fans of the movie and it certainly has it's charms...the first few tracks 'Life', 'A Planet', 'Engineers', are really beautiful with definite musical themes, even if they are just brief melodic tidbits. Unfortunately, the vast remainder of this score relies heavily on variations of these few short themes and the textures employed with them. 'A Friend From the Past' is one exception which pays quick but tasteful homage to Jerry Goldsmith's 'Alien' score. Overall enjoyable, but again light on the actual music.

0824835921|3.0|It took me 7 months to finish this book. It was not enjoyable, but did give me an idea of how to view the kanji by components. I practiced for at least two hours a day, including writing practice at Skritter. A month later, I have forgotten many of the kanji I learned.<br /><br />I have moved on to sentences and pronunciations. (Not RTK 2 or 3 - You couldn't pay me to spend another minute with Heisig!) I sort of wish I had learned the kanji in frequency order and then maybe I'd be doing better with reading.<br /><br />I found the RTK app helpful, even though they haven't bothered to update it for the 6th edition. Also, the Reviewing the Kanji site is great for finding stories. RevTK has the most beginner-friendly Japanese language learning forum I have found on the web. Lots of helpful info there!<br /><br />I know that thousands of folks have found RTK invaluable. To me, Heisig seems like kind of a strange guy and I did not enjoy his writing style. He'd keep saying in the book that the hardest part was past and THEN later on intro a chapter saying it was the hardest in the book. What's up with that? Some chapters have less than 20 kanji and the longest chapter had well over 100.  It was difficult to break up into manageable bits.<br /><br />To be honest, I now feel that I may have wasted my time on a method that didn't work for me.<br /><br />UPDATE: They finally released an update to the iOS app that brings it up to date with the 6th. Edition. I sure wish they had done this A LOT sooner.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love to read.  The Kindle is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  The Verso cover is a wonderfully soft leather case that makes the Kindle look like a classic book.  All of my friends have commented on how beautiful it is.  The cover is very well made, the stitching is perfect and I should know because I am a quilter and stitching is something that always catches my eye. The design with gold details is simple yet elegant.  I would and have recommended this product without reservation.  I know it will add to your experience the way it does mine.

B0081HLM2E|4.0|\\"Headhunters\\" (Hodejegeme) is a Norwegian thriller with dark comic overtones, based  on the novel by Jo Neslø. Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is a shrewd corporate headhunter. He gets the right person for his company and makes the prospect's reputation with an aggressive attitude and unconventional advice. He's also short and financially overextended. Roger moonlights as an art thief to support a lavish lifestyle and, especially, to impress his beautiful, statuesque wife Diana (Synnøve Macody Lund), whom he always fears will leave him for someone taller and richer. Desperate for cash, bank account overdrawn, Roger needs to score big. He finds his target in a conspicuously charming Dutchman, Clas Greve (Nicolaj Coster-Waldau), who is harboring a Reubens painting in his Oslo apartment. But Greve, a Special Ops veteran and ruthless CEO, will prove to be a more formidable, and more violent, opponent than Roger bargained for.<br /><br />This plot goes over the top for black comedic effect, occasionally bordering on farce. Good writing and Morten Tyldum's deft direction combine with Aksel Hennie's terror and fighting spirit to pull this off. This could just be silly in other hands. But it's funny and suspenseful, with a selfish, insecure, sympathetic protagonist and a handsome, obsessed, almost cartoonish villain. Nicolaj Coster-Waldau is having fun being evil. \\"Headhunters\\" strengths are bizarre twists, one after another, that seem plausible enough but which no one, neither Roger nor the audience, could have predicted and the surprising mettle with which Roger meets these grim challenges. He seems surprised by his own determination and fortitude. The audience certainly is. But Roger keeps going and concocts a few surprises himself. Incidentally, Synnøve Macody Lund, so alluring and natural onscreen, is not a professional actress. She's a Norwegian film critic.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2012): The film is primarily in Norwegian with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles. Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and \\"Behind the Scenes of Headhunters\\" (22 min), which offers optional English subtitles. This featurette interviews director Morten Tyldum, cinematographer John Andreas Andersen, the film's producers, Aksel Hennie, and Synnøve Macody Lund about the conception of the project, the challenge of working on a budget of only about $5.2 million, the characters of Roger and Clas, casting, the actors, filming the car crash, and more.anish subtitles.

B000002JSN|5.0|Between the blend of musical influences, the song structures, and the musicianship, this is by far the best Rock album EVER recorded.
1933633867|4.0|I found the book deeply engaging at times.  There were some real gems in the parts about ancient history, and Graeber deserves kudos for emphasizing credit as pre-dating money (though he certainly is not the only one).  The author emphasizes cultural/religious aspects of debt and abuses by creditors, but descends to caricature debt as simply designed to suppress the innocent poor.  His grand conclusion: it's not amoral to default on your debts since a debt is \\"perversion of a promise.\\"  Sure there have been abuses by creditors, but I suspect his real beef is not debt but capitalism, war and modernity.  Debt is not the cause but the effect, which we shouldn't have to honor.<br /><br />Curiously, Graeber leaves out a few sacred cows: what about the devastation of socialism (a la Stalin)?  How about suppressing credit standards to meet public policy ends (hint: US homeownership policies since the 90s)?  What about the US government running up debts to unsustainable levels in our name?  Should debt be the only financial obligation we have no moral obligation to pay?  Why should we pay taxes or follow regulations (for which we are obligor/debtors)?  What about the education racket in the US that is reducing our young to debt peons while overpromising post-graduation earnings potential?<br /><br />In addition, he offers up no solutions to better the malevolent world he describes, for example: How should debt be regulated? What is the moral responsibility of the debtor? What are better debt forgiveness mechanisms?  Should there be minimum credit standards?<br /><br />He's the practical anthropologist on matters ancient/tribal and the rambling academic juvenile anarchist on matters recent.  I still give it four stars, for the good parts are really good.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is great! easy fun and entertaining for kids and adults! anyone can play its real easy! try it!
B007WA10IW|1.0|Hmmmm... It just doesn't seem right; The Sex Pistols \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" REMASTERED...I think we should listen to it recorded off of an old scratched vinyl record (found in a used record shop) copied onto a crappy beat-box cassette recorder and then dubbed again onto another beat-up tape found from the bottom of the floorboards of a '76 Plymouth Fury. That would sound better.
B003VNKNDW|5.0|Good product at a goo price... not much more there is to say about a USB flash drive since the only concern is that it works...
B001USHRCK|5.0|This is really one of our best sets. It is the last of the Castle playsets, I believe, before they discontinued the line (so my kids tell me). I just bought this because it was a cool set that had a lot of play value for a very good price.<br /><br />Sure, there are a LOT of tiny pieces. This isn't a build for the \\"faint of heart.\\" However, once it's built, then it's durable enough. This isn't just a facade-the buildings open and close to form complete stand alone structures. The rooms are very good-sized (7 rooms and a stable!), with various pieces of interesting furniture. I love the blacksmith's station-more room than if you purchase a kingdoms blacksmith set separately. Stables are down below, which historically, I learned they did that to heat up the upstairs rooms, since heat rises. So, there is some good educational value, here, as well.<br /><br />The market has a lot of play value for my animal-loving daughter as well as my teenaged son. She loves the 2 cows, mouse, horse and fish. The \\"duck\\" you have to put together didn't look duck-like enough to us, but we think that is a small thing. There's also a chicken that is similar to the duck. There's also a whole turkey, carrot, cheese& apples along with the fish to have for food. There's an actual market stall to sell items like the food and flowers. The white horse can pull a cart full of \\"hay\\" bricks that is included. There are two girls (that are unfortunately flaunting cleavage-easily corrected by taping on replacement designs).<br /><br />Our son likes the blacksmith's area, with a hammer that it hooked to the water wheel. It moves up and down as the wheel turns. He also enjoys the firepit with iron ore, the kings soldiers, gold plate and bullion, the safe and overall design of the entire set. It fits perfectly with any castle to expand play even further.<br /><br />Other notable pieces include two boys and an older man, making that at total of 8 minifigures (not including animals) that come with this set. There's cups and spears, sword, knife, treasure chest, barrels, baskets, tables, a bed, signs... Again, great play value for both boys and girls, alike..

B00003CXPJ|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time. One might describe it as \\"a classic\\" if one new what the definition of a classic was.
0385523912|5.0|This book is extremely well-written, an excellent way for someone who doesn't know much about history or politics to get introduced to them, and to become interested.  The fact that the information presented here is current is unbelievable.  Until I read this, I had no idea such horrors were happening in the world today.
B0070XFNDE|2.0|Perhaps it is because I'm such a fan of the previous two books (Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game)that I'm not afraid to give the latest installment in Ruiz Zafon's \\"series\\" this admittedly abysmal rating.  When I came to the end I honestly thought that maybe Amazon had made some mistake - maybe they'd mislaid about 100 pages? The Prisoner of Heaven, while well written, was nothing compared to the artistry to be found within Shadow of the Wind.  However, my biggest gripe is that the plot doesn't really GO anywhere - just makes us wait until the next \\"installment\\" so we can fork over another $14.99.  I'm really beginning to wonder if \\"Shadow\\" was so delightful simply because it wasn't meant to have a sequel or two which could only serve the function of disappointment.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good addictive game buy! But too many darn ads. Can't I just buy it cheap??? And why a minimum of twe20nty words ?
0545265355|5.0|This is a must read book!!!! Drags you into the story, it makes you want to not put the book down. Great read!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good book. I will be reading it again. I hope she follows up with more books like this. I would love to read the story from Christian view
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love this app, but it stops responding and force closes constantly!  Also, keeps turning the 3rd party sharing option back on in settings after I've turned it off.  Fix these issues, and it would be a 5-star app!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I'm going to speak from the heart this is by far the most mind blowing rap album Eminem has put out since the first album and second.  It defently blew me away with his beats and lryics plus the guest stars on the album nice bonus.  His song with Pink track 4 wont back down exactly how I feel at times in my life.  I also enjoy lot Not Afraid track 7, Track 10 was also very good called space bound, But the hardest and offensive song on the album I dont think was track 9 No love with Lil Wayne, but track 14 called Almost Famous.  But if you were looking for some Eminem music to enjoy or savor with friends or just by yourself then pick this cd up and enjoy Eminem back at top of his game, rap game that is.  Now I know why they wanted give him so many mic awards for this album.  The only song I didn't care for was track 11 called Cinderella Man, but maybe you like it came off as just strange to me as it listen to it.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Overall this movie really impressed me.<br />The story follows the younger versions of the crew we've all come to know and love from the t.v. series.<br />Excellent story, characters that pull you in and entice you, great directing, superb action scenes, impressive visual effects.<br />Normally these type of movies aren't done well. The storIes tend to be shallow filled with poorly constructed characters. But this was the exception.<br />I would buy this for my collection.
B00004T9UF|4.0|This Rap cd is by far very amazing material by the artist and rapper Eminem but I had an issue with three tracks off this cd of his. Those tracks were 9, 12, and 14.  Rememeber me was track 9, Ken Kaniff was track 12, and Amityville was track 14.  But as for myself my favorite songs were The way I am track 7, Track 18 Criminal, and track 11 Marshall Mathers.  This cd got a lot of heat when it came out from lot of religious groups and political groups and so forth.  Just like his first album I believe this surpass the first one both in style and lyrics.  But if your a true fan of his material both in style and lryics then pick this cd up if you dont have it by now and listen to it with open mind and be prepare to be amazed by the album.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I bought this organizer to be used on my Britax B Ready stroller. It installs on the handle just fine, but takes a little finagling to get it in the right spot, where you can put a cup in it and not have it bump into the handle. I like that it has two \\"pockets\\" on the sides to hold drinks securely. It also has a small zippered pocket that can be used for a small wallet, money, or an ID. The main pocket is deep and can hold everything I need to have at hand, and then some. I can still fold my stroller without any problems.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem yes goes after the popish rap style but he doesn't fall flat on the album.  I only dislike track 9 drips, and track 17 say what you say.  The rest was amazing and the beats so sweet and keeps your car bumping all the way down the road or your bedroom thumping from the beats.  My personal favorites off this album has to be White America track 2, Track 8 Say goodbye to hollywood, track 12 sing for the moment, track 16 when the music stops, and last track 19 my dad's gone crazy.  I feel like most Eminem fans he outdid himself on this album and should keep this type of style going for future albums.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is NOT about Pearl Harbor. It's more about a sappy soapy predictable love story that happens to take place at Pearl. It is filled with historical inaccuracy. Just horrible. The only thing that was accurate was that  Pearl Harbor is a US naval base that was attacked by the Japanese. Hell, I've heard some of the survivors of the true event trash this movie.<br /><br />You don't need to make up a sappy love story to talk about Pearl Harbor. There was more than enough drama in the real event.<br />To any history teachers that may be thinking of showing this to their class....please don't!  This is NOT history. I recommend showing then Tora, Tora, Tora instead. It may be a little slow, but it is WAY more accurate than this.
B005LAJ23A|3.0|This is about the show not the product.  Season 2 of the Walking Dead was a disappointment for me.  It started off promising, then dragged in the middle....and I mean really dragged, seems like they were stuck on that farm forever.  But the last couple episodes made up for it and definitely leaves you hangin and restless for Season 3
B00846REIS|4.0|Kind of reminded me of 50 shades of Grey. A lot of repetitions, but I liked the story line. I am getting the sequel as soon as it comes out!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserable is a great classic. I am delighted to have it on my kindle. I plan to read it to my granddaughter.
0385742886|4.0|In a prequel to the Maze Runner series, we start just after the sun flares began and wreaked havoc upon earth. Mark and Trina were in New York when it happened. Lucky to escape with their lives, they pair up with Alec, Lana, and a few other survivors and head to the mountains, where settlements of survivors are rumored to exist.<br />The group manages the trip, and attempt to survive in the horrible heat and nearly desolte planet. Over a year after the initial sun flares, a new disease surfaced, a deadly virus that causes it victims to go crazy and die violently. But there is something suspicious about this new disease, and the rapid way it spreads, killing everyone in its path.<br />After the disease ravages their settlement, and they realize that it is mutating, the group seeks a cure and the truth about where the disease really came from. The truth; however, might be more devastating than the disease itself. With humanity on the line, Mark and Trina are in a race against time and death.<br />Told from the point of view of Mark, and intertwined with flashbacks to the beginning of the sun flares, The Kill Order is an action packed and emotionally intense novel. Each of the characters has their flaws, but their human qualities and friendship among one another leave the reader turning the pages waiting for the conclusion and paving the way for the story of WICKED, the Glade, and Thomas's quest in the Maze.<br />[...]
B007L3BMGA|5.0|i don't really understand why there are so many people dislike this book.<br />To be honest, I love it and it was my first erotic fiction.<br />After finishing the 3 books, I am looking for more women's fiction.<br />I read some comments saying that if you wanna read BDSM books or crave for the incoming movie of this book, just go to watch<br />the story of O. After watching the story of O movie, I found that they did share some similarities.<br />But for the story of O, it is simply BDSM, I can't see the love. Just really can't figure it out why a man who loves a woman will sacrifice her to the others.  For Fifty shades Trilogy, it is all about how Ana changes Christian and how Christian changes for Ana. Christian can get out of BDSM because of Ana. It is what love does!!<br /><br />We just have to view from different angles sometimes.<br />If we wanna grab a simply BDSM book, then Fifty Shades Trilogy may not suit you.<br />But if wanna get a romantic but with some erotic parts, you should definitely go ahead with Fifty Shades Trilogy.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|Pros: Excellent script, acting, and directing. Lots of extra featurettes included!<br /><br />Cons: Is it just me, or is the video quality kind of \\"grainy\\"? For being Blu-Ray I wouldn't expect there to be a grainy-ness to the video, but season 1 on Blu-Ray has the same issue. Maybe it's just my Blu-Ray player??? Or was this an intentional effect???????
0345803485|3.0|You can't take this book too seriously. It is what it is; love it or hate it. Fifty Shades is not fine literature (and hopefully it is not one day regarded as such!). Yes, it's unrealistic and can be whiny and melodramatic for the most part. Not to mention the awful, repetitive writing. However, it's simply a guilty pleasure and as one person put it: literary crack.<br /><br />I myself went back and forth on deciding to read this book. I tend to skim through books that I intend to read. With this one, I was initially horrified. But after reading it in full context it's not as bad as it seems. However, I feel that book romanticizes an abusive relationship. Although at times that line is blurred because it's obvious that Christian Grey has a ton of baggage that he is struggling with. He even admits to his imperfections and you do feel for these characters (as undeveloped as they are).<br /><br />What I don't like about this series is the fact that young girls are going to read them and think this is how all relationships are supposed to be.<br /><br />Perhaps the Hollywood treatment will give this story some substance. Go forth and indulge but don't make it your top priority.<br /><br />If you're looking for good erotica, I suggest The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty series by Anne Rice.
0062082353|5.0|After reading an interview in American Rifleman magazine (NRA Publications) i was moved to purchase, and read this book after a 15 year hiatus to book reading.<br /><br />I REALLY enjoyed the writing style used, i felt very involved in the book. I read this while at work and as i turned each page i was instantly transported to a different place and time, something books have previously been unable to do for me. Not only was i transported to that place and time, i also felt, by the same token that i was also in the same room with Mr. Kyle listening to him tell this.<br /><br />This is truly a masterpiece that should be read for anyone who is interested on how our freedoms are defended, how it actually is in a war zone, and the effects it has back home should read this book. Furthermore i am stressing VERY much to ignore the ignorant negative reviews this book received; they were clearly written by uninformed people that do not want to hear the truth.<br /><br />Mr. Kyle is is a great man that i would be honored to meet and spend time with.
B0085776BG|2.0|I was quite disappointed in this movie. It had well known actors in the lead parts, which is one reason I bought the movie. All Cuba Gooding Jr., did was walk around with a pipe in his mouth. Terrence Howard wasn't much better.<br />The movie was choppy and jumped around from one subject to another. I reccomend renting this movie before purchasing it to see how well you like it before adding it to your dvd collection.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. It is a great game to play and pass the time. Wonderful time playing the game.
076790382X|1.0|A book that I thought was supposed to be about re-experiencing the U.S. from a foreigner's standpoint turned out to make a mockery of Americanism.  Don't get me wrong, I agreed with some of the issues he discussed, but I felt it was a political, whiny, irrelevant and diluted book that was masquerading as a comic novel.  A shame, because I liked Bryson's other books, and I read it on my honeymoon.
B000V8A95C|5.0|Great CD at a perfect price!!!  I have never seen Wicked but I have loved hearing the music and wanted to experience the Broadway hit in one way or another!
1439102430|1.0|I have always been a fan of Kathy Reichs having read everything that she has ever written.  I cannot believe that she actually wrote  this book.  It was awful.  Her sharp style was clearly missing and the normally riveting plot was missing.  Perhaps between the television show and her books she  has over extended herself and is not giving her novels the attention that her readers have come to expect from her.  Don't waste your time or your money on this book.  A total disappointment.
B00770KR7W|1.0|The toy that this company shipped to me was not only sent in EXTREMELY damaged packaging, but also the figure itself had paint coming off the side of its helmet and its leg/calf section was poorly molded, resulting in a terrible toy altogether. I blame GoHastings for this and are sure that the figures themselves are not at all terrible in any manner.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I got the life proof case in the mail and the packaging that encloses the iphone itself was torn and taped together. When I tested it in the water it came out with condensation inside the lens. This was such a waste of time and money. The case was clearly used then resold because it didnt work.<br /><br />i give this ZERO STARS.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Funny, Sweet and tragic. Odd mixture but it works. Could not put it down.<br />Characters are memorable. Ending a little contrived, but forgiveable as the rest of the book was a gem.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|it graphics are alright but the game itself was repeatedly obnoxious. thug fight is mostly what u get out of the game while the game begging to end dident last long or hold much interest. first time opening it was the most exciting part the rest was dull....
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I bought this Boardwalk Empire first season, and loved it !!! As well I knew I would.  I hate that it's not what we used to call in the good old day's as a full season like the one's we enjoyed, you know the one's that ran at least 22 ,23 , maybe a couple more episode's  ,  not the 12 to 13 episode's  like HBO seem's to have fun teasing with.  This series like almost all of HBO's show's is top notch worthy of movie statis ratings. My only gripe is there to short, I WANT MORE !!!  PLEASE !!!  People buy this you'll love this show, the acting and story telling is superb, P.S. check out TRUEBLOOD the HBO series it also is addicting.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The third in his trilogy, The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest is another Stieg Larsson book that I just couldn't put down.  The story lines are woven together wonderfully well and it was just a fun and intriguing read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game.  The quality of the gameplay, the graphics, and the pace of the rewards within the game are all great, especially considering it's a free app.  Of all the apps out there for the Kindle Fire, this is one I keep coming back to for some great entertainment, and I'd highly recommend it.
034580404X|3.0|I am a huge fan of the Twilight series, and these books parallel the characters and feelings in the twilight books, except for the sex. Well of course it does because its fan fiction BASED off of that series, it was originally called man of the universe with the lead names bella and edward. If you leave that out of it, these WERE good books, and it is a red hot read. It got a little boring in the second and third books once you got used to the authors writing and the sex in it, there wasn't a whole lot of action. I really only liked the first book.
B000SEI230|4.0|Its a really good book but if you don't like a story with a shock and for some people can be a little sad I don't recommend it.  I liked it :)
B008KPDYQY|5.0|I thought that this was a fairly funny movie, not a fan of Emily Blunt, but in this film she was pretty good. If you like How i met your mother than i think this movie is for you
8866131369|5.0|I love the Moleskine Planners I've been using them for 2 years now, they're just the right size for my packs and generally (the hardbacks) can take quite a bit of damage. But I notice that my most recent doesn't have any of the cute stickers in the back pocket and instead has an address book. Looking back at the product description - it did say that an address book would be included and made no mention of the stickers but I'm still disappointed.
1595827684|5.0|This was a gift.  The recipient was overjoyed with the quality of art work.  I definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys sci-fi fantasy art.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|This was a first Lee Child novel for me, so I didn't come into the story with any preconceived notions of what to expect. Maybe that's why I have a more positive take on Nothing to Lose than many reviewers here.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, quite simply. Reacher's dogged determination reminds me of several guys I knew in the Army. The puzzle of Despair grabs ahold of Reacher and draws him back in, again and again, until he can get to the bottom of the mystery. And the fight scenes are just beautiful.<br /><br />The whole AWOL soldiers thing pissed me off more than a bit, largely because Jack's attitude toward it just doesn't remind me of an ex-MP at all. It's a moment when I lose all suspension of disbelief, and an author should try to avoid those moments. But, this is a book. It's entertainment, so lighten up, people.
B000EQ5HSK|5.0|If you're going to spend this much on a lens, why cheap out on an aftermarket shade? I got mine for 1/2 of what they were selling for initially ($50 vs. $100). The thing fits and functions like the good Lord and Canon intended. It's OEM quality and will make your experience a hell of a lot better than something from the PRC for $20 bucks less. \\"Nuff said.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|my two teenage sons and I have hours of entertainment playing this app. l like the chalang of having to complete the games before unlocking the next. the only annoying part is not having enough coins to unlock the next game and having to constantly play completed games until you have enough to unlock the next. each page of games cost more. that's when I have my sons get me more coins by letting them play.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|I am a huge sci fi fanatic and decided to write this review after watching all of the movies from start to finish on blu ray. I'm 22 years old, I grew up on the old Lost in Space flicks, Star Trek, and the obvious Star Wars films. I also recently started watching old school flicks like Forbidden Planet. But one franchise I always kind of blew off were the Alien movies. I recently upgraded to a 42\\" LG 1080p Flatscreen TV and to compliment it, I wanted to buy some blu ray movies to watch on it.<br />I surfed around on Amazon and see the \\"Alien Anthology\\" blu ray box set. A little pricey, but the packaging looked nice, the movies sounded fun to watch, and it was something entirely new that I never experienced yet. My dad is a big fan of the movies as well (at least the original two) It didn't take much thought before I decided to purchase these movies on blu ray!<br /><br />Packaging/Shipping, this item took a little longer than expected to arrive and shipped separate from the rest of the things I ordered on Amazon Prime. But it came in excellent condition, no dents/abrasions on the box. Upon first inspection, the actual box is kind of difficult to open first time and you may have to bend the packaging a little to get the movies out. I think this could be avoided if they would simply put an open slot on the side of the box to open the box easy. But no biggie, I still like the packaging.<br />Once opened, the collection comes in a very nice \\"booklet\\" with all the movies nicely showcased with images and descriptions of each movie. The end of the booklet contains the collectors stuff like commentary and things. I am on the fence for the packaging. I really love it and it's different, but it is hard to open and I do get weary of wear and tear on the disc after a while, the sleeves they are in aren't that great.<br /><br />The movies themselves, I will review and break down quick. One thing I would like to complain about (and one reason I felt like taking a star off for), the aspect ratio of these movies. Only \\"Aliens\\" (Alien 2 by James Cameron) is filmed in the advertised 2.35:1 ratio. This movie looked the best and filled my entire TV screen. The rest were filmed in the 1.85 ratio... depending on your TV screen size/aspect ratio/setup, maybe the films will look full screen to you, but three out of four films I had to watch with them goddamn annoying black bars on the top and bottom the screen! I hate that when I am already watching on a brand new widescreen TV! Yes, these were the way these films were originally shot, but they should label the technical specs better for these films. Now anyway for the actual movies...<br /><br />ALIEN - 7/10<br />This is the original Alien movie. This was my third time watching the film and first time on Blu Ray. To many's surprise, I'm not that crazy about the original Alien film. In some ways it feels like a rip off of \\"2001 Space Oddessy\\". Still though, the aliens/special effects/camera work are excellent, this is a classic sci fi movie. The story line was good and it introduced us to Alien franchise.<br /><br />ALIENS - 10/10<br />This movie, this was my first time watching it and I have to say this movie alone was worth buying the entire Alien Anthology collection for! This movie rocks. It's got James Cameron written all over it and the always lovable Bill Paxton really compliments this movie. Lovable characters, great camera work/lighting, intense horror scenes, well written script, and I like the aspect ratio it was shot in filling my whole TV. Picture quality, still had that grain but it was just right this time. The sound effects were better mixed in this one and the scary scenes jump out loud when they need to be without being too much. James Cameron knows how to do it right, this movie is a classic and I highly recommend it to anyone whether they are a sci fi fan or not.<br /><br />ALIEN 3 - 6/10<br />This movie was a huge step back from the James Cameron classic. The plot/story sucks forvery obvious reasons although I don't want to put spoilers on here. The camera work, special effects, story, and the rest of it, it just wasn't as good as James Cameron's \\"Aliens\\". Comparing to the original movie it's not as good as that either. This movie was jut bad. I seen it once and I don't want to see it again. Blu ray wise, this is probably among the best of the originals. The picture/sound quality are excellent. No more of that old school grain, everything looks like it's there and you can touch it. In 5.1 surround this movie rocks.<br /><br />ALIEN 4 - 8/10<br />This movie is kind of it's own movie from the original trilogy. It doesn't tie in well with the originals but it's a great sci fi flick and I would watch it again. The camera work, acting, and story are far better than Alien 3 though in my opinion. This movie had the best blu ray quality of all the films. The picture quality is crystal clear, the sound is crystal clear with deep bass tones and rich sound quality well mixed with my 5.1 setup.<br /><br />Overall I welcome these movies into my collection. But I am on the fence for the whole thing.  I try to rate these movies from a \\"general audience\\" stand point. If I am an average person looking to buy these movies for myself or another person as a gift that is not a sci fi fan, are they worth it? To be honest, no. I think the average person should just buy \\"ALIENS\\" (Alien 2), the sequel made my James Cameron. I cannot say enough good things about Aliens. It is a fun, re-watchable movie and ANY audience can enjoy and you can buy it alone on blu ray far cheaper than this entire box set.<br />The rest of these films, the sequels are mediocre. The third film is a train wreck. I feel like never watching it again, and that is a bad feeling to have when you buy a movie that is a permanent addition to your collection of movies.<br /><br />Let me end the review with this. Before you buy, make sure you or the person you are buying these for is an Alien fan. These movies just aren't for everybody. I recommend renting them all and checking them out for yourself. If you think they are fun and you would watch them again over and over, then buy all means buy this box set. Also, if you don't care about that and/or you want the \\"movie theater\\" experience people that doesn't like \\"streaming\\" quality then buy all means, but this!<br />I'm a sci fi fan and I found these a bit dull. I enjoy the original Star Trek movies as better. General movie goers should stick to Star Wars which are all amazingly done in blu ray.  If you already own those and are looking for something different, I highly recommend these. They are fun movies, just be weary they are not for everybody. Overall I welcome these movies into my collection, I will watch them again except for the third film which I felt was just terrible.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This is by far the best film of 2011. It reminded me of movies like close encounters of the third kind, stand by me, and  the goonies. It had a 70's or 80's feel to it; you know back in the golden era of modern cinema that was shaped by the likes of GEORGE LUCAS, FRANCES FORD COPALA and the GOD of a man, the best film maker of all time who produced the film I am critiquing right now, STEVEN SPIELBERG. What more can I say except buy this DVD you wont be disappointed. The sound track by, Michael Giacchino is also great very much in the vain of JOHN WILLIAMS. Giacchino also scored such works as, JJ ABRAMS \\"STAR TREK\\" and the upcoming \\"star trek sequel\\", \\"the incredible's\\", the show \\"lost\\", \\"ratatouille\\", \\"john carter\\" and the video games \\"MEDAL OF HONOR\\" AND \\"MEDAL OF HONOR 2\\", One last thing the kids in this could really act I am surprised none of them were up for Oscars especially Elle Fanning, who if you didn't know is Dakota Fanning's little sister.
B002SAS26E|5.0|First of all I consider myself a veteran of 2-player games. 90% of my gaming time is spent playing 2 person games with my wife, We live in a small coastal community with absolutely NO gaming presence...so we play 2-players quite frequently...some are: Jambo, Morels, Citidels, Lost Cities AND now Jaipur.<br /><br />I have to give credit where credit is due...I first heard of this game throug the YouTube channel 'WatchItPlayed'. Andrea Smith presented two segments where she presented the game and played a round, I was hooked and then purchased it through Amazon. This is such a fun, easy to play and teach game. The strategy is as difficult as you make it. Such a good 2-player game...in my top 5 games for sure.

B007SGM084|3.0|Alright, so I gave into the hype about this book series. I'll admit I read all three of them in three days, a book a day, an easy feat when you don't remove your eyes from the pages.<br /><br />so I don't know what I was expecting from this book the summary pretty much sums it all up.. maybe and forgive my cheesiness.. MORE. More from the redundant sex scenes? Or maybe less of that and more storyline? What redeemed it for me was Christian's psychological turmoil and his character development I wasn't impressed with Ana at all.. in fact I preferred Kate to her, but thats my personal view.<br /><br />I did rather enjoy Christian, not just his dominating sex persona but him in general and I'm thankful that he made reading the series bearable, because without him and his psyche it would have been fifty shades of suck.
034580404X|5.0|I LOVED THE BOOK, CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE!!!!! THE BOOK WAS SO GOOD I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, I JUST KEPT WANTING TO READ IT CONTINUALLY!!!!!!!
B0067QPVD2|5.0|super awesome! great prequel, leads perfectly into the original, well done!i dont know why they need twenty words, i think i summed up how awesome this movie was in my first two half sentances
0385534639|2.0|I purchased this book from Amazon.  I found it hard to get into and even harder to follow, but  beautifully  written.  When I finished<br />it I still felt I had missed a chapter!
B008N1V11U|3.0|its ok. if you saw the movie you would know that it downy really follow the plot of the actual movie it has. barely has anything to do with the dark night rises it mixes in the origional and most of it is made up. the vehicles have terrible controls until you upgrade them a little and it keeps crashing and also it restarts my kindle. his attacks are also alittle borring he needs more. so if your not too sure about the whole thing then don't blow 7 bucks on it
B000QDA7OU|3.0|My disappointment of course is not with the movie itself, as it is a wonderful movie. I did think however, that it was going to be remastered and in better shape than it was. It looked as if nothing had be done to it whatsoever. When you buy vintage movies, read everything about it. . . has the sound been remixed, has the movie been remastered? It is something to take into consideration for all you purist out there. Beware. . .

0743454537|5.0|How could she do that? What is he thinking? Why is he not saying anything? How could they do that to their own daughter? How can she do that to her own sister? Is she going to die? These are all the provoking questions and thoughts that came to my mind as I was reading the controversial book My Sisters Keeper. This book will grab your attention and not let you go until the final miracle or last goodbye. Jodi Picoult inserts the reader to make your feel like you are a part of the chaotic family and as your criticize each character you think to yourself well....what would I do?<br /><br />It starts off as a regular family with loving parents and two happy kids growing up. However, when the eldest, Kate, gets diagnosed with leukemia, each member of this once perfect family comes crashing down. Willing to do anything to save Kate, the parents decide to have a perfectly genetically matched daughter in a petri dish so that from her birth Anna will be able to help their daughter live a longer life. As the parents, Brain and Sarah get so caught up with Kate's disease that they cannot see the pain the other two children are going through.<br /><br />Anna, a courageous young women, decides she has had enough when her parents ask her to give up her kidney and that she is finished with the hospital procedures and wants to live a normal life. She can no longer be controlled by the condition of Kate. Before she was born, her parents where already thinking about procedures for her to go through so that she would be able to help Kate. \\"It made me wonder, though, what would have happened if Kate had been healthy. Chances are, I'd still be floating up in heaven or wherever, waiting to be attached to a body to spend some time on Earth.\\"  She collects all the money she can and hires a lawyer to get her medically emancipated from her parents. She has decided that she no longer wants to be the lifeline for Kate anymore. Or at least that what she makes us believe...<br /><br />And then there was Jesse. He on the other hand can no longer handle to lack of attention. He feels he has no purpose in his family because he was not a genetic match and could not save his sister. He turns his way of life to drugs, alcohol, fires and other criminal works. Jodi Picoult's writing style throughout the character of Jesse consists of very dark and dangerous acts. As Jesse reacts to his sister death he states. \\"I imagined the raindrops melting away my skin. I waited for the one stroke of lightning that would arrow through my heart and make me feel one hundred percent alive for the first time in my whole sorry existence.\\" He goes back to a flashback on drugs where he would rather have lightning strike him in the heart than have to go back to the reality of his family and live through his sister death. Even though it would kill him he would still feel more alive and less pain then the pain he feels watching his sister slowly die one earth. This is only the beginning.<br /><br />From there the story twist, falls and rises. New relationships form and even more come crashing down. This novel will have you reading on the edge of your seat with eyes wide open. Another reason why I loved this book is because Picoult did not just take the story from one person in the family perspective. She wrote from the perspective of everyone involved in Kate's life so that the reader gets a whole different story from each character and you come to realize how controversial and how difficult this situation is no matter your relationship to someone who is dying. After reading this book, not only did I just want to read it again but I also decided to read another one of her books called Nineteen Minutes. Picoult is an excellent writer who will leave you flabbergasted after every chapter.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a very good book and sadly the last I the hunger games series. In my opinion I like to finish a series so if you have read the 1st and 2nd I would suggest this book. I did seem to like te first book the best bit mocking jay would take a definite close call with the first book. I hope anyone who who buys this book loves it as much as me!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I use this all the time. My tv just burnt out or broke somehow so I couldn't play on the tv so I just hooked up my Xbox to the g155 and played on that. It has very sharp graphics too. Love it
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Unique story, easy read, 80s & 90s references, likeable characters.......there isn't much not to like with this book.  It is not a difficult read either.<br /><br />If you're over 30 you will laugh with this book.  The references are amazing, comical, and detailed.  If you're over 30 AND you are a video gamer, this may end up being one of your favorite books ever.  It certainly is one of mine.<br /><br />I'm not going to go any further because I will end up spoiling a great novel.  If you want to kick back and laugh with an easy weekend read, I highly recommend this title.
B004QL7K8E|5.0|Project X is a really awesome out of control party movie that we all wish we could experience at least once in our lives.  (I'd definitely like one like it!)  The movie is definitely farfetched, but very fun to watch.  It keeps you curious how everything is going to turn out at the end for Thomas and his friends.  I definitely recommend this movie to anybody who likes having parties and to people who like storylines that are really farfetched and spiral out of control the more the movie goes on.  Also, if you're into movies like this I also recommend [[ASIN:B000SW16M6 Risky Business]] and [[ASIN:B005DD7CKU Take Me Home Tonight]] if you haven't already seen them.  They're all good coming of age movies that are worth your time and money.
0143119680|5.0|I had probably picked this book up four times and put it back down before finally ordering it from Amazon. I just didn't want to read another vampire book. But lo! I was so wrong! It took me a couple chapters to understand that the witches in this world are for real, magical witches, not just Wiccans. Once I got that, I was smitten. The pacing is perfect, the characters are compelling, and stuff just keeps. On. Happening. So much action! And the ending... No spoilers, just a massive excitement for the next book.<br /><br />Basically, this is a supernatural book for intelligent readers. The scholarly component is wonderful. Also, make sure to have some wine on hand. One character drinks it incessantly, describing it in ways you don't typically read about, that will make you want to enjoy a glass or two as well.
030746363X|4.0|After reading some of the reviews on here, I have to say that I think this book is for the healthy layperson, not the health professional.<br /><br />As an average person, I have found Ferriss' wisdom enlightening. Not to mention that his writing style is clever and entertaining enough that I actually read his diet/lifestyle book which I could never bring myself to do with other authors.<br /><br />I have been following his prescribed diet for 4 weeks and have lost 22 lbs and 5% body fat. I plan to continue for a bit longer as I have more weight to lose. I'm not concerned with diet professionals disagreeing with this diet, or suggesting that it's unhealthy because there isn't a diet out there that dieticians will agree on. There is always someone who takes issue with a diet. I've struggled with an eating disorder for roughly 10 years of my life, and when I finally gave it up, I put on the pounds. I have never been able to follow a diet for more than a week which is why I always defaulted to my disorder to lose weight. This is the first time in my life I have lost weight in a healthy way and stayed on a diet.<br /><br />Although I'll grant part of my success to my active lifestyle as I walk several miles a day and engage in strenuous exercise three times a week at least, I have had that lifestyle for more than a year and didn't lose weight till I paired my exercise up with Tim's diet.<br /><br />I think buying the book was a worthwhile investment for me. It's entertaining and full of advice and ideas. Tim doesn't claim to be a doctor, he's not trying to prescribe anything, just help and inspire.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These phones are awesome! My only complaint is I was used to a little more bass with a different pair of sony headphones so these were a little getting used to. I feel they deliver waaaaay better sound than my previous headphones. They're not super pricey either. They fold up real nice and the sound output is very clear. I heard things in songs that I never heard before. I use them for recording and I can have them up louder and the mic doesnt pick up the music from the headphones. Love these headphones.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|So dissapointing. Based on all the hype I was expecting something fun and engaging. What I got was a piece of stale cardboard.<br />It's pretty rare for me to not finish reading a book - I can count the number of its on one hand. Well, I got to add another one to the list with Redshirts.<br />Truly rubbish.
0385340540|4.0|Yeah, I agree withh everybody else, there was a little too much travel dialogue in it that slowed down the middle.  But the story was good enough that it was still a page turner for me, I couldn't wait to see what would happen to the lead because the odds are more stacked against him than most Grisham characters.
0060591714|5.0|The book arrived on time, and in good conditions.Is going to be use for my daughter'spanish class. It was at a good price.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Spoiler alert.  Don't read this if you haven't already ready the 3rd or 4th books.<br /><br />Ok people, those of you who are saying this book is boring or that there is no \\"plot advancement\\" obviously aren't true fantasy/sci-fan fans and/or have no understanding or appreciation of the amount of time and talent that went into the making of a book like this (much less the entire series).  Not to mention an innordinate amount of impatience.  I will agree that there are a lot of characters in this series, but I would not say it's boring or that there's no plot advancement.  How can you say there is no plot advancement when he kills off major (and minor) characters at the most unexpected times, takes plot twists when you least expect it, and ends chapters (and entire books) on cliffhangers that leave you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next?  Yes, there is \\"downtime\\" for the characters and yes, they have self-reflection and think and ponder on things.  That's what makes them real, believable, and relatable.  This is what's called character development.  And GRRM does character development on a level I have seen few authors accomplish.  GRRM is a born writer, truly talented in a way that others can only dream of.<br /><br />I actually like that he takes you so far in depth into the characters rather than just having random \\"bad guys\\" throughout who are presented as such and you never hear their side of the story, what made them that way. Instead you are just forced into the only point of view that the author gives you which is that this is just a bad person.  But maybe something bad happened to him when he was younger, maybe he doesn't want to be a bad person and wants to redeem himself, or maybe he really is just truly evil.  By giving the backstory to characters with such a high level of development, he lets the readers form their own opinions rather than just telling them what to think.  I mean, I actually cried when Robb, Grey Wind and Catelyn were killed and when Brienne and Podrick were killed.  Maybe some of you will think that is lame, but I think it shows you how compelling these characters are and how relatable they are.  I wouldn't have been nearly as sad about Brienne and Podrick if I hadn't known as much about them as I did.<br /><br />Anyway, I say it's a GREAT book, and a GREAT series.  If you truly LOVE fantasy/sci-fan then you will LOVE these books.  But if you get bored easily, are highly impatient, or just don't CARE about characters the way I do, then don't waste your time reading these books.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but don't knock something and say negative things if you aren't even a true fan of the author or the genre.  True fantasy fans have a fine appreciation for a good, hearty fantasy read, something deep and gritty and powerful, not your fru-fru pop lit damstel-in-distress-princesses-who-wait-for-knights-to-save-them-fall-madly-in-love-and-kill-the-evil-monster books.  If that's what you're looking for, you won't find it here.
0307719219|4.0|3.5 stars: Acemoglu and Robinson's central thesis isn't hard to understand: countries with inclusive, equitable political and economic institutions tend to prosper, while those with extractive, exclusive institutions geared towards the interests of a small elite tend to languish. The authors minimize geography and culture as significant factors in the equation, pointing to nations where those realities are similar but political systems vary.<br /><br />The dynamic exists, the authors maintain, because the interests of an exploitative elite and those of regular citizens are usually in conflict, so the elite must actively block democratic movements, workers rights, unions, property rights, innovation, etc. in order to maintain a hold on power. In more inclusive systems, meanwhile, there is a virtuous circle effect, in which opportunity breeds motivation and meaningful choice, while making it hard for anyone to consolidate too much power over others.<br /><br />It's a strikingly simple hypothesis -- a little too simple, I think -- but the authors back it up with a wide set of historical cases, ranging from post-Renaissance Europe, to the colonial Americas (noting the different approaches taken by English and Spanish settlers in controlling their territories), to post 17th century Britain, to the United States (monopolies and trusts are discussed), to the Arab world, to the Soviet Union, to modern Africa, to North versus South Korea. Even if you more or less accept the book's ideas, the details are still informative. If you're not familiar with the political differences between imperial Spain and England, they cast quite a bit of light on the separate paths taken by the two former world powers -- and their former colonial possessions. Similarly, you don't appreciate what apartheid meant for South Africa until you've contemplated just how the system was structured to impede blacks from becoming more than cheap sources of labor. As was a problem in the US, too.<br /><br />The examinations seemed politically balanced. Communist governments taking a drubbing, and the authors argue that China's rapid growth as orchestrated by Bejiing is unlikely to be sustainable unless the Party relinquishes more of its grip. But Acemoglu and Robinson also pay attention to how capitalist monopolies undermine democratic ideals, as do weak or corrupt central governments that lack the power to enforce laws and protect individual rights.<br /><br />The book has its blind spots, though. I simply don't agree with the authors that geography doesn't matter. Most wealthy countries, it seems to me, have inclusive systems, but were also blessed in resources, either obtained locally, or extracted from some other region. It's easy, for example, to see a country like the Netherlands as owing its prosperity to a liberal democracy that overcame a lack of natural gifts, but that's not the whole story. The Netherlands got started on a path to prosperity because it set up exploitative trading companies during the colonial era and eventually reallocated the wealth into new ventures. Being \\"inclusive\\" at home or among upper classes doesn't mean the same was true abroad or among lower classes. I also think that geopolitics is underrepresented as a factor in Why Nations Fail. South Korea and Israel might be successful countries in spite of tough landscapes, but both enjoyed massive military and economic support from the United States, enabling technological economies to flourish. It's not that a country like Zimbabwe has no chance of becoming a technology center, but it would have to find a way to produce skilled workers who can compete in the global economy, without being tempted to emigrate. Creating an educated population has significant start-up costs, even with the best of intentions.<br /><br />All in all, the ideas that Acemoglu and Robinson promote are important foundational ones, but should be considered with their blind spots taken into account. Readers interestedin history for its own sake might enjoy the case studies; if not, the themes are pretty repetitive.
0345803485|4.0|The first book was very hard to get into. After the first half of book 1 it was a very easy, distracting read. E L James takes the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotions and and control. I was barely able to to any housework until the trilogy was over. Book 2 is my favourite as the story line was already built in book 1. Christian and Anastasia are their own kaleidoscope of sex, happiness and commitment. Well Done James! I look forward to Elliot and Katherine's story

0425263908|4.0|I loved the book.. Great writing and story line.. The only thing I don't like is that you have to wait for the second book in Oct. By that time I would have read tons of books and will have to go back and get back on track with the storyline to where I left off.. I read throught Fifty Shades of Gray one right after another.. if there is a third eddition to this one and I have to wait.. I might not purchase it.. Too long inbetween books..
B0061PEAUY|4.0|From some of the previous reviews, I see some people did not like this book. I mostly liked it. The mystery was pretty good - but I do agree - I learned way more about diamond mining that I ever wanted to know.<br /><br />Dr. Reichs did not go into as much detail on the forensics as she has in the past. Maybe she thinks we already have learned all we can. At any rate, less on the diamond mining and more on the case would have been better.<br /><br />She also needs to have her chapters flow a bit better - rather than making so many of last paragraphs rival a season finale of TV. We're already planning to turn the page (in just a second or two).<br /><br />While some people have commented that there was no forward movement on her relationship with Detective Ryan - I thought it was fine. He's unhappy about her past relationship with the Mountie but also concerned for his daughter. He needs to sort his own feelings out.  I don't think he's over Tempe just yet. As far as Tempe and the Mountie. She was clear that she felt he was a mistake from her past and time and distance did not diminish that feeling. And the fact that RCMP Hasty didn't share that feeling - just annoyed her. I'm thinking most women would have the same reaction. He did seem to think he was a stud that she was pining for - which is about 180 degrees from what she was feeling.<br /><br />One thing Tempe needs to work on is to quit getting herself into circumstances where she's in so much danger. For heaven's sake - she's been around law enforcement enough - she should be able to have a clearer idea about when and how to ask for help. If she were to act a bit more professionally, she would be taken more seriously by law enforcement personnel.<br /><br />Anyhow the book's pretty good - just do what I did and skim over all the diamond mine stuff. It doesn't add much to the story.

0375842209|5.0|Just finished reading this book... Words, as powerful as they are, can not explain how beautiful this book is.<br />The Book Thief is a young girl, adopted by foster parents in the poor area in Germany, who learns to trust, live, love, and survive. The first book she stole was a Gravedigger's book, found in the snow in a cemetery where her little brother was buried. From then on, she tries learning to read, and eventually, with help from her papa, masters the art of reading and understands the manipulating and wonderful power of words. She makes best friends along the way that help her grow. The story speeds up when they let a Jew hide in their basement, and the rest, you must read for yourself.<br />This book is smartly executed, too, with Death as the narrator. Death has a weird, dry, and entertaining type of humor, that's great with teen or young adult readers. Zusak introduces the thought-provoking possibility that Death may be just as afraid of us as we are afraid of death. That maybe this fear should not be directed at Death, but at the many circumstances and sequence of events that lead to death. The way the story is narrated is a little hard to understand at first, but worry not, because you'll get accustomed to it, and the story speeds up fairly quickly. This book is also very emotional... left me in a mess of snot and tears. I feel that it has changed the way I see things with its symbolism and artful execution.<br />This book is a must read, and will definitely leave you asking questions that usually do not have solid, black and white answers.
0439023491|5.0|I'm not one for teen books or movies but after having everyone I know tell me I have to see the movie, I gave in.  After becoming completely engulfed by the film and left with the cliffhanger I thought, well what happens next?!  Right away I ordered books one and two.  I ordered the first because no movie incorporates every detail and purchased part two to answer my original question.  The first was amazing and original, took me a day to read it cover to cover.  I was moved to say the least.  I have recommended this book and the movie to everyone I know.  When I read the second (which took me well under twelve hours), I was angry for not buying the third at the time I purchased one and two.  The suspense is only to be described as wonderful.  The 'ending' of the second book I didn't see coming and loved it.  The plot of the second book had such a twist that I actually said, \\"oh my God, oh no...how could they do that?\\" aloud.  I am addicted to the Hunger Games and am waiting for the third book to come in now.
1452101426|5.0|This book is super cool and perfect for a brave fan. Shows all the sketches and pretty much everything in the movie and tells you about the process of making the movie etc. The pictures and sketches alone are awesome. Highly recommend for a disney fan or a collector.

B005LAIHPY|4.0|Okay, okay... now -I've reviewed Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and the lastest version of \\"The Tempest\\" -both of which are excellent, extremely well done movies.  But just like with metal (the music genre): there's \\"thinking man's metal\\" and \\"down and dirty, beat you up metal\\"... This movie is more akin to the latter -just don't think about it.<br /><br />I heard and read about all the angst this movie received from reviewers and even moviegoers.  Now, I'm not saying it's the best thing since \\"Citizen Kane\\" or something retarded, but this movie is actually pretty good -for a \\"turn your brain off, aliens attack, sci-fi flick\\" -that involves the U.S. Navy.<br /><br />First off, the movie has some (genuinely) funny moments that don't come across scripted (per se).  Second, the story/plot -while not over emphasizing using all your gray matter to figure out, is simple. Aliens come here, want to take over -we kick their a**! (Well, the U.S. Navy does but still, you get the picture)... Third, Taylor Kitsch isn't Tom Hanks but he did a pretty good job in leading the movie... He may not be a \\"name\\" star yet, but who cares!?<br /><br />This movie shows the U.S. Navy in a very positive light (similar to \\"Top Gun\\") and honestly, maybe I'm biased because I'm pro military, but I really believe the negative hype against this movie is undeserved. This isn't a \\"perfect\\" movie, nor is it a thinking man's movie... It's sci-fi action flick -period.<br /><br />Look, if you believe the hype then don't even watch this movie.  You have to want to give it a chance.  Again, it isn't THE MOST AWE INSPIRING MOVIE EVER MADE, but it is a fun popcorn flick with great special effects and the U.S. Navy kicking some alien butt. This movie is similar to \\"Independence Day\\" in that respect -don't take it so seriously and look for flaws and plot holes -cause you'll find'em. Enjoy it for what it is. Give it a watch -it's fun!!!  Just don't forget the popcorn :)
1118026470|5.0|By showing how to detect and exploit a web application's vulnerabilities, this book becomes a must-read for all web developers.<br /><br />What I liked about this book:<br /><br />1. The authors start from first principles - right from the HTTP protocol and various encoding schemes.<br />2. The authors provide examples for every assertion they make. The words \\"for example\\" occur over and over, and are always followed by helpful real life scenarios.<br />3. This is a very current book, so you'll see a treatment of modern web application concepts<br />4. Very easy to read - it can literally be read in a single sitting if you dare.<br />5. Workbook style sections lead you through a practical application of concepts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is significant repetition across chapters. While this may have been an intentional pedagogical technique to reinforce concepts, I found it distracting.<br /><br />Also, there is a lot of self promotion going on in this book. You are either continually being directed to their commercial web site or you are being sold on their commercial testing suite.<br /><br />Despite these minor quibbles, I was very impressed by both the quality of this book's content as well as the quality of its writing.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a great read, fast moving, and very spell-binding.  I would like to read more from this author.  She does not waste my time filling pages of words of description that so many authors do to pad their work. I will watch for more writings by Kathleen Grissom.

Starts off strong with \\"Dirty Paws\\" and \\"King and Lionheart.\\" \\"Lake House,\\" \\"Little Talks,\\" \\"Love, Love, Love,\\" and \\"Yellow Light\\" are phenomenal.

0316056863|5.0|This book is all about Tina Fey's life experiences. Boy, is she funny! Have you seen her on Saturday Night Live? She's fabulous, and it's not just because she resembles Sarah Palin. She also has her own show, 30 Rock. Most people don't understand the title, don't they know the title is referring to an address: 30 Rockefeller (in the Rockefeller building) in New York.<br /><br />Tina Fey talks about growing up, her time on SNL, how 30 rock came to be, motherhood, and everything else that happened in her life. I read this book, and then later listened to it on audiotape. If you get a chance to listen to the book, I would highly recommend it. Tina narrates the book and she is just fabulous! She knows how to grab you laugh.<br /><br />I was cleaning the house, with my headphones in, listening to Bossypants, laughing out loud. You must read.

0374214913|4.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan is a romp through the world of  ancient and modern codes, through the book arts, typography and the geeky wonders of Google.<br /><br />Clay, a young out of work graphic designer gets a job at Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore in San Francisco. The time is the present. Clay discovers a secret society of weird clientele who borrow books having text with no discernable meaning. Clay's job requires that he write detailed descriptions of each and every borrower and the circumstances of the interaction. As he does so, he realizes that Mr. Penumbra's bookstore is a front for some kind of secret society and that Mr. Penumbra and the clients who borrow from his bookstore are all initiates.<br /><br />It soon becomes clear that these mysterious patrons are on a quest to unravel a code hidden within the books shelved in the bookstore. Clay calls on friends from the techno-geek underground to help him unravel the mysteries of the bookstore. His girlfriend works at Google and desires to become one of the project management team. His oldest friend has become wealthy by creating software for the gaming industry dedicated to modeling the appearance of breasts under sweaters. Clay knows a pioneer in the pirating of copyright protected books. One of his roommates creates hyper-realistic physical models for the high-tech movie industry. All of his friends, as well as Mr. Penumbra and one of Mr. Penumbra's former patrons, are enlisted to employ their unique skills in order to solve the mysterious code, a code purported to grant eternal life.<br /><br />According to the book, this code is related to a font purportedly developed by one of the earliest typographers, somebody named Gerritszoon.  If you google 'Gerritszoon', one of the things that comes up is Erasmus.  Erasmus is one of the last people who was supposed to know all of human knowledge.  All the fonts in the books in Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Book Store are in Gerritszoon font.<br /><br />We have a Dungeon and Dragons-like quest. In the end the code is not what we expect. The hiding place is unexpected and the meaning is both more and less than anticipated. This is a very enjoyable read, ultimately about the endurance of friendship and ideals.><br />We have a Dungeon and Dragons-like quest. In the end the code is not what we expect.

0812550706|3.0|I had many recommendations about this book, from its citation in [[ASIN:0143116843 Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century]] to personal recommendations from friends.  After finishing it, going over some online Sparknotes, and reflecting on it, I have to say that I get what the book was trying to convey, but it felt rather hollow to me.  The fact that these are children who are being manipulated and used to train for and win an intergalactic war is shocking at first, but by the time the last game is played, the last revelation is made and the curtain of illusions is raised, I feel pretty accustomed to it and Ender's personal pain and anguish over his own actions no longer moves me to pity or remorse.  Perhaps Mr. Card was going for that, but it just didn't move me to shock or grief or empathy as you would expect such a twist ending to do.  And the last chapter, where Ender starts a new religion and is given a chance to reclaim his humanity, felt rather rushed with little time to chew on it.  For me, Ender's Game is a good book, but not a great one.
B008FOB124|5.0|Anastasis, the new album by Dead Can Dance, is superb.  This is a much more symphonic recording than past DCD albums.  A must have for any fan of brilliant, beautiful music.
0525952616|2.0|I killed the book. Sorry for all of those fans who like it so much. I wonder if I am just too old for a book like this. But for years I have read many books with military acronyms and did just fine. I think the writing here leaves  a lot to be desired. Too many characters and a wobbly plot made this book just a slog for me. But, I'll defend your right to like it to the very end!
B00008OWZC|5.0|What can be said about this band that hasn't already been said by generations of adoring Zep fanatics.  If nothing else, it seems to set the record straight that they were an outstanding live act; as though this was disputed prior to the release of this album!  On the contrary, everyone knows Led Zeppelin was a force of nature when placed in front of a crowd.  And these performances, culled from their 1972 tour, show just this.  The band tears through their numbers, both electric and acoustic, with precision and recklessness, grace and grit, humility and headstrong dominance.  They certainly sound like they own the venue, and the crowd for that matter, when they unleash their blues-based fury.  This album also usurps the long criticized The Song Remains The Same and gives fans a live album that finally lives up to the high expectations the band set.  Highly recommended.

0142419400|4.0|Rating: 4<br /><br />The Low Down: Anna gets sent to an American school in Paris for her senior year of high school.<br /><br />Best Thang `Bout It: It's been a long time since I have read a good ChickLit book like this one. I love that it's set in Paris, Anna knows no French, she loves the cinema, her Dad writes cheesy romance novels and her potential love interest is French/British/American. Who couldn't fall for a guy named Etienne St. Clair who speaks with a British accent? Seriously! There are complications, friendships tested, break-ups and mean girls; illness, drunkenness  sleeplessness and heartlessness; and at the end of it all, there is forgiveness.<br /><br />I'm Cranky Because: My book seemed to stop at page 372. I wanted more pages. I even shook the book upside down, but there weren't any more. Plus, that's the bad thing about romances; once they get together, you can't really have a sequel that packs the same punch, can you?<br /><br />Should You?: Mais oui!<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss was published on December 2, 2010 by Dutton Juvenile.<br /><br />Genre: Young Adult Contemporary Romance<br />Ages: 12 and up

B004EPYZSK|5.0|Good movie!  Really, really bad title!!!  I'm aware that this movie is based upon a graphic novel of the same name, but that's no excuse for keeping the title!  The title discouraged me from seeing this in the theatres and my son had no interest in this movie for the same reason.  But both of us loved it!  So whichever of the many producers chose to keep this title should be fired! Better titles:\\"The Strange Events at Saddle Rock\\", (I'm making up the town name here.) \\"Demons at Black Rock\\", \\"Really Bad Day at Black Creek\\" -- almost any other title would've been better!  Heck, even \\"Snakes on the Plains\\" might've been better.  All I'm saying is: Don't be discouraged by the title.  Daniel Craig is a convincing cowboy for a limey and the movie is light-hearted escapism.  This is now on my Amazon wishlist.

B0032Y0OH0|4.0|I'm digitizing some footage that requires just minimal editing in Sony Vegas 11, so I decided the ShuttleXpress would fit the bill for me (not needing more than the 5 hotkeys this unit provides).<br /><br />When setting up the buttons for Vegas 11, I noticed that only previous versions were predefined.  No problem, I went through the steps to setup the buttons for Vegas 11, which requires you to navigate to the .exe file that you will be running for the program you're setting up.  I followed the steps, but when I tried my hotkeys in Vegas, they did not work (or responded differently than what I had programmed).  It took me awhile to figure out; it turns out that the software was reading Vegas 11 as Vegas 6.0 and was using those predefined key sets.  If I right-clicked the contour software in the system tray, there were two key sets available: Vegas 6.0, and my custom set.  I selected the custom set that I made, and everything worked perfectly.<br /><br />Until I tabbed out of the program and came back to it.  The contour software defaulted back to the \\"Vegas 6.0\\" settings.  I have been unable to figure out how to set the software to my custom set, so instead I edited the Vegas 6.0 set to my custom settings.<br /><br />Now that that's done, everything works fine and my workflow is much easier to manage and I'm flying through these simple edits.<br /><br />About the unit itself (instead of the software): the jog/shuttle wheel is responsive and easy to find the desired scrub speed.  The three middle buttons do have recesses in them to help you to know where you're at without looking.  Overall, this small footprint unit feels pretty solid for it's size.

I did get a little tired of the amount of times the two got it on, When I did I just skipped over it and on with the rest of the story.I am now looking for my Christian Gray LOL.I read all three books ! You will want to after reading the first one. More of the story in the second and third book.It is a reason it is on the best seller list!!!!!!!!!!!

I have been collecting their albums since and have seen them 4 times.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels is a HUGE step in a new direction for Rush. It has everything that has been missing fromn their past 4-5 albums; Neil's doublebass \\"how in the hell can one man do that\\" drumming.....Alex is in a world of his own on this album and Geddy, by far, has found his old stroke. They simply mesh so damn well on this album. It is a breath of fresh air. Anybody that considers themself a fan HAS to buy this one!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved Fifty Shades Darker : of the Fifty Shades trilogy. Outstanding!I started reading this trilogy of books with Fifty Shades of Grey that I bought from a book store and could not quit reading and had to order this instantly to keep reading the other two books. I was sorry when I was finished.
0425263908|3.0|I'd like to start off my saying that while this book resembles Fifty Shades of Grey, it is no where near as good. I must say that the author did not plagiarize, as many people are sayin. Since plagiarism is exactly copying someone elses work, the author simply took the idea James had successfully written about and made it her own. I must say though, this book was well written compared to Fifty Shades. Which is why I gave it the extra star.<br /><br />While I tried to find a book that would take the place of, or at least wow me just as much as Fifty Shades did sadly, this was not it. It's unrealistic, which wouldn't be so bad given there was a plot involved. I feel this story was all over the place and never made me want to read more after I finished a chapter. I simply finished the book just to finish what I started. The relationship they have is seriously messed up just as much as their past and there's nothing in the book that makes me understand their love connection. I also missed the part when it's said why his past is so messed up, or was it never mentioned? Either way this book was just OK.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|...this may be the book for you. Fantasies where the gangly and uncoordinated young girl 1) meets rich and very good-looking young man; 2) entices said rich and very good-looking young man; 3) experiences a series of unusual events, all the while having amazing, mind-blowing sex with said rich and very good-looking young man.<br />I don't know about you, but I shamefully enjoyed the trilogy.<br />A very easy read, probably worth it. Put away your 'Booker Prize' books for a short while, enjoy Fifty Shades for what it is: something to get you in the mood!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|best game ever it is sooooo adicting and awesome. I stay Hp so late playing I t I have all the gadgets and jeypack I am on the highest catigore love it get it recommend it
B0086700CM|3.0|There are some glitches and lags during the game which can get tiresome.  Also, there is not much of a scenery or goal change, therefore can be quite boring.  But, if you are new to this game or just enjoy a quick challenge while commuting, then this is wholly suitable.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I have been watching \\"Teen Wolf\\" since the first episode aired on MTV. When I saw the previews I thought it might be a good show...I was not disappointed, this show has a great story line. What I like most about it is that each character is evolving, and all the good stuff isn't just focused on one character....I recommend this show to anyone, and yolu should also check out season 2 its great as well..I'm gonna purchase it as soon as its on DVD!!!
030758836X|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've read in a while. I was intrigued by the description of it, but right from the first sentence I was hooked. It was extremely hard to put it down. I knew the book was \\"disturbing\\" and had some sort of twist, but despite that it was not predictable by any means. The writing is great, the characters are very...interesting to say the least. I was never once bored while reading this book. Gillian is a great writer, and I would recommend this book to anyone!
B0086700CM|5.0|The first game I've found worthy of a review.  Great graphics, smooth game play, a challenge but not a super hard impossible game.  I love it, works smoothly on my Kindle Fire.  It doesn't drain the battery. This is a great game for just about any age group.  A friends 3 year old plays it, a friends teenager plays it and a 57 year old woman that I work with says she's hooked.  It was free but I after playing it I would pay for it if that was required.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I don't normally write any reviews, but I just had to say that I was truly suprised at how much I would enjoy this book.  It's a fun read and the writer definately keeps you wanting to know more.
6305014140|5.0|WOW! Everybody who hates this movie points out the rapes scenes (2). Then they go on about how the  movie potrays women and how she should be feeling as a rape victim. Here's the deal...she is a FREAKING ninja and will not be acting to the whims of people living in todays society. She's probably gonna act like a ninja. For a simple example is if someone rapes a women who is a myu thai champion well he may get his ass kicked in a dark alley, if someone rapes a police officer he may get shot down in the near future. If someone I know got raped they would probably be paranoid for a little while, need to go to a rape crisis center. If a ninja gets raped and survives the encounter the rapist may find that leaving her alive was not a good idea. Also Ninja's a more akin to modern day soldiers and take orders from high on up, (ninja seeing as it's lifelong commitment are probably more loyal and are made not to fear death). So it's hard to believe that she would act the way the reviewers would and also that this occurs a long time ago where there were few laws and those that were made were made in royalties favour... seriously read a James Clavell novel for more examples on this. It would suggest to me that the one who hated this movie aren't well versed in the asian culture of a long time ago and should probably never have even tried to watch this. For the other positive reviews I 'm proud to say there all probably true...good solid movie, well animated, good bloody battles, creative villians, oh and yeah that's right a little rapage here and there.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Amazing product, A must buy for everyone who possesses a Plantronic Bluetooth Headset. Infact it should be included with the purchase.
B004FZS0N0|5.0|Wow!  Most of these songs were recorded when Cody was either 12 or 13!  Most pre-teens don't have the talent or GUTS to do what young Cody Simpson is doing!  All of these songs are fun to listen and dance to!  Just by pushing play on this sucker you can have your own dance party or carnival in your backyard.  Joking aside, it is quality work from such a young boy.  This child has soul and ambition, and it is only going to grow!  An acoustic version of iYiYi is featured also.  Honestly, I think it's a track for the haters just so they can see his pure voice with just a guitar and no autotone or tweaks.  Flo Rida is featured on the original version of iYiYi (that right there is telling you that even the popular Flo Rida has faith in this boy).  I hope this boy turns into a superstar, because he is deserving of it and already has the talent.  I know his target audience ranges from Elementary-Junior high girls, but I think all ages will enjoy his sound.<br /><br />This Australian boy is genuine and LEGIT!  He may be young, but watch out for him in the future because he may change the music industry for the better one day!

1401937519|5.0|To start this review, I must preface it by saying that I am an spiritual agnostic (if that makes any sense) who, for years, has been intrigued by quantum physics, out of body experiences, quantum healing, and other pseudo sciences.  Mind you, I have been interested in these things as a passing fancy - I always feel like slowly but surely I am putting together the pieces of the puzzle that sooner or later will all fit together perfectly.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by my older sister.  I have recently changed my diet to a vegan diet since I have rheumatoid arthritis and I have studied the affects of food on inflammatory diseases.  Anyways, I was at a restaurant, and I was frightened by everything I put in my mouth since some of the foods contained dairy products.  I wanted to make sure that I didn't accidentally eat dairy.  My sister told me about this book, and about two weeks later I bought it.  My life has not looked the same since.<br /><br />Not only was this book an absolute joy to read, I found myself relating to Anita Moorjani on so many levels.  I think that most people are people-pleasers to some extent.  We all want our parents to feel proud of us.  We sometimes put the needs of others over our own.  And we're all trying to find our place on this earth.  Through our journeys, some of us might experience health problems along the way.  In fact, most of us will.  Like Anita, my arthritis has forced me to be a little more introspective in the recent years.  Pain will do that to you.<br /><br />I realized after reading this book just how important it is to express who you really are to the world!  There is no greater gift that loving yourself and accepting yourself fully!!!!!  It is more difficult than it sounds.<br /><br />For me, this book not only changed my perspective on life and our purpose for being on earth in human bodies, it also opened the door to other NDErs who had a similar experience as Anita's.  I am absolutely hooked!  What lifeafter life looks like has brought such a profound change in the way that I live my life, not only do I feel more at peace with myself and my life, but my arthritis has actually improved!!!  I cannot emphasize enough how important this book was/ is to me.  After seeing what life is really about - hint: it's not about our jobs, our incomes, our boyfriends or girlfriends - my health has made a drastic turn for the better.  I cannot express my appreciation enough.  It is evidence for me that what she talks about it true and real in every important sense there is.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone who feels lost in the world.  Anyone dealing with a health issue.  Anyone who feels afraid to be themselves.  This will give you the courage to live your life fearlessly and fully!<br /><br />Happy reading!!!!

B007EDCWHA|5.0|For the person who gave this one star, shame on you!!! That's why you should have got it at Wal-Mart!!! FYI the book is better if you get it in print and not on the Kindle. For example, pictures as small as a credit card take up two pages in the actual book! If you buy this book, buy it at Wal-Mart!!!!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|How this movie didn't do better at the box office is beyond me. Good looking cast, paper thin plot, and awesome special effects. What's not to like?! It is the truest form of summer blockbuster schlock since Pirates of the Caribbean 4. I found it simple and concise; Earthlings send message into space, years later alien recon force arrivals to determine if the Earth is fit to invade. American armed forces in the form of the Navy battle the superior force and it is up to the aged Battleships to stop the aliens from sending the final acknowledgement to launch an all out invasion of Earth.  When it's all done tons of stuff has been blown up, the good guys kill all the aliens, and the hero gets the girl. Had this been made in the 90's it would have been called ID4.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|First let me say that this book was pretty long but it never dragged at all. I never got bored reading this book and found myself tearing through pages eager to get to the next chapter.<br /><br />One of the greatest parts of this book is that in reading the one book I felt like I had completed an entire epic fantasy series. I cant believe that this whole story was contained in one book, I felt like I just spend 40$ on a whole series but in truth I spent 3$ on an amazing book.<br /><br />Plot Review:<br /><br />Vaelin is the son of a renowned war hero. After his mother dies at a young age Vaelins father brings him to the door steps of the \\"6th order\\", which is an order completely devoted to the art of war and killing. The kingdom has 6 orders all devoted to different aspects of the kingdom: War, Healing, Communicating with the dead, scholarly ambitions, etc. All 6 of these orders makes up \\"The Faith\\" which is the kingdoms primary religion. Although all 6 orders concentrate on different areas of service, all are taught and expected to uphold at all times the doctrine of their religion.<br /><br />The book begins as many fantasy series do. Vaelin is cast into a world he is unfamiliar with by circumstances out of his control. He quickly distinguishes himself in this new world where friends can quickly become the deceased and the only enemy is the \\"tests\\" that he has to pass at each stage of his training. Death is a common theme throughout this book and throughout young Vaelins academy.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />Although I will not give away much I will say that throughout this book Vaelin discovers more and more about the faith that he has devoted himself fully to. It ends up not being exactly what he expects and finds that his eyes are being opened more and more to the harsh realities of deceit and manipulation.<br /><br />Eventually after graduating he finds himself in the crosshairs of a crooked king. This king is held as the leader of the faith andis known to as close of a deity as is allowed in their religion. The first chapter reveals Vaelins blind dedication to the faith where the last chapter shows Vaelins eyes finally fully opened to the truths that were held in secret.<br /><br />The king thrusts Vaelin into a world of war and conquest. Through his conquests Vaelin discovers more and more of the web of lies that the king has strung for his own motives. But the even greater revelation to our main character is that the corrupt king is the least of his worries as he finds himself a major player in an even bigger and more ancient enemy.<br /><br />Throughout the whole book Vaelin uncovers a secret power within himself that helps and guides him through the tribulations of his life. It increases in power and is held a secret as he discovers more about his power and more about himself.<br /><br />************************************************<br /><br />This was a great story that held me hooked the whole time. I can not believe it was only 3$ as it was absolutely worth more than that. Some of the great things about this book is that the author is not SCARED! So many authors are scared of how they choose to twist the plot will not be received well by its audience. So the whole story is steered by how something will be taken rather than how the author envisioned it to go. This is absolutely not the case in this book, the author holds no fear; this is his story like it or hate it it will be what he wants it to be. I couldnt have been happier that he did not succumb to the urge to do what was expected instead of being risky.<br /><br />The twists and turns of this book left me shocked and shaken at every turn. To be honest after finishing this story I still have a seed of regret in my heart of how it turned out. Would I have changed it if I had the chance? No way, it makes the story real and unique. Yet still, it does not have the cooky cutter ending that we all in the fantasy world have become accustomed to.<br /><br />If I had to describe this book in 1 word it would be: Complete. The book from start to finish tells such a complete story that it is hard to believe that the title holds the words \\"Book 1\\". The character depth of the main character is impressive. You come to know his devotion is so deep seeded in his character that he would not be who he is without it. Although the character depth in other characters in the book is shallow, I believe that plays perfectly into the theme of the book.<br /><br />The story is meant to get you into Vaelins head. Just as we, as real people, do not always know what is going on in peoples minds around us so in this book you are on the inside looking out. You do not know exactly what is going on in those around you and your opinions of people are based off of the observations and experiences of the main character, not off of some extra point of view that you have that is not shared with the main character. You understand why the character does what he does because you only have the same amount of insight that he has, nothing more nothing less.<br /><br />If I had to say what I found most impressive about this book it would be this: It is very, very, VERY hard to write a book that does not follow a specific chronological set of events. Patrick Rothfuss is one of the only authors I have seen do this style of writing with any sense of clarity. Authors brave enough to attempt to write in this style often leave the reader confused and starting over chapters trying to find out where they got lost. This did not happen to me once in this book. Times are constantly changed throughout the book as Vaelin relives his experiences to a skeptical scribe. He often jumps from the past to the present and many facts are presented in the present that do not start to make sense until you read more and more from the past. In the end the complete picture comes together and you finally understand what was presented in chapter 1. This shows a clear mind ofthe author and a lot of thought and planning. I found that it was my favorite part of the book and it led to an exciting read as more and more things began to make sense the more I continued in the story. I found myself striving to read more so that my ignorance could be cured by Vaelins life experiences.<br /><br />Overall this book was entertaining and well worth the money. For those familiar with fantasy series there are no wizards blowing up towers with a word and a bead of sweat on his brow and there are no fierce dragons that find friendship in a lowly farm hand. The fantasy aspect of this book is much more subtle but no less entertaining. I believe in future books we will see more of the fantasy aspect of this series developed. I recommend this book to anyone, even someone who is not a usual fantasy reader. It is a great read and left me wanting for more. I was excited to find a cliff hanger at the end that will result in a continuation of the story.<br /><br />In closing let me say that I hate when books leave off cliffhangers that are Humungous! You leave feeling unfulfilled and cheated. By the time the next book comes out you have completely forgotten what you were supposed to remember from the last book. This book has a cliffhanger but it only comes after completely developing and deploying the points in this first book. I will be happy to pick up where I left off when the next book comes out.<br /><br />BTW, Anyone have an idea when that will be???<br /><br />I hope this review encourages you to try this book you will not be disappointed.

B0034G4P1W|4.0|This enjoyable movie for children reminded me instantly of the Pirate ride in Disney world, with a Pirate show that was very funny as is  this movie. Pirate Captain and his crew are simply not the best Pirates in the world. Regardless of their reputation, Pirate Captain embarks on a mission for the 'Pirate Of The Year' contest. He attempts to compete, but the odds are not on his side. He decides to give up the whole idea and heads to England, where he must face more challenges. A fun-filled adventure from beginning to end, and at times hilarious. Animation is good and overall movie is enjoyable. A great summer movie for children!

B008220CHO|5.0|This horror tale is one of the most scariest movies I've ever seen. This terrifying tale of demonic possession is about a broken family,and right after a divorce, they get attacked by a supernatural entity. A young girl purchases an antique box from a yard sale, then her behavior begins to change as evil threatens to take over her body and soul. Her frantic father, who is in a state of panic, begins to realize what the demon is attempting to do to the child and tries to help. Edge-of-your-seat thrills and chills from start to finish. As scary and haunting as \\"The Exorist.\\" Acting Performance Superb. Highly Recommended to horror lovers!

B000EHSVQ4|3.0|I'm a huge fan of historical dramas, especially when the filmmaker has the vision and budget to really capture the look, feel and spectacle of past events.  When it was announced that Ridley Scott was going to make a film about the Crusades, I was really excited about the possibilities... this director knows how to manage big budgets, big sets and action scenes involving casts of thousands and get it onto the screen. Scott is a superb technical film maker and an intelligent guy.<br />Nonetheless, Kingdom of Heaven suffers too much from the Hollywood treatment and I'm not talking about the casting choices as some reviewers were quick to criticize.<br /><br />Orlando Bloom, as Balian of Ibelin, is just fine in the lead role, as are the majority of others cast in the film. The Muslim actor who portrays Saladin gives a particularly noteworthy and fairly accurate account of this historical figure.  Nope, the fault is with Bill Monahan's script (and Scott sticking to it, so faithfully)  Instead of showing Balian in a reasonably accurate manner as the wealthy inheritor of an estate in the Holy land, he's depicted as a troubled blacksmith- one who's wife has just committed suicide and who's brother is a psychotic and manipulative priest. In a long, convoluted series of scenes, Balian kills his brother, is reconnected with his long lost father who is shortly mortally wounded. He takes up the Cross (reluctantly) and arrives in Messina, ready to travel to the Holy Lands and mange his fathers estate.... but not before he's been shipwrecked !<br /><br />It takes nearly a hour of this convoluted fiction to set the stage for the religious, political and military conflicts that are to come.  Monahan finally settles down and produces some moments of clarity when Balian arrives in the Holy Land.  Of course, any historian of the Crusades could find fault in nearly ever scene, but who in the general audience would notice or care.  We should expect that in a Hollywood extravaganza, a romantic interest would be created, where none actually existed -and that's OK, too!<br /><br />Screen writer Monahan, however, is not content with simply fleshing out and elaborating on the fascinating characters of Baldwin the Leper King, his sister Sibylla, her eventual husband King Guy d' Lusignan and the rogue robber baron Reynald d'Chatillon - he fashions them into over-the-top cartoons.  There's nothing at all subtle or nuanced about the way these characters are depicted. Guy has all the emotional depth of Snidely Whiplash, while Balian plays his adversary as the slightly morose Dudley Do-Right.  Reynald is reduced to a psychopathic killer, rather than a shrewd, albeit violent, political operator. The leper king is gentle, wise and always diplomatic, to the point where it seems he's been sedated throughout Monahan's script.<br /><br />Of course, when it comes to the broader military conflict, Ridley Scott is in his directorial element and the movie captures plenty of thrilling battles, inglorious defeats and individual heroics, while keeping fairly true to the historical record. This is where Kingdom of Heaven borders on being a cinematic classic and there are awesome spectacles of Jerusalem under siege.  Certainly, Ridley Scott and Monahan had the right idea - post 9/11 - to speak to the divisive nature that religion sparks in humanity and to question how theology, greed and power can corrupt peaceful cooperation.  This movie could have been better received and gotten its core message across to a broader audience, had it been more careful to avoid the obvious cliche's of the genre.  I don't even know where to begin discussing in how lousy the script concludes.<br /><br />Hey, the boxed set does contain a nifty full length documentary about the making of Kingdom of Heaven which is really enjoyable for fans of cinema - showing how tens of millions of dollars are spent to bring an epic to the screen, department by department.  That was a fun bonus.  It's a shameall those millions weren't spent crafting a film based on more accurate, and thus meaningful, script.all those millions weren't spent crafting a film based on more accurate, and thus meaningful, script.
B009329ZF2|2.0|This is perhaps the dumbest movie I have ever seen. This movie is basically a two hundred million dollar Asylum film. If you don't know what the Asylum is, it is a film studio that makes very low budget \\"Mock-busters\\" of popular films or low budget films for the SyFy channel. Watch movie on the SyFy channel and then watch this and you'll see what I mean. This movie is corny, dumb, and ridiculous with some of the worst acting I have ever seen.<br />Something tells me that the studio wanted and alien invasion movie but wanted it to be different. So if in Independence Day the aliens are defeating in the sky and in Battle: LA they are defeated on the ground, what's left... the Sea. And because there has been success in developing Hasbro toy lines into movies (Transformers and GI Joe: Rise of the Cobra) so they decided to go with another Hasbro line, Battleship.<br /> There is also so much in this movie that makes no sense. (SPOLIERS) If the main character, Taylor Kitsch, is a slacker, how does he go from being unemployed to being a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy in just a few years, makes no sense. But the biggest problem is how incompetent the aliens are. At least in Independence Day and Battle: LA, the aliens were competent and managed to destroy most military but here the aliens were defeated by two ships. The two smaller alien ships were destroyed by one hit each from the USS John Paul Jones and the biggest one was destroyed by the seventy year old museum ship, USS Missouri.<br /> And I don't understand why the aliens don't attack unless their attacked first and even then most of the time they won't. I get why the Borg from Star Trek won't attack unless threatened, it's because of their collective mind, unless enough them recognize a threat, none of them do. But these aliens in Battleship are all individuals but Rihanna is standing there repeatedly shooting one in the face and it does nothing.<br /> But if you like corny schlock then this movie is for you. It didn't make me angry like the Transformers move did, so that's a plus.

B0093M2716|5.0|I first heard of Änglagård through a mail order catalog back in 1996. I acquired an LP copy of Hybris on the Norwegian Colours label the following year (before prices started shooting through the roof). It already went out of print, but I knew I needed to get a copy then or I'd end up forking up the big money for a copy in the future. It blew me away, never realizing prog could be done like that in 1992. Then I acquired Epilog, knowing I needed that one too, and it too blew me away, and no vocals this time. The band broke up in 1994 after their performance at Progfest '94. There was a brief reunion in 2002 minus Tord Lindman, but it was clear by 2003 the reunion didn't last. Now they reunited (again without Tord), and I was sure they'd split after a few shows, but instead they hung around long enough to record a third album, and here it is, Viljans Öga! It was released on their own label, Änglagård Records.<br /><br />Let me tell you right away, if you love their other releases, you need this album! They continue to make amazingly complex and challenging music, with Thomas Johnson providing tons of great Hammond organ and Mellotron, even some Moog. He even uses some Chamberlin sounds too, like some Chamberlin female voices. Bassist Johan Högberg is now going by the name of Johan Brand, and he just piles it with the Rickenbacker bass. Anna Holmgren's flute playing seems to play an even greater role than before. The band seems to work fine without Tord Lindman, leaving all the guitar duty to Jonas Engdegård. All the songs are around the 12-16 minute time range, and there is so much going on. Themes show up, and later on, variations on that same theme, which you might not notice until listening to many times. I love how all the instruments are clearer than anything on their first two albums, Thomas Johnson's Mellotron is more upfront, for example. \\"Ur Vilande\\" starts off with a gentle flute melody, but then soon you get some aggressive passages, and even one passage that sound like didgeridoo-like sound effects (although not from a real didg). \\"Snårdom\\" features some nice Genesis or Camel-like passages with Hackett or Latimer-like guitar passages, plus a slow, somber passage on the Hammond organ. \\"Längtans Klocka\\" has some nice flute themes, and circus music played by guests on wind instruments. It's unbelievable the 18 year gap since their last album, and they stay totally true to themselves, delivering an album just as great as the classics they gave us in the 1990s! It's probably safe to say Viljans Öga is easily the best prog release of 2012, not only that, an album destined to be a classic. I had my copy since early July 2012, and I was listening to it practically nonstop for a month. It blew me away that much. I couldn't believe that prog this good could be made in 2012! Your collection simply isn't complete without it!
1455502758|5.0|In writing this review, I can't help but also feel that I'm writing an obituary.<br /><br />The greatest thing about Hitchens was his humanity. Like the classic figures he so admired he was defined by his flaws as much as by his strengths. Yet, he sure was brilliant. His humour, erudition, pomposity and boldness, combined to form a true tempest of a public speaker. You cannot get bored while listening to Christopher Hitchens.<br /><br />But he is gone now, and for those who miss him, this book is surely his last offering. It could be described as a collection of wandering dispatches from Hitch, as he struggles to acclimatize to life in `tumourtown.' In his `year of living dyingly' the author muses on the inconvenience, humiliation, pain and tedium of his final days with esophageal cancer. He speaks about torture, prayer and predestination, euthanasia, his loss of voice (his very personality fading away). It is a deeply, to be frank, troubling book, given colour and life through Hitch's extraordinary turns of phrase. The New York Times called Elie Wiesel's [[ASIN:0374500010 Night (Oprah's Book Club)]] `a slim volume of terrifying power.' The same description is apt for this work.<br /><br />I miss Christopher Hitchens like almost no other past intellectual hero. I miss him even though on most major respects I disagree with his opinions. I miss him for his humanity, his language, his extraordinary courage. I miss him for that strange twinkle of rebellion that could be seen almost always flickering across his brow.<br /><br />This is, of ninety or so books read so far, my favourite of 2012.
B008VBYN80|5.0|seems like a fun game so far. not too far in but it seems to have a lot to offer in terms of game types and activities. recommended
B0047WJ12K|3.0|Inception concept is brand new - travelling through other person's dreams and that too iterating through the dreams. Movie is great with good sound quality. No Sub-titles - that is a problem.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun but wish you could earn more invest points for those that Caesar not to have face book.  Very fun game though. I'm addicted!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I like it so far. I've only been playing it for like 30 minutes it seem fun so far. I hope it stays like that. So no complaints yet.
1416550550|4.0|I adored this book. Completely adored it, so much that I may feel compelled to bump the four stars up to five. Morton is a great writer, and while this book had a nice mystery and interwoven clues and all, she could probably write a book with a completely meandering plot and I could still adore it because she writes so beautifully. She can make me sympathetic to a villain and fall love with exactly the character I'm supposed to fall in love with. She can make me curious, passionate, longing, frustrated, and vividly imaginative.<br /><br />So why did I knock off a star? Because she waited about 130 pages to do this. You see, while this book takes place in three different time periods, its true story is the one at the turn of the 20th century. The characters have much more depth, and rightfully so -- the main purpose of the other characters is to uncover the story that took place in the 1900s, and if Morton were to devote the same amount of depth to the characters in each century, the book would be over a thousand pages and the plot would be much less tightly cinched. However, I didn't really get drawn into the story until Eliza Makepeace (as a child) made her first appearance. That didn't happen until somewhere after the hundred page mark, and a really good novel shouldn't take that long to get going.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I loved the movie very much because the message that the movie sends is very understanding between the bond of man and dog.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|This movie seemed to parallel the book. I enjoyed watching it, but I wasn't hooked, where I watched it straight through. It took me two days to watch it.  It was a good movie though.  It took one person like Eugenia Phelan (Skeeter) to have a little courage to stand up for what is right, to inspire others to help and support her in her endeavor to write a book that may ease life for colored people in Jackson, Mississippi and other states. Although we won't know if there were instantaneous results from the storyline, we can gather that there will be changes to come because of our many history lessons in school. It definitely tells a story of the challenges and difficulties colored people had even after slavery.  I encourage you to watch the movie or read the book to see what life was like for colored people from a fictional perspective. If anything, for those who aren't that into history education,(like me), then I encourage this movie or book also because you can learn a bit of history from a fictional perspective.  And for those who were expecting a romantic happy ending for Skeeter, it isn't in the sense of Stewart, but in a sense of her success as a writer. Finally, although the movie was good, I encourage the book over the movie. It just seems a faster pace than the movie.
B000PFUAO6|1.0|Besides \\"Constant Motion\\" the rest of the album is pretty boring.Them and their goth direction since Train Of Thought have really altered their way the last few albums.I was expecting something of the early days but it's a far cry from those times.All they release is long & tedious songs with all of them clocking over 8 minutes long.I ain't saying it's bad but the last 2 to 3 albums all have clocked over 70 minutes long.Why not instead spread half of those songs and make them into 2 distinct songs not just 1 hovering 15 minutes long.I own basically all their albums besides the Bootlegs & Cover series which I have yet to purchase but let's be clear about this DT has basically experimented the last 3 albums and haven't been quite good.Why not mix some early days and of the now then you might be seeing something good but in my opinion that ain't happening neither is them keeping with the goth style look which I personally do not like.It could have been worse, they could have gone down a road like Metallica & Queensryche did,thank goodness they didn't go that far!
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I often get e-books from the local library. Some of them are adobe versions which I downloaded adobe on my kindle and still couldn't get the books to download right. Very frustrating.

1476712042|5.0|Wow, this was a rollercoaster ride I did not want to get off, these characters had me from the first page on. Addictive and intruiging, I read it in one sitting unable to put it down except to go to the bathroom amd take an occasional sip of my coffee. Some of the reviews I read before starting this book were misleading and I wished I hadn't payed any attention to them.<br />I have started my own book club with 10 amazing woman and many different personalities. This book was what I chose to start us off with for me it was an excellent choice and definitley a conversation starter.... A great summer read...
0316017930|4.0|Whether you are involved in sports, business, or performing arts, Outliers is the book for you. This book covers everything you need to succeed. I really liked this book because I could relate it to my life and what I am going to do in the future.<br /><br />While using the Beatles as an example, Gladwell tries to show the point of putting in lots of hours. He tries to emphasize that you need to devote your time into what you do. \\"And what's more, the people at the top don't work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder.\\" He even uses Mozart as example. He said that even though Mozart was composing songs at the age of 6 it took him until the age of 26 to become good enough.<br /><br />Another aspect of success that Gladwell touches on is age and the month you were born. From personal experience, my success in my softball career supports what Gladwell was saying in the quote: \\"For some reason, there were an incredible number of January, February and March birthdates.\\" There are many other aspects addressed in the book, but these were two that I could relate to most.<br /><br />I have to say out of all the books that I have had to read for summer reading, this book relates the most to me. For each example and point that Gladwell made I could relate it to something going on in my life.
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|I think this album by Fiona Apple, after several years of silence, sounds very different from her previous work; many songs are less than listenable, and don't seem to lead anywhere. \\"Tidal\\", \\"When the...\\" and \\"Extraordinary machine\\" are a totally different story.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|Apart from the gripping tale, all to the end, it should've ended like this still keeping the audiences thoughts and mind bending towards evaluating that extenuating circumstances, in a man's life cannot be experienced until he is deep under waters. **spoiler alert** they bring back the bomb back to shelton's cell. and he dials the number. It blows up the cell.. blah blah!! not how it should've ended. The whole reason sheldon does all the killings, is to prove one point. That the law should show no prejudice based on the evidence, or the counsel's maneuvering the witnesses, or the prosecutions cutting deals to maintain the conviction rates. Like he said, .. \\"it's an imperfect system, and they it's imperfect servants.. \\" but two imperfections should make a perfect justice. If they are willing to take the gloves off, when dealing with shelton, just cuz he was a worthy opponent.<br /><br />Alternate ending: the bomb is placed in shelton's cell.. but he doesnt' trigger that one, but triggers another that doesnt kill the mayor but instead destroy's a room not filled with people.., proving his tact..shelton instead shows a video that if they can play dirty,.. he already did.. (by showing his wife and kid in a room with a bomb next to them, ask him to make a hard choice.. and tell nick to live with it..) , shelton, still two steps ahead of the game, nick admits defeat ..then nick confesses his guilt in public to the press that he cut the deal, to protect his conviction rate.. and that it's an imperfect system where tampered evidences or counsel taking defense for such criminals make this insane society look sane to people's eyes ,.. his wife and kid watch him.. with disgust.. and finally a few years later the media announcements that .. cutting deals for convictions.. would not be part of the law.. and that amedments would be put in practice to make people believe in law... \\" that law abiding is also .. law believing..\\" .. shelton vanishes..  but watches from somewhere faroff .. nick and his family.. now together .. and shelton looks at his family picture and smiles.. !!<br /><br />The words or the framed sentences might not be perfect but i think.. you would get the idea.. :)
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I'm a die hard fan of this show, and I'm counting the days till season 3 in October. Basically it's a simple bluray release 4 disc set if you want special features it has quite a few including deleted scenes, webisodes, and so on. I don't know if they'll do a double dip it's possible since they did it last year. But this show is now a cultural phenomenon I see zombie commercials for all kinds of products, hornady zombie max ammo, and the list could go on. I'm not a comic reader so I have no idea whats to come, and that's the way I like it. This is a incredible show that focuses not just on zombie killing, but the human drama that comes in a apocalyptic scenario. It has characters that everyone will like/relate to I could go on thing is I have to watch this season on bluray. So if you haven't seen it give it a chance if you have I don't think the double dip if any will give you any more than this release. Besides it's the show I want not the special features so get it already, and get caught up for October.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app the reason that it explains how much battery life I have in simple easy to understand ways. its a good app it get if you are looking for one like this.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I'm in my early 50's, been fit most of my life, was into mountain biking and weightlifting for years.  I let myself go in my 40's and got into cooking instead.  After ten years, I got sick of being a fat, achy wimp and resolved to do something about it.  Got on a diet, lost some weight, started riding the bike again and thought about getting a health club membership.  Checked out a couple of places, wasn't really impressed.<br /><br />I came across Convict Conditioning while browsing on Amazon one day, thought it looked interesting and downloaded it.  I read the whole thing in an evening and thought the program sounded solid.  There is enough here to be effective, but not so much that you lose focus and go off on tangents.<br /><br />I took the author's advice and started at the beginning with Step One of the \\"New Blood\\" routine (though, for now at least, on a five day cycle rather than the recommended seven days).  If there was one lesson I learned in my years of lifting, it was that slow and easy progess pays off, especially at the start.  Don't overdo it.  Allow time for recuperation.  Once you start dealing with sore joints and tendons, it really takes a lot of the fun away.  I don't really have a set goal, I am just going to see where it leads, and I have no intention of killing myself to show off.  I would like to settle in at a level that gives me a level of fitness I am happy with, without being so rigorous that I dread it. I already feel better after not even two weeks of workouts.  By the time I reach Step Five (hoping for around New Years) I should feel like a new man.<br /><br />I already got my wife and a buddy following the program.  Even though the more advanced steps will kick just about anybody's ass, the initial steps are easy enough for middle aged, sedentary couch potatoes like us, so there is truly something here for everyone.  When I describe it to people my age, they immediately grasp that here is something that is attainable and profitable.By the new year (four months away), I hope to be leading a genuinely changed life.  I am very glad I found this book.<br /><br />***Added 1/3/13<br />I mentioned some New Years goals in my initial review, so I thought I would do and update.  It has been just over four months now that I have been following the  Convict Conditioning program.  I have kept a log of my workouts, starting back on Aug 23 of last year.<br /><br />All I can say is, \\"What a difference!\\"  I am significantly stronger and have added muscle mass even though I have also been dieting also.  I still look forward to my workout every day and have to restrain myself on off days.  I am on a 7-day cycle as recommended in the book.  My current workout consists of:<br />Day 1 - Pushups, 3 sets of 20 (step 5)<br />Day 2 - Squats, 3 sets of 30 (step 5), Calf Raises, 3 sets of 60<br />Day 3 - Off<br />Day 4 - Jackknife Pullups, 3 sets of 10 (step 3)<br />Day 5 - Leg Raises, 3 sets of 20 (step 5)<br />Day 6 & 7 - Off<br />I also take every 8th week off.<br /><br />That is really the bulk of what I do as far as working out.  It only takes minutes per day.  I can do the exercises virtually anywhere and at any time, so even if I am busy, I can squeeze them in.  The improvement in strength, energy, flexibility and endurance has been phenomenal.  All my nagging aches and pains are pretty much a thing of the past.<br /><br />For the coming year, I will add the other two exercises of the book, which work on handstands and spinal flexibility.  Most importantly, as I mentioned in the initial review, I want to keep the program as a whole at a level that I can maintain, both physically and mentally.  I still have just as much enthusiasm as when I started and I would like to keep that up.  Avoiding boredom and injury is crucial in the long term, and I would like to continue this into old age, God willing.
0385523912|4.0|The book is well written and interesting. I knew very little about the life in North Korea so it was a revelation.<br />It is important for more people to read the book and really learn about what is going on there!

B000FC12ZA|4.0|The title is misleading until you read part of the book - it was recommended to me as I would not have chosen it by the title, it sounds like a sci-fi mix. the author Presented the book as a work of fiction, but it is an account of a woman of western culture who get's the chance to go on \\"walkabout\\" with a group of Australian Aborigines. the account is a look into an extremely old culture's spirituality & beliefs as well as way of life. it's obvious that the events are true & published as fiction to protect the Aborigines. I think this book is a Diamond in the Rough.

1932735410|4.0|After deciding to get my PMP certification, I spent time reviewing the Certification process and coming-up with an attack plan. I gave myself a year from start-to-finish (from filling out the application to passing the test). I started in August of 2011.<br /><br />The process to get to the point of scheduling my exam took more energy than I had thought it would. Documenting my Projects, completing the Application, taking/documenting my Professional hours and becoming a local chapter PMP member seemed a bit grueling---but that is what was needed, so I did it.  At the end of December of 2011, my PMP Application was formally accepted and I was now in a position to schedule my Test. Phew! I had until December of 2012 to pass the Test (within 3 try's).<br /><br />I gave myself 8 weeks to study for the PMP---and scheduled the test for April 2012---which would give me some breathing room around the Holidays. But then work/life got in the way and it was March before I knew it and I had yet to open a book! I rescheduled for June---and then rescheduled for August.  I remade the committement to finishing (I only had until December to pass) and blocked off July and August as Study months.<br /><br />But what/how to Study? Before scheduling my Test (the first time), I read lots of reviews/searched many sites and finally settled on Rita Mulcahy's Prep Book/FastTrack Testbank. My plan was to complete Rita's book, read the PMBOK and then take 3 simulated Tests (Full, 4 hour long, 200 questions) using the FastTrack Software. I decided that I was going to spend at least 1-2 hours a night and every weekend studying. Additionally, if it was harder than I anticipated, I would take off Mondays over the 2 months and use those as extra study days.<br /><br />What actually happened was that it was harder than I thought it was going to be to study, grasp and memorize all of the information. (Which surprised me because I have a graduate degree and have been a Project Manager on multi-million dollar Projects for a fortune 500 company for 5 years. Go figure!) After the first week I kicked-in my backup Monday's and truly cleared my calendar for the full 2 months as much as possible---declining social events was a pain, but getting time from work was difficult with my current Project, but I had too or I knew I wouldn't pass.<br /><br />2 weeks into my Studying of Rita's book, I knew I had to do something different---the book format and amount of information was overwhelming me.  I went back to the web for more research to find another Approach and/or Study Materials.<br /><br />My first thought was to just bite-the-bullet and take a Prep Course (my company paid for all of my cost up to this point, but I knew they wouldn't pay for a Prep Course.) I found several  3-5 day, Instructor lead Prep Courses offered within 4 hours of me. I debated taking a weeks vacation and immersing myself in the material for a week. A quick calculation put the cost at about $2,500 when I factored in course & hotel---commuting wasn't an option because the courses were from 8am to 6 pm with some forms of homework. Setting aside the cost (which is no small amount) I had family and work committements that would suffer (and mentally distract me) if I went this route. I decided this wasn't the plan for me. I would choose a self-study course and if I didn't pass the first time I would re-evaluate a formal Prep course.<br /><br />After ruling out the formal prep course (at least for the first round of Testing), I focused on finding other study materials that might work better for me. (I was still at somewhat of a loss because I am typically a self guided, book/manual focused learner.) I decided I would get the 2nd option from my previous materials review--Andy Crowe's PMP Package (Book, Flash Cards, CD's and some Web Based Study Materials). I'm was well into week 3 when the study materials arrived. I opened the book and---Deja Vu. A bit easier for me to read/understand compared to Rita's but maybe it was just because I had already studied that material in Rita's book? Now what? I looked over the other material in Crowe's Package and found a 6 month on-line Access Key to their web site \\"Intuit\\"---can't hurt to try it...<br /><br />And there was the answer for me! On Andy Crowe's web site (\\"Intuit\\") there was an entire Self Guided, Video based presentation that mirrored/supplemented his book AND offered an on-line Test Bank. The entire presentation was long---50+ hours, I think, but it covered every facet of the PMBOK and was broken into manageable sections. Additionally, the material was presented in a very interesting/engaging format (well, as interesting as this material can be). I completed each section, read the book and then took the 20 question test from the book for each chapter. I was starting to feel like I could really do this!<br /><br />By the end of week 5 I had completed the on-line course and had read Crowe's book. I had also listened to the CD's---not very deep, but good context setting. I tried the flash cards but not much value to me.<br /><br />At this point, I had 3 weeks until my Test. I decided I was going to take three, 200 question/4 hour practice tests from the Intuit site----one every Monday. I would take the test (using the full 4 hours) and then review each answer---which was a great feature of the test bank in that it explained the right answer/told you why the other answers weren't correct. Unfortunately, to review all the questions/answers took my another 2-3 hours. A full day committement. Two weeks later, I had scored a 75% and then an 82%. Sweet! I'm feeling really good (dare I jinx myself and say Prepared?)<br /><br />On my last 'Study Monday', I decided to use Rita's FastTrack test bank---still taking the full test/studying the answers. Ugh: a 65% on the test! What the %^%}?!? The questions seemed a lot harder than Crowe's. Time to Panic! My test was Friday of that week (yesterday actually). I was worried that I didn't have much buffer between passing (61%) and my Studying. Now what? I decided to take off an extra day from work and take one last test from Rita's FastTrack, review the answers and then close the books. On Thursday I got a 74%. Closer. More buffer, but still not a lot of 'wiggle room'---especially If I'm stressed or the real test is harder....at this point, time was up and after a good nights sleep (sleeping pills did the trick!), I was off to my 9:00am PMP exam. (After doing a 'dry run' to find the location earlier in the week.)<br /><br />I arrived an hour early (just in case!), and did a last minute review of the 42 processes and the dozen formulas.  After checking in (I was assigned a locker/given a key, ID checked, an inspection of my pockets and a quick metal detector sweep), I sat in front of a monitor that had my Name/Test ready for me (my test site apparently offers all kinds of other test---there were two people taking CPA exams and someone taking an electrical test that I spoke too.) I started the tutorial and quickly made my way through it because I had read that I could use the 'extra' time to write down the information I wanted to make sure I didn't forget (or misremember) during the stress of testing. I'm glad I did! I was more nervous than I thought I would be and I had a hard time jotting it all down. [The tutorial was 15 minutes---it took my 5 minutes to get through it and then I took 10 minutes to write down the 42 processes (in Knowledge/Process grid) as well as all of the EV formulas.]<br /><br />The test was hard, no doubt about it: But I passed! Let me say that again: I'm officially a PMP!<br /><br />As for the Test: The first 3 questions I didn't know the answer---but I at least I knew the concepts. I forced myself to mark an answer and move on. The level of questions were more similar to Rita than Crowe's. Drat. That meant I had 'less buffer' if I believed my Prep test results. I focused on my Test Taking Strategy (answer every question, complete all questions in 3 hours--or less, take a 10 minute break and then review as many questions as possible). During my Prep Tests, I had run into the situation several times where I was feeling good about the testing but then I would come across a whole group of questions that I was unsure of the answers. As I chugged through the test I was feeling good---at least about getting enough questions right that I was passing, but I kept waiting for that group of question that would throw me off. I'm happy to say, I didn't run across that group during the test! In retrospect, there were about 5 questions where I didn't know the concepts---let alone the answer. I made educated guesses on those questions. The rest of the questions were very reflective of the testing questions from both Rita & Crowe---but I give Rita more credit on accuracy of Test questions. It took me longer to get through the actual test than it had during my Prep test. I could make it through all 200 questions in about 2 hours during my prior testing---it took a full three hours on the actual test.<br /><br />Bottom line: I spent a lot more time persuing my PMP than I first estimated I would need---in both completing the Application and Studying for the Exam. As for Study Materials: (1) Studying on Crowe's web site tutorial is my number one recommendation---again, for my learning style (2) Both books (Rita & Crowe's) were about equal for what they offered me in way of breaking down the PMBOK (3) Rita's FastTrack Test bank was more indicative of the level/style of questions.  ***Good Luck***didn't have much buffer between passing (61%) and my Studying. Now what? I decided to take off an extra day from work and take one last test from Rita's FastTrack, review the answers and then close the books. On Thursday I got a 74%. Closer.

As I chugged through the test I was feeling good---at least about getting enough questions right that I was passing, but I kept waiting for that group of question that would throw me off. I'm happy to say, I didn't run across that group during the test! In retrospect, there were about 5 questions where I didn't know the concepts---let alone the answer. I made educated guesses on those questions. The rest of the questions were very reflective of the testing questions from both Rita & Crowe---but I give Rita more credit on accuracy of Test questions. It took me longer to get through the actual test than it had during my Prep test. I could make it through all 200 questions in about 2 hours during my prior testing---it took a full three hours on the actual test.<br /><br />Bottom line: I spent a lot more time persuing my PMP than I first estimated I would need---in both completing the Application and Studying for the Exam. As for Study Materials: (1) Studying on Crowe's web site tutorial is my number one recommendation---again, for my learning style (2) Both books (Rita & Crowe's) were about equal for what they offered me in way of breaking down the PMBOK (3) Rita's FastTrack Test bank was more indicative of the level/style of questions.  ***Good Luck***
0446614459|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the team of King and Maxwell. I unfortunately read this book (1st in the series) last.  But it was a great and easy read.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate for you to go pick up a copy and read it.  It is a classic page turning, political thriller.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|doesn't work on kindle fire, despite what other revises said.<br /><br />I'm asking for money back.  the digital clock doesn't display ccorrectly.
B007RXRSEY|4.0|A very good hard rock record, Myles and Slash make a great combination.  One of the better rock albums I've heard in a while.  Some of my favorites are Anastasia, One last Thrill, title track, Standing in the Sun, and You're a Lie!!!  Liked it so much, I'm going to see them live.  Rock on Slash!!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Couldn't believe that a 900+ page book would captivate me from beginning to end.  So much knowledge about India and it's culture.  Also discovered I did not want to spend time in prison.
B00008J2DQ|2.0|ok, that´s enough...when you think Godsmack will mature their sound and become something almost original, they did it again....like other reviews said, FACELESS!??!? what about FACELIFT, from ALICE IN CHAINS where even the front cover is incredibly similar, with a distorted face....man, even godsmack´s logo is a clone of ALICE IN CHAIN´s logo with a sun!!!!! and the singer tries really really hard to sound like Layne!!!!! all the stuff together is embarassing, because this is not a AIC cover band....the songs are really heavy and i like some like I STAND ALONE, but all the songs are very similar and the whole album is a long ride...if you never listened to ALICE IN CHAINS, you may actually like godsmack, but the incredible rip off goes on....
B008XG1X18|5.0|awesome!  love it awesome ideas for everything form decor to food and everything in between!  recepies that are quick and easy and the kids love!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is highly over-rated. Frankly, it is horrible. The writing is redundant, images are terrible, boring, boring, boring.....Find yourself something better to do. This is probably the worst book I've ever tried to read. The author doesn't know how to develop character or plot.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Es la primera vez que leo a este autor, y la verdad es que me ha dejado m&aacute;s que satisfecha, y el precio del libro realmente vale cada c&eacute;ntimo, un gran libro!!!!, En resumen es una historia que te  mantiene intrigado todo el tiempo hasta llegar a un desenlace inesperado.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Absolutely love Spider!! will share with family and friends. This game is addictive and is a great stress reliever. Really makes you think.
0140569324|5.0|I heard so much about this book but wasnt until I got my hands on it that I realized how encapturing it is . My son absolutely loves it . Keeps the childs interest and excitment from beginning to end .A  must have
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I am very satisfied if I'm on the go I know when to plug in into my ac adapter and how long I will have to charge it . overall I am very pleased with the app I would definitely recommend this app.
B007SGM084|4.0|Before I bought this book, I asked some co workers what they thought and I got mixed reviews.  I also read the reviews attached and got the same thing.....either the reader loved the book or they hated it.  I enjoyed reading this trilogy, even though it seems like a far fetched love story.  For me, I wish the author went more in depth with both main characters,especially Christian, exposing them a little more. My one issue is that the sex almost seemed to take over the books at one point,  I found myself skipping through those chapters to get to the actual meat of the book.<br /><br />When reading this book, keep and open mind and read for the enjoyment, not the expectation.
0452287022|5.0|\\"It's a rare book that wins the battle against drooping eyelids,\\" (Tracy Chevalier). History, the beauty of art, and imagination all come together to keep the reader awake in Tracy Chevalier's novel, Girl with a Pearl Earring, as she opens the gates to a new perspective of a very famous painting.  Griet, \\"the wide-eyed maid\\" and protagonist, gives a voice to the girl in the portrait so many people admire.  After an unexpected accident with her father, she is forced to work as a maid for the very difficult Vermeer family.  Not only does she come to struggle with the new family and house, but she also toils with her feelings for Vermeer and the maid life.  Her beauty, brains, and outstanding artistic perspective set her apart from most other girls her age in Delft and cast her in an alluring light to Vermeer, the painter. Vermeer also draws Griet into his life in a painting and the only way they can express their love is through the world of art.  Love, loss, grief, debt, betrayal, lies, and friendship all come together in this one novel to tell the story of Griet and Vermeer's forbidden relationship during the 1660s in Delft, Holland.  Chevalier successfully manages to combine not only history and fiction, but also simplicity and detail, bringing the 1660s Delft life of the Girl with a Pearl Earring and Vermeer to the present day reader.<br />In case some do not know much about the painting of the Girl with a Pearl Earring by Vermeer, like I did, it is one of his most renowned paintings of his life and is famously known in art and history.  Sometimes referred to as \\"the Dutch Mona Lisa\\", the painting now sits in the Mauritshuis Gallery located in The Hague.  The story behind the painting, like the date or who the work was for, are uncertain. After I read the novel, because I was so interested in learning more, I tried to research the facts behind the painting and Vermeer.  However, there was little luck and the real history remains mostly a mystery.<br /> Since thereare no accurate references to rely on, Chavelier produced a fictional version of the historical moment when the painting was made.  With the novel's help, the painting now has a story so many people can admire and relish.  If you like Girl with a Pearl Earring, Falling Angels and The Virgin Blue are two other books by Chavelier.  Also, if you enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory, the Girl with a Pearl Earring is similar in style and is a historical fiction novel.<br /> I am a seventeen year old high school senior.  As an option of a novel for summer reading, I chose the Girl with a Pearl Earring.  I thoroughly enjoyed the novel from start to finish.  Though it is not a thriller, the forbidden quality of the novel lures the reader to curiosity.  The language also provides vivid images that allow me to truly feel that I am in the situation.  Chavelier also provides exquisite detail and creativity to a time where little history has been recorded.  Characters render personalities and characteristics that make it easy to depict with clarity.  Even though it is short time period, the journey is worth the read, just as the journey of the story that lead to the painting is just as important as the actual painting itself.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This is one of the best movie Ived seen I would suggest this DVD to every Robert Di Nero and Jeremy Iron fans...
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|I really love this movie,  a lot of action and the actors are great.I was very happy with the movie, I think other people should buy it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I think it is a fun app and I like how you can get the big puzzles so that it takes longer. the only downsides are you have to pay for more puzzles if you want more and if you go out of the app you lose your progress. but all and all a fun app
B008XG1X18|4.0|love pinterest, love this app. unfortunately, it does not load more often than it does. fix this and I will be one happy lady!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its great and it gets you going also great for kids you should listen to my review and get this game
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Overall it's an ok app. All I really use it for is to check how much percentage of battery I have left on my kindle. Nothing bad about it but it's not very exciting. I wish there were more ways to customize the batter; that's the only improvement I can suggest. Otherthan that, just a pretty basic app.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Fantastic app I love how it tells you how low your battery is.  Looks great on the shelf. Just super.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book is awesome! I would rrecommend this book to all my friends of course beginning with the first of the trilogy!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this app is one of the best apps ive played on the kindle. keep it up team lava with great updates and games
B008XG1X18|5.0|can finally spread the addiction from the desktop to my kindle fire! soo convenient. I love this app. it can do it allll.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This is a must for walking dead fans. Yes its unforunate that anchor bay will release the special edition in a few months, but the zombie head designed by todd mcfarlane is worth it.  Plus you save like 35.00$. The deleated scenes that are on the discs are kewl, and i love the extra features. Buy this if your a fan of the show.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I ordered this almost 3 weeks ago. I just got an email from Amazon stating that the shipping would be delayed by another 3 weeks. I find this completely unacceptable. This is an Amazon product made for the Amazon Kindle.  Wouldn't it kind of be a no brainer for Amazon to have PLENTY of these on hand considering the Kindle is THEIR brand of tablet? I just got this Kindle in January and had not used it until now. I gave up my IPAD for a college student in the family. The cord that came with it is DEAD.
0345803493|5.0|This books are part of a trilogy that I found to be well written. If I would have known the story lines of these  books in advance I would not have never purchased them. Much to my surprise when I finished one I could not wait to start the next. I enjoyed each of these books and have recomended them to my friends and co-workers.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Honestly, everything in this book was amazing. I love the switching between the characters' POV and I love the humor. It's less cheesy as it was with first PJ book, as if Percy's growing up affects the humor in the books.<br />Anyways, if you haven't read it, please do.  There are libraries and stuff, if you don't feel like cashing out for this book. Though I must say it's worth it!!!
B008MEM24S|4.0|I have the free version of this, paid Where's My Water? Fun. I really just wanted to be the 1000th reviewer.
B005JFWKKY|5.0|This hard sheild appears to be a very robust unit.  I have not done a scratch test on it, but being polycarbonate, I tend to believe it will provide reasonable protection.  I first discovered this on a YouTube review, and ordered it on that recommendation.  It does go on easily and clear, with no bubbles if the directions are followed.  Overall I would recommend this product.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Works well! The estimates for continuous music and movies seem to be vastly overstated though. It is neat to see your power consumption on the graph tool.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|very addicting. simple but notso simple.  great to pass the time.  I would recommend this to fast thinkers--especially the timed play
B007SYWFRM|5.0|we play every night before bed.. we try to see who can get to the next level first. the graphics are amazing.  and the game is fast paste
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I so much wanted to love this movie but I hated it.Read the book or watch the BBC miniseries and you'll understand that you can't cram this much nuance into such a tiny package.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I enjoyed watching this film and was excited that it followed the book so well. It made some of the scenes from the book really pop - but made the whole idea of kids killing kids even more real and disturbing. I liked the way they showed a bit more about the reactions of the people to the games, how outraged the families were with deaths, etc. [[ASIN:B0093HDV20 inDIVISIBLE]]
B000005KQT|5.0|LITTLE WALTER-HIS BEST: The blues has produced many impressive harp men...JUNIOR WELLS, JAMES COTTON, and CHARLIE MUSSELWHITE among them...but the undisputed king daddy of all harmonica howlers was LITTLE WALTER. Marion Walter Jacobs sowed his oats as a featured player in MUDDY WATERS' first and greatest band before moving on to solo pay dirt via the rollicking instrumental JUKE and RNB chart topper MY BABE, which featured WALTER's swaggering, street smart vocals. The first performer to successfully amplify the device, he blew like a freight train, coaxing out scratchy, squawling, spleen-splittin' sounds no one has fully mastered since. BOOM, BOOM, OUT GOES THE LIGHT may be familiar to modern music fans via hard rocker PAT TRAVERS' unsubtle cover, but WALTER's heavy influence on modern music also extends to every harp hot shot from the J. GEILS BAND's MAGIC DICK to JOHN POPPER of BLUES TRAVELER. LITTLE WALTER may not have the immediate name recognition of his CHESS RECORDS label mates MUDDY WATERS, CHUCK BERRY or ETTA JAMES, but HIS BEST is an unparalleled, ear-opening sampler of his most sought after Chicago roadhouse repertoire.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE DEEP BREATHS
0385737955|4.0|The opening of this novel caught my attention completely and drew me in. Throughout the book questions arose about how the kids got there, who they were before, what would happen when the solved the maze ... I had a difficult time seeing some of the mechanical objects in the maze as realistic, but enjoyed the book and look forward to reading the rest! [[ASIN:B0093HDV20 inDIVISIBLE]]
B0052UYJDC|4.0|Organized, concise, in small digestible pieces. A perfect book for simplifying and downsizing with a nice personal touch. A quick read but with helpful and specific suggestions.
0439023521|4.0|[[ASIN:B0093HDV20 inDIVISIBLE]]Very interesting book and a good read. I enjoyed the characters but had a few issues with some of the responses or actions of them ... Can't wait to read the others in this series!
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|They did a wonderful job turning this wonderful book into a movie for both adults and children.  Remember this for your Christmas lists. . it is a must see for all!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I like this item because it helps me remember things I need. It works well, and I really like it!
B005LAIGN2|2.0|One star for special effects. One star for Terrence Howard and a good supporting cast of Americans of African descent. Watching Gooding was painful. He used to be a fine actor. Also, they should have hired a script writer. Most of the lines were trite, especially those of the white pilots. Great subject matter turned into a comic book, replete with obvious plot devices.
B003C1QIO6|4.0|Really good album that I enjoyed. Johnson has a certain sound, but he goes a bit more electric on a few songs with this album. All in all, it's worth the purchase.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I'm not Christian and participate in another religion. Nor do I have children. Nevertheless, the messages here of fellowship overcoming adversity, and fathers taking their responsibilities seriously represent values that any reasoning, caring person can support. The addition of some well-written, well-timed comedy added spice to an otherwise excellent movie. Some of the actors may not be Hollywood quality, but their efforts were all the more genuine and endearing because of that fact. The police scenes were realistic, as were the sometimes less-than-perfect manner in which characters dealt with challenges. The Kendrick brothers hit another grand slam on this one. Faith-based movies like this offer inspiration and spiritual food for all. Highly recommended.
B005WYFLNU|3.0|I was looking for something like the Color Forms that were available when my kids were little.  These were close.  But the pages are large which made them awkward for taking them with us when the kids needed to be quietly entertained.  I liked the fact that there were multiple backgrounds.  But it did seem strange that the gloves were all made for the left hand.  No right-handed gloves were found.  The individual items are reusable multiple times and that was good.  But getting them off the background meant bending the background.  While an adult could do it without bending the background, the kids found that challenging.  We used these with children aged 2, 3, and 5.  The 5-year-old twins found it most entertaining.  The 3 year old was mildly entertained.  And the 2 year old stuck with it for only a few minutes.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Very good adaptation true to the spirit of Burroughs' story. I read the entire series as a young adult. The idea of traveling to Mars and finding a vibrant warrior culture was appealing. This production shows the same wonder and appeal, and presents a viable Martian environment and society. Good plot, with the right mix of action, humor, and conflict. Highly recommended.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I love love love this game. I vent with this<br />My kid son loves this game as well!!!!!!!!  soo fun!
B008BM9L72|5.0|I was drawn in immediately. I was aware of the \\"Mummy Porn\\" label but found myself wanting to know more about Christian and Ana.<br />I had to make force myself to stop reading...too many midnight reads is not good with 2 small children the next morning!<br />Loved it and found I wanted more once I finished \\"Freed\\"!
0143116738|5.0|I was always considered a 'weak' student during my grade school days, since I didn't excel in subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry and so on. I had to take these subjects given the UK educational standards we followed in Sri Lanka.<br />I am now a professor at a university, and it is all because I found my own 'element'. I connect with many of the stories that this amazing author has to share with us, and has put into perspective. I highly recommend this book for all my colleagues, students, family and friends.
B0048FQ0HU|5.0|This audio tape was life changing for me, I learned about the benefits of love, before this I had used the word love so many times and thought I knew what it was but I had no idea.  While listening to these cd's I felt some intense feelings of love, gratitude and inspiration, more than in my entire life before, I learned to think of what I love all the time ( or as much as I can) and now when I'm feeling low I think of the things I love, I name them one after the other and I don't care if there's really a \\"power\\" from doing it because it makes me feel good and that is good enough for me, anything beyond that would be a welcome bonus.  I would recommend this cd because it taught me how to instantly change my mood, to spend more time thinking about what I love and want and not what I don't love and don't want and so much more.
0765365278|5.0|Thank you for taking the time to read my review.  First off, I stumbled across Mr. Sanderson's work way back when Elantris came out.  I read that almost non-stop.  It was delightful, entertaining, and well played out.  I researched Mr. S (if you will) on the internet and came across his cutting comments about the all-father of the modern adult fantasy genre, mr. tolkien....<br /><br />Mr. S, after reading this book, I forgive you.  May your pen never run dry and your fingers ever retain the strength to hold it.<br /><br />I eagerly await the next installment of this series.
0345803485|4.0|I never read a book like this. Thanks to my best friend for making me read it!  Seemed unrealistic but it is fiction!
B008KEQMDC|1.0|this movie is really bad, extremely boring.<br /><br />A few funny parts, not that many though.  Some crude language too.<br /><br />I would save yourself the time, skip this movie.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|itotally worth the download. the game is simple, hectic, funny, and super fun. very satisfying upgrades and things like that.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|If you have not watched the Series, WATCH IT. It's amazing. Its like Gladiator (Russell Crowe) mixed with 300. Its Gory, Sexy, Profane and just down right crazy story. I love this series. It came on time with no issues what so ever.
B006J420UE|5.0|This processor is really fast and it runs just about any game on high quality without lag this is one of the best processors ive ever bought
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Zombie fans, I can't tell you how much you need this to be a part of your collection. AMC really out did themselves with this hit series. I have watched every episode glued on for that sole hour. It is mind blowing, gut wrenching, and nerve wracking. Zombies are so life like it makes you wonder (Do you have what it takes to survive a Zombie Apocalypse?)
034580404X|1.0|This would have been viewed as so much porn back before a second opening of Pandora's box which released not the evils but all potential sleaze into the world, that is the First World of homo consumerus. Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey form a perfect pair through which to view the gross corruption of our times in the lives of an investor executive and an aspiring entrant to the yuppie sector of society. They also share a love of flirting, constant contact via the silly e-mails of people now, blurbettes of contact, superficial and also flirtaceous. The ridiculous female often refers to her \\"inner goddess\\" in reference to the enormous vacuum that occupies the insides of her cardiac and cranial cavities. The ending, which arrives suddenly (I only read book 1) puts an end to what was an experience of cheap and tawdry writing and people. If there is any merit to it, it lies in describing the flaws and failings of many individuals who have emerged in our globalized times, people who are an enormous blot on the landscape wherever they may be found.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Everything about this show is sheer perfection. The amount of love the creators put into it combined with the magnificent work done by the rest of the cast and crew makes for a lovely experience. The cinematography and musical score are especially breathtaking (especially in A Scandal in Belgravia).<br />Also the packaging for the actual DVDs was in top shape.
B00913DPW2|1.0|I want to get this game but it would NOT install on my Fire.  What's goin on?!!!! /:-((((  I've tried and tried but just wouldn't that it's upsetting!!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I rarely write reviews but felt compelled after my daughter told me to read this magnifent work.  I was hooked from the first few pages and had trouble putting it down to go to work.  Im getting on facebook now to tell all my friends to start reading Wool Omnibu.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I love you Don Draper!  You are gorgeous, charismatic, suave and debonair!  Yet so flawed. I have faith in you !
B00787IR2Q|4.0|I like this when I saw it a a younger person and my kids loved it.  I wish Amazon could stop the ISP from throttling back the connections when the movie is playing.  I am considering a Mac Mini as the new player over the Roku because I could then download the movie and watch it rather than stream. Most of the time it is OK but we do not choose HD movies in part because of cost and in part because the ISP will slow the connection down so we can't view in HD anyway (Cox Communications)
030758836X|2.0|I'm giving it 2 stars because the first half is good. I really like the format and the story. Half way through it is like the author came to a fork in the road. She could have chosen one way, added some twists and suspense and it would have been a good book...maybe great. Instead she went on the other path and tried to have a big OMG moment for the readers..it was like that at first but the rest of the story was so far fetched and ridiculous (I won't give anything away but it is preposterous that most of that would have happened...more holes in the story than a block of Swiss cheese). Not a book I would recommend to anybody.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Maybe I'm too new to this but I'm finding it rather difficult to transfer info &amp; picts from one page to another.<br />Everything else seems great as far as I've seen.
0446572993|3.0|After finishing The Innocent I went back and read many of the helpful reviews and found that \\"implausible\\" was a common word used. For me, a really good work of fiction (book or movie) is one where I'm entertained and can enjoy the story without frequently questioning the plausibility of a character or plot twist. In this book there were too many of both. I found the ending to be too much of a stretch of the imagination and too often the dialogue involving the 14 year old girl (like when she comments on Wall Street and algorithms) seemed ..... implausible.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I got this app to download, but it wasn't compatable with my Android Impression. Had to uninstall it! It might work for other people, but I had a bad experience with it.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|It's a lot of fun to watch and producers, director and actors went all the way out. CGI effects were incredibly good. The fact that war veterans were casted made the movie something not only very patriotic but also unforgettable. The scenes filmed on the Missouri were awesome and the veterans stole the action.<br /><br />I wish the producers had taken things seriously, forgetting the stupid pranks and touches of goofy humor. Otherwise, it's an excellent movie. And the blonde is intelligent and knows how to act and is real eye candy.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to \\"Battleship 2...\\"
B008IJTFYW|5.0|the best relaxation app ever. I love the way you can combine the different sounds and adjust the volume for each.
B003JTHESA|3.0|This album it is not a five stars! Giving five stars to this album, it is the same as saying it is as good as \\"The Number of the Beast\\", \\"Piece of Mind\\",  or \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" and obviously it is not!<br /><br />All these \\"listen to it more times-speeches like chorus\\" are nothing less than lacking of courage to admit this is a weak work..  Artists have always known that people are incapable of refuting something done by their beloved group, so keep you all buying crap, while they count their money. rsrs.<br /><br />So why people have given five stars? The reason is well known, fans are unable of recognizing that a work done by their beloved group is not good. So all these five stars reviews were written by new fans. They don't know how to discern between a good or a more or less work.<br /><br />The problem with the majority of both heavy Metal and hard rock bands is, they  feel a strange need of turning themselves into progressive rock groups, maybe because of a strange kind of inferiority complex, near the end of their carreers, like has been happening with Rush for example, and so, they have lost their own identity as Heavy Metal bands they really are.<br /><br />I don't have words to say how good luisdanifilth's review is,  I am a musician, I know music technicaly,  I understand exactly what you mean, very good review indeed. The Iron members should read your review before doing another album.<br /><br />The last great album is without any doubt \\"Dance with death\\", that is the best after Bruce's return, a truly excellent album. The Final Frontier is both wasting of effort and time.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer here that wrote we'd like TO SEE Iron composing 4/5 minutes of true heavy metal songs again, instead of trying to be a progressive rock band.<br /><br />Being an Iron fan since the beginning I've felt very disappointed with the way Iron has decided to adopt. We all miss albuns like \\"Piece of Mind\\", and \\"The Number of The Beast\\". After listening  The Final Frontier, I put the first album on my turntable, and after listening the amazing song \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" I thought to myself,  we'll never listen to something so good again. The Final Frontier it is a  3.5 stars without any doubt!
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|\\"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\\" is a wonderful documentary about the true effort behind and meaning of success. It's not the money or the fame but in the doing and doing well. In it's quiet and straight forward way it's like a prayer.

B007DIQC90|5.0|A great album from a group of real musicians and singers.<br />Wonderful songs full of rock/pop/folksy goodness.<br />Lyrics in clunky slightly awkward English (in a charming Abba-esque way).<br />Watch their Lollapalooza performance on youtube and you'll understand why there's a buzz about this band.<br />(The drummer is their secret weapon I think).

B006ZZANDI|5.0|I searched through multiple stores for this deluxe edition of the cd and finally decided to just order it online. Every song on this alum is great and each one could be a hit single. The 2 extra songs on this edition are 2 of the best and it is so worth buying this version just for those songs. If you aren't a fan before you hear the songs on this album, I guarantee you will be a fan after!

0374275637|5.0|Kahneman does a great job of describing the evidence for various ways of thinking, and how natural human tendencies can lead to systematic and severe errors. It's not feasible to go through life doing an exhaustive analysis of every decision, but after reading this book, I'm prepared to better understand what my intuition is telling me, and I know when my intuition is likely to lead me astray.<br /><br />I would recommend this book as essential reading for anyone who makes high-stakes decisions under uncertainty, like \\"Which car will I most enjoy?\\" or \\"What investments should the CDC make to ensure public health?\\" Some of the examples are disarming because of how vehemently people act in self-contradictory ways, or make decisions based on irrelevant factors, such as the way a question is phrased.<br /><br />This book also addresses how people's intuitive understanding of statistics is frequently astray, and how it can cause people to make bad decisions.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a must for all dog lovers. You do need to prepare before watching this movie though. Have a box of tissue next to you. This is a perfect movie to watch if you feel the need to cleanse your eyes. It proves, as all dog people have known all along, that the love from your dog knows no limits. They are yours forever. I have loaned this movie to family and friends...they bought their own copy  :)
B005LAIHY0|4.0|When I saw this movie for the first time, I left feeling unsure what to think of it. There were undeniably awesome aspects; this is the movie that 3D was made for. Visually, it's flawless. There were also some awful aspects. The less prominent characters were mostly place-fillers. It always bothers me when I only know characters by labels such as biology guy, geology guy, navigator guys, etc., especially when they have pivotal roles. Even worse for me, many of the characters' actions are simply inexplicable in their context. Taking your helmet off on an alien planet? Playing gitchee-gitchee-goo with an alien life form? The science was questionable in many places as well. If the Navigators are \\"100%\\" genetically identical to us, why would we be so different physically? Yeah, dramatic license, yada, yada, but really, talk about some idiot moves...<br /><br />That said, Prometheus stimulated so many conversations with friends that I went to see it again. I was shocked to find that I loved it the second time around. I think that the difference was knowing about the WTF stupid actions of so many of the characters (I'm not talking about Elizabeth and David here) as well as the bad science, which were taking me out of the movie at first viewing. I docked the movie a star because I shouldn't need to ignore so many things, but I think this will eventually be considered a flawed classic. You may recall that Blade Runner was a major flop when it was released. The critics shredded it, but now? A flawed classic.<br /><br />I think that Prometheus gets uniformly bad reviews from viewers who were hoping for an Alien prequel. In that sense it would be a disappointment. However, taken on its own, it works for me. It's a worthy view if only for Michael Fassbender's incredible performance. David sticks in the mind long after the other characters fade.

0812993292|5.0|I picked this book up after reading a review and read it in two sittings.  The incredible amount of faith that Harold had in his mission, and as time went on, the faith that his wife had in him was inspiring.  It reminds us that some of the things people do don't always make sense to us, but they make sense to them and we should support that. I am, of course, not  talking of acts of violence or hate, but acts of love, of passion, of determination to reach a goal, to make a difference in someone's life.  It also showed that you don't need to broadcast what you're doing...just do it.  It is enough to know that you are doing it.  I really liked this book.  It made me think and wonder, would I do the same thing....and why wouldn't I? To have faith, as well as give.  That was the story of this book.

B002VBV1S6|4.0|Locke Lamora is an orphan, raised in a gang of thieves and given over to a priest/con-man who teaches him and a small group of chosen young children to be trained as one of a group of Gentlemen Bastards. This is fantasy, of course, with an alternate world in which we vaguely recognise elements from varying different times and places. Lamora and his cohorts are a likeable bunch, with good qualities alongside their love of stealing and violence. The book is slightly long winded in places, with long flashbacks which do not always add much to the plot. Also, although the priest has set his group of young thieves on a path to concoct elaborate plots and amass great wealth, they do not seem to use the money for much. As a group, they seem slightly stuck in a vacuum, working for more and more money, but not really getting much from it apart from the joy of the chase.<br /><br />The plot of the book is long and involved, with many different characters either posing as other people, seeking vengeance and being involved in various plots and side stories. Lamora basically has many people after his life and has to try to dodge through various dangers, while attempting to keep his group together and in one piece. There are magical elements, extreme violence, a great deal of intrigue, action and edge of the seat excitement, as the author expertly weaves a complicated plot together. Although this is a great action adventure story, I did think the characters were slightly weak in places - we know where Locke Lamora comes from for example, but little of what he feels about it. However, this is apparently a series of books and the author may address deeper character detail in future books. If you like a lot of action and fast paced writing, with dark fantasy and a touch of crime, this is the book for you.

0316017930|5.0|My high school class was assigned to read Outliers for our summer reading program. At first I was dreading reading the book because I have not read much non-fiction. However, the book pleasantly surprised me. By the end of the first chapter I could not put it down. Outliers is a great choice for anyone who wants a fascinating book to read.<br /><br />Outliers is a novel that explores how certain people in our society become so successful. The book itself is split up into two parts. The first focuses on opportunity and the second on legacy.<br /><br />In the beginning of the novel, Gladwell clearly states his intentions for the book as follows, \\"In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal explanations of success don't work. People don't rise from nothing.\\" Gladwell, in Outliers, evaluates how some people become successful. Gladwell proposes that it is both our opportunities and legacies that help us to become who we are. Gladwell conveys, \\"The culture we belong to and legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine.\\" Through these cultural and legacy experiences, Gladwell explains the impact they have on us.<br /><br />In this fascinating book Gladwell takes you on a journey with some of the most successful people in the world. Through countless interviews and studies, Outliers explains how and why some people are successful and others who seem to have so much potential do not succeed.<br /><br />It can be rare to find a truly interesting and thought provoking non-fiction book. Outliers is a true outlier from you average every day book. For this reason, I would give this book five stars. Once you start reading, you will not be able to put the book down.

SO, I thought I d give it a go.At first it amused me, then, it started to get ridiculous, then boring, then I threw it out. I have never done this with any book, ever. This writing is garbage and the plot is weak and I cant believe the nerve of this woman to get this published as a bestseller!<br />Yes, hormone driven teens will devour it and also possibly men who like or fantasize about S&M, but the rest of us wanna puke from the bad writing and a lack of imagination.<br />This book deserves to be in everyones garbage..lol!!!

034580404X|1.0|I really thought this must be great due to all the buzz about it. I literally didn't make it through the first book - and I bought the trilogy expecting a great read. What a waste of money! I couldn't identify with the characters at all. The girl was beyond naive for her age which I think is totally out of touch for the 21st century. Make that the last 50 years! If I heard about Christian's grey eyes one more time I probably would have hurled the book at the wall. Ha, I literally fell asleep reading \\"the contract.\\" I thought that section would never end. I literally laughed out loud at some of the terminology!<br /><br />Then I read the comments on one of the reviews here about this being some sort of online fan fiction that I could have read for free (not that I'd want to) -  the words were literally the same - just the names changed and a few minor details. I've read some great erotic fiction in my day, but this piece of trash is definitely not one of them. Still surprised that it was number one on the bestseller list for so long. I'm sure this says something about the state of people's choice of reading material these days; not sure what, but there are so many truly good books out there to read, even cherish and re-read. No doubt a movie is in the works. With sequels. Sigh.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't recommend this book (or books) to anyone. Think I'll sell it back to Amazon and get a few bucks. Also, a lesson learned, buy the first book of any series and decide from that if you want to continue to read. There wasn't really a price break anyway for buying the trilogy.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another fabulous book to follow up Duma Key.  I am seldom disappointed with King and these past few have been wonderful and all consuming!
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I am kind of glad my library had this as an ebook, because it was not nearly as fascinating as Matched. The inner monologues of Cassia and Ky took up about half of the book. When I was mid-way, I could not take it any more and started flipping through pages. I do like the author's style, but the constant  back and forth of their insecurities was just too much.<br />I also agree with a fellow reviewer that the simple naming conventions (\\"the Society\\", \\"the  Aberration\\") made sense within the society, but that, as they gain independence, certainly would have come up with their own way of referring to things. Why would someone call his own village \\"the Village\\"?! There are surely more than one.<br /><br />I hope the next book is better. While I read the first one in one sitting, well into the morning hours, I ended up needing one painful week for this book, even skipping through the last half.
B002GYI96U|3.0|A light read, although you pretty much know exactly what comes next. Being a romantic comedy, there's not much romance and surely it's not that funny.

B0080SE0UA|2.0|I bought this based on a review that said it was more like The Cult from quite a long time ago, as in the Love days. I found that I totally disagreed with that statement. I'm not even sure how to describe this album and I will definitely give it a few more listens but it definitely isn't like any Cult I liked from back in the day.<br /><br />To put this in perspective the last Cult record I bought was Sonic Temple as they had started getting more cheesy metal by then. I'm not even sure what records they put out between Sonic Temple and Choice of Weapon so take my review with a grain of salt.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I debated whether to rank Lee Child's latest as 3 or 4 stars.<br /><br />A Wanted Man starts well, with Reacher stuck in a car with 3 potential killers, while dramatic irony unfolds all around him. I liked the break from typical Reacher territory, with more of a focus on psychological tension than fisticuffs. Aside from Reacher's dull mathematical daydreams, I would have loved a novel based entirely in the car as Reacher tried to deduce the story behind his three companions.<br /><br />Alas, it was not to be. About a third of the way into the story Reacher's sense of humour was introduced. I'm not sure if this character has been in the series before, but this time around the only bad-guy I wanted dead was Reacher's wit. Inbetween B-grade 'snappy dialogue' Child keeps the plot moving by way of multiple twist reveals, some of which were predictable as Reacher hitting someone, others just surprising enough to keep the pages turning.<br /><br />Then by the final quarter Child's clearly just filled in the blanks of his 'Jack Reacher Novel' template and had Reacher punch, shoot and verbally abuse? his way through the climax of the book.<br /><br />In total A Wanted Man wasn't too bad for the millionth book in a series - I just couldn't shake the feeling that Child has been driven slightly mad by the news of Tom Cruise playing Reacher on the silver screen, and in a fit of cognitive dissonance threw in several kilos of cheesy dialogue and one-liners.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|This is one of those so stupid its funny type of movies. A lot of sick jokes so if you are offended easily this is not for you. Great for laughs. I totally would recommend.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I have been somewhat disillusioned with modern music, taking refuge in older bands like Genesis and Pink Floyd, in order to get any real depth out of music.  But when my brother-in-law insisted I look up the song \\"Some Nights\\", I did so, and found myself quite enjoying what I was hearing, despite the obvious pop leanings and especially the heavy auto-tuning near the end.  I did a bit of research and found they were the band that did \\"We Are Young\\".  Whoo boy, okay, that one is a bit overplayed, and it's okay, but I was kind of sick of that one.  But I was familiar with it, and decided to check out the album.<br />And I'm glad I did!  What I found was a pop album that strives to go beyond the simple bubblegum pop of most popular artists nowadays.  The album opens with Some Nights (Intro), an operatic piece that sounds simultaneously like classic Queen and My Chemical Romance's \\"The End\\" from The Black Parade (which itself was heavily influenced by Queen!) that in and of itself isn't much of a song but it serves as an excellent introduction to the album, giving the impression that big things are in store.  And by far, the first half of the album doesn't disappoint.  The aforementioned \\"Some Nights\\" follows, beginning with a harmonized vocal intro that somehow recalls the finely tuned gospel sound similar to that of the Backstreet Boys, without making me want to vomit all over myself.  It then goes into a tribal-rock beat while Nate Ruess discusses the effects of war on the people who are involved.<br />Next up is the song everyone knows, \\"We Are Young\\".  I have to say this is probably the lowest point of the first half; the lyrics are nice but the music is wanting, with the verse actually being musically superior to the chorus (musician's protip: don't do this).  I shouldn't have to say too much about this one; you've probably already heard it and have made your mind up about it.  However, don't let it discourage you from checking out the band anyway, as it gives something of a false impression.<br />After that is \\"Carry On\\", which sounds unassuming at first but takes on a new life a couple minutes in when the backing instruments kick in and bring a whole Irish folk vibe to the sound, at which point I simply fall in love with it.  And this basically ends the first half of the album.<br />And this is where things start to collapse under their own weight.  The next song is \\"It Gets Better\\", and it's so drastically sub-par it compels me to skip it almost every time.  It sounds like 90's Rush, if Neal Peart were a caveman (and I don't hold as high a regard for Neal Peart as many do), wrapped in a thick coat of Blink 182.  The end result is an obnoxious rock song that does absolutely nothing interesting.<br />Fortunately, this horrible display of inadequacy is made up for by the next two songs, which are a couple of my favorites.  \\"Why Am I The One\\" heavily recalls Electric Light Orchestra (the chorus sounds very much like \\"Sweet Is The Night\\" off ELO's Out Of The Blue album), though to be fair, it is very structurally unsophisticated, and some may find it boring.  However, the track that comes next, \\"All Alone,\\" is a great track, starting off with a catchy verse similar to Maroon 5's \\"This Love\\" before breaking into one of the catchiest choruses I've heard lately, despite the simplistic lyrics.<br />\\"One Foot\\" is another one I find obnoxious.  The background music repeats the same damn annoying horn riff endlessly while Ruess does his best Eminem impression, and it fails to ever rise above mediocrity.  Next is the nearly-seven-minute \\"Star\\", which I initially disliked, but I have grown to appreciate several parts of it, even the bizarre autotuning bit that escalates nearly into madness, but always keeps it subtle.  While I don't think it's the fitting climax or conclusion to the album, it's certainly not a bad song, and I think when given enough attention, there's a lot to like.<br />Closing the album is the bonus track \\"Out On TheTown\\".  It should probably have been stuck somewhere in the middle of the album, because it doesn't really fit at the end.  It's a decent pop song that can get stuck in your head, but it lacks any hooks to really sink it in good.<br />So despite the weaknesses of the second half of the album, the strength of the good tracks (and fortunately there's a good number of them) elevates this album above the crap of most modern pop music and damn near into the realm of art.  The band clearly wears its influences on its sleeve, but it's largely presented with tact and cleverness.  Highly recommended!

0743454537|5.0|\\"Traditionally, parents made decisions for a child, because presumably they are looking out for his or her best interests. But if they are blinded, instead, by the best interests of another one of their children, the system breaks down.\\"<br /><br />  Jodi Picoult's My Sister's Keeper tests every aspect of the family dynamic with the Fitzgerald family. In the story, which combines family drama, a court case that rivals To Kill a Mockingbird, and suspense up until the very end, 13-year old Anna Fitzgerald sues her parents for the rights to her body. Conceived in order to be a donor match for her leukemic sister, Anna takes her parents to court in order to avoid donating her kidney to save her sick sister Kate. Her motivation for pursuing the case and the family reactions that unfold drive the gripping plot of this novel.<br /><br /> Picoult weaves an engaging and suspenseful plot, deftly switching perspectives of the main characters in each chapter. By writing each chapter from the perspective of a different character, Picoult allows the reader to understand the diverse points of view and opinions of the characters, ranging from Anna and her family to the lawyer and guardian ad litem who work with her on the case. Each character is intricately developed, with plot twists, romance, and internal conflict. The story is masterfully constructed, transitioning among the various storytellers without confusing the reader.<br /><br /> My Sister's Keeper confronts many serious ethical questions, making the reader examine his or her own beliefs. This book handles topics such as family obligation, designer babies, organ donors, and the role of parents with sensitivity and an accurate portrayal of all sides of each argument. Every character acts in the way he or she feels is correct, but the decisions are never easy, as shown when Anna's father asks, \\"Can you tell me what the right answer is here? Because I don't know where to look for it. I know what's right. I know what's fair.But neither of those apply here.\\"<br /><br />  One of the main reasons I enjoyed My Sister's Keeper is that I appreciate books that make me think and challenge my ideas. Woven into the story are serious concepts about the family dynamic. I found myself changing my mind as I read, first siding with Anna, then her mother, then her sister. The little nuggets of philosophical wisdom in the book are thought-provoking and insightful. The only complaint I have with this novel is its conclusion. Though I understand Picoult's point in writing the ending the way she did, it left me feeling unfulfilled and a little frustrated. As a whole, however, I highly recommend this novel.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book held my interest, somewhat, but not my belief.  It is a sad piece of work.  I am surprised it has been listed among the year's best.
0596806027|3.0|The author's writing style is engaging in my opinion since the author adds sarcasm and humor in his writing however his writing style is also aggressive.  Personally, I liked the author's writing style since it was a break from reading 100% technical books but I can understand if his writing style is an annoyance for others.<br /><br />The presentation of the information seems a bit choppy and does not delve too deep into the content.  There are not a lot of practice codes to accommodate the topics.  Also, it would be nice if there were boxes around the practice codes for easier visibility and identification.<br /><br />All in all, I feel as if there is something missing in the book, giving you an incomplete or a confused feeling when maneuvering through the book.  For a book titled \\"HTML5: Up and Running\\" I feel as if it would be a reference book at most.

Plus, I consider myself a sponge with regards to fitness and nutrition, always looking for new information.  I was a little skeptical with all the 5-star reviews going in, and reading the book just further confirmed my suspicions.<br /><br />Bottom line, unless you have been living in a cave the last decade, there is nothing, nothing, in this book that you do not already know and has already been published by someone else.  I could have written this book.  But I didn't (though maybe I should).  Save your money for something else more worthwhile.  You'll just be scratching your head after reading this one.

014241493X|5.0|John Green is an author that continues to amaze me.  He is an astoundingly talented writer and Paper Towns does a fantastic job of showcasing that talent.  Quentin is your average nerd with a crush on his neighbor, Margo Roth Spieglman.  He becomes more than average when the day after late night escapades with Margo, she runs away. Quentin is certain she wants him to find her and so he, along with his two best friends, Radar and Ben, set out to follow the clues Margo has left behind.  Along the way they are joined by some surprising new friends and Quentin is forced to face the truth about himself as well as the girl he thought he knew.<br /><br />Quentin is a mix of many things.  He is part nerd, part hero, part hormonal teenage boy.  All throughout the book he is changing though.  Margo may not have meant to but she changed Quentin in so many ways.  There were times when he was selfish and rude to his friends but he always fixed his mistakes and learned from them.  His friends, Radar and Ben, were hilarious. They were both band geeks and they definitely had some geeky quirks.  Radar was obsessed with updating his website, Omnictionary.  Ben was obsessed with girls, or as he called them, honey bunnies.  Along the way the boys are joined by Lacey who is not as flaky and superficial as they first believe.  Margo Roth Speiglman is a mystery for most of the book but she was a very interesting character.  This cast of characers is one of the best I have ever read.<br /><br />The story is told in three parts and each part is interesting in its own way.  One thing each part has in common, however, is that they are hilarious.  This story is very deep at times but very funny always.  John Green has a way with humor.  A book that could be dull and dark is livened up by the humor he infuses it with. This book is laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />Overall, Paper Towns is a new favorite of mine.  I wasn't sure anything could compare to Looking For Alaska but this book definitely came close.  I highly recommend it!came close.  I highly recommend it!

006197806X|5.0|Really?  That is the end?  Why must you continue to do this to me, Lauren Oliver?  Oh the wait is going to kill me!<br /><br />Okay now for my review!<br /><br />Pandemonium is an amazing follow-up to Delirium but I expected no less from Lauren Oliver.  Pandemonium was a lot darker than Delirium and that I did not expect.  It was still greatly enjoyable but be warned: there are not many happy moments in this book.  Still, in my opinion, it was better than Delirium.<br /><br />Lena's life changed completely when she lost Alex and had to go into the Wilds alone.  She became a much harder person, more likely to hate than love.  Of course she wasn't alone in the Wilds for long.  She was found by Raven and welcomed into her homestead.  There she met Tack, Blue, Hunter, Squirrel, Grandma, Grandpa, Lo, Sarah, and Miyako.  They made her part of their family and Lena started to move on with her life.  Things changed though.  The resistance became more forceful and the Wilds were no longer safe.  Lena had a choice: to stay in the Wilds until death finally caught up with her or to go back to the cities and stand up with the resistance.  Of course she chose the resistance but she never expected to fall in love with the enemy.<br /><br />There was a lot of death in Pandemonium and I definitely teared up at each and every loss.  It seemed like every time things would look up for Lena something bad would happen again.  I loved how strong she was but I loved even more to see her breakdown.  She is such a human character and that is what makes her awesome.<br /><br />The plot in this one was very different from Delirium.  Right from the start you are hooked because there is so much going on.  Also, each chapter is either Now or Then, Then being right after Lena made it into the Wilds.  It made for a very interesting story and I liked the way it was told.  It wasn't confusing at all which I was originally worried about.<br /><br />Overall, Pandemonium is a must-read if you liked Delirium.  It is action-packed, brutally real, and at times, super sweet.  And that ending!  The wait for Requiem really might kill me.  =)rium.  It is action-packed, brutally real, and at times, super sweet.  And that ending!  The wait for Requiem really might kill me.  =)
B008MEM24S|4.0|Very fun! But I went through all the levels a couple of days.  There needs to be more levels! :)
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love the different levels. have had no problems with it on the kindle fire. I highly recommend it for manning fans
1416585710|5.0|this is stephen king in top form. a cant put down must read. i was hooked by page seven. a great story of how the love goes on even after death.
B0055SWM08|3.0|Great game. But update for new permissions and nagging for reviews knock the rating. I like it very much and will continue playing, but not updating.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the series, but the second was the best story.  Of course, one has to read the first and I found myself reading in my living room at night.  The 75 year old mom of a friend was found reading the book at 3am.....after she said was too old for the type of books....not! she is now on third book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a great game to pass the time while you are waiting. Waiting for the doctor, waiting for an appointment, waiting for your kids to get out of school. I have it on my cell, so I can pull it out and play this game at anytime. I highly recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Pretty fun for what it is!  I wish some of the games had more lives/turns, but I like it.  I like mini games and variety, so its perfect for my short attention span, lol!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|If you're looking for some deep novel that makes you think, then this book isn't for you. It is most definitely a teen book, with cliches and simpleness the entire way through. With that being said, it is still an excellent read, and it keeps you going until the last sentence. I recommend it.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|What can I say about Kiss of Steel- I loved it, it's vampire steampunk done well!<br /><br />Honoria Todd is a human woman, down on her luck.  She is in charge of her two younger siblings, one of which is facing the blue blood virus.  She hardly has enough money to make ends meet when she is noticed by Blade, the master of the rookeries and notorious Blue Blood.  Blade is drawn to Honoria and determined to make her his, but he wants her for more than blood and finds himself going out of his way to keep her safe, especially when powerful enemies want her as well.<br /><br />I am a fan of the steampunk genre, but I don't get the opportunity to read it very often.  So, when I had the opportunity to read and review Kiss of Steel, I was excited.  Bec McMaster has created a very unique paranormal world filled with humans and thralls, Blue Bloods (infected/vampire-like humans), and the occasional vicious/rabid vampire on a rampage.  It took awhile for me to understand the setting, but I really loved the set up, and the story in general.<br /><br />I liked Honoria a lot, it was easy to relate to her and her situation, even in such a unique world.  She was just trying to take care of her family to the best of her abilities, and she had a difficult time overcoming prejudices that had been taught to her.  I really like Blade as well, he is a good man with a nasty reputation.  However, he takes care of his own and he made a place and a life for himself outside of the rulers confines.  Honoria and Blade develop a solid connection, and sparks fly between them.  I love the romance in this book, it doesn't come easy for Honoria and Blade, but it is well-deserved.<br /><br />Steampunk is a historical setting, but that doesn't mean that there is no action.  There is plenty of action in this fast-paced book.  The vampires and blue-bloods are deadly fighters and life in the rookeries is far from peaceful.<br /><br />With excellent world-building, and intriguing setting, memorable characters, and (of course) romance, Kiss of Steel is altogether an excellent read.  Readers who like paranormal books, vampires, or even steampunk, I highly recommend giving Kiss of Steel a try.<br /><br />*I received this book in exchange for an honest review*cters, and (of course) romance, Kiss of Steel is altogether an excellent read.

B007R3AZNK|4.0|This cd is a great sounding recording in the same styles as Robert Johnson, Eric Clapton and other great Blues players. Has a lot of great string playing and a driving bass beat on most of the songs, would recommend that if you like the blues you get a hold of this one.
B00932A6G4|3.0|Which was to bad.  Nice animation....but, the sound was<br />awful.  All hard to understand.  I just couldn't enjoy the<br />movie; because I had a hard time, understanding what<br />they were saying.  If it hadn't been for that, I would have<br />given it a four star rating.
B008VBYN80|4.0|creative and addicting game<br />for anyone who likes free social games that will keep you busy during the boring hours.  its evony and farmvilles illigitimate child
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I'm not into \\"modern\\" R&B because there are simply so many crap artists that would not be able to sound good without all the pro-tools and other music technology that is out there to make their voices sound good. Alicia is absolutely incredible. What a beautiful strong representation of a woman, what a voice, and what an album!
B00881VLCE|5.0|to be honest this is the best puzzle app that I have ever downloaded and I really suggest that you should get it.  I luv it so yeah that's really it xD
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Your reaction to this movie will depend on the type of viewer you are. If all you need is to be entertained you won't be sorry: There's spaceships! Alien races! Thrills, mysteries and action! By golly, you can watch it in 3D AND IMAX!!<br /><br />If you're any kind of Sci-Fi fan you will leave scratching your head, first wondering about the lack of narrative, then asking yourself why you even bothered to go, rent or buy this in the first place. Me? Ridley Scott! Result? Sheesh...<br /><br />- Don't read beyond this if you haven't watched it -<br /><br />The plot is just one series of incoherences, it could have been called \\"Amateurs in space\\". Let's take a super intelligent android so he can casually stab us in the back! Let's spend gazillions of dollars and travel bazillions of miles only to take a couple of doofus to mess about! It's not like they're going to get lost, I mean they have this cool mapping technology, right? Oh, they did? But they won't inevitably get eaten or beaten, right? Honestly, I was ready to leave by that point.<br /><br />I think someone could take the scenes from this movie and make a more intelligent narrative: Is it some sort of cult? Are they mortal enemies? Who came first? Have these beings evolved so much they are in mortal danger from their own boredom? The makers of this film obviously want us to watch the sequel, but guess what, I'd have a better time speculating with friends than watching another movie about space made by amateurs. I would suggest we all stop subsidizing mediocrity.
1400082773|1.0|This book is poorly done. Spend your time reading something better. It was hard to even get through this but I did because I wanted to like it.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I like it. would love to see a platinum version for iphone. really good radar views. nice User interface. good job.
1402270275|3.0|Kiss of Steel<br /><br />This book is part of the steampunk genre, which I am relatively new too.  It is sort of a mix of paranormal and science fiction, in my opinion.<br /><br />In this book, Honora is trying to provide for her younger sister and brother.  Her brother is sick with the craving disease.  In order to be able to afford any medical treatment, Honora turns herself over to Blade, a highly feared man in their neighborhood.  Normally blood or body would be payment for Blade's protection, but the two strike a deal that she will provide him diction lessons to make him sound more like a gentleman.<br /><br />Of course the two have chemistry and try to fight that.  There are complications in their relationship--Blade's enemies, Honora's pride etc.  This book was a decent read.  I received a copy of this book from the publisher, Sourcebooks, in exchange for a review.<br /><br />[...]
B008D28HYS|4.0|This game is fun and addicting for those who like logic puzzles. Starts out with very simple puzzles and gradually becomes more complex requiring more thought. Only two drawbacks I see so far... it needs some sort of hints specific to the puzzle you're on instead of just the generic link to the Wikipedia site explaining how to play, and it would be great to have the option for multiple players on the same device so you could each keep track of progress separately.  One other thing to note is that it's really only playable on a large tablet. Later puzzles get so large they are impossible to work on a phone screen.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So many ways to study the Bible. With this app there is no excuse not to study the Word. You can study by subject or chronology. There are even devotionals from Joyce Meyers.
B004NELBPC|2.0|The app is great. I consider the HP very left of center and misleading in many of its stories.  I do read it along with legitimate news sources for perspective.
0553801473|2.0|I have to admit, I was excited to get this book and continue on with the saga, but it just isn't what it used to be. Maybe it is simply that too many of the characters I liked have died, or the story is simply getting too morbid and fantastical, or maybe it is just too long now and I am looking for some closure, but starting with this book, the story just didn't have the same draw for me. It took me weeks to get through the first 100 pages, then I finally just stopped. It doesn't mean the book isn't worth reading, but just be ready for this book to not live up to your expectations.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|The Forever Girl is a new series that has a different twist on how we have vampires in our world.  Sophia is likable and a character I would like to see more of in future books.  I would also love to see a future book with more of Sophia's mentors storyline.  She was a secondary character, but I would love to have a look into her history. Overall, a different and good addition to urban fantasy genre.
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|This book is not a total waste of time. There is a beginning with a tough situation, a middle with challenges, and a happy ending. This book also has seen reasonable amounts of editing, so you won't go crazy from too frequent spelling errors or inconsistencies. But that's about the extent of what's there to recommend it.<br /><br />But, even worse, the book wobbles between taking virtual reality all too seriously, and not seriously enough. On one page, it's made clear how the virtual reality is game-like and user-created; on the very next page, there are huge limitations on what you can do in the VR that would only make sense if the world was physical. In one chapter, the VR is described as enabled by a new, distributed approach to computing; in the very next chapter, it's made clear that anyone who wants the best VR experience should live near the central servers somewhere in Middle America.<br /><br />As most other reviewers have said: All the '80s nostalgia just gets boring. I was alive and aware in the '80s. I remember the same things. However, I don't think they were the Best Things Ever, and I don't think anyone able to create the things that the God-like character in this book created would think that, either.<br /><br />Maybe I should give it three stars, but seeing how it's up-rated vastly beyond what it deserves, I'll just stick with the one.
B0088X7YMS|3.0|Unable to get any real actresses to take their clothes off for another sequel, they decided to make a film they can easily convert into an action game. Enough people have died so Johnny Rico is now a general with the looks of Caspar Van Dien and the voice of David Matranga. Like my kitchen, in the never ending story against bugs, the crew of a starship investigates the silence of the John A. Warden, another vessel.<br /><br />The results are fairly expected as the bugs bring the battle home. Major Henry 'Hero' Varro has become the new hero bug killer. The 2 deleted scenes looked like they were in the film. The picture of Rico on the back of the DVD cover is reversed. Good cast of characters that would have been better without the CG animation.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex? early CG nudity. Adult language in the gag reel.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book starts with a sledgehammer, and doesn't let up much.<br /><br />The world is imaginative, conceived in high detail, and holds together. The science works. The characters work. The plot moves forward along a logical, yet not predictable trajectory. The book, while seemingly self-published, does not suffer from too much editing dysfunction.<br /><br />And, at the end, you're done. I don't think we need any more books in the same universe -- the story runs its arc, and that's a good thing. Even though I loved this book and think it's a great buy, I probably won't get the next one.<br /><br />I'm weighing four or five stars for this book. But in the end, it doesn't quite have the \\"extra special\\" something that I need in a five-star review -- like the better books by Banks, Heinlein, Gibson, Vinge, or other greats.<br /><br />I'm hoping we get other books from the author, set in a different world. With more practice, and a little more editing, it could be great!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am ashamed to admit I read this book. In my defense I read it many many many....(good) books ago. Before ALL the bad reviews and I couldn't even finish it...so I have no idea how it ends. You ask why am I writing a review now? Well,  I will tell you dear book lover's....<br />I was in the mall today and had a craving  to be around books.( since the kindle I don't go in those too often anymore) and what was the first thing I saw * drum roll* a big whopping display of DUM DUM DUM Fifty shades of FREAKIN' Gray. How did this book get published?  Seriously. HOW?!?! There must be some serious bored women out there with serious dull sex lives if this is getting their knickers in a twist!! Anyway,  I came home and looked it up on Amazon and there are just about as many one star reviews as five. If you want entertainment read the one star reviews. They are so so much better than the book itself.  How exactly does a book get on the bestseller list? Just by the number of books sold? Because this book is bad....not a good bad. Oh no,  just plain BAD!! Trust me.  Two words to sum up this book....TRIPLE CRAP!!
B0090EIILU|2.0|This movie was disappointing when compared to \\"Borat\\" or \\"Bruno\\". Baron Cohen's portrayal of those two characters, plus Ali G and Jean Girard, gave me hope that this movie would be just as funny as his others, but it doesn't come close to their level of hilarity.  The only halfway entertaining scenes were the ones shown in the previews.  Thank goodness I only rented the movie rather than buying it or seeing it in the theater.  I am still a fan of the man and his work, but this movie stunk.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never before felt compelled to write a review for a book.  Honestly, I bought this kindle edition because I was bored and didn't have any of my \\"regular\\" authors to read (I am a epic fantasy reader).  $5.99 for five books?  What did I have to lose?  The first book drew me in immediately; however, it was rather short and I thought, oh no!  5 small books!  I have since learned that book one was published as a short story and grew it popularity so much that the author went on to expand it into a series of books. Books 2 through 6 seem to grow larger and larger. I will say that Mr. Howey did get me into a bit of trouble with my boss, because I couldn't put the books down at night and went to work for a week sleepy, distracted...wanting to get back to the story. What an original, well-characterized series. This could really happen. I wait on the edge of my seat for the continuation of the story. I would HIGHLY recommend this series of books; it is most definitely not one of those that you read and forget about.  Every day I see something that takes me back to the Silo!

0525478817|5.0|I've read a lot of books. I'm an English major. But nothing, NOTHING, has ever made me feel so much as this book has. It's the perfect combination of laughter and sadness. And, I can say it is truly incredible the way John Green can capture the heart and soul of a character. John Green knows people. And this book, well, it demands to be read.
0385742886|3.0|First Sentence: Teresa looked at her best friend and wondered what it would be like to forget him.<br /><br />A Quick Synopsis: Before there was WICKED, before there was a maze, before there was a Maze Runner...there were sun flares. Mark and Trina knew it wasn't going to be easy to survive the sun flares, but they did. What they didn't know is that the sun flares were only the beginning. Now a pandemic is spreading everywhere, turning men into madmen. Is there a cure for this disease? Can they stay alive long enough to get it?<br /><br />The Review: When I learned that James Dashner was going to be writing a prequel to the Maze Runner trilogy, I really wasn't very excited. The last book of the trilogy, The Death Cure, asked us more questions then gave us answers, and I didn't see how a possible prequel could give us the answers we were supposed to get in The Death Cure. Also, the world before the Flare was already described very well in The Maze Runner, so I didn't get why a prequel was necessary.<br /><br />I still don't understand why The Kill Order is necessary. First of all, this is just more of the same: characters get attacked, run, see zombies, run, OOH! LOOK SOME COOL TECHNOLOGY, but wait ZOMBIES!, run, repeat. There were some places in The Kill Order where I felt the author was just writing to fill up pages. Page after page of action truly does get boring after time. Plus, there just wasn't as much action or suspense as The Maze Runner in this prequel. I also felt that some zombie encounters were just solved with deus ex machinas disguised at some new high-tech technology that the characters found.<br /><br />And speaking of the characters, you know the old saying that goes: \\"Great fiction is character-driven\\"? Well, add that to the list of reasons why this series and its prequel won't be considered great fiction. Mark, Trina, and Alec are as flat as your breakfast pancakes. And I felt that Mr. Dashner was just reusing Thomas's character to create Mark. Also, Mr. Dashner, could you stop referring to Alec as \\"the former soldier\\" every 3 freaking pages? I'd really appreciate it if you did.<br /><br />Overall, The Kill Order succeeds in finishing what The Death Cure started: killing off a once-great series. Really, The Maze Runner was a fantastic premise, but was marred by its predecessors. And now this. There are too many things we'll never know about Mr. Dashner's world, and I doubt even he himself knows them. The Kill Order was a major disappointment for me, though I guess I shouldn't have expected much after The Death Cure. However, there is another one of Mr. Dashner's releases that I await eagerly, [[ASIN:1609080556 The Void of Mist and Thunder (13th Reality)]], so he better not screw that up. You better not, Mr, Dashner, YOU BETTER NOT.<br /><br />Memorable Quote: There was a warning symbol plastered across the top, the kind that indicated the contents were some sort of biohazard. A label below the symbol said:<br />Virus VC321xb47<br />Highly Contagious<br />24 Darts, Extreme Caution<br /><br />Mark suddenly wished he hadn't touched the thing.<br /><br />Inappropriate Content Notifiers (for parents, spoilers follow!):<br />Sex/drugs: One kissing scene.<br />Language: The strongest it gets is \\"h*ll\\".<br />Violence: Battles with zombies, and one massive fire.

B005H29GSI|5.0|We only let my 4 yr. old son play Angry Birds on our Windows Phones when we're at the resturant after he's eaten a good meal so my wife and I get a moment to eat and chat too.  But he always wants to play and I was looking for a way to do that off phone.  Enter this kit (and the other one I bought off Amazon too).  We have a ton of fun offline with these...setting up all kinds of towers and knockin' them down.  It teaches him a lot about patience, accuracy, physics, trying and trying and trying again, all with fun one on one interaciton with me.<br /><br />It's a blast and really inexpensive.  Oh - we don't use the card either.  We use our imagination :)
B005LY4B0A|5.0|this app is a lot of fun. Harder than you think as levels go up. a must have for your Android phone.

B008VBYN80|3.0|its a pretty good game because you can challenge. people from around the world and fight game bosses but you need energy to progress throught the game. unless you want to purchase it using diamonds or real money you'll have to wait awhile because the bar loads very slow.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre many years ago, around the year 1968, I was a teenager, I loved the musical so much I decided to purchase the dvd, It is a family movie and will be enjoyed by every mmember of your family old or young.<br /><br />James Jones<br />Staten Island, NY
B0058SNI58|5.0|I got these for my Mom as one of her birthday gifts. She wanted a pair since my stepdad and I each have a pair of the men's crocs and really liked them. She finds these to be quite comfortable and also stylish, which is surprising for Crocs--most of you know that they aren't the most appealing shoes in the world. Since I'm not the owner of these nor a woman, I can't give my personal review, but from what my mother has told me she really likes these, so I'd imagine most women will.
B002BRRTUO|4.0|All I can say is I love this movie. It's meant to be corny, but very entertaining. The sets and effects mimic the old serial from the 1930's on purpose. This is what makes the movie different from all others.
B0085776BG|5.0|I enjoy historical movies so this was right on  button.<br />GREAT acting Cuba Goodings but would expect no less..<br />Worth every  penny to see.
B005FLX1HS|4.0|This is the second cd by Skrillex that I have owned.  I still think that Scary Monsters was a better album, this one was still very good.  If you like his sound, you wont be disappointed with this one.  If you are new to Skrillex and wanting to check him out, I would suggest buying Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites first.
B008VBYN80|4.0|well it's a good time burner and fairly entertaining although I haven't played it that much basically build a kingdom grow food make a army
B001EN71HC|5.0|Ok, so all 3 of the Austin Powers movies are funny.  But as for this collection, I really enjoyed it.  All 3 of the movies play nicely and the extra features are pretty cool.  With the Amazon pricing its about $10.00 per movie, on blu ray.  Not too bad.
B009329ZF2|1.0|This movie gives movies like Commando a bad name.  It has to be the worst alien invasion movie ever.  I found myself rooting for the aliens at every turn, but somehow they are the dumbest aliens ever in a movie.<br /><br />I can't think of a movie that I wouldn't watch over this one.
B00008GKEG|5.0|As a die-hard Beatles fan I absolutely loved these dvds. The quality and candor of the interviews is refreshing and contains interviews from the \\"Threetles\\" interspersed with audio from older Lennon interviews. The series was chock full of old film clips and outtakes from some of our favorite Beatles tunes. My only complaint about this series is the fact that squashed the White Album, Let It Be, and Abbey Road all into one episode. If I remember correctly, Abbey Road receives less than ten minutes of discussion. Overall, this is a lovely collection and I can't wait to enjoy it again!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I bought this for my husband, a huge Joe Walsh fan and it hasn't left my truck's cd player since we bought it.

0743454537|5.0|Traditionally \\"mother knows best\\", but not for 13 year old Anna Fitzgerald, who was born to fulfill a specific purpose.  \\"See unlike the rest of the world, I (Anna) didn't get here by accident.\\"  Indeed, Anna was conceived to be a bone marrow match for her dying sister Kate.  Anna may not be the \\"sick one\\", but she might as well be.  By age 13, Anna has donated blood and marrow more times than she can remember.  Anna has always been defined by Kate...until now.  As her sister's condition worsens, Anna is asked to make one final sacrifice.  However, this time, Anna's decision rips her family apart and has devastating consequences for her leukemic sister.<br /><br />In my opinion, this book is phenomenal because it is relatable. \\"It's about a girl who is on the cusp of becoming someone.  A girl who may not know what she wants right now, and she may not know who she is right now, but who deserves the chance to find out.\\"  Through her extraordinary characterization of Anna, Piccoult offers a quirky yet inspirational personality for readers to emulate.  However, you do not have to be a developing adolescent to enjoy this story.  Piccoult tells her story through a multitude of viewpoints; she offers brilliant insights into the thoughts of the mother, brother and father as the entire family deals with Kate's illness.  Like a box of chocolates, there is something for everyone in this book.  This novel is humorous yet sad.  The themes are inspirational yet truthful.  The characters are real yet captivating.  Ultimately, this is an enthralling story about a family that is torn apart by clashing needs and unrelenting love that overcomes human weakness.<br /><br />I strongly suggest reading this book, but beware, because if you pick it up, you may not be able to put it down!
B004N4HXXQ|5.0|The Vaccines was certainly the hottest thing that happened to British rock in 2011. Sincere, to-the-point songs and the humorous art-rock attitude renders Vaccines as a unique breakthrough act. Arguably one of the best debuts in the last few years, \\"What Did You Expect From the Vaccines?\\" is a compilation of catchy, witty, and highly British, indie-rock anthems.<br /><br />I can see the point many of the people who don't like or denigrate this album are making. But for once, take your time and look at the current state of British music. To me, what has been very, very special about the music coming from UK has always been the wit, and the attitude it had. And by attitude I don't mean the clothes they wear. Vaccines' music sure isn't something you've never heard before, they're bringing back something that has been long gone; consciously constructed humorous pop music with delicate Britishness. Whether the sarcastic lyrical nods Justin Young makes (with his unusually-good-for-an-indie-band voice), or the anti-solo, minimal yet atmospheric, art rock guitar work by Freddie Cowan, this band has CHARACTER.<br /><br />People are free to have their opinion, but I'm pretty sure that overly-critical music snobs who deem this album as a repetition of the rock music history, go around on the web criticizing progressive artists for being too experimental. Pop music always scares the hipsters, and this is guitar-pop at its best.

0525478817|5.0|I have read this book 3 times. And I will keep reading it for the rest of my life. It is no doubt my favorite book. I cry every time I read it, no matter what. All at the same parts too. John Green is amazing and hands down one of the best authors. I have all of his books actually. But The Fault in Our Stars is his best yet.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|\\"Prometheus\\" is a Ridley Scott sci-fi action movie, which means it has amazing cinematography and tough heroines. If you are looking for them, you will not be disappointed. But how about the story? Please don't expect an intelligent and intricate screenplay here because \\"Prometheus,\\" an indirect prequel to the \\"Alien\\" franchise, is a typical case of Hollywood blockbuster full of sound and fury, a visual extravaganza with so many big plot holes.<br /><br />Set in 2093, an expedition team of scientists and experts including an archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is sent on a mission to the moon LV-223. This is a trillion-dollar project financed by the Weyland Corporation (the CEO Peter Weyland is played by a nearly unrecognizable Guy Pearce), to discover the \\"Engineers\\" and secrets about the origin of the humans.<br /><br />The film starts promisingly, benefitting the veteran director's assured control of scenes, but as the story of \\"Prometheus\\" (script penned by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof) unfolds, you may have a very strong feeling of déjà vu. While the film's main theme is very ambitious, each set-piece looks as if borrowed from some other sci-fi films including Ridley Scott's own works.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender plays an android David. Though Fassbender as always delivers a solid performance, the android's decision making is random and sometimes unaccountable. The way he speaks reminds us of HAL9000, but Fassbender's character behaves more illogically than the computer of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" In fact, there are so many illogical motives and implausible situations in \\"Prometheus,\\" where characters almost always end up doing things in a wrong way.<br /><br />Had \\"Prometheus\\" been directed by someone other than Ridley Scott, what would the film have been like? A terrible mess of a grade-B sci-fi movie, perhaps. \\"Prometheus\\" is a gorgeous-looking and action-packed sci-fi film, of which poor storyline is barely covered by the special effects.
0743454537|5.0|This book is beyond extraordinary. Jodi Picoult's style is an easy read and captures your attention right from the beginning. Personally, I am not a book reader; in fact, I usually never read but this book just captured my attention. I couldn't put the book down and it just kept me wanting more. The complexity of this issue the book sheds a light on something people don't realize the true effects it has on a family. Jodi Picoult captivates you with the sisterly bond and the emotional ride the family deals with. If you are a sucker for suspenseful and heart-felt books than this book is perfect for you even if you are not a book reader like me.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper is about the controversial ethical issue about your rights to your own body, but hidden inside the text of the book is unconditional love of your family, sacrifices you make for your love one, and the morality of decision making. The Fitzgerald family was at one point one of those average families, but one day everything changes when Kate is diagnosed with cancer. No one is able to save Kate, except a specific Petri dish baby that is genetically designed to be an exact match to Kate, Anna. Anna is born for a specific reason; to save Kate's life. She never hates her family for making her save Kate's life, but in reality she likes doing it for Kate. Throughout Anna's life, she undergoes numerous invasive procedures in order to save Kate. Now thirteen years old, Anna is going against her parents' wishes to challenge the law to get control over her own body.<br /><br /> But the whole book isn't about one person; it is about family. It is about the bonds of family that are unbreakable. It is about the sacrifice you make for the ones you love. During the trial, Sara says to her daughter \\"Anna', I tell you, `I love you. I loved you before I ever saw you, and I will love you long after I'm not here to say it\\". When Kate is diagnosed with cancer, the Fitzgerald's life is turned upside down. They get forcedagainst each other but still nothing is able to break their love for each other. Sara Fitzgerald makes the decision for her family to save Kate's life, because that person who needs help is her daughter. Maybe she makes some wrong decisions but she is human, and she does what she thought was right to save her daughter's life even if it means sending her daughter through these procedures. Once you finish this book, it touches your heart and you are left with a new appreciation of your life and you're family.<br /><br /> Now if you are a parent what would you do if your family was put in that situation? Wouldn't you do anything and everything to save your child? How do you know what is right and wrong? Sometimes you don't have all the answers and that's okay. We are all human. But this book covers the complexity of making decisions. Sara Fitzgerald is faced with her daughter suffering from cancer, and she makes the decision to create Anna in order to save Kate's Life. She puts Anna through numerous procedures to save her other daughter's life. In front of the jury and the judge, Sara gives her testimony on her decisions. \\"Was it legal? Was it moral? Was it crazy or foolish or cruel? I don't know. But I do know it was right\\". This book covers choices and shows the choices of a family to save their daughter and the right to have control over your own body.<br /><br />This novel is much more than the right to have control over your own body. It is much more than just a family. It is much more than words on a page. It is a perfect masterpiece of the controversial issue, family bonds, love, sacrifice, decision making, the law, and the ultimate creation of a book.

6305090564|4.0|A boat captain and his crew have been hired to take a group of men to the South China Sea.  It is a rough trip as the men are really mercenaries and they are none to friendly and the weather is bad.  They come upon a massive cruise ship which was really their destination but it is dead in the water.<br /><br />The mercenaries' intent was to help rob the ship and sink it.  Meanwhile the boat that they are on is damaged as it hits another smaller boat that has fallen off of the cruise ship.  Now their escape boat is in need of repair before they can even leave.  The mercenaries are loaded with the most advanced mini Gatling machine guns and they even have a torpedo.  They board the cruise ship and find almost all of the passengers have disappeared and the ship is infested by some creatures or one creature that is apparently eating everyone on board....<br /><br />This is a monster movie that is full of action and it is actually pretty good.  It also has humor in it and at times it is quite funny.  This movie really never takes itself seriously and as a result it is just fun to watch as entertainment.  There are some great one liners in this film that are just hilarious.  I really enjoyed this movie years ago when I purchased the DVD but the ending leaves you hanging.  It is almost like there is a monster movie to follow but one was never released.<br /><br />If you like mindless entertainment with monsters and action then this film is one you should watch.  I recommend it to you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it! I am always using mobile devices. It's an added pleasure to be able to access pinterest when I'm on the go.

Only flaw I can find is opening of app seems to have lots of issues. I have to close and reopen several times to load.
B00003CXSP|4.0|This is the sequel to the first film, Silence of the Lambs.  It takes place seven years after the first film and a horribly disfigured man and his aid are interrogating a man who was an employee at the asylum where Hannibal Lecter was kept. The disfigured and crippled man is a wealthy man who in his younger days was a child molester.  Hannibal ( Anthony Hopkins) was appointed as his court appointed therapist and Hannibal left him disfigured and wheel chair bound.<br /><br />The disfigured man is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) and he is trying to find out all he can about Hannibal and Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore).  At the end of the interview the asylum worker offers to sell Mason a piece of Hannibal Lecter memorabilia and he sells Hannibal's face mask for $250,000.<br /><br />Agent Starling is managing a huge bust of a drug ring and the apprehension of a female habitual criminal.  When the woman walks out of the warehouse she is guarded by three men and carrying a baby in a shoulder harness.  Starling calls off the bust but one of the local cops draws his gun and a street war breaks out.  The entire operation looks bad as Starling is shown carrying away a baby covered in blood and 5 people are killed.  Since she was in charge she takes the blame for the embarrassment to the FBI and other federal agencies involved in the bust that has gone bad.<br /><br />Mason Verger uses his wealth and influence at the justice department to get Starling reassigned to the recapture Hannibal Lecter.  His goal is to capture and kill Lecter as revenge for his torture, disfigurement and his being crippled......<br /><br />This is a very good movie for many reasons but unfortunately it is a sequel to a super top rated Silence of the Lambs film and it was not rated as highly as it should have been because of that.  This movie is well filmed and the cinematography is just spectacular from the scenes outside of the Verger mansion to the scenes shot in Italy.  It is also a detailed and macabre story and may be too intense for some people.<br /><br />The acting in this film is top notch and Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling did a wonderful job of replacing Jodie Foster in this role.  Every actor in this movie plays their role to perfection and this is what made this movie first class.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story and the movie for many reasons.  It is really a good film and worth watching.  I recommend it to you.  Just be aware it is gruesome and has several horrific scenes in it.  It is not for the weak of heart.d macabre story and may be too intense for some people.<br /><br />The acting in this film is top notch and Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling did a wonderful job of replacing Jodie Foster in this role.

0099448599|3.0|This is the book on which the Johnny Depp movie THE NINTH GATE is based. Published in the 1990s, I bought it because Carlos Ruiz Zafon (THE SHADOW OF THE WIND) lists it as one of his favourite books. If Zafon is a 'disciple' of Perez-Reverte, I think the student has begun to outpace his teacher.<br /><br />The story centres on the quest for copies of a rare 17th-century volume called The Nine Doors, which contains a hidden code for summoning up the Devil. Lucas Corso, a sort of Jason Bourne for bibliophiles, is obsessed with Alexandre Dumas's THE THREE MUSKETEERS and becomes convinced that the scarred man and the 'femme fatale' who keep obstructing his quest are incarnations of Dumas's most famous villains: the Count of Rochefort and Milady de Winter. He also hooks up with a mysterious beauty who calls herself Irene Adler (the name of the one woman Sherlock Holmes fell for).<br /><br />It's an unusual piece of fiction that can mention Miss Marple and the Inquisition on the same page! But I found THE DUMAS CLUB a bit disappointing, as I did the film version. The cover blurb seems to promise something along the lines of a Gothic potboiler by Dennis Wheatley (best remembered for THE DEVIL RIDES OUT, although my own great favourite was STRANGE CONFLICT, battling Satanists on the Astral Plane). But Arturo Perez-Reverte is more influenced by Umberto Eco, I suspect, although he is not in Eco's league (is anybody?.<br /><br />THE DUMAS CLUB is more of a literary 'conundrum' than the Hammer Horror extravaganza I was hoping for. It takes a while for the pace to pick up, but the last chapters are both spooky and sparky.<br /><br />[Reviewer is the author of THE DROPOUT]
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|First i would like to state that I've had many different types of watches from vintage to new, from unknown to very well known watch brands. This Seiko is truly one of the best watches you can get for the money. The dial is clean, legible, and functional. The large white hour markers really stand out, and the glow is just incredible, it will basically last all night although its intensity is reduced as the hours go by. Day/date feature, Ive read that sometimes the wheels do not align, but I'm happy to state that they do align perfectly for my watch, however do not expect date change as instantaneous as the eta calibers. Also the accuracy so far has been spot on with only a few seconds of variation! this is better than some of the ETA powered watches. But even so i do appreciate the swiss made craftsmanship of the ETA's. The black bezel turns with a slight resistance which reassures you that once you set it it will not move. The large crown is at the 4' o clock position which is out of the way of the wrist, and is protected with the crown guards. Nice heavy case, rated 600ft, with engraved design on caseback. The rubber strap is so comfortable that i can wear watch all day. i usually prefer bracelets over rubber but I'm impressed. i will however buy a jubilee bracelet for it to change for more dressy occasions. I'm expecting the movement to have its Seiko dna and this should make it run for years without any issues. I highly recommend this watch.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it's a fun game my two girls eight and nine and myself forty all like this game...give it a try and enjoy
0143034901|5.0|I had never heard of this book when I picked it up. (I'm not sure how that's possible, but it's true.)  I fell in love on the first page, and though I was dying to know about the history of the book's publication and it's author, I fought the urge to google either.  That is all to say, my opinion of the book hasn't been swayed by any outside source.<br /><br />I love it.  Every word.  Countless times I found myself re-reading beautifully written sentences.  I loved that every character was fully developed with his or her extraordinary, unique and beautiful back story.<br /><br />I don't want to say more, because I don't want to ruin it for you, or set you up to expect something it's not.  Don't read the review or plot summaries.  Read the book.  Love it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting, and quite a bit challenging. I would recommend it to anybody who likes puzzles. Its patterns.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Upon first reading the book I thought it was heading toward a direction that wasn't really my thing.  However, I found myself becoming addicted to reading this trilogy.  Not to mention it doesn't hurt your sex life.  Loved the books the whole way through, so did my husband.  I am actually going to read them again.  Definitely recommend reading.  Spice things up a bit.

I haven't listened to much of theirs over the years until I found out the Thundersteel line-up was back. What a great album and a must have metal album for sure. Get it now!

1936719118|4.0|The book is short, I bought it for kindle and read it in one sitting.<br />I ultimately enjoyed the read, Derek offers good advice about<br />the philosophy involved in running a business. He advocates<br />the same thing as Henry Ford, which is basically to serve<br />your customers and know that you will be compensated.<br /><br />I am giving this book 4 stars because of the length of the book<br />relative to the cost. In other words, I think it is pretty expensive<br />in terms of cost per page, but it is still a good read.
B00005NI5Y|2.0|quite good - after so many bad records during the 1980s and 1990s. I like to listen to Dylan again. Like so many others from the 1960s, he somehow lost his creativity (after \\"New Morning\\"). How to interpret the title? Seems quite obvious to me: he loved so much Woody Guthry - and has stolen so much from him that he should transfer the profit from this record to a \\"Woody Guthry Foundation for Unsuccessful Songwriters\\"!
0425263908|4.0|I liked this book alot, similar to Fifty Shades but without the innocence of Ana.  When I start reading a book I just can't put the book down, I don't like the fact that I have to wait 45 days to read part 2.  I have read so many books after I finished Bared to You, that I am going to re-read the book before I read book 2. I like the way Sylvia Day writes, just couldn't put the book down.

1416972250|5.0|Well... im a little overwhelmed by these books. Especially this one!<br /><br />So far I have loved every single one of them, but in City f Glass, you finally got some answers!! And I mean, ALL the answers! Really I feel like this series could have been a Trilogy and it could be over. There is no cliffhanger; no nothing to make you think there is more to the story.<br />Although, we all know, there are 2 more books... so ill read them because I love the characters.<br /><br />Speaking of characters, all of the same ones came back. I really don't want to spoil anything, but this book makes it ok for Jace and Clary to love each other, they really are not brother and sister!! YAY<br /><br />Of course there was non stop action. We finally get to see Idris and the city Alicante... we find out who Clary's brother really is.<br /><br />Clary finds a way to save Jocelyn...<br /><br />Everyone has a happy ending...<br /><br />That's all Ill say, before I add WAY too many spoilers<br /><br />Review by Mrs Jones at [...]
B005MYEQ9U|4.0|I must confess I was very skeptical when I knew that Netrebko was going to sing Anna Bolena, the first of Donizetti's trilogy about the Tudor Queens. Well she was pretty good, much better than I expected. True, she's not perfect and her beautiful voice lacks agility. Also she has some breath problems; however I enjoyed her performance. Garanca is more on style here and her voice blends perfectly with Netrebko's. I didn't care so much about the production. A dull scene with lavish costumes but static, and with little interest apart from looking at the gorgeous dresses. The Wienners sound glorious, even with a 'routinier' like Pidò. There are many cuts, most the cabalettas are abridged. Also the confrontation scene from Act 2 is heavily cut.

0765316994|4.0|Other reviewers have gone into more (much more) than enough analysis and plot detail. I'd just like to add another voice recommending REDSHIRTS for anyone who enjoys a good, playful read that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Just seriously enough.  While this isn't literary fiction, its a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend several hours if you have fond memories of the Star Trek TV series and/or you had fun with the print version of William Goldman's PRINCESS BRIDE (high praise indeed).
B00028HBKM|5.0|When I was younger, phrases like \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" seemed like ad slogans and I ignored them.<br /><br />Now that I'm older, it strikes me that the tale of Jesus Christ is indeed the greatest story ever told.  Whether it be true or false (historically) it has certainly attracted an enormous number of believers -- and, as an amateur historian with a large library of books about Christianity, I have little doubt that the main outlines of the story of Jesus are true.<br /><br />Which leads me to echo another reviewer: Is this the way we human beings treat God?  You might want to take a look at Dostoevski's tale of \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" (in his novel \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\") for another perspective on the idea that human beings cannot live with the idea of God -- that we cannot tolerate it.<br /><br />Mel Gibson's terrific movie presents that horrifying idea in a way that will not be forgotten.  A cinematic masterpiece.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I used to be a real metal fan, but Shakira's sheer beauty, amazing vocal talents, and personality immediately drew me to her. \\"Laundry Service\\" definitely takes you across the world. Shakira's trademark of electric guitars and pan flutes among the many other traditional instruments She utilizes into her music is what sets her apart from every other celebrity out there. Now enough with me drooling over Shakira, let's review this album:<br /><br />There is not one bad song on this album AT ALL.<br /><br />\\"Objection (Tango)\\" is a very upbeat track. Rock oriented but really pop sounding.<br /><br />\\"Underneath Your Clothes\\", Shaki's trademark ballad paying homage (I think) to many of the 80's power ballads that influenced her, really touches you deep down, and will have you swaying and singing all the way through.<br /><br />\\"Whenever Wherever\\", arguably the standout of the album. Shakira showcases tremendous vocal abilities hear, especially toward the end. The pan flutes give this song a really \\"exotic\\" Andean feel (which Shaki refers to herself) and really makes you wanna get up and shake your ass just as much as she does in the VERY sexy accompanying music video.<br /><br />\\"Rules\\", one of the main rock numbers. Very feel good, and upbeat.<br /><br />\\"The One\\", a meaningful yet sombre power ballad.<br /><br />\\"Ready For The Good Times\\", the most danceable track of the album (no disrepected to Whenever Wherever) This song is very disco oriented and really makes you wanna move.<br /><br />\\"Fool\\" is a very heartfelt song that just about anybody can relate to.<br /><br />\\"Eyes Like Yours\\"- Shakira's english translation of her 1998 worldwide breakthrough hit \\"Ojos Asi\\". A Very sexy song in either spanish or English, and She always makes a steller performace on this song live.<br /><br />\\"Suerte\\"- Wherever Wherever's Spanish translation. I think this version is just as sexy as the English version.<br /><br />Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango- Objection's spanish translation. Enough said<br /><br />IF you are a TRUE Shakira fan, You would buy this without thinking twice. I know I would.<br />Seriously, who would ignore a beautiful Colombian woman that's charitable, can sing, and can move her hips like there is no tomorrow??
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Best mystery I have read to date. Very well written. Craig Johnson brings Absaroka county Wyoming to the reader in great detail. A must read. If you like to read westerns and/ or mysteries this is a perfect book and series for you. A modern day western mystery that will become a classic.
0307730697|5.0|This is an outstanding biography/story which includes all the topics of an incredible story. The best part of it is that it is all true.

B0074MZSPO|5.0|I listened to this album at a friends house and I was blown away! Just a few songs in and I went online to amazon and ordered the vinyl record. The band is stellar, the songs are phenomenal, and you could get the CD or download the mp3's; but there is no substitute for the feeling you get when you drop the needle down on this record!! In addition to the 33rpm vinyl record of Boys & Girls, you get a 45rpm record with 3 bonus tracks!! The bonus tracks are more up-tempo and while not out of character, I can see why they are included as bonus tracks and not part of the album.

145162607X|5.0|There is something about Philippa Gregory's writing that is enthralling. This story was told from Anne Neville's point of view and I found it fascinating, especially since the last book I'd read by this author was The Lady of the Rivers. I love it when a series takes on different perspectives so you get a more well-rounded view of all sides.<br /><br />I felt sorry for the Neville girls. How awful to be used for gain and raised to marry and solely to increase one's wealth. I think the author did a great job at making the girls female versions of their father. He thought he was doing the right thing, but switching sides is not the best way to achieve an end. There were so many needless deaths over the throne and to protect one's right to reign that it was appalling. I can't imagine living in constant fear like that.<br /><br />Anne's mother was perfectly hateful, too. She did not act like she cared for her daughters at all, but merely had her own interests at heart. I felt especially bad for Isabel when she was pregnant the first time. I found the doubt that her mother put in Anne's head about her husband quite sad, and then when things got convoluted in his relationship with his niece, well, let's just say ick to that. I pitied Anne because she felt the desire to give up at such a young age. But after so many needless losses on so many fronts, I don't blame her for wanting to go to sleep and never wake again.<br /><br />I found the whole belief regarding the Woodville's controlling men through witchcraft quite fascinating, but I can see where things that cannot be explained would be concluded that way. There were a lot of needless deaths over this as well. So much treachery and loss. Anyway, I love this series because it makes me think and the most profound conclusion of all was that the very thing Anne wanted most of her life seemed hollow in the end without love. Isn't that the truth? Great story. I read it quickly and it's over 400 pages long. That's a great novel!l!

You can save and send pics to twitter and fb and you can save to your gallery. I applaud the makers of this app and look forward to more. The edits are great fixes Color,blemish,red eye ect. Also lots of fun effects, add ones, and frames. I find myself playing with different things mixing and matching the options again and again and always coming out with great quality results.
1440440034|4.0|After being disappointed with a couple of Austen's books after P&P, I was glad to enjoy this one.  Her wit is rarely as good as she accomplishes here.  The characters are back, too and here we have both a decent leading man and lady.<br /><br />As a work of satire and literary criticism, the story works.  Although I am not familiar with the genre she criticizes (past Frankenstein), it lampoons the fans as much as the genre and there are many parallels in today's genre fans.<br /><br />I put \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" on my list to round out my opinion, but it is huge and I won't be getting at it any time soon.
