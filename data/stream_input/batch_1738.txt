B00A77II0U|5.0|great graphics love the hidden object puzzles. not a fan of clowns so story line was a little creepy good game to keep you busy when you have down time
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love all the books the last book I hated to end the series.told many co-workers about this book I read it on my kindle.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is one movie to add to your collection of entertainment.  The plot, the animation, the effects, the color, and the folks at Pixar has done it again.  When you see anything with Pixar on the label, grab it.  Disney was smart enough for once to see the writing on the wall.  These folks have such a grasp on what the world wants to see.  It is one of the best all time greats.  It will match anything Disney has out there.  I watched it four times in one day.  IT IS THAT GOOD!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think this book was great I just wish the book was not so short other than that great read
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Stop complaining about the price it is 1,000 pages = 3 regular books<br />It hits the ground running<br />No 100 page introduction as to where you were in book one<br />Great book worth the wait
B007DA2FHG|5.0|One of the best movies to come along in a very long time. This is a keeper worth owning . Young and old alike loved this movie
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game and have a hard time putting it down. my kids live watching me okay and I even got my mom addicted
0857860801|5.0|Having two cats myself, I found a chuckle on every page. Sheer delight. I hope there's more to come soon.
0061997811|5.0|This book is well put together and is a joy to read and learn from as a fan of Harry Potter and its great legends.  The book is larger than most and has beautiful work within its pages.  I love it for entertaining friends and especially those Potter lovers.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I travel for a living and I need the weather to make informed decision on what roads I will take. So far with this app I have not been able to figure out how to do that. It is great for a person that stays in one place or looks at a family members weather in another state all the time.
B007HU7NBK|3.0|As a long time Duran Duran fan, this book gave me every reason to purchase it. Once I started digging in and going into the story of my favorite bass player, some questions were answered that dogged me for years (Such as Ordinary World not being one of his favorites was a detail that bummed me out.). Others, not so much, such as the glossing over of the time away from Duran Duran or refusing to get into certain details with band-mate conflict. While I can understand the reluctance to answer them, it leaves the door open for others to fill in the gaps for him.<br /><br />The story is brisk, yet has very good moments that made me want to read more. Without getting into too many details, let's just say this book gets into the sordid details of life in the band and on the road. While it seems glamorous, and in many ways, John Taylor made no bones about the downsides of that glam. Life on the road is indeed tough, hours are grueling, and the loneliness in the midst of everybody loving him glaring. I almost wanted to feel bad for guy, but he brings the reader back into the cold reality that he and he alone chose his way.<br /><br />I would recommend this book, but for the non Duran Duran fan, some may ask, &#34;John who?&#34; Maybe this book could answer that question well enough.
B007CLSE8K|4.0|Pretty good story line. Not a five star movie but a good solid four. I would not mind seeing part two
B008GXHOFW|5.0|so good i like how it's freeroam game and it's the best game yet on the kindle fire hd it's worth the cost and now they drooped the price get it
B001AX9DT0|3.0|You have to appreciate the artist's singing and composing talent.  Some of the songs stand out and others drag along.  This might be a good listen for a quiet evening or if you are needing to fall asleep.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This group of actors have it going on and the plot is great.  You will laugh as well as be shocked by the antics of these folks playing the hunters and the zombies.  I love it!  Harrleson and Eisenberg are the best.
0470913029|3.0|My son is on this diet, so I wanted to know what he can have when he comes over for dinner.
B004I744AS|5.0|easy to navigate, love the extended info  , word origination is always interesting to learn. I like the flags that show the countries associated with the words.
B0086DBE62|3.0|All the Grandkids really enjoyed this movie along with some of the adults. Worth renting on a cold wintry day
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Its way better than the original. It does not freeze or have any problems. It is the best app i have!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app works very well. By downloading, you can get around the error message about a video not being available for mobile devices. The Save as MP3 option doesn't always work correctly (just like the warning in the app says), but all other features work with no problems. Definitely worth trying it out.
B005PK553C|5.0|The writers and director have touched on something different in society or at least brought it out in the light.  I watched the entire season in one night and I have purchased it through Amazon Instant Video for a life time.  It is that good and is and should be a winner of many awards.  It is a keeper so invest.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|if you like those things your going to like this game, there's not a lot more to be said really, it's just fun.<br />oh and once again FREE on google play.... yes amazon has pulled that one again, only allowing the paid version in their store in a desperate bid to wring money out of us.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Though the juicedLink has a little better S/N ratio, in my eyes, it doesn't justify the extra $200. For my money this performs solidly.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|A little dry at times. Very insightful. I think would really appear to older audience. But should be seen by any teen or college age person.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was looking for a new book after I had finished the fifty shades of grey series. I found this series and I love it!  I can't wait for the third book to come out in may 2013!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This series is going to be as good as the first although I sat through the entire first season in one night.  These writers and director have it pegged.  Keep up the good work, scare and frighten us again and again.  I love the off the wall experiences written in such a light.  Life is real and we don't, as a society, know the half of it.  Long live Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, a pair of great writers....keep thinking out of the box.
B007NMN2US|5.0|its not a toy to play with just a keychain but i suppose u could play with it. Its a regular lego character on key ring.. Batman is my fav so i love keychain<br />Any questions just ask<br />-Bee

B0076NKNLA|4.0|Well done movie. Not exactly what I expected. Showed a side of Marilyn I believe few people knew. The actors were great
B0053O89WY|5.0|This Series is AWESOME! They were packaged appropriately everything brand new and was received sooner than I even expected. Loved it.

1455502758|4.0|First book I've read by Hitchens. He writes the best about a hard subject and withot depressing one. I'm going to read other books by him now.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Most creative series I have seen in a long time! It keeps you very entertained! I love how entwined they make all the different fairy tail stories!!!

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Always look forward to new Jack Reacher novels as they never disappoint.  Jack always gets the bad guys and the people he meets along the way who join him in the hunt are well developed and interesting to get to know too.  Cannot wait till next one!
B004YOEFG8|5.0|bonjour ce blu ray est parfait et tres instructif merci!!!de tres belles images et un son enorme quand la fusee decolle!!!!
0465011047|5.0|A sad but interesting book. Great story with a lot of information about North Korea and how they live in the camps. Definately worth the read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved it! Very smart plot. I thoroughly enjoyed this page-turner book and am looking forward to read more books by this author.
1400031354|5.0|Ongoing saga of a lady's detective agency in Botswana......fun, light reading that'll put a smile on your face.  I recommend this series.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This is helpful book for people who don't total get our English language thank you for this book it was a good.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY love this type of music. When I saw this was only $4.00 I had to get it. It's well worth it, especially if you like this type of music. The Lumineers are one of my all time favorites too, I  cannot wait for more albums from them(:
0307891402|5.0|Excellent guide for an excellent game. Very well explained and the hard cover helps to preserve it. A good choice on your travels in Skyrim!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent trilogy! Couldn't stop reading.. I thoroughly enjoyed this page-turner book and am looking forward to read more books by this author.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|The story line was great!  Being able to find a sister that you didn't know about coupled with a tragedy.  My wife thought that it was a little dark for my daughter (being 4 years old); however, I ended up watching it with my wife from the beginning and felt that the story line was appropriate.  This isn't as dark as the Treasure Hunt -- which my daughter did get a little scared at one point.<br /><br />I'd recommend watching this during the day just to be safe.  My daughter tends to dream about the last thing that she saw.  So, we had her watch a fun uplifting show that she is use to.  Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it!
B000VZR75K|5.0|kiss is one of the best bands in the world and this is i think their most essential album! from the ballad beth to the anthem rock-n-roll all nite i think this album has something for everyone if you like this type of music! for those of you that dont know about the band i would start with this cd and another essential cd would be the very best of! 2 killer cds by \\"the hottest band in the world\\"
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|if you haved read any of lee childs books,this is the best one yet. i have read them all and reacher just gets better and better.<br /> a must read.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sade once again proves that she and her amazing band are truley gifted performers. This video of a live performance does not allow for studio adjustments to sound, but rather show a group of well rehearsed and soulful music for which she is famous for. She seems not to age since she first started and this video features many of classic tunes as well as newer tracks. My only regret is that I did not see her live myself last time she was in Chicago, I hope she returns soon so that I can enjoy the live performance as well.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent trilogy! Couldn't stop reading.. I thoroughly enjoyed this page-turner book and am looking forward to read more books by this author.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|I only rate this a 2 because I found the movie to be thought provoking.  It's the product itself that I find lacking.  The disclaimer at the top states you cannot redeem your Digital Copy past December 4th 2012.  That is the date of the release.  What a rip off!  It may be offered for half off but unless you get it (at a much higher cost) that same day you will be out half of what you paid for!  Lame!<br /><br />And what is this shift to only put extras on Blue-Ray?  I'm sorry that I can't afford the fancy HD, but that doesn't mean I don't want to see the extras as well.  Once again I'll just get in line to rent it from the library.  Or off Red Box.  Or order it via my cable provider.  Much cheaper!
B00992CF6W|4.0|they should have redstone in the next update its fun but it would be more fun with redstone and sticky pistons and regular pistons
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This set is a micro world Lego visualization of minecraft.  I would not classify it as a play set per say but a great complement piece to someone who loves minecraft.  My 11 year old daughter loved it, it's small detail and its trueness to minecraft.  Do I see a huge replay value?  No...  But I do see her using it as a art piece once she is done building.  Who knows, maybe she will find something more to do with it.  Knowing kids, anything is possible.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Upon listening to \\"Get Naked (I Got a Plan)\\", Britney's sixth song on her fifth album \\"Blackout\\", I noticed that there was a clear sense of catharsis present in her voice which she undoubtedly projects back onto us (the listeners), as we are now made a part of her struggle and subsequently, and thankfully, her ultimate liberation. The sexual, but most importantly innocuous themes pervaded in her song (despite what the critics have said) are an essential part of her album, and it is so cleverly stated through its title \\"Blackout.\\" Simply beautiful. A must buy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend this book to all my female friends. I will read other books by this author.
B007IL5D3S|5.0|I really enjoyed this latest book from Vince Flynn the characters were well drawn and the story was fast paced and enjoyable I look far ward eagerly to the next episode of Mitch Rapp's career
B0067Q42BY|3.0|This game isnt spectacular enough for there to be any justification in putting ads in a game i spent money on
B008966SIU|5.0|Like it better than Veckatimest. Easier to listen to, and every song takes you to a different place, but works together with the last one.<br /><br />I'm not good at writing music reviews. This is one of my favorite albums ever. Buy it.
B0041KVYIW|5.0|OK, I'll assume that everyone already knows the quality of the Beatles songs on REVOLVER(If you don't, here's a hint: They're all GREAT!),so I'll concentrate mainly on the quality of this particular issue of it.<br /><br />This review is from an average Joe, with a sub $500.00 Audio rig - I'm sure by now you've all read horror stories from some of the ultra expensive gear owning hard core Beatle Maniac Audiophiles out there. Yes, these new VINYL LPs have come from a DIGITAL Master, that was originally intended for the 2009 remastered CDs. And yes, there are some minor discrepancies here and there in the printing of the jackets(not to mention 2009 copyright notices.)<br /><br />I DO sympathize with those Folks who are disappointed - heck, If I owned a $200,000.00 rig, I'd probably be P.O.'d too!  But I can honestly say on my \\"Econo\\" equipment, this album sounds mighty fine. Crystal clear fidelity, with rich, deep bass, smooth, yet punchy mid-range, and sparkly, never harsh treble - awesome!  There's something about the sound of great Music on vinyl, that is just very appealing - even on relatively inexpensive gear, and even if that Music has gone through a digital link somewhere in the chain leading it to vinyl. I think it's probably the almost subliminal sound of the stylus itself actually riding on the vinyl. It creates a certain subsonic ambiance, that you can feel more-so than hear. You really just don't get that vibe with CDs or MP3s. I believe that's why many People, myself included, prefer the sound of CDs(or MP3s)recorded directly from vinyl over the actual official all digital ones.<br /><br />Bottom line: Vinyl lovin' Beatles Fans who's Turntables didn't cost more than their cars did, should be very happy with this. I certainly am!
1469984202|5.0|Tis is one of the best books I have read. I would say up there with Enders Game in the Sci-Fi category. The characters are interesting and the story is just as good. I had a very hard time putting this down.
B000HT3JNY|5.0|This Blu ray was exactly what I needed to help fill my collection....Not only cause this is one of my favorite movies, but also cause I didnt have to wait long to recieve this product either......
B008QMMEOE|5.0|my 18 month old granddaughter loves it and it keeps her busy while I get food ready...impressed! this is the first puzzle game she has played...and she really likes it.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Not your Daddy's physics game, Jellyflop offers simple yet rewarding gameplay and, if you're a fan of physics puzzles,  this WILL addict you. Keep in mind,  there are more solutions than just one per puzzle, and the best victories are the ones that you're fairly certain you out thought instead of solved.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|I've had this app for about a month and am still trying to figure out how it works.  I'll keep trying.
1400064287|5.0|It is fun and informative.  I have always thought of myself and incapable of marketing a product or idea but this book has changed my notion of what I can do.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|Our requirement for speedy delivery to meet our granddaughter's visit. Movie arrived as promised in perfect condition. We enjoyed viewing as a family with our granddaughter just as much as we did when we originally viewed the movie decades ago as newly weds.
0812550706|5.0|A great 8th grade English teacher introduced me to Orson Scott Card, and I've loved reading his books ever since I started with this one.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|The story line and acting was so poor it was painful to watch.  Wanted to see it through to the end, but never thought it would end.  I like some musicals but hope they do not make more like that one.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Just a great, fun film. Any movie where Robert Downey Jr. gets in a \\"Point Break\\" reference has to be great.<br /><br />Seriously, just a fun movie. It's a total popcorn flick and one of my favorites for 2012.
B008FIHUDO|5.0|This is what the blues is all about.  Her voice roars and aches with depth that can't help but touch your soul.  Don't miss this this album if you love to hear real thing.
B007STXHTM|2.0|Seems to leak when buttons are used underwater. No fatal leakage but consistent dampness and then condensation around the lenss housing.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|the most amazing book ending in the Percy Jackson and the olympians series, I was like OMG all the last chapter
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|this book was entertianing and all but alot of the ideas in this book were taken from many other stories. also the main character was extremely unlikable and if this author had any sense she would write it all over again from peetas perspective.(similar to enders shadow by orson scott card)
B008EK91XU|5.0|Excellent well written book that is easy to read. Was an interesting insight into an elite athletes life who at only 14 was a world class competitor and how it changed his life forever.
1878424319|5.0|I have purchased many copies of this book and other books that continue the same line of material. The material is extremely valuable and supportive of amost every code of ethics and thinking. It makes difficult ideas about living life easy to understand without the illusion that it is easy to do.<br />I rcommend this book.
B0083GR6Y6|5.0|Let's gets this straight right off the bat...this isn't a movie about wolves.  Yes there's wolves in it, but this is a film about the human spirit.  Go in with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.  In my opinion, one of Neeson's best performances.  Oh and for those of you complaining about the ending...you're missing the point.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Gray game easy to plain and good way to entretain your self  and kill time. When. You have sapare time
B004PGNB1K|4.0|I think this book is better than the first in the series, it packs a lot in and leaves you looking for the third! I took a star off because I cannot find the last one online
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Clint Eastwood is a classic cowboy strong silent and deadly with a weapon. If you've never seen this you are definitely  missing out on a classic.

B005LAII9O|1.0|movie was very boring,action was good, but not enough, will trade it in soon not worth keeping,endings were dumb. too many sex acts.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved this game! Great grafics and a good mystery story line. The game had lots of clues and plenty of help if you needed it.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|First off, I'm not a fan of the horror genre at all. I grew up in the 80s when horror films were made over-the-top (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, etc.). So perhaps when my fiance recommended we watch this together, I was a bit reluctant, and also expecting the same experience from those other films.<br /><br />This is quite different, as others have noted. It is extremely low budget, but probably also gained one of the highest return on investment ratios in the business. And it is deeply entertaining. It's so entertaining I ran down to the video store and bought a copy.<br /><br />The premise is simple enough - there are bumps in the night, and the couple suspects it might be paranormal. So they set up a night vision camera, an EVP recorder, and then go to bed. A number of increasingly bizarre things happen in the night which climax into a shocking ending. I won't spoil it. Overall, I was deeply entertained by the film, I found myself straining my eyes and ears at times to try to anticipate or spot the unusual disturbances, and was surprised how quickly time passed when it was over. And for me, that's indicative that I've seen a good film.<br /><br />Only two gripes of mine (mild spoiler alert): 1) you owe it to yourself to watch the film with a good sound system. The stock speakers on your TV will serve you well for the highlight of the unusual activity, but with a decent sound system or headphones, some of the \\"thumps\\" or moans you hear will build the anticipation and climax for many of the scenes. So keep that in mind. 2) It was all so well-done, but the scene with the Ouija board looked pretty bad from the visual effects perspective, and was a bit over-the-top given the previous events that lead up to it. But otherwise all the other scary scenes overshadow the Ouija board scene and allow me to forgive its cheesiness.<br /><br />As a non-believer in the genre, this film got me to reconsider \\"spook\\" films (honestly I don't think this onequalifies as \\"horror,\\" even though that's where it was categorized at my local video store). I look forward to seeing the next two in the series.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Wow I love this and I hope he has more to follow, great music not the usual mix, extremely impressive. A music lovers cd
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This is an extraordinary S.F. film for those willing to immerse themselves in it. the second time around it is even better. It is spooky and unsettling, leaving one with imagery that sticks around. A typically brilliant, original Ridley Scott production.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|so much better than other games like this. this game has races and many other things to do than hatch and level up
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|An awesome thriller with a dramatic twiSt u didnt see comin in the end....couldnt have been a better cast....definitely a lil diff
B000UJ48O0|5.0|My wife was a huge fan of the O.C. when it was on the air, but I'd never watched it before. I have to say, this show is pretty great.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|This hidden object and mini puzzel game is full of mystery.Keeps the player engaged in story as well as trying to solve the murder.Really enjoyable game
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have to say, this is a pretty great book-to-film adaptation. The movie version of \\"The Help\\" really stays true to the spirit of Kathryn Stockett's popular novel. Set in Jackson, Mississippi, in the early 1960s, the film takes a close look at what life was like for the African American women who worked as maids in the homes of upper-class whites. The casting is spot on. This is the first movie I've ever seen Emma Stone in, believe it or not, and I am now officially a fan of hers. You can also see why Octavia Spencer won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as a result of her work in this film...she's fantastic! I appreciate that this is a long movie, so not as much needed to be cut from the book (though I was disappointed they omitted the whole toilet-training process, which is pretty central to the book, in my opinion). If you are like me and generally avoid film adaptations of great books because they usually, well, suck, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book held your interest but I was very unhappy with the ending.  Hope book four comes out real soon.
0316926345|5.0|As other reviewers have already mentioned, this book operates at a few different levels.  Ultimately it's a spiritual journey.  Evelyn Waugh's writing is sublime.  I've read this book many times and am now at the point of reading it to just savor Waugh's gorgeous prose.  Can't wait for it to come out in Kindle!
B009AZZ6H8|5.0|We have been waiting too long. Soundgarden is my favorite band, they have that unique sound and I like both they're old Sound and new. They're just musical virtuosos.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I see all these bad reviews that are mad about the price and so much more so no way I'm going to get this unless its free.<br />not not not never never not not going going going to to to to get this freaken apppppppp
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved the book and the characters. It is well written and makes me think of what is happening in the world today.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|Meryl Streep is so convincing as Thatcher that I totally lost track of time while watching the movie.  Definitely recommend watching this.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Fast paced, climatic, Suspenseful.  Hard to put down until every page is read. Great casting of characters and intriguing plot with plenty of twists that will keep you guessing.  4 1/2 stars all the way!  Will be looking for more of Gardner's books!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This is a great film, well directed, well acted, stunning special effects, and a deep story line. Ridley Scott has exceeded the original ALIEN with this movie. It is taut disturbing very byzantine and dark. David shows the basic anti-organic personality exhibited by all his descendants. The end leaves tou wondering when part 2 will come out.
B007HACDLK|5.0|So many times after an author has written several books about the same character they lose their edge. Not so with Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp. Really enjoyed this one and hope Mitch returns.
B00A77II0U|5.0|As I 've said before,  I love point and click mystery games,  but do not like hidden object sections. However, once again,  I 'll overlook the HO parts and enjoy this excellent,  creepy,  suspenseful game.  I could also not have to put up with the sarcastic comments certain games throw in when the player is searching for an object or a clue. Some are insulting!  A WARNING : IF YOU HAVE CLOWN PHOBIA,  BETTER PASS THIS GAME UP!  Otherwise,  enjoy the game! It will keep you occupied for hours!
006016848X|4.0|It was nearly ten years ago when I first read Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus, and I remember thinking how fortunate I was to stumble across such an honest guide to understanding the opposite sex. There were secrets to be revealed here and all I needed to do was pay attention.<br /><br />Today I'm married to a marvelous Venusian woman, and maturity has helped me appreciate how much more I still had to learn from my bachelor days. If anything, my greatest lesson is perhaps the Socratic wisdom--I know that I know nothing.<br /><br />From experience I can attest to this book's timeless insight.
0316187216|5.0|For Joe Abercrombie fans:<br />I happen to be in London when Red Country was released in the UK approximately two weeks earlier than in the US. Thus I have with me both the UK hardcover and the US kindle version. And this book is so well written that right after I finished Red Country, I ended up buying the kindle version of the First Law Trilogy that I already read a few years ago just so I can rediscover Mr. Abercrombie's magic. Starting book one again now. But I digress. Quick summary for you fellow fans: Red Country is much more well written than the Heroes, but the action is less exciting and less &#34;cool&#34; than Best Served Cold, and the story nowhere as epic as the Trilogy. Iif you're already a Joe Aberdrombie fan, then you know what i'm talking about, just get the bloody book.<br /><br />For non fans: this is a stand alone book that can be read as a starting point to Mr. Abercrombie's fantastic world, but I highly discourage that you start here. So many fine details, references, and irony will go unnoticed and great characters will lose their weight if you are not familiar with the back stories. Go and start with the First Law Trilogy (the Blade Itself is the first book) and you will discover one of the very best read of your life (although the first one third of the first book can be a bit boring due to the character and world building).<br /><br />Yes, the First Law Trilogy is as satisfying as GRRM's first three Game of Thrones books  and somewhat better than Patrick Rothfus's also excellent Name of the Wind books. Just read all Mr. Abercrombie's previous books first, then quickly get this one. You will be glad that you did.<br /><br />If your previous experience in fantasy is any of the following: Brent Weeks (Night Angel Trilogy), Mark Lawrence (Prince of Thorns trilogy), David Anthony Durham (Acacia Trilogy), David Gemmel, Glen Cook, R Scott Bakker, and the much overrated Brandon Sanderson, then the First Law Trilogy and its subsequent stand alone books (especially Best Served Cold and this Red Country) will open your eyes to what proper story telling is all about.
B00684J49U|5.0|I own the entire series and watch them often.  I hope there are a few more seasons.  I admit that I want to see more happy couples...love the medicine too!
B00338QENI|5.0|I have to say this was one of the most informationally, emotionally stunning books I have read in ages. I don't read a ton of non-fiction,, but would recommend this book to anyone interested in how landmark medical research is done, the cost in human terms of such experimentation, the people involved on all levels. Racism, loyalty, love, history figure prominently in this book. To name just a few areas of interest. I cannot say enough about how valuable this book is to a deeper understanding of the medical establishment we take for granted today. Rebecca Skloot has done a great service to people of African American heritage, too. I so admire her work here.
0930289234|4.0|To be honest, this one was a challenge for me to get into. The characters seemed just a little too distant and unrelateable for much of the story.<br /><br />I saw the live-action movie in theaters, and then after finishing the novel, I watched the extended movie version on DVD. I think the combination of book, movie and putting the story in the context of the mid-1980's (where Cold War fears were still high, and the threat of nuclear annihilation was much more a reality than now) is what helped me fully appreciate what Watchmen was trying to say.
0425263916|5.0|Love, love, love this book.  Sylvia Day I am waiting for the next book, which seems like forever.  Have read it (3) times now.  Will reread before the next one comes out again. Did I mention I loved it!!!
0393343405|5.0|English is not my native language, and the author used a lot of words that are not commonly seen in the materials that I have read.  So I have to use dictionary to learn about 1000 new words, but once the meaning of those new words are clear, the sentences are so beautiful and reading is so enjoyable.  Usually I would stop reading an article if there are too many new words, but I never thought about quitting reading this book.<br />Really enjoyed it and learned a lot about that period of human history.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|i am intersted in buy this gun. but does anyone know if the geometry of the hail fire and the drum mag allow the drum mag to fit it?
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I was very surprised at the way this movie was beautifully created and written. It was not at all like the previews suggested, but still a pleasant film from Disney and Pixar. The attention to detail was spectacular and the way the water rushed down the river and off the stone of the castle wasn't something I had been fully prepared for, much less the detailing of the bear's fur and own maiden's curly locks! The plot of the movie was an interesting moral tale that I'll let you watch to find out for yourself how wonderfully written it is! Overall a well thought-out, gorgeously animated film to be watched over and over!
B008VBYN80|4.0|pretty good. a little slow paced but other wise not so bad. download and have fun today. good for all ages.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a trip many would like to take and hopefully not have to think about the outcome BUT it makes you think and KNOW that everything you do changes something.  Loved it.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|First saw this years ago and it is better than I remembered, very intense.  What a kick to see all the old Hollywood hands doing cameos.  Billy Crystal as the gravedigger is wonderful.  Branagh chews the scenery a little here and there, but no harm done.  It's a lavish and satisfying production.
B005XBA9Y8|4.0|An almost excellent box spoiled by the six disks of the idiotic and imbecile third-rate brass propaganda. Still, well worth the money for the Szeryng disks and Symphonie Fantastique.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book! I couldn't put it down and I can't wait until the third book! From beginning to end this book is a page turner and I found myself cheering for Gideon and Eva's relationship.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is like angry birds so I don't know why people hats it because it is like angry birds which may I remind you is the best app ever! this game is clearly cooool if you feel the same that type these words- JUL
B004I744AS|5.0|great great app.highly recommend this to everyone. not only can you look up words, it gives you great history info. it has a lot of things I learned in school and much more . Just love it !!!!!!
B003UMW68Y|5.0|This is a fantastic movie and the Blu Ray format does it justice. It's so crisp and vivid it brings a whole new life into the film, and altogether improves the experience. I think it's well worth the money it's charged however I'd probably like to see a little more behind-the-scenes stuff and bonus features and what not. However, I can't complain too much about that so I'd recommend this to any fan of Tim Burton's original movie
0761536434|5.0|The person I bought this for loved it. Great gamer gift. :) it was a little late for his birthday but he didn't mind.
B0055SWM08|5.0|awesome puzzler I think you should buy it today.  right now is a good opportunity so take advantage of it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|HAVE NOT YET READ THIS BOOK.  BUT I LOVE ALL OF VINCE FLYNN'S BOOKS.  MITCH RAPP IS A REALLY TOUGH KIND AND BUT<br />I WILL VENTURE THAT HE IS QUITE LOVEABLE TOO.  I AM ANXIOUS<br />TO GET INTO THIS BOOK
B004UID2LC|1.0|ok so i was searching for a few songs and it said searching but didnt download...i guess an update caused this but it ruined the app for me and i uninstalled it...dont get it its not worth it
B009WO7NQO|2.0|not a bad game but $$ required for everything. purchase, then add on content and lastly to get the unlock code to get special content you need to buy angry birds merchandise from amazon. do not pass go, do not collect $200. (monopolistic, aren't rovio and amazon?)
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was not quiet as good as “Hunger Games “.  The ending was great but I thought it got off to a slow start. Still, I cannot wait to read the third book.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This is simply my favorite movie of all time. The actors are great, as well as the lines. It had a great impression on me.
B007SGM084|5.0|wasn't sure I was going to like it.  The more I read the deeper I got into the the story line.  Once I finished the book, I needed to know more about the people involved.  I went to Amazon and found the trilogy!<br /><br />Thank goodness, all three right there together, and it would only take a few seconds to start reading Fifty Shades Darker!  Needless to say, I have read all three now and need to check into more.<br /><br />Love my kindle and Amazon!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|okay so my kindle fire hasn't really done the new update! but over all the review is ive never had an app more addicting
0061122416|5.0|This book is in such surprising condition, like it just came off of the printing line. I am loving this book!
B009KHCT94|4.0|It was good over all. Even the space battle would have been ok, without the chick and her dress. That was too much.
0140557741|5.0|Good book to use for team building.  I took it apart and have members discribe their picture and then try to put the pages in order without showing the pictures.  Its fun and the team learns to trust and listen
B009GFEOY8|4.0|Overall, I was satisfied with this product. It was my first time using film in my Polaroid OneStep, so the first few pictures didn't really turn out, but once I added an old Flash Bar I had, the pictures looked great. I'm scared to use it without a Flash Bar, but it might've just been user error. Definitely better than taking your chances with expired film though.
B0089XH38M|4.0|I originally had different antivirus protection for my tablet, however I downloaded an upgrade to the OS and lost everything I had acquired in the tablet.  Therefore I searched for new protection.  I found AVG on Amazon and I trust Amazon for good products.  For a free program, I like it quite well.  I would like to see the icon on the top notification line to KNOW that it's working and my tablet is always protected when I enter the Internet.  Currently, it only shows me when it scans an app I've downloaded or when I manually scan. There are no ads associated. I like that.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third installment of this popular trilogy was every bit as engrossing as the first two. I couldn't put it down!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The title of the book intrigued me and after google research about the author I had to read it. The book kept my interest up throughout each chapter. Whether you are a believer or not it is a thought provoking story!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I have not finished the book.  I am not really interested in all this sex as in Fifty Shades of Gray.  I plan on reading until the end.
B000SGSU58|5.0|I had no problem following the story line. I have followed the main character, Harry Bosch through the books in order.<br /><br />Just a well writtn series, with lots of great twists and turns ..
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I like this movie because it leaves a message, so many times we don't see the beauty around us while others can.<br />Simple things that can make you happy and you don't even think about it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good gaming  nice graphics  ads are annoying but minor compared to my enjoyment of the play  plus it was FREE!!
B009WJ2HDS|3.0|I can recomend this recording but it is not his best. Some of his other releases contain tracks that make you stop whatever you are doing and listion. February Sun on the disk Neighbourhood comes to mind. I can't not stop and listion when it cycles on.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy pinning. I have found so many things that interest me. Great ideas for crafts and recipes. Beautiful pictures. Something for everyone.

B0063IH60K|5.0|very easy way yo pass Time plus u can play against other ppl. don't do the rsdom deal though u will never win I learner that the hard way
B007SGM084|5.0|I had been hearing so much about these books and I have to say that when I finally began to read, I didn't want to eat, I didn't want to be bothered.  I just wanted to lock myself away into my room for a couple of days with my slow jams on and get lost.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can't live without this app.  I have been so inspired by all the pins.  Now I'm ready to create.
B005DMNS4A|5.0|Best album ever recorded period! The sound quality is excellent.  I think this is the 5th time from lp to cd that I have purchased this recording.
B007UXSKMU|5.0|Really liked it, even our teenage daughter liked it and now has watched all the previous ones. Makes for a good popcorn night!
B00984668E|5.0|For some context here, I love all The Sword's albums, in this order: my favorite is Gods of the Earth, then Age of Winters, then Warp Riders.  My impressions of this new album: I thought at first that it was a move away from modern metal, and I characterize it as a throwback to what we called Heavy Metal, in the 1970s. It seems maybe that the group doesn't want to be characterized as a metal band, but wants more to be thought of as a throwback hard rock group.  This album is more bluesy than the others.<br /><br />Like many albums, repeated listens improve your opinion of the record, and this one is no different.  Overall, this is not a huge departure for The Sword, nor do I look at it as a sellout record.  I must say that Gods still ranks number one, as far as my favorite, because I prefer the heavier, metal sound of this earlier album, but this is a solid record.
0062183591|4.0|I read Dan Ariely's \\"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty as a student in Carlow University's Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics Program.  [...]  As a student in this program, studying a wide range of aspects in fraud, Dr. Ariely's book provided a great amount of insight in a simplistic manner.  This text is filled with experiments to determine what most affects when people cheat, and how external factors may contribute to their rationalization of cheating.  The explanation of experiments clearly defines Dr. Ariely's thoughts prior to, as well as after the research.  The ways in which he thought of experiments was quite intriguing.  For example, while meeting with a fashion-oriented friend before a lecture, he began thinking of how brand name labels influenced people's code of morals and honest (or dishonest) behavior.  The results of experimenting with brand name labels and honesty were quite interesting: individuals had a higher level of cheating when they were aware that the clothing and accessories they wore were counterfeits.    There are few weaknesses that I noticed as I read this book.  Each chapter is mostly independent of others, so it is rather easy to pick and choose the topics to read.  However, if read through as one book, it becomes slightly repetitive, as Dr. Ariely recaps information from previous studies that are utilized throughout several experiments.  This repetition is both a positive and a negative, though.  If read slowly, it serves as a refresher and good reminder so readers clearly understand what was used from previous experiments.  If read quickly, however, it slows down the reader and serves more of an annoyance than refresher.    As a future fraud investigator, this book truly helped in understanding the thought process behind individuals who rationalize cheating, and the degree to which they rationalize it.  It helps people to see the simple things that aid people to rationalize their lying behaviors.  Ariely included several letters from individuals who have read his writings, and sought out his opinion because of the situation they faced- such as a gentleman who faced over billing client hours (which was done by all other employees) or being the first to be fired when the time for terminations came.  The manner in which Ariely addresses these real individuals helps readers connect the dots between his experiments and research to associations in the workforce.  This book is a great read for anyone interested in lying, cheating, and rationalization.  After I finished reading this book, I realized just how prominent cheating is, and just how much it goes unnoticed and/or unpunished merely because of social surroundings.
B008JFC6F0|4.0|Its great! awesome songs(= Really good riffs and really i guess powerfull meanings. O m g y e s !
B008AK8FHM|4.0|He writes very well. Enjoyed the book very much. Except that it's more on the new age side, as there's no mention of who this God of love is, no mention of Jesus Christ. It's a good book to break the barrier for a atheist to consider the possibility of afterlife but not so good as a theology book.

B00005N5S5|4.0|The Terminator(released Oct/84)was Schwarzenegger's cementing of his acting career to the highest heights of the action genre.It was a fast paced,thrill ride and he played his part of a cyborg killing machine,right down the middle.Starring along with him was Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor,Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese,Paul Winfield as Ed Traxler,Lance Henriksen as Hal Vukovich,and others.Henriksen would go onto star in director Cameron's Alien 2,along with Cameron`s friend Bill Paxton,who can be seen as the punk with the spiked hair outside the Griffith Observatory near the beginning.<br />The world of the future on 2029 Earth has machines battling humans.A defense system created by Cyberdine systems for the U.S.Government,became more powerful than anyone could have imagined.The system eventually turned on humans in general,and thus began mankind`s battle back to reclaim the earth from machines.When all seemed lost for the humans,one John Connor inspired the people to never give up and the resistance spread far and wide,and much stronger than before.The machines decided in order to completely wipe out the resistance movement,they would send one of their own back in time to kill John's mother,Sarah.And so they sent a cyborg(Schwarzenegger),who suddenly appears naked on the street,amidst bolts of static electricity.The resistance learns of their plans and sends one of their own back to protect her,Kyle Reese(Biehn).<br />In 1984 Sarah is not married and lives with a roommate.Suddenly other Sarah Connors in the L.A. area start getting killed one by one.When she is the only one left she gets worried and calls the police for protection.However the cyborg sent to kill her is hot on her trail and is now stalking her in the very club she awaits for a police escort in.Just as he is about to shoot,Reese is there also and he blasts away at the cyborg.Very little can stop the machine and it continues to recover after every blast of Reese`s weapon.Sarah and Reese flee for their lives,while the cyborg is never very far behind.<br />In a motel the two talk of Reese`s future,Sarah`s future son John and what has happened to bring him back.He admits that he loves Sarah and the two make love,with Reese unintentionally becoming the father of his good friend John from the future.Their bonding is short lived as the cyborg eventually catches up and the two must flee once more.Out on the highway a chase ends in Reese`s death and the cyborg is totally burned.However,even though the outer covering has burned away the inner mechanism still functions and continues to pursue Sarah.She hides in a factory and when the chance arises,she manages to crush the cyborg under a heavy duty press.<br />The film ends as a pregnant Sarah has gone to Mexico,and as she gets gas a kid takes a picture of her.It happens to be the same picture Reese was carrying of her when he first arrived in the past;the one given to him by John.<br />Well written and directed by Cameron,this film not only cemented Schwarzenegger`s career but also gave Cameron`s a much needed kick in the pants also.There are little moments of rest in this film,because its`very theme of being constantly pursued,negates it.That is what makes it purr along so well.Schwarzenegger does a great job in his role,and if you didn`t already know,this is the film from which his famous line,that everyone to this day still copies,comes from:``I`ll be back``.And as fate and the box office receipts would have it,Ah-nold WOULD be back for two more Terminators. It is unfortunate that the opening prologue mentions that the events portrayed are happening now,in 1984.This dates the film.It is too bad no one had the foresight to just say events transpire in 1984 or that this is simply present day.As an aside,Sarah`s roommate was Bess Mota,the star of the famous work out show of the 80s,The 20 minute Workout.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and for its age it looks darn good.Extras on this onedisc edition include the trailer and some old DVD ROM features.<br />All in all,this is the action movie that put Schwarzenegger on top and catapulted Cameron`s career along.The film moves along from beginning to end and has alot of heart stopping and thrilling moments throughout.4 solid stars.Recommended.disc edition include the trailer and some old DVD ROM features.<br />All in all,this is the action movie that put Schwarzenegger on top and catapulted Cameron`s career along.The film moves along from beginning to end and has alot of heart stopping and thrilling moments throughout.4 solid stars.Recommended.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is just OK.  You can view Home Page & Profile Page, but difficult to find comments on any post.  Also isn't always in date/time order.  Seems to be just a basic way to look at your Facebook account.  No games are accessible to play if you are a FB gamer.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|It was very visually pleasing as well as a great story about the life, love and pain of Mexican Artist Frida.

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Like a terrific train wreck or automobile crash that is hard to pass..., American Horror Story's Second Season makes one feel good about feeling ill at ease. The subject matter took a wild left turn from the first season's \\"gentle-by-comparison\\" offering - and plummeted to the deep sub-basement of which the worst things of nightmares are made.<br />  For the nightmare fans there is a wide assortment of goodies - Nazi's, Elizabethan embarrassing punishments and misery, blood - plenty of blood, and the given weird macabre \\"monkeying around with DNA/humans\\", not to forget the exorcizing of demons - legions of demons, of course. A caste of thousands!  A journey into the asylum-minded patients, along with the odd severed limb or two - for your tortured viewing pleasure!<br />  The returning actors from season one have done their homework well, and provide genuinely artistic performances.  Even before the closing credits, I'm more than anxious for the following week's fare.  Chomping at the bit (just like some of those in the cast - ha ha ha), this show has grabbed this reviewer's short and curlies'  held high for a jarring test of gravity.  The magic of the idea carries across seasons and, for the specific demographic, more than delivers. It compels, teases, holds a vise-grip on one's attention like a cold slap in the face.<br />  Watch it with a light on.  All the lights on.<br />  I will be eagerly among the first in line for the dvd/blu-ray, and hope for special features, many many special features!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its like a cheaper version of super Mario but much better for you. its so much fun and its very entertaining.

B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie hit me, hard. It touched me to my very core; it penetrated my soul, and my mind. The im-ages have not left me since I turned the dvd player off. What struck me about this was how much the Holocaust was empty to me before this. I think that the reason that I felt emptiness when studying the Holocaust previously when I wanted to feel pain and grief is that it lacked reality. My mind was pro-tecting itself from the horror, the sadness of the ruthless realities of the organized killing of millions. When I had previously studied the Holocaust, I was shown pictures, bombarded with numbers of the dead and exiled, struck by the written accounts, one after another, but for all the evidence, it wasn't real pain. It wasn't real death. It wasn't a tangible. That's why this movie hit me so hard. Even thinking about it transports me back and brings me close to tears again. It hit me so fully watching this movie, because every time I cried my mind would automatically try to comfort me by thinking \\"this is not real, this CANNOT be real.\\" but every time I would catch myself and remember that it was real, it was all real, and I cried. I felt. I hurt, and it felt so good to finally feel something about this event, which I had longed to feel something about ever since the first time I heard about it. I am so grateful for the pain that filled me at every heart wrenching moment, because it made me feel human. Like a human able to connect to the deaths of other humans.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great way to kill time.  makes you think but not too hard.  easy to navigate, walks you through the game with easy instructions.

B005779X4U|5.0|Very nice can. Convenient to have trash and recyclables together in a hands-free can. We are able to use regular 13 gallon trash bags from the grocery store - although the sample bags that came with the can did fit better. The lid closes quietly and can easily be made to stay open. Easy to keep clean.

B0063IH60K|3.0|Really enjoy playing this game! Hate the pop up ads but that's why its free. So I look at the ads.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Just as great as the previous four sessions. The only downer aspect is the Graphical User interface to get to each episode.
B0089ZZXX2|5.0|I watched the movie because I'm a sucker for \\"True Stories\\" or \\"Based On True Events\\" and I wanted to be Marine or a Navy Seal.  The entire movie was very moving. Being a former police officer, I understand and liked the way they showed what most don't think about. These guys have families and lives just like we do, and their not just soldiers. And if the boat scene at the end of the extraction scene doesn't get your adrenalin and patriotic juices flowing, nothing will!! That to me is my simile of these guy for the United States. They put their lives on the line to save us with some serious cover fire!!!
B008YJFDQK|4.0|Impressive career-spanning collection of Ben's ballads, mostly songs of his own composition.  The selection showcases his folky, contemplative side, and includes his finest love songs.
B006OFN0SE|2.0|For my taste I would have enjoyed more historical content. There was some, but the story was more of a personal soap opera dealing with Hoover's personal problems. It seemed to focus so much on the negative and abnormal characteristics of his life. It leaves questions as to accuracy.
B009AMANBA|2.0|I looked forward to seeing this brand new film.  I am interesting in history and figured that because Stephen Spielburg was involved with this script and there was so much publicity for it that I was going to love it.  I sure was disappointed.<br /><br />From the beginning which started on a battlefield with Abraham Lincoln and two Union soldiers (one black and one white) making politically correct statements and reciting the Gettysburg address, I must say I raised an eyebrow.  The rest of the film supposedly reenacted Abraham Lincoln's political genius in getting the Emancipation Proclamation through Congress.  It was all about the compromises and political persuasion it took.  We all know how this all turned out of course.<br /><br />The acting was excellent even though Daniel-Day Lewis doesn't really look like Abraham Lincoln.  But as far as I'm concerned it was Tommy Lee Jones cast as Thaddeus Stevens whose performance was the most outstanding.<br /><br />Sally Field was cast as Lincoln's wife but I think the screenwriters went much too far in making her sound like a modern feminist.  I found myself reacting negatively every time she opened her mouth.<br /><br />I also think that the trailer for the film which included a battle scene was misleading.  This was not a film about the War in the field.  It was a about a political war played out in Congress and the audience needed to follow the political arguments between the different factions.<br /><br />I wasn't planning on falling asleep but I found myself dozing off several times which does not make this a film that I\\"m anxious to recommend.  As I like to read about politics though I will probably read the book.
B007X4ECMI|2.0|Stop me if you've heard this one: President's daughter gets caught in a very bad place teeming with criminals and convicts.  A known felon gets blackmailed into helping get her out.  Yes, Snake Plissken did it all before in \\"Escape From New York,\\" but Lockout puts a twist on things by moving the action...to SPAAAACE!<br /><br />It seems CIA agent Snow (Guy Pearce) has been framed the murder of undercover agent Frank Armstrong, who in turn had uncovered evidence of a mole within the space program selling state secrets.  When U.S. President Warnock's daughter Emilie (Maggie Grace) attends a space penitentiary known as Maximum Security (MS) One to determine if putting prisoners into stasis is cruel and unusual punishment, things go horribly awry.  SPOIEROUT: And by horribly awry I mean plot-bendingly stupid, in which her secret service bodyguard decides the best way to defend the president's daughter is to be on the side of the glass with a prisoner, and -- for reasons that only make sense to the writers -- a canister of highly explosive gas is stored directly behind the interrogation room.  Can you see where this is going? It all leads up to lots of explosions, Emilie in trouble, and Snow drafted to save her.<br /><br />The plot manages to be unpredictable thanks to Hydell (Joseph Gilgun) and the ethical question of the President's personal interest in saving his daughter balanced against the possibility of a mass prison escape. Then again, this is a movie with a trailer that states with utter sincerity:<br /><br />\\"There's only one man who can get her out.  Snow.  He's the best there is. But he's a loose cannon.\\"<br /><br />Get that? Snow is the best there is, BUT HE'S A LOOSE CANNON!<br /><br />\\"Lockout\\" keeps piling on the silliness as the plot shambles along, complete with an automated defense system that's highly effective at keeping people out but pretty terrible at keeping people in.  What were the architects worried about, space pirates?  And if so, demonstrating the threat of space pirates might have made the whole bristling prison gunship premise a little easier to swallow.<br /><br />Without Snow's witty banter with Emilie \\"Lockout\\" be nothing but a derivative hunk of space junk. This film is just lazy.  But it will make you wonder how the mastermind behind \\"The Fifth Element\\" managed to stoop so low. Here's hoping Luc Besson escapes wherever he's locked up.ing the threat of space pirates might have made the whole bristling prison gunship premise a little easier to swallow.<br /><br />Without Snow's witty banter with Emilie \\"Lockout\\" be nothing but a derivative hunk of space junk.

B0083P1QUM|1.0|Cornwell was once one of my favorite authors. Her first decade? of books were page turners. No more. Perhaps her new readers will be as excited about the announcement of one of her new novels as I once was. I think the turning point was when she wrote the &#34;Jack the Ripper&#34; book. I feel as though (not saying it is so) that someone else is writing. Not the Cornwell I once knew. Could be that I've just read to many.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|I thought I knew all these songs?! In the beginning I was in shock but the more I listened to the album the more I appreciated the effort that went into this production. Kylie has musically rearranged most of the songs on this album.  I was fascinated by the changes she put into the songs. Abbey Road Sessions proves that Kylie's creative juices are still flowing. This is a MUST HAVE album for Kylie fans that know her music.<br /><br />Now to the quality of the recording.  Kylie's recordings have usually been very high quality.  The clarity, dynamics(bass punch), arrangements are usually top notch.  An example?  Light Years  This recording goes one better.  Her vocals are so alive it sounds like she's singing right in front of you.  The best her voice has ever sounded in my opinion.<br /><br />Love Always For Kylie!
B005S9ELM6|5.0|\\"Argo\\" is what happens when real life is more bizarre than any movie plot -- which is why it makes for such a good film.  The death of our American ambassador in Libya is a reminder that the geopolitical instability of yesteryear is still an ever-present threat today.<br /><br />Ben Affleck succinctly sums up the state of affairs in Iran: the United States backed a brutal Shah who seeks asylum in the U.S. amidst a revolution and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini.  The U.S. embassy is subsequently overrun by an angry mob, and we experience every nail-biting moment as the crowd smashes through the American embassy's defenses and takes everyone hostage. Everyone, that is, except for six terrified employees who decide to make a run for it.  Part of the thrill of \\"Argo\\" is determining whether or not the six refugees were better off as a result.<br /><br />The subsequent daring escape plan that ensues is nothing less than a full propaganda assault.  Communication professionals know how this works and it's clear Affleck does too -- the CIA isn't just creating the illusion of a film crew, it's projecting the cynicism of a decaying Hollywood (so aptly on display in the wrecked iconic sign) that lures secret police and foreign ministers with the possibility of money and fame.<br /><br />And so the plot unfolds: a fake director, a fake producer, a fake film crew, and very real stakes. Part of the film within a film's reveal is the appeal of its plot: \\"Argo\\" is not just a space opera ripping off \\"Star Wars,\\" it's about the will of the people rising up against a brutal dictator to preserve their way of life. The secret of Hollywood is that every lie is grounded in a basic truth, and it's upon that tiny truth that balances the lives of six refugees and one CIA agent.<br /><br />Ironically, that plot was actually drawn from another film entirely that never made it into \\"Argo.'\\" Titled \\"Lords of Light,\\" it was a screenplay by Barry Ira Geller based on sci-fi author Roger Zelazny's award-winning novel of the same name.  But Geller had even bigger plans, enlisting famous comic book artist Jack Kirby to create plans for a sci-fi theme park called Science Fiction Land.<br /><br />In short, even fiction is stranger than fiction. Although \\"Argo\\" certainly dramatizes the events, it's a compelling and entertaining reminder that the world is a complicated place.award-winning novel of the same name.

0547391005|5.0|This book is so fantastic.  It's so nice to have all the original George stories together, and it's so brightly colored and beautifully printed.  The copy I received has been extremely durable so far.<br /><br />Also, a lot of people complained about the size and weight of the book, but it's really not unmanageable.  I took the jacket off (the cover is bright and attractive all on its own) and that helps a lot because it makes the book less slippery.  It's about the size of any large picture book, and only somewhat heavier.  My 19 month baby has no problem picking it up, carrying it around, or flipping through the pages.  Granted, he is big for his age, but he's never dropped it on his toe or had any trouble with it.  So I think people might be exaggerating or being a wee bit overprotective when they say you can't just put it on the shelf and let the child take it down themselves.  I mean, maybe I wouldn't put it on a really high shelf, but as I say it hasn't been any trouble for a toddler not even two years old.

Make no mistake that Radical Jihadist are trying to enter this country to do harm to you, me and your sons and daughters.<br /><br />There is no line in the sand, there are no innocent folks, everyone is an infidel to them and they will do EVERYTHING they can to destroy the western world.<br /><br />This movie, shows what SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMANDO's are doing daily to protect the USA from these folks. As you can see, the problem is a global threat, not just one singular country.<br /><br />I've been downrange and worked with these \\"SPECIAL FEW\\" who do this type of work. This movie, by far, is the best depiction of what it means to be a SPECIAL WARFARE FIGHTER in the US MILITARY.

B003LL3NOK|2.0|What popular zombie series features the dregs of law and order intruding in an idyllic farming community led by a stalwart patriarch holding a terrible undead secret in his barn?  Before The Walking Dead did it, George A. Romero's \\"Survival of the Dead\\" did it first.<br /><br />Our crew of formerly upstanding citizens includes Sergeant Nicotine Crockett (Alan van Sprang), Kenny (Eric Woolfe), Francisco (Stefano Colacitti) and Tomboy (Athena Karkanis).  The farmstead is led by two rival patriarchs: Patrick O'Flynn (Kenneth Welsh) who believes all zombies should be killed and Seamus Muldoon (Richard Fitzpatrick) who believes all zombies should be protected until a cure is found. SPOILER OF THE DEAD: There's also Patrick's twin daughters, Janet (Kathleen Munroe) and Jane (played by, uh, Kathleen Munroe).<br /><br />Our ragtag band of warriors are less interested in politics and more in survival, but it's not long before they are caught up in the conflict between the O'Flynns and Muldoons.  Characters die, zombies bite, and the two rival families continue their civil war despite the apocalypse raging on around them.  Depending on your perspective, this either makes their hatred of each other truly spectacular or spotlights just how petty their rivalry really is.<br /><br />Romero, who at this point seems to be shambling through his own zombie films, adds a few new touches to the genre he helped invent.  But mostly this is a film about two Irish guys acting like anachronistic Hatfields and McCoys, pursuing some vendetta that no longer makes any sense to anybody, including the audience.  It all feels a little pointless, and Romero is only too happy to leave things that way.<br /><br />As the latest chapter in Romero's zombie series it's a bit more effective -- everyone seems to think escaping to an Island is the ideal way to restart humanity, but as \\"Survival of the Dead\\" makes clear, humanity's biggest problem is itself.  It's too bad Romero had to resort to stereotypes to make his point.to make his point.
B005LAII08|5.0|I've been trying to understand why some seem to be lukewarm about BRAVE.  Some would like to see the beginning cut so that the action starts sooner, I would say that you'd miss the exposition if it wasn't there.  I, for one, enjoyed every minute of it.  Some have said that the backgrounds were too realistic, I think the backgrounds (and all the animation) is just incredibly beautiful.  I would agree with the sentiment that it would have been nice to see more of the mother/daughter interaction, but then the movie would have been too long for the younger kids.  It's there appropriately, but when the mother and daughter's relationship changes it could have been a slower process and I'd have enjoyed it because I'm at an age where I can enjoy the subtle changes.  A ten-year-old wouldn't like that so I can understand the choice.  I've read all the negative reviews, but I just don't agree.  BRAVE is a great film.<br /><br />As for this 5-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition - It's fine.  I would have liked a sound remix for the 2 channel Dolby.  The dialogue is slightly too weak or the musical soundtrack too loud.  But if you aren't listening to the film on internal TV speakers then you're fine.  It's all great and nothing too terribly distracting.  It's great that Disney included so many extras.  That makes buying these versions worth the extra $$.  I couldn't care less about the 3D, but it's there if I care to watch it.  But I honestly never do.
0307591549|5.0|There are many reviews out there so I won't get into the 7 principles.  What I can say is I felt happy when I read this book.  I was so profoundly affected by the book that I did a synopsis (10.5 pages!) on it to try to drive home the principles.  I truly believe that happiness really is just a state of mind and this book completely backed that up.  Happiness begins with each one of us and it is totally contagious!  Who couldn't use more happiness in their lives??  I find myself using these principles for other things - change management being one of them and guess what, they work!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Generally a very entertaining read, with a unique writing style that although somewhat obnoxious at first, gradually grows on you. Each character is told through a fairly distinct language and vocabulary, although the further you get the less distinct it begins to feel. While I do see connection between 5 of the 6 stacked stories that is beyond the obvious birthmark, I do feel like that connection is weaker than it could be, and I totally do not see a connection with Cavendish at all, leading me to wonder if I missed something. Perhaps there is a connection that those with a more liberal arts background will pick up on, but I will content myself that my money was well spent and left me wishing for more.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|Killers latest, Battle Born is a good listen. Brandon & band continue in their distinctive establsihed sound. You are either a fan of The Killers and accept that with each release comes maturity and a slight change from previous releases or you just don't like them. I am a fan and love Brandon's voice(which is stronger than ever) and some of the risks he takes. Hot Mess was a classic first release. They are not the same bad as they were back then. They are better.  There are a few slower temp sngs on here but for the most part the CD moves along at a great pace and I didn't find myself bored with any of the songs. I'm happy to add this to my Killers collection.
B008OE05IG|5.0|The really interesting thing, to me, about Jiro Dreams of Sushi is that it could have been about nearly any craft. There are details about the rice and fish and all that, but really, the film is about the dying art of the specialist. These days, we jump from career to career and hobby to hobby. The idea of doing one thing, over and over for 75 years of your life, is nearly unheard of. We like to fancy ourselves Renaissance men, doing lots of things and knowing a little about each of them. Here is a man who knows nearly everything a person could know about how to do one thing brilliantly well. It's an interesting trade-off, and one that is presented with all of its advantages and disadvantages, including the fact that like any obsessive, he was not the most attentive parent. But it's still incredibly admirable to see someone concentrate on being the best at one thing instead of adequate at many.

To me ths is a full retrospective. I know other fans feel some songs were left out but I am more then happy with this release as it captures Westlife from the beginning to now. I didn't have the ablity to purchase there single releases that is why I opted for the Greatest Hits. Well worth it. Enjoy!!

Thanks to the US Festival and  MTV Judas Priest could not get any bigger. Included in this killer re-mastered CD is the DVD from the US Festival(Riverside, CA) which I never thught would see the light of day. Pretty good quality considering the technology back then.

B008G12ERC|5.0|I don't know where to begin with regards to reviewing The 2nd Law. From the opening Bond styled, &#34;Supremacy&#34; to the confusing, yet stunning suprise adventerous song, &#34;Madness&#34; - Muse takes me on a ride I have not been on before and I don't want to get off. As of 11/18/12 this is my favorite CD of the year. Every song is a journey and I did not want this CD to end. I have read that some Muse fans do not like the song, &#34;Liquid State&#34;. For me, it is my all time favorite Muse song, Bassist Chris Wolstenholme takes over vocals and delivers a way to short sonic boom. It rocks like no other Muse song does and clearly stands out from the rest of the songs. The final songs, The 2nd Law:Unsustainable & Isolated System, reminds me a bit of what the Eurythmic's were doing on their lone soundtrack release, &#34;1984&#34;. Sampling news casts to a throbbing techno wizardry keyboard bonanza. Muse' use of strings never fails to amaze me.They come in  at the right moment to bring you back to earth before shooting you into the stratosphere. The 2nd Law is a masterpiece. One that people will look back at and think, How did they do all of that on one CD? I don't like to categorize bands. Some bands fall into obvious categories. Muse is undefinable and this CD just ads to their legacy. I hope there is more of The 2nd Law to come. If 10 stars were an option, it would be a 10. I have sent this CD to 5 friends. Not as gifts but just so they could experience this inredible CD and band. I can't wait for the live show in January. Cheers & Enjoy!

0374531269|4.0|I feel grateful to Ishmael Beah for having the courage to express in words such a vivid description of the events that tore his childhood apart.  It hope that the process of writing his memoirs was cathartic, and perhaps that the physical distance and the passage of time offer some healing.<br /><br />Ishmael's book succeeds wholly in reliving the events as he experienced them, swept up by the ruthless civil war in Sierra Leone in the 1990s.  The strength of the narrative lies in Ishmael's ability to recount how it felt to live as a drug-induced killer.  The recollection of his headaches, nightmares, and flashbacks are compelling.<br /><br />The caveat to the book is that readers should not expect an explanation of Sierra Leone's conflict more generally.  Unfortunately, Ishmael breaks with his engaging style and includes a \\"chronology\\" chapter, which reads oddly like a wikipedia entry on Sierra Leone's history and thus presents a striking mismatch from the rest of the book.  That chapter should have been omitted or woven in to the story.  In that respect I wonder if Ishmael might have benefited from a collaboration with an experienced biography writer, as in Tracy Kidder's account of a young man's survival in Burundi in Strength in What Remains.<br /><br />The author's trip to speak at the UN is a fitting climax, especially since it's the point at which Ishmael begins to broaden his perspective beyond his country's war and to see issues related to child soldiers globally.  Yet Ishmael's point is diluted somewhat by his distracted awe at New York City's snow, city lights, white people, and tall buildings.  Like other 4-star reviewers I would have appreciated a bit more exploration of how the author went through the painful process of forging a new identity as an ex-soldier, as a student and as an emigrant.  Perhaps that is Ishmael's sequel, in which case I look forward to it.

Even with all of the research into the work that went into this album I was not even remotely prepared for what I was about to hear . . . pure Soundgarden creativity.<br /><br />Overall I have to say that I am deeply satisfied with the new album! As a typical Soundgarden creation, each track is identifiable among the rest with unique tunings and time signatures (and yes, Cornell can still belt out those notes!). I currently have the entire album on repeat and I just can't get enough!

B004CEUEWE|4.0|I have spilled much ink talking about the corner boy society that I grew up in 1950s Olde Saco (that's up in Maine for those interested) where some hard-ass (and soft-ass too) corner boys ripped up the imaginations of wanna-bes like me and my corner boys  who hung around, soft-ass hung around, Mama's Pizza Parlor over on Atlantic Avenue, waiting, well, waiting for some  breathe of fresh air, maybe coming in from the nearby ocean to wash over us and take out of that red scare cold war night. In the meantime we hung out, doing a little of this and a little of that, some stuff legal other stuff well, let's just leave it as other stuff. So on any given night, mostly weekends, from about junior high school on you could find us in those environs playing pinball on Mama's back room machine, the Madame LaRue busty ladies pictured on the scoreboard begging you to play for their favors, play fiercely although empty-handedly (except those seventeen free games you racked up in your, ah, frenzy to please Madame). Or when rock and roll threw its fresh breathe over us we tossed many quarters to hear the latest songs about twelve times straight and hoped that certain shes came in to listen and maybe help make us those selections. Or, on some dark night, we might just be found doing our midnight creep around the neighborhood in order to make ends meet, that little of this and that stuff mentioned early.<br /><br />As high school turned to work world ,or maybe college world, the old corner boy society, or our generation's chapter of it, went in several difference directions, some good some not so good, including those like the legendary Big Red Dubonnet who graduated to armed robberies of gas stations, liquor stores and Shawshank. Yah, Big Red was tough (I once saw him chain-whip, mercilessly chain-whip, a guy for the simple error of being on the wrong corner, Red's, while breathing), was pretty smart, in a street smart way, knew a couple of things about the world and, and, be stillmy heart, let me have some free Madame LaRue games after he had racked up a ton and needed to take care of some ever present girl business.<br /><br />And that is where memories of Big Red and the characters that inhabit The Town intersect in my mind. See Big Red, the late Big Red now, never could find anything better in this whole wide world than being king hell king of the corner boy night. But that takes dough, and so you either work the work-a-day world with the squares or go where the dough is- for Big Red in Podunk gas stations and liquors stores and the guys like Doug and Jem who lead their peoples, their Charlestown corner boy peoples, banks, and other high-stakes projects. Thus this film held me, held me in the thought that for a minute back in the 1950s, hell, more than a minute, I could have been lured to the life, no sweat. And while this film gets wound up in little bizarre love interest between Doug and one of the bank victims and some serious literary license on what was what in that old time Boston Irish neighborhood, Charlestown (where the guys were so tough that even tough guys from Southie, South Boston, had second thoughts about tangling with them, these grown-up corner boys were very recognizable.<br /><br />Oh yah, I don't know how true the code of omerta (silence) still is in Charlestown (or Southie, or about seventeen other places where corner boys, some corner boys anyway go on to the life) but I am willing to believe that it is honored more in the breech than the observance. At least it was in Podunk.  How do you think they (and you know who the they is just like in film, the cops from the locals to the feds) got the lead that got Big Red after he knocked over the biggest liquor store in Portland that last time before they clipped his wings?
1451620829|1.0|I just finished this book and I must say it's left a sour taste in my mouth. It just goes to show that fame and fortune have absolutely nothing to do with developing a sense of self worth. While it's obvious that Criss was mistreated, it's also obvious that his answer to being mistreated is to dish out embarrassing info and humiliate those who mistreated him. This is how feuds never end--poison for poison. He seems to excuse his selfish behavior basically by saying \\"but look how I was treated\\" over and over and over. His supposed betrayal by Ace is based upon Ace calling him to his room as a friend and saying that he felt bad that he was making more money (a fact that he would never have otherwise known) and says he is still struggling with forgiving him for that. But then he slams Gene and Paul for being \\"all about money\\"! Aside from that, I hope he realizes how ridiculous it sounds to a middle class person to hear him whining over 40k per show!<br />The sleaze mentioned in this book is sickening and I'm really sorry that I read it. Ace once possibly performed an \\"act\\" on Criss? Gene smells bad? These are the light ones! But I guess if you want to sell books (money again) you have to throw all the trash you can in to attract the Jerry Springer types. I bought it as a fan and frankly, I feel stupid for having done so.

I think the beginning is the total best - the battle at the end keeps the guys entertained - but for me the sections when they run at night thru the forest are so much like scuba diving that I could just rewind and watch over and over again. It's a good story (not new, not surprising, but so beautifully filmed), and the quality of the visuals - in 3D or just even in regular DVD mode are so high that it's worth buying to show off your system.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|But from an artist who grew up in Austin, that's what I should have expected. I don't want to go through every song and write about what I did and didn't like, but if you thought this guy was the future of blues, he probably isn't. It's good music, nonetheless, but a bit more polished and produced than I was expecting based on &#34;When My Train Comes In&#34;, the one song I heard on the local alt-radio station.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|the game play is simple but since its random every time it doesn't get boring.  and all the upgrades are attainable without spending money or some truly ridiculous amount of time. the missions keep it challenging.
1451695187|5.0|This book continues to exceed my expectations.  I was worried that this book might be filled with images of fluffy clouds and bright lights.  The author combines medicine, science and his experience to weave a store that captures and compels the reader to continue to the next page.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Ok - kinda silly story line. And it's not a new story, just a new take on an old story. But - when I had the best buy geek squad over to install my 3D TV - this is the movie they grabbed to test the system. Says something about the quality of the 3D. It's amazing. It absolutely works for this movie. The clarity is amazing - you totally feel immersed in the beauty of the images. Get it on sale - add to your collection, just don't admit you like it.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My daughter loved her Wubbanub pacifier.  She had 3 in total and we never lost any of them.  She was able to put the pacifier in and our of her mouth at a young age- and she enjoyed cuddling with the stuffed animal.<br /><br />Wubbanub also has really good customer service- when my daughter started teething she was really rough on her pacifiers and the pacifier started tearing off the animal.  The company mailed us a replacement for free.<br /><br />We also found them simple to clean.  When the stuffed animal got dirty (beyond spot cleaning) we put them in the washing machine.  We laid them out to dry and they were fluffy and as good as new.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|The guys are sooo HOT.  It also has a good story line.  Love the blueray format.  Going to have a girl's nite so my friends can enjoy it, too.  Thanks.
B00946ZOT8|5.0|An excellent addition to any Twilight collection. Be a true fan and collect the whole family, but keep them away from the kids!
B005BCE7FQ|4.0|It appeares easier to make animated movies 3D - and this is a good example of the high end of the 3D animated movie spectrum. My 12 year old grand-daugther totally loved it - I thought it was cute.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoy this app. It has helped to monitor my battery usage.<br />I recommend everyone download and install.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great book I would read it again and again if I had tim. I loved all the spicy romance
B003TSEL7S|5.0|like all the kids in my school i instantly fell in love with the book i should resd the rest of the series. i can see why the book series is so popular its really good.
B004G600A4|5.0|This was a gift so I have not seen it but the child I gave this to, loved it.and is very happy to own it.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|Philip K. Dick was (and is) a brilliant innovator who combined science and spirituality in startling ways.  This is one of his best books on an oft-repeated theme of &#34;What is reality?&#34; The &#34;ageing&#34; of objects by reversion to prior archetypal forms is amazing, as is the notion of &#34;half-life.&#34; This book is both frightening and exhilarating.
B0018OFN4U|5.0|If you love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, this is your kind of movie. Extremely funny, lots of surprises, Timothy Dalton..it's one of my favorites. Maybe I'll have a festival today, and watch this one, &#34;Paul&#34;, and &#34;Hot Fuzz&#34; again.  My 12 year old grandson dressed as Shaun of the Dead for Halloween one year!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Firstly, let me send my very sincere & heart felt sympathy & understanding to all those many, many who've received damaged vinyl of this release. Sooooooo many are reporting these warped, off center, noisy surface discs that there appears to me to be a very serious quality control issue here. That said...I personally waited outside my favorite Sunrise record store in Toronto, 2 hours early Dec 13th, to be first in line to get my Beatles Box. Mine has original shipping styrofoam, well packed, came perfect, box label says... shipped by Sony on 10/09\12. I was lucky to have virtually every record in perfect condition, with small exception of first song on side 2 of Revolver had a visible scratch, resulting in a few rotating pops, not a big deal at all, very minor thing. Which brings my main point...there are an endless variety of Beatle fans out there, some love analog, some digital, mp3, hi-res, mono, stereo, etc...some like me love vinyl, also just love great sounding music & know the difference between bad & good. I'm sure many are like me who are blown away by at least 2 things on this set, great sound, clear vocals, hearing details we \\"never\\" heard before, but most importantly, owning mint brand new Beatles vinyl of ALL 14 albums! WOW! My other Beatles LP's are all used copies, some stereo, some mono, but most very scratched up, that's what's commonly available in used vinyl stores in Toronto and I'm sure to many others out there. Unless one is 60 plus, has original pressings kept mint, or inherited them, or has a LOT of money to buy pristine originals, this is an absotulely terrific 2012 opportunity to get mint Beatles vinyl. I'm proof there are perect copies of this box that exist as I have one. I just hope & pray that all of you that truly want them in your heart, to sound great like I have them, can get them, & problem free. Keep the faith!
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|I really loved this cd a lot!! I ordered both cds because I couldn't find them at any store, which sucked!! LOL!!  I watch Big Time Rush on tv a lot and I really like their music too!! I also have two BTR posters on my door in my room!
0670058971|5.0|This is a vital picture book - perfect  even for tiny babies. The rhythms of the words quickly become familiar and even the tiniest babies can be grabbed by them. It was the first book my grand-daughter really responded to after only hearing it a very few times. She was a only few weeks old. Read slowly, exaggerating the word rhythms and the child becomes absorbed. The illustrations are so clever and detailed and charming, the adult reader can end up being just as absorbed. I always seem to discover something new in those pictures. They create a world you can get lost in. This book is like Wild Things, and Lion in the Meadow in being one of those books that no baby should grow up without.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|The songs are extremely well done and varied.  This is the 1st Wallflower CD I own and well worth it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|You can just change the kindle device time zone to get more coins and then you do not need to wait
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|I really liked this cd, and Big Time Rush is a very great boyband!! I listened to it quite a few times already!! GO BTR!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Highly entertaining. This book is action packed with a bit of a Mad Max survival flair. Full of emotion and beautiful descriptions keeping my attention the entire time.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Wild(From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail)-I thought she was totally umprepared for the trip but pursued and grew. Made my feet hurt to read about her boots.
1451695195|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book! Wonderful expansion of Raymond Moody's work, adding the elements of documentation of 'brain death' plus his own scientific scepticism. A natural story-telling ability makes this book one that is difficult to put down.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Reliable and useful application that I use daily. Can be used to create notes but also as a storage syztem for materials found on the WEB.
B008Y76A5A|5.0|This movie is a delightful comedy about how men and women cope with relationships, by not having an emotional one, but a physical one in its place.  The irony is the humor involved when you you the viewer realizes it's not possible and the characters are unaware of it.<br />A great movie.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|this app is awesome.  for those if us who have a hard time sleeping, this app helps me sleep without tylenol pm.  its got like 80 sounds to choose from.  love love love. you can set it to play for as short or long as you like and multiple sounds if you want.  i just set the tmer for 8 hours and i can get some decent shut eye :)
0891419063|5.0|I watched the HBO series, THE PACIFIC and loved it. But there is no way that televsion and special effects can capture the pure and absolute horror the Marines faced on Pelileu and Okinawa like E.B. Sledge does in this book. The Japanese soldiers were formidable enemies. The Marines, Sailors and Soldiers literally had to fight for every yard on the battlefield. Reading this story made me truly appreciate the high cost the United States military paid for victory in WWII. E.B. Sledge shows just how much the human body can endure when it has no other choice. I recommend this book to every military member and every person considering joining the military.
B0081BU42O|3.0|I'm a fan of Banks. I think I've read all his earlier Culture books. This one had all the elements of a typical Culture novel. I liked the discussion of subliming. This is long been an element of Culture novels but not with as central a role. I got tired of the main character Cossont. She sort of lurched around the novel in an uninteresting way. She was basically a helpless pawn. The problem with trying to describe a level VIII technology is that it's so advanced that all sense of jeopardy is effectively lost. The fact that you can back up people so that even if they die they can be resurrected is problematic for reader identification. Any injuries short of death can be easily fixed. Even the ships are too powerful although I like the the various names and droll conversations.<br /><br />Neal Asher has the same problem with his Cormac series but he solves it in a much more interesting and fun way with all his various alien races both current and in the past.<br /><br />I love space opera so I will keep reading. This one was better than Matter.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I'm like the other viewers, this is a copy cat...but with kids added.  I bought the book out of a book store on vacation trying to relax and get some ideas from one of the GREAT authors whose books turn into movies...UNBELIEVABLE! Go watch Sleeping with the Enemy if you want to know about this book.  I think his best and only book that I thought should have made a movie did not...so somebody is getting props where props are not deserved.<br />Lisa Rose, Author
B006CQLGXG|5.0|The best Christmas short story ever written. It's so great to be able to read it anywhere in a convenient format, even in the dark which makes the story spookier.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|jetpack joyride is the best game and I love it because it is not just a game it is a great game
B00914JWSW|5.0|This is a wonderful, even stunning, array of outtakes from Streisand's vaults. The range is amazing, from the mournful \\"I Think it's Gonna Rain Today\\" to the primal lift of \\"Being Good Isn't Good Enough\\"; from the ethereal \\"How Are Things in Glocca Morra\\" to the surprisingly effective country-tinged \\"Try to Win a Friend\\". A must for any Streisand fan, and a worthy choice for those who are less enthusiastic fans. Bravo!
B0039TD7PY|4.0|This was a gift for my mother, but I decided to give it a listen, and now it is on repeat on my ipod. Great live performance!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Works great, doesn't take up much memory or slow my Kindle down. In todays world a good  security suite is essential. If you want peace of mind surfing the web, making purchases, opening email, etc., get avast now !

B0000714BP|5.0|This came quickly with no problems and in great shape. The DVD works beautifully ^_^ I would defiantly do business again.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|The best of the series and finally the first two books are to be published in English.... Can't wait!! And just discovered Harry's last name is pronounced Hooley!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I ididn't expect much from this movie but the ride was really fun. The cast played well off eachother and the storyline was actually interesting. Adding &#34;The Rock&#34; to the cast helped make the storyline more exciting. The scenes of Brazil were nice and the music was good.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning what happened on the mission that brought down Osama Bin Laden.  I enjoyed it greatly.
B008COD5OO|4.0|Really funny. Watched if several times in the forty-eight hours I had rented it for. I suggest you rent it.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I think I have read every publihed work of John Grisham and always eagerly await his next effort. This one was not close to his usual quality. The main character was not likable, and the plot was hard to follow. In an effort to complicate movements of people, money, gold, etc., it just all got screwed up. The reader is kept in the dark until the end, where a lame jailhouse explanation was added. Grisham has been a favorite for years, so it is with regret that I would not recommend this book.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|just a fun movie to watch. I didn't expect a lot when I purchased the movie but it was a fun watch. Don't take it too seriously. It is full of fun and action.
B008HB34I4|5.0|This is not religious at all - in fact you might call it anti-organized religion.  Great flick - entertaining - not a momemt slow - but very interesting.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|Really Disney/Pixar?????  You think our children need to see the naked butts of animated grown men???  Please don't do that anymore.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is moving faster and I am loving every minute. If you love zombies you'll love this season for sure!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am unsure of where all they hype of this book as come from. It is poorly written and repetitive. I was disappointed and I had to force myself to even finish it. Needless to say I will not read the other ones and I do not recommend this book  and suggest you not give into the hype and waste the money.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is Physics  This is done soooooo well<br /><br />Give it a try and you will be hooked  get all 3 stars  you can  be patince
B005H29GSI|1.0|My mother and I bought the \\"on thin ice\\" game for my niece.  She is five years old and loves angry birds.  Just for the giggles of it, we cracked it open to give it a test.  We both thought the idea was really good, however there was one problem- the launcher is absolutely useless.  The bird either flies straight up or it only flies a few inches.  We could not imagine how a 5 year old would be able to figure out the mechanics of it.  Perhaps I might be able to macguyver a slingshot that would work better.  Either way, this game is virtually unplayable.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I knew I had to get this album! Alt-J was introduced to me by a great Seattle radio station called KEXP. When \\"Taro\\" came across the airwaves, I was all too ready for something new. For the most part I was impressed with the dynamic lyricism and unusual vocals--I just couldn't get them out of my head! Alt-J literally transformed a gory war-time story into a tragic, poignant love story :) If you take the trouble to seek out the context of some of their other songs, you'll see their penchant for putting that unique spin on things, and I LOVE IT! The only thing I  wish I'd done before purchasing the album was to also purchase a great set of headphones so I could listen to every detail of their multi-layered musicality. So, listen to this album for the first time with a good sound system, or you might miss something amazing.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the 1st book and this one as well.  Great storyline and it keeps you reading long into the night. Can't wait for the 3rd.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Timer refill will get annoying if you are only playing this game. Wish you could easily revise older parts of your city later in the game.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|No excitement or suspense. A dull weak plot. Many of his earlier works are much better. Very disappointing after such a long wait.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|great app to pass time with but it crashes my device, doesn't. include all settings and achievements, and the prices are high.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This novel keeps you interested throughout.  The characters are interesting and you don't quite know what is going to happen next.  The writing style is easy to read and the sci-fi story keeps you glued.<br /><br />As the books progress the characters change and i was worried I would get attached to a character and not care about the next.  This did not happen what so ever.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|VERY, VERY INTERESTING, THOUGHT PROVOKING AND HARD TO PUT DOWN.  I DEFINITELY THINK IT IS WORTH ONE'S TIME AND HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO SEVERAL PEOPLE.
B00013M6NK|5.0|just what I needed and at a great price, my old battery had failed to hold a charge right in the middle of my last trip.

B000QQFKYE|5.0|Since purchasing this movie I have watched it several times. There are many different interpretations of exactly what is going on (as with most David Lynch films), but what I love about his films, this on especially, is that you don't have to fully understand it to enjoy it. There are sections of this movie that I have watched on their own several times. It's almost as if you could break the movie down into several short films and still be satisfied.<br /><br />Now, having said that, I did not find the three hours to be too long at all!! It felt very seamless to me in it's pace. I am a HUGE David Lynch fan. But one thing that I loved about Inland Empire was that it was not overly graphic. There are no graphic sex scenes, the F word is used occasionally but not pervasive, and the violence is tame. Even though I am a Huge Lynch fan, I find sometimes that he can go a little overboard with some graphic scenes. That is not the case here. Inland Empire was very tastefully done! It shows a more subtle side of David Lynch.<br /><br />However, it still contains Lynch's trademark quirky/disturbing/darkly funny/unsettling feeling that we know and love. This movie is a must for any Lynch fan or any fan of creative film-making.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I would honestly be embarrassed to recommend this to anyone.  Its a porno with a plot that doesn't reveal itself until about halfway in.  I feel obligated to finish the series just for some closure.  This book took me back to a very dark in my own life and reminded me of exactly why I married my husband and not any of the controlling exboyfriends of my younger years.<br /><br />Terrible writing, annoying overuse of 2 or 3 key phrases which the author modifies slightly and aside from the attention to detail in the sex parts, there is no real description given to much else.<br /><br />This can only be a best seller because most of America is sexually frustrated.  Otherwise it just doesn't make sense for this to be so popular.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This completes the story, a nail biting,compulsive,read. The characters, their personal and shared horrors, the twists in the plots become very personal.5 star read.
B0084AYLK8|1.0|Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit. Suggest you try another kindle version.
B0030B624E|5.0|...the best movie every made. It's perfect. Coming of age story with zombies--what more could be said? Stylish, well-paced and endearing.
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|This is the album that made the groop.  It is a masterpeice.  Tuesday afternoon and nights in white satien are the best known
B001IF252M|4.0|Works well, but the tiny screws on the side didnt screw in to my vga cable. So it unplugs on its own every once and a while, and then it messed with the screen resolution on my mac. But i just changed it via the recomended resolution. So again minor problems, but overall no lag and clarity is sharp. So decent product.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Kept me laughing throughout the movie.<br />Really enjoyed it.  The local pub, the romantically inept, and the zombies chomping down on family and friends - what's not to enjoy.
0385535147|3.0|I'm not big fiction fan but I thought I'd give this one a chance.  The storyline takes a while for Grisham to develop, therefore, the reader must give it a strong 75 pages before determining whether to continue.  The outcome was predictable, so I didn't find this to be a real pager turner nor one that demanded I stay up all night finishing the book.  Great characters and all were very well defined and easy to relate to.  I particularly liked the short chapters, which made the book perfect for reading on an airplane.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A wonderful read, that shares a fantastical journey of a young man pursuing his destiny - the perfect adult fairy tale!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|I waited a while before finishing the third book. It was an easy read and a good finish to the story. The 'sex' I found was a little over the top but that was the main topic of the book. The story got better as the novels went along. I would recommend this book for light reading or someone wanting some ideas.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Wow, I love this game! Its highly addiccting! I wish that you got more than 42coins when off though....Still 5 star.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I love this app. I'll admit, I do have problems with it, but I'm 90% sure its my phone. Its quite laggy and sometimes unusable, but when it works, its a thing of beauty. Controlling your computer from your phone? Genius! I can do basically all the things my phone can't do, but only now, it kinda can! If only I had a more powerful phone, or a tablet I could use it on, maybe I would give it 5 stars... but I can't be too sure. Maybe it isn't just me, or just my phone. But yeah, this is a great app!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Quite an engaging read. Slow start but draws you in till you can't put it down. Will actually read the next novel in the series to see what happens.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|good album, waiting for part 2. not so hard as slipknot but it's real stone sour with nice melody and hard stuff
B004EPZ03O|5.0|The muppets arrived quickly and in great shape.  this was great as I purchased for a birth day  present last minute.
1593082037|5.0|Just finished the book last night...I just loved it but then again I have always been a big fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson..thank you very much...looking forward to purchasing Volume 2 shortly!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is the best game I have ever bought as a puzzle. game. you need to buy it is not a waste of space at all
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Ok aerosmith released their material after 11 years its fvkcing great isnt it?I bought it the day it released and played it really loud!Well Joe and Brad did awesome job solos and riffs are great!Some riffs and solos has Rocks and Toys vibe.Tom and Joey did great job too drumming and basses are awesome!When it comes to steven he is the one who wants ballads...Well album has great rocknroll songs and some crap ballads just skip the ballads and listen to rocknroll tracks with maximum volume.Light your marlboro,drink your jack daniel's and just LET THE MUSIC DO THE TALKING!
B002QP145C|5.0|I was a bit worried about the quality, since it was coming from the ROK.  I spent a year there in the 2nd I.D., and saw plenty of what the Koreans had to offer, especially in Itaewon (everything on the street sold for 8 dollars).  But the quality of the picture was the same as the first release, and it is not full screen.  There is a letter-box, but is it just not the scale of The Robe.  The story has been fleshed out alot, and we get to see all the characters more fully developed.  I recommend buying this copy if you liked the original offered by Belle and Blade.  The weapons and Russian armour leave nothing to be desired.  Where the producers found T-26 tanks, BA-32 Armoured Cars, and what looked like a BT-7, is beyond me!  The Finns also had a Swedish AB Bofors anti-tank gun! This film is one of the most authenitc WWII films ever made, right down to the Artillery and tracers.
B0081KTHEQ|3.0|I really can't say much of anything about this movie. It's OK. Radcliffe is alright, the plot is passable, even the FX are just acceptible, but nothing about &#34;the Woman in Black&#34; will stay with me. Well, except maybe for how lame the ending is.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I rate this wonderful book 5 stars because not only because it is a thriller, suspenseful, romantic and easy to read, but I love the tie-ins with other books Stephen King has written. I lived through most of the period he is writing about and it is spot-on!  I wanted to read it all at once but did have to sleep. The characters are totally believeable and you find yourself immersed in their lives. As with his other books, Uncle Stevie has excelled in telling a great story.<br />Thank you,<br />Waiting for the next story,<br />DRojano
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Album is great. Her music has gotten so much better than it used to be. Also the digital download is really nice to instantly get it
B005YPJ31I|5.0|Probably there has been no American who has had more books written on him the Abraham Lincoln. It makes sense considering Lincoln was President of the United States during the most important as well as bloodiest time in the history of the country. Very few men could have withstood the pressure of the job that Lincoln had to endure during the time he was in office. It is funny now how we as a country today look upon and revere Abe and proclaim him the greatest president of all time then when you look back and see how most people then thought him to be totally incompetent and a fool as president. Even today while we may hold him in great esteem many people think Lincoln as a simple guy born in a log cabin, grew up in the country and posessed simple ideals. But Doris Kearns Goodwin shows there was so much more to the man in her biography \\"Team Of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\\". Maybe he was born and raised in a log cabin in Kentuckyand did not have much formal education but \\"Honest\\" Abe was a lot more complexed a person then many would believe.<br /><br />'Team of Rivals\\" shows just how deep and intelligent Lincoln really was. Whether during his time working as a lawyer or as a Congressman from Illinois or as a presidential candidate or as President of the U.S., Goodwin shows how the political mind of Lincoln worked and how he used his knowledge and people skills to get others, even those who may oppose him, to come around to his way of thinking. The title of the book \\"Team Of Rivals\\" refer to the fact the majority of Lincoln's cabinate members were themselves his political rivals who had run against Lincoln for the Republican party presidential nomination in 1860. In the beginning when Abe announced he was running for his party nomination most people considered him a long shot at best to be the one to represent the Republicans in the Presidential election. It was to be sure a long hard fight for Lincoln to pull off the upset and not only get his party's nomination but win the election as well. Knowing with his election to the White House that the threat of southern withdrawel was most likely, and in fact southern secession was already underway before Lincoln had even had the chance to have his inauguration, Lincoln began the process to put his cabinate together by talking his republican rivals into joining his cabinate. Lincoln didn't want a bunch of automatic \\"yes\\" men being a part of his cabinate. He wanted men who would be honest and upfront with him in giving their opinion and views (even when it differed from his) as he looked for the right path to direct the country during the most trying times the nation would ever know.<br /><br />It certainly wasn't easy for Lincoln to deal at times with the cabinate he managed to bring together. Especially when the majority of them were sure they would have made better Presidents then their boss was. \\"Team Of Rivals\\" goes into great length and details in how Lincoln dealt with such big egos and extracted from that the guidence he needed to lead the U.S. through such a horrific war. In turn the book shows how Lincoln was able to bring out the best in his cabinate members and how in time they came around to his way of thinking and develope a staunch devotion as well as respect for their boss. Goodwin does a great job in presenting to the reader how Lincoln's mind worked and in turn brings a new respect to our 16th President. Goodwin goes to great lengths to provide details in showing how Lincoln's mind worked. Read this book and I bet you will be amazed how little you knew about Abe and how much more complexed he was.<br /><br />It is a long book. Around 900 pages. It is not always an easy read and certainly the amount of attention to detail Goodwin puts into the book is a good reason why. But it is worth it if you are willing to invest the time to delve into this book. It is because of how much detail she goes into it that helps bring Lincoln to life for the reader aswell as a clearer understanding behind the genius to such a simple man.

B009AMANBA|4.0|I haven't been out to a film in a real theater in a long time.  It took something as promising as \\"Lincoln\\" to get me to drive to my local cineplex, stand in line, sit way up close in one of the few remaining seats and sit through seemingly interminable previews.  After all, who doesn't love Abraham Lincoln and Daniel-Day Lewis?<br /><br />Be aware that this isn't a biopic of Lincoln's life.  It focuses on one event in his life,  his attempt to pass the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and thereby to abolish slavery.  There is passing reference to ending the Civil War but that seems almost like a side issue.  The parallels to the trials of our present President are interesting.  Here is a second term President, newly re-elected, with an iron will to pass through his own initiatives but is faced with opposition in the House of Representatives.  The Amendment has already passed the Senate some time earlier.  In this case it's the Republicans who are on the side of justice and equality for Blacks and the Democrats who are opposing it.  It would be fun to see the film with Obama and hear his reactions.<br /><br />There is a lot of talk.  It's more discussion than action so be prepared. And it's long.  Personally I would have liked more personal glimpses of Lincoln and his family.  We do see views of Mary Todd Lincoln, played by Sally Field. One of the most interesting scenes to me was the fight between them regarding letting their son enlist in the service.  This was the only scene in which we see Lincoln as a tad less than saintly, but only a tad.  The rest of the time, he was consistently wonderful.  The man probably was so but I actually got a little tired of it, especially his cute-folksy routine.  This is not a fault of Lincoln, nor of Daniel Day-Lewis, the splendid actor, but of the script and Spielberg, I think.<br /><br />The actors are all good.  As another reviewer commented, though, I kept seeing Sally Field up there, acting, rather than Mary Lincoln.  I have to admit, too, that I felt the same about DDL.  He almost overdid it, in my not-so humble opinion.  Likewise Tommy Lee Jones, another of my favorite actors.  He is very funny and steals every scene in which he appears but I have to wonder how accurate this portrayal was of the actual person.  I also wondered if his last scene (I won't spoil it by giving details) was of a real event. His wig is a little over the top.<br /><br />The film is nothing if not respectful, indeed adulatory, of a wonderful man.  To state the obvious, there is not a lot of tension for the viewer since the main problem was to pass the amendment and we all know how that turned out.  If a person had never heard of Abraham Lincoln, if such a person exists and would see this film, he would be blown away by this character.  To us it's a little underwhelming.  It is worth seeing, preferably in the comfort of your own home, with plenty of snacks, and with friends with whom you can comment about the actors.  \\"Sally Field put on weight for the role,\\" \\"look, there's Hal Holbrook!\\"  I'd tempted to give it three stars but lest I be accused of deep unpatriotism, I'm giving it four.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Awesome book. Very intriguing. Keeps you going to the very end. Very unexpected ending. Highly recommend this book to everyone.
B005LAIHZE|1.0|What seemed an interesting premise (having not read the book), turned into a farcical foray into dazzling cinematography..but mired with worthless drek.<br /><br />This was \\"nuking the fridge\\" bad.<br /><br />I'm all for suspension of disbelief in fantasy/horror films, but there are moments and sequences (Who knew so many people had Matrix-styled fighting skills in the 19th century?)that step into the realm of pure idiocy. This film made Timur Bekmambetov's previous film \\"Wanted\\" look like \\"Lawrence Of Arabia\\".....and that's saying A LOT!

B004LWZWGK|1.0|Once again, corporate greed defies customer preference.  I think if you want this movie, you're stuck with UV, unless you want to pay more for the storybook version exclusively at Target.<br /><br />Give stupid UV as a choice, rather than a demand, and you''ll sell more Blu-Rays. :-P

B0041KVW2K|2.0|I bought this product and at first I was in awe of this box set. I was impressed with the book, the packaging and everything visually about this set. I put my first record on the turntable. I choose Please Please Me. It certainly pleased pleased me. Great sound and I was hooked. Next record was A Hard Day's Night and it was pristine. Then I listened to Abbey Road. I heard there was alot of quality control problems with it and I didn't have a single problem with it. I was in love with this box set. Then I put on The White Album. When I got to the song Martha My Dear it went all down hill. The record was pressed horribly. The sound of static, the record not centered. I thought... well it must just be one spot out of the whole set with quality. Then I put on Sgt. Peppers album and side one was fine even though it wasn't centered. Then I put side two on and it was not even listenable. Total distortion. I was thinking maybe it was my stylus. Ortofon doesn't make crap. Anyways I checked to see if it was my stereo and it wasn't that either. I also recorded it to my laptop and it recorded the same crap coming from my ortofon. Then I switched out to my audio technica stylus and the same sound. I was pissed. I also played Let It Be the album and it wasn't all that great. Let It Be the song was unbearable.<br />I had it. I then made my decision then and there. I am not shelling over $300 for audio incompetance. The final product of sound was crap. It all came down to the pressing of the records themselves. The music and quality of sound is awesome when they are pressed right. Overall I recommend not buying this until Apple figures out how to put out a better finished pressing of The Beatles. The greatest band of all time deserves better. We the fans all deserve better.<br />I am going to wait for the Mono Box Set and maybe they will have the pressing issues figured out. Funny how I have never had a problem in the past two years with a new record bought. Maybe I have never bought a Rainblow pressing. I hope they do not have rainbo records press the mono set early next year. If they do I would stay away from them too.<br />Apple records: Please correct this issue so us fans don't have to suffer through crappy quality. The Beatles Mono CD box set is awesome. Make the vinyl mono box set as good. Returning this product was a painful thing to do. If you received a set without any problems, consider yourself lucky.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I read what the book was about I didn't think I'd like it. Was so popular I thought I'd try it and to my amazement found it very enjoyable and intertwining.
0439023483|5.0|I so enjoyed all 3 books.  But this book kept my attention.  I actually watched the movie before I read the book.  I was glad that I did only because it put a face with the person.  But, that is about all I got from the movie.  Don't expect the book to be just good as the movie, the book is GREAT.  Don't stop with the movie you will miss out.  The movie's are always the best!

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love show tunes and I love Susan Boyle. Add Michael Crawford and Donny Osmond to the mix, and the result is incredible. None of the eleven tracks are disappointing, but I have become especially fond of the three duet tracks: \\"The Music of the Night\\" with Michael Crawford, and \\"All I Ask of You\\" and \\"This is the Moment\\" with Donny Osmond. The arrangements and orchestration take the listener from calm, almost ethereal at times, to soaring and back again. \\"Send in the Clowns\\" is almost mesmerizing - so beautiful. Susan Boyle has an incredible voice and she controls it so well. It is refreshing to listen to pure music that delivers expression, intensity, and spot-on pitch control without using auto-tune and overdone electronic manipulations, which so many artists lean on today. I simply know what I like and I recommend this CD. Kudos, Susan, for another great music album.
B009KKLQVS|5.0|So yes, it is something of a travesty that they represent the Beach Boys 50th anniversary tour with a 21 song DVD when the whole point of the tour setlists was to play 50 (or more) songs per show.<br /><br />But leaving aside the outrageous decision to produce a 21 song package, the sound is very clean and the performances are top-notch.  The Beach Boys 50th tour could have very well turned out to be a simple victory lap, but somehow everything gelled, and the band pushed themselves to prove once and for all that they are America's most important rock band.  (And David Marks assures he will never be written out of the Beach Boys story again..)<br /><br />Everybody is in good voice for the selected tracks (when Mike in particular was having on days and off days on the road), and despite the 21 song constraint, we do get some semi-rarities including a spirited \\"Marcella\\" a top-notch \\"Sail On Sailor\\" and a spot-on \\"All This Is That\\".  Both singles from the new album are represented, with (as on the album itself) \\"Isn't It Time\\" being far the superior.<br /><br />I can't comment on the video portion of the DVD as I have no interest in watching concert videos -- I immediately ripped the audio to MP3.<br /><br />So, accept that this is not the full magic of a show from the 50th tour.  There are \\"unofficial\\" sources for those.  For what it is, it provides good sound of magic performances.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|MOVE WAS A TAD BORING IN PLACES. NOT ONE OF JOHNNY DEPPS BEST MOVIES,  ALTHOUGH FUNNY AT TIMES. NOT GREAT BUT OKAY.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Only 1/3 thru it, but am enjoyiing it as much or more than any other Grisham books!!  Already looking forward to next book
B007CGLRWA|5.0|Detachment follows substitute teacher Henry Barthes as he begins teaching at a rough and on-the-edge school for a month; it also follows the faculty of the school and the lives of the students. It may seem like this is your typical story of a teacher-class relationship and how everything works out and test scores are improved (etc.) because of the cover, but it's not. Although Detachment focuses on the poor education system and lack of motivation in some students, the film strongly focuses on the feeling being detached, being lost, being alone.<br /><br />The story is deep and powerful. It will take you on an emotion ride, if you let it. Some scenes will make you depressed/sad (possibly to the point of tears), while some scenes will infuriate you. I don't want to spoil some of the main scenes for you, but there are some short transition-like scenes that are equally effective; for example, there is a quick scene where the constantly bullied Meredith is eating in the restroom alone and another scene where she is bullied by her father, and these short scenes really got me. It all leads to a an amazing, although slightly predictable, ending. I really enjoyed how it showed the teachers' side of the story and how they often feel helpless and underappreciated. The cast was brilliant, especially Adrien Brody and I couldn't help but be amazed by Lucy Liu's powerful speech/rant when she snaps. The film is complimented by a somber soundtrack, which I really enjoyed. The short runtime benefits the film, so it doesn't overstay its welcome. I didn't really understand why Adrien Brody's character had some interview-style scenes throughout the film, though, and hoped that would be explained.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Detachment and felt like it had a significant message; I think everyone will get a message out of this film, or at least think about some of the issues it brings up. Detachment is a powerful, thought-provoking drama. As of 11/18/12, this film is available onAmazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is highly recommended.<br /><br />Detachment has some blood and violence, and nudity/sex.

I hated the story line the setting the characters... everything!!! I mean prim was tolerable but no one else was! I do not recommend this irritating book nor do i understand the obsession!! All i can say besides this is BOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008458O3S|5.0|Got this when it was the FAOTD last week and I've been obsessed with it ever since. The game is perfect, really - it has all the features it needs to make it an outstanding offering, and nothing more. The best part is how there are literally multitudes of solutions for solving the puzzles; if you go online you can check them out, in case you're having trouble with a level or if you're simply curious to see what others have done with the same layout. Downright inspiring.<br /><br />But be warned == Due to the obcenely addictive nature of this game, make sure you have nothing pressing to do before you start playing because you will most likely lose track of time. (Sorry, couldn't resist.)
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Good movie with lots of action and great special effects. Not one I would watch over and over but a good watch.
B001RIY4WE|2.0|If you are really into all the special edition features and all the bells and whistles, this might be a great disk for you. However, if all you want to do is watch the movie, forget it! I am not even going to go into the special features since they are well covered in other reviews. So if you just want to watch the movie, you have to cancel the attempt to log into \\"Skynet\\", then it tells you that if you want to get the full  Blu-Ray features you NEED the internet connection, and you have to wait a bit there. After a few graphics, you get to pick a version, theatrical or special. Ok, you have picked your version, and now you can watch your movie right? Well sure, after all the promo screens for Lionsgate, a special T2 THX bit, and several others eating up time that you can't skip. So now you can watch the movie. Ok, it's not the first disk with all that stuff, but it takes longer than any I have come across before, and be careful not to stop it, (or in my case bump my remote) because you can't get to the menu to choose scene select until you have gone through every second of that stuff, AND when you do get to the scene select, you only get to look at one choice at a time, not a page with four or six scenes per page. I know to some people this will sound really picky, but what I am getting at it that it takes a ridiculous amount of time to just put in the disk and watch it. If I had known, I would have looked into a different version, but since I am only looking at watching it once a year it will be alright, just wish I had a heads up. Now you do...
B000GFLE1S|5.0|This film is funny, touching, well-done, and illustrates how a man who inherits a failing shoe factory from his father turns it into a profit making enterprise that saves the jobs of loyal employees.  Beyond that simple message, it is a movie with heart and loyalty and business based on principles instead of greed.  Of course it has all that makes a movie engaging and fun and dramatic... let it be a surprise as you watch it!!! Well done!
0446580848|5.0|While I have read the other John Corey books, and enjoyed them, this one was riveting for me due to the immediate relevance to the disaster at Benghazi.  While others may have been bored by all the descriptive content, I found the parallels with Libya to be illuminating and instructive.  The melting away of the \\"police\\" or \\"guards,\\" the company secret agendas, the inter-agency rivalries, the callous sacrifice of human life and of Americans who interfere in the \\"plan\\" - it all made for an amazing read that did not seem fictional at all, given what we know so far about Benghazi.  Corey's snarkiness balances the bleak details of an operation that relies on the most primitive motives for execution and lightens the reading experience, which might otherwise be too desolate to endure.
6305882592|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite films.  So much of the film is funny, and yet the love is real and very touching.  It gives a possibility for how we can touch and help each other beyond what society considers &#34;average or normal&#34; ways of relating.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|After seeing the movie with the wife and a lengthy discussion about all the nuances of the film, we purchased the online version of Cloud Atlas. While not as smooth an experience as the movie it did answer the questions about plot and details of the movie. This would be another example of the book being better than the movie!<br /><br />We both recommend reading the novel to round out the Cloud Atlas experience.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|Re-Animator's just a helluva lotta fun!! Nice to have it on blu-ray! Has all the bonus features of the original DVD & the picture looks great. Highly recommended for people who like movies where the humor isn't so obvious. Also, listen to this one with the cast commentary, it's one of the best I've heard.
1932735410|4.0|I have started reading book, what i like most about this book is it will keep your interest in reading by using interesting tests and questions. It is much better then PMBOOK Guide given by PMI. After reading some pages of PMBOOK it become boring but PMP Exam Prep is interesting. But i don't like about this book is that while ordering i thought that CD coming with book is proper full version of Exam prep course but what i found is only DEMO version. Before ordering this book i have already downloaded it from torrent but still reading from book is different experience. Still i would like it more if that full version CD comes as free with this book. Also AMAZON charge lot as shipping charges as i am from INDIA. book cost was $60 and AMAZON charged me $30 as shipping cost. Isn't it wrong?<br />Any way till now my experience is good. Enjoy reading...

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|As a former US Marine, I am always skeptical of war films purporting to be about Marines. Marines have a way of thinking and acting that is hard for actors - (for anyone) - to grasp. If you're a Marine or former Marine watching some actor botch up his role as a \\"Marine\\" it ruins your experience of a film. Case in point: Eastwood was fine in Heartbreak Ridge but the actors with him resembled US Marines as much as they did small brown furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.<br /><br />Pacific, however, does not suffer from that weakness. These actors were subjected to a nine-day \\"boot camp\\" before filming. Who ever \\"trained\\" them did a stellar job. These guys talk, walk, and act like Marines. The weakness the film *does* suffer from is lack of cohesion. Perhaps even a cinematic genius like Spielberg couldn't figure out how to get around a loose story line with battles fought all over the Pacific. Another weakness is the depiction of the Guadalcanal fire fight that occasioned John Basilone's receipt of the Medal of Honor. That fight as filmed needed hundreds more assaulting Japanese; as portrayed, it seems merely like a hellish-tough skirmish. I also found the episode devoted to John Basilone's romance tiresome. I don't know why, I just did.<br /><br />Also, the date given in the film for the Battle of Peleliu is wrong: it shows the Marines hitting the beaches of Peleliu in \\"October\\" whereas the actual assault commenced in September. (Spielberg committed a similar odd and easily checked historical error in his outstanding film [[ASIN:B00C1BU7V8 Lincoln]], by the way.)<br /><br />Those are the only cons (for me). The idea this film somehow is \\"anti-American\\" --- (same critique was leveled at Saving Private Ryan) --- seems to me an inaccurate cavil. Clearly the WWII Pacific US Marine veterans who met with the actors during this film's production did not regard it so; rather, they viewed it as an honor to their service. Marines pride themselves on fairness when fairness is called for and mercilessness when mercilessness is called for. In the Pacific, mercilessness was called for.<br /><br />The pros are the film is historically accurate, has immense detail, portrays the Corps accurately, and is enjoyable, sometimes impressive, to watch. My favorite episodes deal with the horrific fighting on Okinawa. Eugene Sledge remarked of that fighting, (roughly quoted): \\"It was beyond ludicrous that anyone could endure those conditions for long and not go completely insane\\".<br /><br />The series is built around three Marines - John \\"I'm staying with my boys\\" Basilone, Robert Leckie, and Eugene Sledge - and the historical memoirs of the latter two: [[ASIN:0553763598 Helmet for My Pillow]] and [[ASIN:0553230557 With the Old Breed]].<br /><br />If you are a Marine, Marine veteran, a Marine family member, or just interested in increasing your vicarious first hand knowledge of the Pacific War, this is a graphic, realistic film I believe you will appreciate.ess when mercilessness is called for.

B009LA1QW6|4.0|When Lana Del Rey released \\"Born To Die\\" in early, 2012, it bowled me over. I hadn't heard her before putting on that album when I bought it, and it was something intruiging, different, as the album brought a diverse sound (ranging from the jazz-lounge to the trip-hop). Now, just 10 months later, comes this sorta-companion/sequel.<br /><br />\\"Paradise\\" (10 tracks, including 2 bonus tracks; 48 min.) starts off strongly with \\"Ride\\", clearly one of the best tracks on here, starting off slowly and then crashing into the hard-charging chorus. After that we get a number of similar-sounding slower-tempo jazz-lounge tracks: \\"American\\", \\"Cola\\", \\"Body Electric\\" (with the exact same chorus line \\"I Sing the Body Electric\\" as the 1980 Fame soundtrack album track, incidentally). Track 5 is the 2 1/2 min. \\"Blue Velvet\\" cover, which is very good (if short). It is followed by a nice \\"Gods and Monsters\\" before we get 2 more jazz-lounge tracks (\\"Yayo\\" and \\"Bel Air\\"). I bought this CD at one of the big box retailers, and it contains 2 bonus tracks, both club remixes of \\"Blue Velvet\\". The 5 min. Penguin Prison remix is outstanding, and one of the best tracks on here. But the 9 min. Lindstrom remix goes nowhere and has not single connection with the actual \\"Blue Velvet\\" song.<br /><br />In all, this is quite the hit-and-miss release, and the thing that makes this clearly the lesser release compared to \\"Born to Die\\" is that it lacks the musical diversity that makes \\"Born To Die\\" such a great album. The bottom line: this is a so-so companion release to \\"Born to Die\\" but if you are new to Lana Del Rey, check out \\"Born to Die\\" before this. That aside, I saw Lana Del Rey in concert in New York in June of this year, and while the crowd was in a frenzy for most of the time, I enjoyed it but was a bit disappointed as the 1 hr. set concentrated entirely on the \\"jazz-lounge\\" songs, hence missing some of the best tracks of \\"Born to Die\\". All that aside, \\"Paradise\\" is a must-have for Lana Del Rey die-hards only (and you know who you are!).e-hards only (and you know who you are!).
1607066017|5.0|Best new comic series.  Seriously.  I just finished Last Man on Earth, and was really hoping something would come along that could compare.  SAGA compares.
B009AMANBA|4.0|\\"Lincoln\\" (2012 release; 150 min.) is the latest Steven Spielberg-directed historical drama (others include Schindlers' List and Saving Private Ryan, just to name those). Not knowing much more besides having seen the trailer for is a few times, I really didn't know what to expect, and was eagerly looking forward to seeing it.<br /><br />Here is what I got: first and foremost, despite the name of the movie, this is NOT a movie about Lincoln as such. Instead it is a historical drama in which Lincoln plays a significant role, and the movie is roughly set up in two major parts: (i) the first half introduces the various characters and ref;lects the debate whether or not the 13th Amendment (abolishing slavery) should be passed before the looming end of the Civil War, and why Lincoln felt it was paramount that it was indeed voted on before the end of the war, and (ii) the second half of the movie focuses primarily on what the Republican-controlled House of Representatives needed to do to get 20 Demcratic votes to vote \\"yes\\", so as to get to the 2/3 majority required for passing a Constitutional Amendment, and how President Lincoln orchestrated it all. Lincoln seduces, cajoles, begs, tyrannizes, and even offers bribes (in the form of patronage jobs) to get the required votes. In that sense, this is a movie with a very narrow scope, even if brought on an epic scale.<br /><br />A few additional thoughts: Daniel Day-Lewis is nothing short of brilliant in his portrayal of Lincoln, and I would be shocked if he didn't at least get an Oscar nomination for this (and he might very well win). The other acting surprise is of course Sally Field as Lincoln's wife: in the (too-short) screen time she is given, Field brings a fiery performance. The scene/argument between the President and his wife relative to their oldest son wanting to join the Army is one of the more dramatic of the entire movie and it didn't even have to do with the main theme of the movie (passing of the 13th Amendment). I really enjoyed this movie, although I thought it was a bit over-long at 2 1/2 hours and could've benefited from some tighter editing. Kudos also to John Williams for a very understated, almost sober, yet very fine music score for this film. Lincoln is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!).

B009D5VNLS|5.0|Just watch the movie. It is really,  really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, fabulous darling.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I haven't seen the movie but the trailer was very well done. It had intrigue, great character development, and great special effects. I was literally glued to my seat (model airplane accident). I can see that other reviewers have given it five stars, as so even though I haven't seen I think it is safe to say that this film is an Oscar contender in one of our parallel universes. The expectation that I feel about this movie is truly an incredible natural high.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Its a bit of a Grisham,  page turner.  Starts out ok but fades away into a Baldacci like finish.  I'm not sure Grisham is writing these books,  probably using a staff of young ghostwriters.  Bit of a scam.  Dissapointing.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I PLAY THIS GAME FOR HOURS EVERY DAY!!  It is addicting. I hope they update it soon and give more puzzles to work as I will be finished with those I have soon.
B00014X8KO|5.0|This was such a well done collection of animated shorts. I think I only disliked one of them, and it was the last one. It was a little long for my tastes, but still such a great buy!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a wonderful logic game that helps me exercise my brain!  This color version is even more challenging, and the lack of a time limit makes it stress-free - thoroughly enjoyable!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A good insight into the training and service of seal team six as well as the hunt for and killing of Bin Laden
B00452VF4O|5.0|Penman writes accurate history in story book fashion with fictionalized dialog and feelings of her characters described from available historical evidence. She inserts imagined participants appropriate to the story line. All- in-all Penman writes with a skill few writers possess and keeps the reader turning pages.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This is the best cd ever!  Who would believe that a man in his 80's could put together such a talented group, sing with them and then use the cd to promote Public Broadcasting?!  This cd is a real winner, .......as is Tony Bennet
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but my best friend has it in his IPOD and he has version 0.5.0.  please update sooner
B0013F1D02|5.0|a delightful fantasy and a perfect way to end an evening. Second time I have watched it and will watch again soon.four thumbs up!
B0084ANCBC|4.0|This classic of the ever-scheming Becky Sharp to rise in society at any cost is delightful. A bit too long, and sometimes filled with long dull passages of telling rather than showing. But when the author \\"shows\\", the story's worth the read. And whenever the author intrudes into the story, his persona is charming. Worth reading just for the famous Rebecca Sharp.
B009AMANBA|5.0|'Lincoln' is a movie of inestimable worth.  Production values fill the screen from the first shot to the final frame.<br /><br />  Forging a lasting work to be sustained in the multitude of films, books, videos, documentaries, docudramas, etc., that form the Lincoln canon is a challenge in itself.  Director Spielberg plays well to the task, knowing he will be expected, but even more, desiring through his love of film, to chronicle history that will be sustained.<br /><br />  His choice of Day-Lewis for the rail-splitter becomes obviously inspired from the moment Daniel appears.  Preoccupation with the minutia of daily life was brilliantly captivating, giving one that marvelous perspective of being the famed 'fly-on-the-wall.'  Film aficionados will study this movie with relish.<br /><br />  Day-Lewis' hunched-back, reedy colloquialisms framing perspectives from scholarly promontories distinguish the living portrait, hungering the audience for more.<br /><br />  Stellar performances abound, dripping over one another like honey over cake.  That viewers are forced to demand if this or that was truly historical only hammers home the realities that were found.  Challenges to plumb the depths of historical documentation flower from such work as this.<br /><br />  The telling marks of time well spent were first, this reviewer's fascination with the playing out of the movie.  The second would be the falling into quiet sleep of my wife after a very long day, at my side in the darkened theatre, during the continuing unraveling of the momentous closing days of the Civil War, acted out in the fires of power broking, literally at times in smoke-filled rooms.  The final coup de grace was my fifteen-year-old's summation of the film, walking the parking lot to the car.<br /><br />  \\"Man,\\" he said, fear in his voice at uttering the wrong thing on such a momentous occasion, \\"that movie sure was fast!\\"  \\"Yea,\\" I agreed, thinking to myself, we're gonna have to watch that one again.  This time at home, with no distractions.<br /><br />For historical background: [[ASIN:1595551115 America: The Last Best Hope (Volume I): From the Age of Discovery to a World at War]]<br /><br />TL Farley,<br />author,<br />Distant Reaches-Autobiography from a Pub in Ireland to a State Police interrogation.

B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Lee Child tells a story in a manner that keeps you turning the pages to find out where Reacher is heading in the storyline. I've read all of them and they just keep on meeting all expectations.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|I've seen it twice before and was pleased to find it was available on Amazon Prime.  As a teenager in the late 60's I totaly understand what drove Chris McCandless's actions in  1972.  Chris was just a young man trying to make sense of the world.  If any of you remember that time in history; it was pretty screwed up.  Most of us just smoked pot. Chris mistakingly thought the wilderness was the answer that none of us could find elsewhere.  Sad ending to his story.<br /><br />Emile was very real in this role, that should be the focus.  So forget McCandless. Just watch Emile Hirsch, the actor.
0141182865|5.0|Ignatius, I know you - what a hilarious read. The book had obviously been well read by its condition which in a way added to the whole theme of the story.
B009NOVCTM|1.0|The Rolling Stones didn't really publicize exactly what would be on this album in the weeks leading up to it's release.  There's a clear reason for that.  This aging band has released about 300 greatest hits albums over the years.  They've also released about 400 live albums.  How many times are fans supposed to buy the SAME SONGS??  I'm a huge Stones fan, and have been since 1970, but I am very disappointed in Grrr.  We're expected to buy 'Start Me Up' -- yet again?  In addition, numerous songs on this collection are EDITED (shortened), which means you're not getting the whole song.  All in all, an album filled with Crrrap we've heard for as many as 50 years.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|A slight deviation from the show, but very solid, raw, and stunning. The Walking Dead is the best zombie-themed story going.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was very hard to put this down, a little depressing at times, makes you realize how oppressive government control can be.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I'm only an hour into the Royal Albert Hall concert & I'll already give this dvd 5 stars. To think I have over 4 hours left to watch leaves me drooling. Better than Song Remains The Same in my opinion, less polished & way more bang for the buck. I'll be dishing out bits of this dvd like candy for the next week or so(who can sit down for 320 minutes at a go?)This is rock&roll history here & any Zep fan could not possibly regret buying this.<br />  Update/The rest of this dvd does not disappoint. I very much enjoyed seeing live versions of so many of the classic songs I've known for years.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story is a little gimmickry but it is an enjoyable read.  Would have loved to know the source of the gold.  Oh well.

B00A77II0U|5.0|Another excellent game from Alawar! Super creepy, great story line, and long enough game play to get your moneys worth.  I enjoyed the game for 2 days, off and on, before completing it.  I love the point and click, hidden object games and this is another winner for them!  No issues with downloading or install. I have a Sony tablet S.  Please make more like this soon!

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore crusades his mission of putting the truth of global warming in a systematic and logical way in this long documentary.  He points out the statistics to show the upward trend at an alarming rate.  Human activities no doubt contribute global warming since Industrial Revolution. Can we point fingers to the now developing countries causing the pollution?<br /><br />It seems he made this programs for all of us especially to the politicians who try hard to distort the truth.  Americans are only 5% of world population but consume 30% of the energy.  If countries such as India and China catch up in American living style, we may need another planet to support!<br /><br />This show had an earth rising picture and planet earth is our home.  If we do not treat it with respect without abuse, it will response in more disasters and hardships.<br /><br />Hurricane Katrina and recent Sandy did a lot of damages in lives and properties.  Do we hear, see and suffer the result?<br /><br />Al carries the torch to campaign the impact of global warming and wants you and me to become part of the solution.  Why Uncle Sam is not the leader in this respect, especially in green technology?  Is it the truth of economics, politics, science, lies and deception?
B003JIPJRE|5.0|This is one of my favorite batman stories of all time! Bruce Greenwood, Jesen Ackles, and Neil Patrick Harris all do a fantastic job voice acting. The story is engaging, and the animation is high quality as well. Definitely check this one out if you are a fan of Batman.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good second book in the Jack Reacher series.  Great action/mystery book.  It is an easy/quick read.  I would recommend this book.
B008UJDOOC|5.0|It was great. No scratches or defects on this Cd. I liked it. I'm now set for Christmas. I'm continuing my search until I do not have any money left.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is addicting and entertaining. I don't like that so many things require acorns to buy. I also don't like that the hearts are so difficult to get.  It takes too long to collect enough to get soccer fields or apes.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|This is the 2nd time I tried to read this book. Previously couldn't get into it.  Had read the dragon tattoo and absolutely loved it. To cut a long story short I decided to watch the film then read the book.  What a great book and read it in 3 days.<br /><br />Just one let down is the abrupt end to the book. Lots of unanswered questions.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the final book in this trilogy.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|lov<br />love Liam Neeson, he's a great actor keeps you sitting on the edge of your chair..can't wait to see 'taken 2'
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a good read, exactly what word-of-mouth was talking about!!!  Hot and Spicey.  I read some where that \\"It's rekindling a fire under a lot of marriages,\\" It does makes you feel sexy. There's lots of detail, but is it really soft porn?  My daughter looked into buying these for my Mother last x-mas. We all enjoyed the books.
1439152802|5.0|WOW!!!! Probably the BEST book I've read this year. I am speechless and can not express how wonderful this book was. I felt so strongly for the characters. Kate Morton is so talented, her writing style is superb, lyrical and powerful at the same time. Jimmy, he was my favorite from the very beginning, I was on the edge afraid for his life choices, what would happen to him, but the twist at the end of the book left me absolutely out of breath, never saw that coming.<br />Kate Morton has been my favorite for a long time, I have read all of her books and liked them, but Secret Keeper is positively my most favorite. Thank you Ms. Morton, I will never forget this story.
B0063IH60K|3.0|okay fun to play to many ad's, show not have to put up with ad's after every game.  Nice but could be better.
B007JVJ3C4|4.0|Unlike the first Ghost Rider movie, I enjoyed this one because it is fast and exciting with great visual effects. There were a few moments where it got kind of silly in the scenes when Nicholas Cage was trying to fight the change into the Rider, but that's what you expect in a Nick Gage movie, but overall it was good.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|So far trying to found out how to use like my office on the computer, which is very different. Still trying to find how to's!!!!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Granted this is the Demo version, but it does not play on the HD correctly.  It appears that no matter how you hold the tablet, the game rotates and is displayed upside down.
0345529057|5.0|The books arrived in top notch packaging and on time. I read every word of each movel. Awesome story line.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book!!! Finished reading the first book and couldn't wait to start this one. Definately lived up to my expectations.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Took me a while to get the hang if it. Didn't make sense at first. Not sure I am playing it right even now but it is fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this for my small tablet, it runs good.  The cards are easy to read, and a single will send the card where it belongs.  Great time kiler while waiting for appts or whatever.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another great book!  Thoroughly enjoyed this one and as usual the plot twists and turns are not at all what you might expect.  Well worth the time!
B0043EV774|5.0|Arrived in excellent condition.  It arrived quickly.  The 3d effects are awesome.  I recommend this movie to add to your collection if you have a 3d player

B005HJWWW8|5.0|Purchased this item to control the volume for my Smart TV ear phone jack. Simply awesome, so much in such a small package. Battery life can last up to 8 hours. my suggestion would be to buy two. Also works great with my Cell music mix and any MP3 player. A great find and if purchased you will not be sorry.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Solid set of music. Nothing sounds too similar. This was my first time using Amazon for music. It wasn't the easiest process, but it worked.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|This is my 2nd Swivel Sweeper and love it for quick clean ups. But this model did not have the one touch  to empty the dust collector, which was very disappointing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A very intriguing game.....totally enraptures the player and occupies your mind completely. You wil thoroughly enjoy playing and trying to beat this game.
B001EBWING|5.0|I love this movie, as does virtually everybody, but short of cueing up my copy and playing it, I'm curious as to who played Sam, the piano player?  It's not even listed on the DVD case, that I could find.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Reading The Racketeer by John Grisham was like eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It is not fine dining, but it is delicious and satisfying from the first bite, and then easily forgotten. Sometimes it's fun to just read something light and entertaining, and this book fits the bill.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I live out in the sticks and don't have cable and never bothered with satellite as I don't watch alot of T.V. I only have internet and I happened across The Walking Dead seasons 1&2 on netflix. Since then I am addicted and have been ordering the new ones from Amazon. I don't usually get hooked on shows, especially zombie/vampire/monster stuff, but this one is awesome.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Rapp is back and this time we get to see, for part of the book, a softer side of him. I won't give away how or why but trust me it keeps the suspense high. Rapp is sent to Afghanistan to investigate the kidnapping of a top CIA officer. While there it quickly becomes clear someone wants him dead. But Rapp is not easy to kill. To say much more would spoil the plot but if you enjoy thrillers, politics, and a look at how our policies are actually being carried out in the middle east, I highly recommend this book. Or if you just want a great read- you won't be disappointed! Vince Flynn is at the top of his game.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I was so glad to get this version. Love it! Brought back great memories of the play at the orpheum theatre. The dark ending fit perfectly with the rest of the story in my opinion. Thankyou, to whoever is responsible for this .
B006H4DBA4|4.0|A short story perfect while enjoying a cuppa ,I am sure we will all find ourselves reflected in one of the women in this tale!

B002RSQGQK|5.0|James Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock what a wonderful combination.  Such supense in this old thriller. This is only one of my favorite with James Stewart. Almost two hours long but worth every minute.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love it cool fun .First you play it, then you earn tons of coins on buying cool characters, fun upgrades and you get these things that tell u what u complesed everyone i know has it
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Worth the money!I'm just cant wait until the Hoth update to be released!The reason I gave it 4 stars is because you have to pay for The path of the Jedi level pack
0345531957|5.0|As usual with John Grisham this was a very good book.  Once I started reading this I instantly wanted more, more of the facts behind his embezzlement, which were slowly released throughout the story.  The way in which his character was able to accomplish everything in his plot and survive unscathed was pure ingenious.  I love John Grisham.  .
B005LAIH9A|1.0|Unnecessary sequel - the lack of a plot shows it, right from having a reunion party that is somehow between the 10th and 15th anniversary (as if it's okay to say the gang missed the 10-year reunion and decide to go to the 13th-year reunion, and that is all makes total sense).  Some hints of character development and unexpected twists in their backstories, but no apparent unifying goal like the first and best of the movies.<br /><br />Bad sight gags and sexual jokes used for shock value.  Just seemed aimless and pointless, no matter how much you liked the characters previously.  (SPOILER! - Once you see Jason Biggs wake up hungover and naked, you suspect it might be a redo of The Hangover, which would give the movie at least have some potential, but there's no such luck as the scene's only use is for a sight gag involving Biggs' meat and potatoes and once that's done the movie just jumps mindlessly to the beach where some girls lose their bikinis to a bunch of losers, and the movie goes further downhill from there).<br /><br />I have a rule - I gave each movie 20-30 minutes.  Then if they make it, and even most of those I don't like survive that test, I give them to the midpoint to be redeemed.  I loved American Pie the original, but I just couldn't give Reunion any more than 30 minutes of my time.<br /><br />The cast and their characters just aren't worth our attention in this 4th installment, but I don't entirely blame for trying to rekindle the franchise.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|at first some of the games can be tricky but hey who's not up for a little challenge! I'm pleased with this app!
B009IJJ712|2.0|I was terribly excited when I heard CBS was making Elementary. I've been a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories since college. But this retelling is...well, it's just plain bad. It would be one thing if this series didn't try to call its quirky resident genius \\"Sherlock Holmes\\". It would fit nicely with the Perception/Mentalist/Monk subgenre of procedural shows. But Sherlock Holmes is a different level of character. He's the archetype. You can't just toss him in with the same level of plot and character as modern shows and expect people to be impressed. I'm certainly not.<br /><br />After hearing about the BBC's veiled threat that CBS not copy their distinctive style in \\"Sherlock\\", I think CBS went overboard trying to avoid anything similar to the BBC show, then never did a beta test on their choices. Nearly all of the changes CBS made to the Sherlock universe made him less interesting to me.<br /><br />It took me two tries to get through this episode. It was that disappointing/boring. I've managed to get through two other episodes since, but I keep seeing the same problems. The pacing is slow. The dialogue is very unclever (that's a mortal sin in the Sherlock universe). Only the crimes are at all interesting, and anyone these days can write up an unlikely murder scenario.<br /><br />Is it just me, or did the writers for this show slow down the action and dumb down the plots because their demographic is comprised of older folks who would tune out if they couldn't keep up? Honestly. I'd say this is my grandmother's Sherlock Holmes, but she's a retired college professor and she'd be bored, too. I feel sorry for the actors who signed up for this show. I don't think Elementary will be a shining moment in their careers.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Christian Bale has knocked it out of the park as the new Batman and brought this super hero back to life (Batman used to be cheesy like a B-movie); I've enjoyed Batman Begins, Dark Knight, etc. but Dark Knight Rises had additional twists and depth, plus had me crying (in a good way) as I found it very inspirational, not just a great action movie. This version of Batman and this particular film can compete with any of the best super hero movies -- what makes a great super hero movie is a believable character that is fighting evil/bad guys but also fighting within to be a better person, overcome obstacles, etc. -- and the absolute best parts are when the character is willing to sacrifice him or herself -- think Passion of the Christ, Braveheart, Captain America, Batman Dark Knight Rises. Just a different level of hero.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|What a frustrating package.<br /><br />Being a fan of the 2009 remasters on CD, I was very much looking forward to these remastered LPs.<br /><br />The box is huge, heavy, and very well put together. You can see there was more than average time spent in assembling each one, from the awesome hardbound book to the foam inserts inside holding everything in place.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's about as good as the QC gets with this set. These vinyl LP discs are completely unacceptable given the price. Instead of rambling on and on, I'll just list out what's wrong with the product itself. These findings are based on examination of two complete sets.<br /><br />Problems:<br />-Warped discs. Some very slight, some more significant than others. Watch your tonearm bop.<br />-Marks, finger prints, scuffs on some discs straight out of the package.<br />-Non-fill issues/surface noise<br />-Bent/creased covers<br />-Uneven thickness of the vinyl discs themselves<br />-Off center labels<br /><br />All of these things are unfortunate, because as I said at the start: I like the sound of the 2009 remasters. As an owner of vintage Beatles vinyl, I am fully aware that these are not the same mixes. So what's my point? I think the LPs in this set sound *great*. In fact, anyone who hasn't heard them before or simply isn't familiar with the Beatles should probably start here for a nice warm, full, and clear mix.<br /><br />...That is, if you like to gamble $300+ dollars on whether or not you'll get an acceptable product to play.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|I love all the Matrix movies -- when the first one came out, the concept was mind-blowing and the style of fighting had never been seen before (though people copy it now). These con't to be some of the all-time best fantasy movies ever made (along with Lord of the Rings, X-Men, etc.). They are incredibly exciting and keep you on the edge of your chair and really make you think -- would you want the real world or the matrix if you had a choice? Truly, great fantasy/science-fiction/action movies.
0385523912|5.0|If you think you are having a tough day at work, read this book. Imagine getting up at 5 a.m. to forage for grass and figure out how to bake it into food for your starving family...without fuel, electricity or even bowls to eat it out of. Watching your children slowly die of starvation around you. Yet being expected to report to \\"work\\" at a factory with no electricity or materials (and no pay) or face deportation to a labor camp. This was all in a day's life for the North Koreans in this book. I knew nothing about North Korea except that its leader has long been a punch-line in pop culture jokes. After reading this book I no longer find those jokes funny anymore. This is a fascinating story of six North Koreans and their journey from unquestioning acceptance of their fatherland to the dawning realization that there is a whole world outside that's not what they've been told. All six eventually escape from North Korea to tell their stories to author Demick. Demick's journalistic perspective as well as the six individuals' hardy natures keep this story from being self-pitying or overdramatic despite the unimaginable hardships they endured. The life of North Koreans is a combination of a concentration-camp-level existence of privation (albeit without physical bars) plus a \\"1984\\"-level police state that kept citizens in such terror they could not reveal their inmost thoughts, even to their own families, for fear of being sent to a labor camp. It is hard for a Westerner to even take in such a level of privation--your brain almost refuses to accept that this can be real. I was left questioning why, when our schoolchildren learn in detail about Nazi concentration camps, are they not learning about this nation as well and a brutal horror that's still going on in our lifetimes. I am very thankful to Demick for her hard work in bringing these six stories to light and her attention to factual detail and verification of the issues.
B006LSZECO|2.0|While the story engaged me in the beginning, it ended up being pretty far-fetched.  Can't recommend this book at all.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is an essential utility for all android phones. I finally know how much battery life I have to get things done.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The concept of the puzzle series is simple, but becomes more and more delightfully complex as the puzzles get larger (harder).  Try playing against a friend (with the app installed on their own device), especially for the more complex levels -- it's striking what different solutions each of you will come up with!
0142501123|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful!  I can't say enough about it, Dr. Suess has nothing on the authors, but none of their other books hold a candle to this one.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I was excited to read this journey into the realm beyond but it was so cluttered with medical/scientific babble that it became distracting.  I too am a medical professional and the last thing I want to hear about a NDE is rationalization about what could have been the cause.  It happened.  Accept it and move on with the wonder that has been bestowed.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I am madly in love with anything hello Kitty and this game is no exception! Graphics and music are just adorable :)
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This book should be read and re read everytime one needs inspiration, feels down and out or just plain looking for meaning and light through dark moments..This book will teach you how to go through challenges in life with more then just instinct for survival but rather a real zest for life and what you chose to make of it, and how you chose to live it.
B00112GVFO|5.0|What a fun ride! I've read a few of the Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt books, but not this one, so the movie was a treat. It's as colorful and over the top as the rest of his stories are. Stream it with good pic & sound, and some tasty beverages & snacks.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Clearly Stephen King has devised some form of visual hypnosis with the pattern of his words to induce a reader to ignore their spouse, their children, their job, and their sleep patterns just to find out what happens next. I have blazed through this book in the last few days and am left with a pretty cool feeling of exhilaration and wonder like I'm stepping off of an unexpectedly extended roller coaster ride. This was a thrilling read and I highly recommend it!
B0085KGHI6|4.0|A great piece of muisc history and unusual footage shows the Stones in a relaxed mode. If only they could enjoy the same again
B009VB97EY|2.0|This film has some good actors with some hot bods, but the script is awful and the acting isn't much better. The dancing scenes are just okay. I've seen movies that were much sexier even though they showed a lot less skin. I wish I'd listened to what many of the other reviewers said and saved my five bucks.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. On a night I just wanted to zone, I picked it as a mindless show to watch. I expected that it'd be on par with Gigli and I'd do a lot of fast forwarding. Instead, I found the characters like able and the plot believable (or as believable as rom com's can be) enough that I'd recommend it to friends and i'd even write a review. Natalie Portman's acting seemed to pull the cast (way) up, and Ashton Kutcher was a good balance to her role. I don't usually write reviews for movies, let alone about romantic comedy's, but I found this movie to be mis advertised as shallow.  Don't get me wrong, it's no Oscar movie, but it is entertaining and semi empowering / revealing for women in today's society.  Ps. It's definitely not kid-friendly with a title like that
B005LAII08|3.0|After the 2011 Pixar misfire with \\"Cars 2\\" I had expected for Brave to be much better.<br /><br />Only better by a little  Not anywhere near Pixar's USED TO BE great story telling, characters, etc.<br /><br />You follow the story then you go into this weird story line that true you did NOT see coming BUT just went south from there.<br /><br />No spoiler alerts although I will say it had to do with Oscar winner Emma Thompson's Queen Elinor.<br /><br />For a 5 disc set, this SHOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER.  I always look for extras like \\"Making Of\\" on Disney/Pixar films.  NONE here, there are plenty of extras but none of real interest to me.<br /><br />They made a new Disney Princess that just stands out because of her appearance, the red hair.  If you want to go to a GOOD liberated Disney Princess look at 1992's \\"Aladdin\\" for Princess Jasmine.<br /><br />It is a good film but NOT up to usual Pixar stands.  If you want extras on your blu rays you got them but for me just not the type I want.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|It's a nice game if it only it stops freezing and the price.  why is it 4.99 when everyone else pays 2.99
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Movie was quite boring in all. Special effects were okay but not outstanding. A big disappointment in story-line and acting. Oh well, can't enjoy everything!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app largely duplicates what it does on the PC and is my go-to to making my own notes or saving images and web pages for sharing, later use etc. Wish it was more touch screen interactive. No sliding pages or items around but still highly useful. Basically the best way to have ideas and notes follow you around regardless of platform or device.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This is one of those songs that you probably like but are probably embarrassed to tell your friends that you like.  It's ok, I was like that but eventually came around.  Even after hearing the song almost constantly for 4 straight months on the radio, I'm still not quite tired of it (yet).<br /><br />It's definitely a frilly pop song without a whole lot of substance, but it's light listening when you're in the mood for upbeat.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|IT IS TRULY A GREAT MOVIE AND TO WAIT SO LONG FOR IT TO COME OUT ON 3D WAS WORTH THE WAIT.<br />TRULY FANTASTIC.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Recommend to everyone- easy read and amazing story.  Truly “amazing grace“. May God bless Adam‘s family and fellow American warriors.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I have all 5 Twilight soundtracks. I love the mellow, indie, alternative feel of the songs they pick to go with the movies. It makes the movie going experience all the more special. I have to admit though, that none of the songs really had a profound impact on me until I actually had the time to seriously go through and listen to all of it. It's not a soundtrack that will hook you immediately, but it does grow on you. I think the soundtrack was actually quite fitting for the with the exception of \\"The Forgotten\\" by Green Day and the Ellie Goulding song. I love both Green Day and Ellie Goulding respectively, but I don't think their place was on this particular soundtrack. I think the best songs is \\"Speak Up\\" by POP ETC and \\"Everything and Nothing\\" by The Boom Circuits. Overall, it's a good CD, so if you have the other soundtracks you should definitely buy this one as well.
B00926J3K6|5.0|Among the nicest Box Sets to ever be issued by any musical unit. Get it while you can find it.  A Stunning display of presentation, performance, and value. The Video alone is worth half the cost of the box. This is something to celebrate. One of the peaks of 20th Century Music, epic, and timeless.
B001FA0W5W|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Only reason I did not give it 5 is because it is somewhay lacking in flow and can get choppy at tomes. Of course, that is to be somewhat expected as it is more educational vs telling a story.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|I love this game. Hours of play, very addicting. I don't get why they wont get the other puzzle quest games for kindle fire. There are other puzzle quest games, . so come on amazon get the other puzzle quest games. I would definetly buy them.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it's simple to use and downloads super fast. only way this could be better is if I could download videos off other websites too!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for this 3D version. Ever since I saw it at the movies. It is one of the best 3D movies ever made and the Amazon release of the DVD version is excellent. I hightly recommend it to anyone who loves their 3D movies and Science fiction.
B008458O3S|5.0|I already like games like this and I'm still totally addicted. From the moment the home screen loads, you will likely be as impressed with this game as I am.<br /><br />I thought if be annoyed that there is no time limit, but the game gets hard enough without the pressure of a ticking clock. Without the time limit I find the game to be just as relaxing as it is challenging. Logic and physics puzzles are great brain food and Trainyard is pretty dang tasty.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game but I have won everything there is to win and completed every puzzle and the update puzzles too. Give me more more MORE!!!!!!<br />Love this game!
B007A4SDCG|3.0|Starts off in a way that is very easy to understand, and very easy to relate with, then it starts to get a bit odd in the latter end.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Seller was great, product packaging and shipping was awesome as Amazon and their sellers always are. I bought two of these products from two different sellers...one for myself and one as a gift...the product is a little flimsy in so far as the \\"stand\\" product feature goes. As a cover sure but the stand thing, not so much.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I Liked this series better than 50 Shades of Gray.  I Can't wait for the third book in the series.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Aditive app but i want a update because...<br /><br />i have pe like my friend who has minecraft pe on her ipod but she has more bricks, matericals, and other things that i would like to see on here because i payed $7 for this but i would like to see those blocks
0891419063|4.0|It is about our real heroes.My late brother inl law took part in most of these battles and survived to return home.
B002C9ZHCS|5.0|It is not a very common CD, compared with Justin Bieber. But it is what I want. The CD is very well packaged.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Topics are simply arranged; very informative.  Ideas are  time-tested; it's worth applying to situational person-to-person transaction.  Will recommend it to my children and relatives.  The book deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />ill recommend to my children and immediate family.  The book deserves 5 star.-
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I had my doubts about this one but as FAOTD I figured it was worth a try. It's challenging and cute. Would be nice if there was a way to skip the hard levels that aggrivate me but all in all I'm glad I downloaded it.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I really enjoyed this, great sub plots, preferred it to the first fifty shades, a light hearted read. Five stars!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I enjoyed the unusual story and the delightful prose. Moreover it made me laugh a lot. I read the book following the recommendqtion of my husband (who is 80 years old) and of my son (48) who read in a Hebrew translation and laughed for the length of it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is the first 3D movie I've watched on my TV.  Having seen the film twice in an IMAX theater, I was amazed that it could be even better in the home theater.  My only negative comment would be that this edition didn't include the extra footage that was added to the theater version.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|The movie is great.  The people who put this movie together did such a great job!  The Unabridged audio version of the book is now available at Audible.com!  WOO!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Quite simply, I cannot think of a CD that has ever come closer to perfection than this.  Each selection is absolutely incredible, and nearly leaves one speechless at Susan's talent, the beauty of her voice and all its subtleties, her range, her passion, and her soul.  Surely, even thousands of years from now, Susan will be known as one of the greatest singers who ever lived.  Susan, thank GOD you found the courage to go on that show four and a half years ago!<br /><br />One very minor point, although it can't lower the five-star rating:  There are times when the music is just too loud, and you can barely hear Susan.  I want to hear every note that comes out of this lady.  Susan, please don't let them do that to you!<br /><br />Mr. Crawford and Mr. Osmond deserve MUCH credit as well; their duets with Susan are moving and simply wonderful, and very beautifully done.<br /><br />Bravo to all involved in the making of this masterpiece, especially to you, Susan.  You are incomparable.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I am very pleased with this priduct and it gives great protection for the Kindle. A great product for the price.  A+
B008NW67E0|4.0|The majority of the songs are delightful. I'm listening to the CD as we speak. There are some that are ehh, but the ones that are good are really great. I'm so glad I got the whole CD and I can't wait for their next album!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I enjoyed reading The Mark of Athena. It continues the story of the Greek and Roman Gods. It's not deep dark literature but it's a good story and a fun read. Mr Jackson has great imagination and makes his myths fun.
B009JTCBLE|5.0|Any CD with Joe Bonamassa is going to be great, he makes music just like the music that has been around forever.
B003QP4NPE|3.0|Action scenes are very cinematic. Climax, though, disappoints: leaves too many lose ends for the sequels. Will not be reading those.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I truly love the way Philippa Gregory makes English history come alive.  She definitely has a talent for doing that.  I am a long time fan of her books.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I read this years ago and was so happy that I decided to read it again.  Classic book that stands the test of time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The first show was lacking punch -<br />but it is building -<br />they finally have that hook back -<br />new characters and listening to the audience<br />Daryl Rules!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great follow up to Bared to you!  It was a quick and easy read and very hard to put down!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very nice its also challenging to jump and do other stuff but its cool you earn coins to buy new charter I recomed this game to every one I know love this game
0316228532|5.0|JK Rowling's first adult book is certainly a deviation from her Harry Potter series, but her character development and insight into the lives and inner thoughts of the characters is insightful and entertaining.  The book is slow for the first 100 pages or so as she spends time exploring the motivations and personalities of all those involved in the book's plot, but once she sets the stage the second half of the book is captivating and a quick read.  The way she demonstrates how the actions of one character determine the fate of another is impressive and leaves you thinking about the book long after you're done.  Keep reading until the end and you will not be disappointed!!!  Overall, I highly recommend this book.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Even the kids enjoyed listening to the story and letting their imagination draw the pictures. The characters were all read with conviction.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am so happy my friend told me about this kindle for android!!! It's about the cheapest price for ebooks that you can get!!! They have everything you need & their a lot cheaper than Kobe, or any other paying website!!!
B004ZISVWC|5.0|Given what the movie is, and the incredible suspension of disbelief required, I thought this was fantastic.  Obviously it's a bunch of phooey, it's a \\"mocumentary\\", but it was well made, the CGI is very good, and I thought it was terrific. Especially if you can get it free on Amazon Instant with Prime.  However, I'm considering buying a copy of this. I really liked it, and the last several years 99% of any of the movies I watch, from blockbusters to Indie to offbeat stuff, have been very disappointing.  This was a great flick.
B00992CF6W|5.0|even though it doesn't have as much as the computer version, it is still amazing! I am so glad it has beds now.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great storyline, puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, and hints if you get stuck. Wish there were more games like this.Well worth the .99.
0307744434|2.0|Usually I feel that, if you're going to write a review, you should at least finish the book. But honestly, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to. I really want to like this book; the idea of it was interesting. But I'm more than half-way through and it's simply horribly boring. The character development is weak enough that I'm starting to get confused as to who's who, and there really just doesn't seem to be anything happening here--there's no story. There is occasionally some decent descriptive writing, and I've given the book a chance because of that, but I keep waiting for the author to get out of purely descriptive mode and back into the story, and it's just not happening.<br />I'm bored out of my mind here.<br />I hate to write a review like this, because I know this is the author's first novel. But even a first novel should have the basic elements of story-telling in place, no?<br /><br />What's happening in the publishing world these days? I've read so many BAD books in the last couple of years (a few good ones, too, but far too few), and so many of them had really great reviews. Then I pick them up, and wonder if the reviewers read the same version that I did. Usually, the problem seems to be just what this book suffers from--lack of anything resembling strong plot and story.<br /><br />If Ms. Morgenstern writes another, I might give it a chance, in the hope that she develops more as a novelist. But I'll most definitely borrow it from the library rather than spending money for it. And I probably won't give it more than a few chapters to hook me. I have too little time to waste.
B000YDCFUQ|5.0|Great quality boot from Timberland. Runs big...I usually wear a size 13, however, needed a size 12. Overall nothing but the best from Timberland.
0425263916|5.0|The second book was even better than the first.  Eva was so good and strong for her man. Gideon was hotter than ever, can't wait for the third book.
B009VB998I|5.0|Both of my kids absolutely loved this movie. We downloaded it to our TiVo as a two day rental. We got our money worth as they watched it at least 5 times.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|.........didn't love this one though.  Disappointing but it kept me interested enough to about the middle of the book when things picked up.  Not the best of the series, but not bad.
141659521X|5.0|Early on in this book, Mitch suffers a head injury and this allows us to see him open up a bit and we see him coming to understand himself and why he is what he is.<br /><br />The book brings back one of the more crueler and perhaps more complex of the bad guys that Mitch has fought, but this time he is a good guy.<br /><br />The book is the beginning of the end of one of the better characters in the series and that is one of the few times we have seen Mitch show emotions in the entire series.<br /><br />I have read all of his books from the beginning. This is one of his better ones. Buy it, you will not be sorry.
B004HEXSLI|4.0|This is a good book for anyone whose had a stroke or has a loved one whose suffered from a stroke. It's kind of boring to read in parts, but it's very informative & helpful!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I got this game because my best friends daughter has it on her nook and I thought I would give it a try. its an ok game, better because its free.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|What can I say? G5 did it again! What a novel idea, letting us choose between hidden objects or the classic tile game. It should go without saying that the graphics were outstanding, storyline captivating &amp; length of playtime outshines all other developers. This is G5 in your face! What a nice surprise to find out the bonus extras included a minigame that lasts longer than some other games I bought. G5 never disappoints &amp; always delivers the best. Looking forward to spending more of my hard-earned money with this developer.
006197806X|5.0|So much action and twists to the story. I couldn't put it down! I hope we don't have to wait long for the 3rd book.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Love it. It is easy to use and gives me the content that I want with very little effort. I am extremely happy with this app.
B007857FOO|3.0|Nothing wrong with the movie itself but the &#34;wedding dress edition&#34; was not what I got. I got just the normal dvd case.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I enjoyed this book and everything in it. I completely agree with Mr. Luttrell and his entire argument. The bravery these men fight with is unmatched.
0061726834|5.0|It took me a few chapters to really get interested in this 1st book but I am glad I stuck with it. I really enjoyed this book.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|this book is awesome. i could not put it down. i highly recommend it. it starts with kvothe as a child an tells his life as he grows, from the streets of Tarbean to entering the University, to gaining access to the best music place in town. It has a great vocabulary. Amazing.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|The effects are amazing for its time. Story compelling. If you enjoy this and get a chance go see, check out  Return to Forbidden Planet Shakespeare's Lost Rock and Roll Musical.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My friends and I had a great time with it! I'd draw or write on her shirt and then scan it! I draw on random things and then scan them! It's fun!
B008PCVGKI|5.0|Another fantastic and eye opening book by Dr Goldacre that I think should be an essential part of every medical students curriculum! The only downside for this novel is that I think it has less of a wider appeal to those outside the health care industry... but I would still recommend it! It is a great way to learn how easily influenced we are by pharm marketing and what we can do to avoid it!
B000O176Q6|5.0|I' m a BIG Bruce Lee fan, so there will be nothing negative to say about this DVD but good things. Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly, Jonny Saxton, Bob Wall, Chinese Hercules  all were great in this seventies classic. Pick up today if your a big Kung-Fu freak of film. Believe me you won't regret it!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Sharif
B0076NAW48|5.0|Still a great CD.
B00340ESIS|3.0|This book is kinda difficult I believe, and would not recommend to just anyone. I purchase this book for my IPad sometime ago and I have the hard copy, but I'm not impress .<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Sharif
B001L5VYFI|5.0|This was the first download to my new Kindle Fire HD.  Great sound.  Amazon was very helpful in helping me get the download completed to my cloud.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I have one complaint about sketchbook (any version) and it's that its maximum amount of layers is only 6. As someone who likes many, many layers in all of my art programs (like photoshop & corel), I feel almost restricted by autodesk sketchbook apps. I know it's unfair to compare mobile apps to pc ones, but how can you not?<br /><br />Even after all I've griped about, I still think this app is worth every cent I paid for it. The difference between this version and the mobile version is leaps and bounds. You have more brush options, more technical options (scaling, alignment & shape guides), to having a fail safe option of saving your work before starting anew. I don't necessarily want to be treated like a child with \\"are you sure you don't want to save first?\\"... but after having the mobile version where that option didn't exist, I no longer mind being childish.<br /><br />I like the layout of this version better as well because it doesn't start up with the radial options. Buttons/options are more available and concise. Much of the guess work out of what a button's functions were has been removed or cosolidated in a logical way... All around the pro version is just more synergistic and easier to use.<br /><br />Finally, if you have a stylus or stylus/paintbrush you'll be in for a treat. It might just be me, but this version seems more intuitive to my brush strokes. Again, definitely worth buying this app for that reason and every other I just mentioned.<br /><br />-------------<br />**EDIT**<br />-------------<br />The problem I was having with the 6 layer maximum has since been blown out of the water after the latest updates. Now I can use Sketchbook Pro on my Galaxy Note 2, and the layer problem goes away. The 6 layer maximum issue was (thankfully) device specific to my Kindle Fire HD 7\\". On my GN2, I've never run out of layers! BEST DRAWING APP EVER!!!<br /><br />Edit 7/29/13: Latest update has added more brushes, symbols and textures. If you've ever used Autodesk's 3D texturing program Mudbox, you'll recognize familiar (IMO) textures the base program provides (versus textures you make yourself). If only this program could import/export .obj, and you could turn their textures into opacity maps!? That would be an extension I'd pay extra for... AND with the ease of Autodesk (over Maya and/or Zbrush U.I.)? Heaven!k's 3D texturing program Mudbox, you'll recognize familiar (IMO) textures the base program provides (versus textures you make yourself). If only this program could import/export .obj, and you could turn their textures into opacity maps!? That would be an extension I'd pay extra for...

B00979CS50|5.0|I love Neil Young and Crazy Horse,  He has been a favorite of mine every since he was part of Crosby, Still, Nash, and Young.  Great sound and easy to order from Amazon.
B004LUS390|3.0|Any artist that has used photoshop before knows about the &quot;layer&quot; system, and is a bit spoiled from using it... I know I am because this app's 6 layer maximum frustrates me to no end. I'm left saving my art and then compressing my layers as a makeshift fail safe. I realize there won't be the same layer customization system in a mobile app as a pc program... but it always leaves you wanting more. Also, this is an autodesk product and not an adobe one. If you've used an autodesk product like 3d max or mudbox, you know autodesk functions can be fairly elusive for a beginner, and with each update, more elusive for the expert. This layout reminds me of the zbrush program in that it even makes it hard for the user knowing where the &quot;save&quot; button is located PLUS there is no autosave feature. I had to do my first drawing over 3 times because I couldn't find the save, and looking through the help guide (in the middle of your project) resets the program. My advice to anyone who gets this app is to save often, and create multiple iterations of your file before you even think about collapsing layers!
8866131369|5.0|This product was shipped on time and i am very happy with it. I have no complaints at all. good

B00003CXXJ|5.0|I love this movie! Shrek is fun to watch young or old! The movie came quickly in the mail! I am very happy with the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My daughter got us hooked on this series. Even my husband loves it!Not too soap operaish or corny. It really is interesting and seems to be accurate in portraying history.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The book was a easy read, and did not bore you with details that did not matter. Would like to let everyone know, if they don't read they have missed a GREAT BOOK
B0000AUHPB|5.0|The original \\"Italian Job\\" starring Michael Caine is still a great movie, and in my opinion better then the later remake. The driving is fantastic, and overall the movie is a delight.
1451695195|1.0|In summary, this book does not provide any proof of anything what so ever.<br /><br />I was skeptical of this book but when discussing with someone the argument was that I had not read it so I could not judge it.  So I purchased the kindle version for my PC, opened the book on one monitor, opened my editor on the other, and read the book writing my comments for each chapter. When complete I had fourteen pages of comments.<br /><br />In several places I felt like I was reading a \\"new age\\" book.  Everything is all one, everything connected, and all is wonderful.  New Age was all nonsense.  So are those sections.<br /><br />A second similarity is found is descriptions of experiences written by those who have experienced drug induced hallucinations.  In each one the user attempts to describe how wonderful and connected everything is, but generally also admits to an almost complete inability to describe their event.  Several passages of the book remind me of this.  The valuable information derived from the drug induced hallucinations and from Alexander's descriptions amount to the same, nothing.<br /><br />In Chapter 15 he writes:  \\"The view of human consciousness held by most scientists today is that it is composed of digital information-- data, that is, of essentially the same kind used by computers.\\"<br /><br />Absolutely Not.  In my notes I consume much space disputing this.  To be brief in the extreme, computers are linear devices able to comprehend only 0 and 1, Yes and No.  The human brain is immensely complex and is distinctly non-linear.  How the brain thinks is controls my many hormones, proteins, etc. The computer is controlled by ones and zeroes.  Most scientists of today have no such opinion.<br /><br />Just for the record, I am a rocket science engineer. (not a scientist).  I configure computer systems and write software for aerospace and have done work of this sort so for a long time.<br /><br />Once blind, now I see.  Alexander takes this concept and usesit to say, in my words, not his: \\"Because I was once like you, and disbelieved, and now have converted over, I should have a greater standing that other people.  As a result you should believe me more than someone else.\\"<br /><br />I found this concept in several places in his book.  He wrote a nice story, and even had a good poem at the end.  But from his experience, he did not bring back any new \\"truth\\" that can be examined, verified, and found to be true or false.<br /><br />The book is a nice read of his experience if you are of that mindset.  But it proves absolutely nothing.
0375507256|5.0|I first saw the movie and was very entertained but somewhat confused, so I read the book and now am completely satisfied. Great story/stories and a real thought provoker!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I have never seen any of the Twilight movies and that was deliberate on my part. Not my thing. OK, nothing wrong with that, each to his/her own. All the pictures I have seen of Kristen Stewart have shown one basic expression and I more or less thought \\"yeah, whatever, she's pretty, so what?\\" I had read a couple of reviews concerning her acting (or lack thereof) so was hesitant to see the movie. However, I like Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth seemed pretty good so I and a friend watched it.<br /><br />I don't watch a movie to tear it apart. I watch it for entertainment and how I FEEL while watching it. Let's face it, Charlize Theron stole the show. She was magnificent! I almost found myself rooting for her but she had clearly gone all the way over to the dark side.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!!!<br /><br />It did eventually become clear that she had experienced some major bad stuff at the hands of men, some at a very young age, and that her mother placed this spell on her but she went over the edge. Way, way over the edge. However she did it in a very belivable way as you could watch her going downhill.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth was very good as the Huntsman. You could see his agony and his need to drown his sorrows. I felt his Scottish was rather good and enjoyed that part very much. I was very disturbed to discover they CGI'd the dwarves. Why not use real actors? However, I enjoyed them very much and they did a wonderful job. Sam Claflin was good too and was downright wicked with the bow.<br /><br />Now we come to Kristen Stewart. OK, she's not the best actress. In a world that demands perfection in every way people want their entertainment perfect and to take them over the edge. (And yet, what about all those grade D cult movies that are nothing but death and gore? The acting is certainly not top of the line for them!) Having said that, what I saw was perhaps not the best FACIAL expresssions, but her body clearly expressed what she was doing. She's actually a pretty good body actess. When I took my attention off her face to how her body expressed what she was delivering I found it made a big difference. Not everyone can be the perfect person everyone else wants them to be and I thought she did a good job. It's my perception she doesn't lack emotional depth, she lacks the ability to express it on her face. In my mind there is a difference.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it again. This is not the Disney fairy tale, this is a gritty, dark, and occasionally disturbing but enjoyable movie where the good guys win again.

I am not being picky, the sound is just distorted at times.

1250027624|4.0|If you are a fan of the series, you need this book.  Beautifully complements the show with photos from tHe production, as well as historical background info that helps round out the characters and grounds the show into the time period of the Jazz Age.  One caveat: this does contain some spoilers, so if this is for a gift, make sure the recipient is at least familiar up through the second season.  All in all though, this is a nice book and a must-have for fans.

B009A9EPLM|5.0|JFK.  NIXON.  And now...  LINCOLN.  What do they all have in common?  Composer John Williams scoring them.  This is another, in a long line of the Steven Spielberg/John Williams collaborations.  Majestic and intimate.  Film music does not get much better than this.  Needless to say...  One of the best scores of 2012.  You will not be disapponted.

B002RI9SC4|4.0|I love this saga and I loved the ending. The twilight saga is the ultimate vampire saga where the heroine could be you or me or any other ordinary woman. We can all imagine ourselves as strong and fearless as Bella when confronted with the possibility of having to fight for the lives of our love or our child. We can envision that it is us who is chosen by the charismatic male vampire as his life long mate. It is our life that is changed for ever and our reality that is altered from the mundane to the incredible.  As for the wonderful concept of being frozen in time as a perfect teenager, who actually becomes completely perfect through the process of transformation as a vampire, it is undeniably attractive. I lie in bed and imagine I am Bella and am transported into her world and I fantasise about how I would use her power, wealth and omnipotence.  I would recommend this book and indeed the entire series to anyone who enjoys reading to escape into the realm of fantasy and magic.

141659521X|4.0|I have been a long fan of Vince Flynnn's Mitch Rapp series, probably one of a few readers in Korea buying immediately on the day of first circulation. I am happy to see that finally Mitch Rapp has returned to the present from ealier stages of his career in the previous two episodes. The previous ones were not boring but nothing unusual but continued story of a super national hero in the making. The today's story continues with never compomizing pattern of a natinal hero to serve his country. I sometimes think the reason I like this one very much is its crudeness and manhood. In action point, it is similar to Daniel Silva's Gabriel Allon in the patriotism but different style in execution. Unfortunately, we do not see many of these dedicated men to serve his country any more. At least in the fiction, we see and dream there will be better days tommorrow with these unseen heroes protecting us, if not I can not become them. Vince Flynn's story line has been always crude and straightfoward compared with Daniel Silva's subtlety and sophication of human sentiment. But I liked Vince Flynn and his product as they are. It is simply a different taste.<br /><br />He writes a new episode once a year which is not too often compared with David Baldacci and Steward Wood who flood the story after story sometimes without sustance. I want him to write more often of this series.  But at the same time, even despite this careful production control once a year for now, I see too many textural errors. He or his team could have done better if they reviewed more than what they had done to minimize errors before the final publication. I have no other complaints other than the poor quality control of the final product. Many faults go to his production team but he also needs more careful review by himself.
B000001FI7|5.0|From the first thirty seconds of \\"Mysterons\\" or so, which are comprised of a wailing Theremin, frenetic turntables, and an eerie guitar that sounds like it was recorded underwater, you know you're in for a very cryptic and very stratified musical experience.  Such is the entirety of Dummy.  Never once across the album's eleven tracks is the band satisfied with repeating themselves.  While \\"Sour Times\\" and \\"Numb\\" sound like appropriate backdrops for a noir spy flick, \\"It Could Be Sweet\\" is a sexy and sedated take on the jazzy sounds of Sade.  \\"Wandering Star,\\" although the single repetitive (and as such, weakest) track on Dummy, bears the quintessential underpinnings of trip-hop:  the genre Portishead pioneered along with Massive Attack, whose music was more influenced by hip-hop and R&B.  Portishead borrow more from film music (\\"Sour Times\\") and smoky jazz (\\"Pedestal\\").  The best songs are the ones that veer farthest from standard trip-hop stylings - particularly \\"Roads,\\" a dirge that evokes many highway drives on sleepless nights, and hit \\"Glory Box,\\" which combines the scratchiness of a 7-inch with Nina Simone-channeled vocals, courtesy of the always compelling Beth Gibbons, and bluesy guitar solo.<br /><br />The song that seems to stick out the most is the relatively upbeat \\"It's a Fire.\\"  This track wasn't part of the original pressing of Dummy, only surfacing on the American edition.  It's also a terrific song, serving as the linchpin between the album's two halves, and I couldn't imagine it not being a part of the album's sequence.<br /><br />Highlights: \\"Mysterons,\\" \\"Sour Times,\\" \\"It's a Fire,\\" \\"Roads,\\" \\"Glory Box\\"

1439102732|3.0|I'm glad I read this book. There were several lines and paragraphs that I highlighted because Picoult's characters are able to articulate thoughts or feelings about sexuality, religion, and the way we experience music, in ways that I hadn't thought of before. I will want to come back and reread those lines. There was plenty in here that made me think, and I am grateful for that and to Jodi Picoult for writing books that help me question and redefine my belief systems.<br /><br />That being said, I did not particularly enjoy this book. There seemed to be weaknesses in all of the arguments that were not addressed and that I found frustrating. And I also just found it somehow a little dull. I can't quite articulate what it was, but I never picked the book back up because I couldn't wait to keep reading. I picked it up because it was there and then I wanted to finish it. For me, that tends to indicate weak writing.<br /><br />So overall, I have mixed feelings. It was an okay book that, for the most part I didn't love, but it included some gems that, for me, made it worth reading.

We weren't expecting an accurate history and were willing to embrace the absurdity of the idea. It seemed like it could be fun. But it was just so boring! Even the special effects were predictable. We gave up when 38 minutes were left and then asked one another why we waited that long.

B007REV4T8|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  This is Daniel Craig's third performance as James Bond--why can't it be his last? Craig is a decent actor who should never have been cast as James Bond in the first place. He's certainly excellent when it comes to the physical requirements of the job as it appears he doesn't shy away from giving it his all in the action scenes. But he exudes little wit which is a key component of this iconic role. This is borne out by Craig's reported professed desire to have his contract bought out since he's been quoted as saying that he finds acting as James Bond to be \\"boring\\".<br /><br />  For a James Bond film to be successful, it needs the three g's (Good girls, gadgets and a Goldfinger). Skyfall pretty much fails in all three departments. Take the 'girls' for instance. Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny is quite pleasant to look at but is given little to do here as agent in the field turned secretary. Initially, we're led to believe that she'll be an integral part of the plot, Bond's 'point man' in the exciting chase scene where he battles mercenary/assassin Patrice on top of a speeding train. After botching the shot that takes out Bond instead of Patrice (how Bond survives the shot and subsequent fall off a bridge is never really explained), Eve is relegated to office work and has little more direct interaction with Bond for the rest of the film.<br /><br />  Then there's B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Lim Marlohe as S&eacute;v&eacute;rine, a concubine of sorts of the Skyfall villain, Raoul Silva. Unfortunately Marlohe does not get the opportunity to show her stuff as an independent 'Bond woman' as she is petrified of Silva and hints that she will soon meet her own demise. There is a perfunctory shower scene with Bond on her yacht which is mercifully short. The end comes rather quickly when Silva dispatches S&eacute;v&eacute;rine on the island with a bullet to the head. It would have been much more tasteful if Director Sam Mendes had chosen to depict the killing off screen but when has Sam Mendes ever been known for being tasteful?<br /><br />  As far as gadgets, 'Skyfall' is even more disappointing in that department. The young and geeky Ben Wishaw, has now taken up the mantle of a modern day 'Q', the quartermaster of the MI6 spy service. He even spells it out quite succinctly when he tells Bond there are no fancy gadgets this time around. Instead, we're left with a miniature radio tracking device and a gun that will not fire unless it recognizes Bond's palm print. Q of course is a computer expert and he stands around trying to hack into bad guy's computer or prevent being hacked himself. The yawn factor is in full force as we've been privy to all this computer mumbo-jumbo, oh so many times before!<br /><br />  Finally there's a 'Goldfinger': If the Bond antagonist is not larger than life, with the much needed ubiquitous charm, it's hardly likely that a Bond film can be truly successful. Unfortunately, Javier Bardem as the aforementioned Silva, hardly inspires confidence as a truly endearing Bond villain. Silva is merely a former MI6 agent who improbably was given up by M (Judi Dench) to the Chinese in exchange for a coterie of MI6 double agents. His goal is to take revenge on M as he blames her for his subsequent imprisonment and torture at the hands of MI6 opponents.<br /><br />  For some reason, Silva acquires super powers of sorts after being released by the Chinese and now has the ability to hack into any computer, resulting first in the ridiculous theft of a list of all undercover NATO agents in terrorist organizations and subsequent bombing of MI6 headquarters itself. If that isn't absurd enough, computer genius Silva escapes from MI6 custody and then attacks politicians where M is giving testimony at a public inquiry.<br /><br />  'Skyfall' of course does not refer to jumping out of a plane but rather, Bond's family estate where he grew up as a child. After Silva's failed try at assassinating M at the public inquiry, she decides the only way to capture the former agent is leave an electronic trail (facilitated by Q) where Silva can find her. Holed up at Skyfall is Bond, M and Kincade, the gamekeeper at the estate. Silva attacks in two waves: the first is a group of his henchmen, all wiped out by Bond and company, utilizing primitive weapons found inside the Bond mansion (how crazy Silva manages to get all his confederates to follow him, is a mystery to me). Silva then makes his grand appearance via a helicopter, which of course is shot down after Bond detonates a couple of gas canisters. Later, Bond falls through the ice and engages in a death struggle with Silva's last henchman. Like the earlier scene where he survives Eve's errant shot, it's unclear how Bond manages to extricate himself from the icy pond, after being submerged in icy water for so long.<br /><br />  I suppose it is appropriate that Silva should meet his end not as a result of a technological advantage but simply due to the flick of an old-fashioned knife into the back. There are other satisfying moments in 'Skyfall' including some dazzling opening credits, a sultry opening number sung by Adele, the aforementioned Bond/Patrice fight on top of the speeding train, lovely panoramas shot in Istanbul and Shanghai, another unlikely but exciting train crash in the London Underground and the big fight to the death action scenes on the Skyfall estate.<br /><br />  I have no idea whether Judi Dench also wanted out of her contract and it was her suggestion to finish off 'M' with her playing the role. Let's hope that Mr. Craig follows suit and the producers then conscript new writers and a director. With a new team, the next 'Bond' can be much better than this current hokey effort.he decides the only way to capture the former agent is leave an electronic trail (facilitated by Q) where Silva can find her.

B002GYVRRI|4.0|`Red' is the final recorded work of the 1972-74 Bruford-Wetton-Cross era King Crimson, released in 1974 following the demise of this high-achieving line-up.<br /><br />Though he had already quit the band, violinist David Cross plays on the jazz-style `Providence'; former band members Mel Collins and Ian McDonald (both sax players) and oboist Robin Miller also contributed to the sessions, their presence felt most strongly on the long closing track `Starless.'<br /><br />The essential meat of the album is the power-trio Fripp, Wetton and Bruford with added garnish from the other contributors - those named above plus others un-credited, to add flavour and variety.  The album contains only five numbers, the middle three bookended by the raunchy, full-on title-track opener and the phenomenal closer `Starless', usually regarded as the signature tracks of the collection. This is powerful music and if some of this band's previous creations seemed to occasionally stray into rebellious and nihilistic territory, then here they lose all inhibitions and let go with confidence and gusto to release all the pent-up energy.<br /><br />On the 2009 `40th Anniversary' re-issue (to commemorate the foundation of the original band, not the 40th anniversary of `Red') sound wizard Steven Wilson again vindicates his deserved reputation for coaxing the best from these old analogue-tape recordings. The DVD features a 5.1 DTS mix of the entire contents of the CD (best appreciated by those with real-deal surround-sound systems) plus high-res stereo mixes, and some rarely-seen performances of the band from French TV in 1974.<br /><br />The booklet offers period photos of the band from the 1970s, mostly in monochrome, and up-to-date sleeve notes from Bob Fripp and Sid Smith; fans however are unlikely to find much new or revealing content in the text. The striking deep-shadow original monochrome cover photo features just the Fripp-Bruford-Wetton trio in a picture the band reportedly referred to as `The good, the bad and the ugly' - though they never let on which was which.<br /><br />If you want this classic piece of musical history in your collection, this is the one to go for and even if you have previous versions, it's still worth buying. Now it sounds even better than ever, and the package on offer is a great deal.`The good, the bad and the ugly' - though they never let on which was which.<br /><br />If you want this classic piece of musical history in your collection, this is the one to go for and even if you have previous versions, it's still worth buying.

B008ULM7HU|5.0|\\"Duran Duran: The Biggest And The Best\\" is a two cd collection that features 17 songs on each cd. I was previously fortunate to be familiar with their music from one of their other greatest hits collections and their strong performance from an autumn 2011 concert.  I completely understand that others may have different personal favorites from this cd, but I would personally list \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\", \\"Faith In This Colour\\", \\"New Religion\\", \\"Meet El Presidente\\" and \\"Chaffeur\\" as some of my personal favorites from cd one. \\"A View To A Kill\\", \\"Notorious\\", \\"A Matter Of Feeling\\", and \\"Save A Prayer\\" are among some of my personal favorites from cd two.  Many of these classics are from the 80's era and are best for those who like 80's pop/new wave music.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|This is a must read for anyone interested in success stories but more importantly on how anyone can succeed and achieve anything in life as well.  Like most people I thought that Arnold S. was just another Hollywood story from busing tables to stardom.  Boy was I surprise and engulf in the reading of this book from the get go.  While reading his side of the story (Arnold's life from his stand point of view) I realize that there was more depth to this man on how he approaches life (not that he was always right, but determined), and even though he paints himself as impatient person, I think that his determination to succeed makes him patient enough to know that to achieve anything in life you have to wait for the right moment to climb to the next step.  As you see in his story he reach pinnacles in 4 very distinctive arenas; Sports-Body Building, Movie Actor, Politics-Governor, Business and Investments, making him one of my favorite hero's of modern time.

B009LDXQGW|5.0|Honestly, I'm no hipster, but when I first heard House Of Balloons it was I think right before Drake tweeted about Abel. I feel in love with that tape. it was the only thing I played. When Thursday came out, I could not describe how happy I was. When Echoes of Silence dropped, I knew I'd buy anything this guy sent my way.<br /><br />Well, when he announced Trilogy was going to be a re-package, I wasn't so sure If I was going to go for it. I decided to Pre-Order because I felt like I owed him.. and Believe me, paying for music isn't something I usually do..<br /><br />Honestly, I have some problems with what was changed in production. The vocals sound as if they are all live.. it's not exactly how I wanted them to sound but I can get past it.<br />Some of the instruments used are gone.. That one clap in \\"XO/THE HOST\\" had to be the best part of of Illangelo and Doc's masterpiece, but they sadly replaced it with a  more simple clap.. thats just one example though.<br /><br />Let me just point out the 3 remasters I hate.<br />The Birds Part 1, Part 2, and Same Old Song.<br /><br />whats sad is that I honestly loved those songs the most.. idk. with the effects they moved around in those songs, i feel like they lost a lot of magic and life.<br /><br />I can't say I don't like them though. That's the thing.. If i were to listen to all these songs for the first time, I probably would have loved them.<br /><br />So if you're an OG fan  trying to hear them with a little extra bass and maybe having some things switched around, go ahead and buy this. You'll proly still love it.<br /><br />If you're a new listener, you're going to have no problem with the switches and you'll love this.<br /><br />.... Just buy the damn thing already. It's amazing.<br /><br />Did I mention the 3 new songs are beautiful?
B009DJB9HC|5.0|I've been listening to Glenn Hughes since Trapeze. I loved when he was in Deep Purple.<br />Burn is one of the best hard rock albums of all time! I think he has one of the best<br />voices in rock history. His songwriting is so diverse between hard rock funk blues<br />that nobody can touch him. His music history should be as big as anybody in rock n roll.<br />It's ashame more people don't know him. Joe Bonamassa really is extrodinary as usual.<br />I hear so many Gary Moore influences in his style and playing but maybe that's just me.<br />Bonham and Sherdian are awesome as well and the band gels so well together. The fact<br />they recorded this live and in a few days is amazing. It would be ashame if BCC doesn't<br />record another album as rumors are they have broken up as Hughes and Bonamassa seem to<br />be having a war that Bonamassa is spending too much time on solo career which I agree.<br />How many people get to be in this situation? he could do both but BCC should be his<br />first priority or just do the solo thing. BCC should be touring and promoting album.<br />Music this good shouldn't go to waste! come on Bonamassa your the luckest guy on the planet!
B004U8VWLE|1.0|This is the kind of over-touted movie that shows up the endless film-industry award season for what it really is: oleaginous self-promotion. It fosters the notion that each year mainstream Hollywood produces so many wondrous works of art that it is nail-bitingly difficult to decide which to honor, when in fact most years Hollywood produces none.<br /><br />Soon, no one, not even the critics whose quotes adorned the ads, will remember why they liked this film, or want to. It's a pretty dreary, cliche-ridden supposed thriller about naked stage ambition, overflowing with shoddy performances and unimaginatively choreographed dancing (most of which wasn't even performed by the stars, though the studio went to great lengths to pretend that it was and deny credit to the actual dancers). Natalie Portman's -- she of the tear-stained Oscar -- main contribution was to starve herself for several months to achieve the appropriate level of emaciation to look convincing as a ballet diva. She does, but that's about all she does.

B006T5FDLG|5.0|Its like Metallica of old.  I have not been a fan for a couple of years now, and then they came out with album.  Reminded me of old Metallica and how much their sound rocks.
B0065RIJ3W|4.0|It is easy to read for people who want to be a aquaponic begainner !!! Clear Step by Step !!
B0002ADXYI|4.0|I purchased very eavy in 72 when I was fifteen.to say that the sound quality of this remaster is a improvement would be a huge understatement! much better dynamic range,cleaner stronger bass and extra tracks.a classic album better than you have heard it before.
0425263908|4.0|Read this after 50 Shades of Grey. Great way to keep the mental and sexual appetite going! Great reading.  Carolyn G
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The usual legal romp. Perhaps a bit more light hearted than usual, but still a page turner and difficult to put down.
B0058YPILY|5.0|So excited for this. I love Criminal Minds. Great Season, and the characters develop more. I can't wait for season 8.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love these books! They have jumped into second place for my favorite books of all time behind Jane Eyre.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|What a great book, it was a great read with many ups and downs, but in the end you saw the love and happiness that was deserved!  Thank you for sharing your life with us, I am forever changed.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I only played this one night and it was a lot of fun.  The problem was that I played it before I went to bed and it got the adrenalin flowing and it was hard to go to sleep.  I will play this game during the day from now on, but it is fun.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|An amazing story, perfectly paced, with great character development. Rick delivers a fantastic book once again. The anticipation of the next book is killing me!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I love the TV show, love the characters and actors, so I thought the book would be fun to read.  At first, it was, because I pictured the TV actors in my mind as I was reading.  But I kept losing interest in the story and found that each day I didn't care much about reading anymore.  I eventually stopped reading the book about half way thru.  Maybe I will pick it up again someday, but it was just not exciting for me.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Great Game,  better the angry birds.  Once beat all the levels i have spent hours and hours just building things
B004KKX814|5.0|Absolutely love this one. My son was super excited about receiving it. He is a huge Beyblade fan. It's kept him occupied for a long time.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Bought this CD after purchasing the newer MUSE CD because I wanted to hear more from this great band.  I was not disappointed as this is another great CD from this awesome band.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I bought this standing case to go along with my Kindle Fire HD 7 and it's great.  I can adjust the standing case easily depending on my angle.  It's very sturdy and stays in place.  My Kindle is well protected.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|I first experienced Lana Del Rey on Youtube due to a coworker (she and I have similar musical tastes) telling me how much she loves Del Rey.  Well, the youtube video I found was the SNL performance and I literally said \\"WTF?\\" and moved on. I really didn't \\"get\\" why people were crazy over her. About a week ago my local Independent radio station played \\"Blue Jeans\\" and I was like \\"Hey, I like this...\\" and they said Del Rey was the artist and my previous WTF was still true but this time? A positive WTF!?!<br /><br />Of course, came home and purchased the album and have been playing it over and over.  Of course, I have downloaded [[ASIN:B00A0HQ7H8 Paradise [Explicit]]] and have been listening to both albums non stop.  I am in love.  I have been official \\"Del Reyed\\" and really am addicted to her voice.  Is she manufactured? Eh.  Maybe.  Doesn't change the fact I am loving her voice and lyrics.  I am loving it.
0312945973|5.0|Well this story starts out a little slow but once it gets going it's great! It is told in the first-person from the point of view of Taita, the slave. The author makes it easy for you to understand the character's frustrations, feelings of loss, joy, and sarcasm. Yes, at times it is a little unrealistic how he is always smarter than everyone else, but what Smith does again is create a great adventure story so that makes up for it.<br />The author had to add the requisite love/romance subplot which I could do without. There is some great humor in the story as well and of course it is so well written like Smith's work is known to be. I can't wait to read<br />The Seventh Scroll next!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Slow and rambling. The movie trailer looks beautiful and will see movie next week. Would not recommend book to anyone.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I really enjoyed this album. From beginning to end it is a great mix with a little variety of style from the country sound to a little bit of pop.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is addictive and crazy.  I love it and don't plan to stop playing. even my little bros luv it
052118939X|5.0|As a foreigner who speaks english for almost twenty years, it's hard to find ways to keep developing, and also correct mistakes that comes with years without any real practice. In that matter, this grammar is perfect.
0688101364|5.0|Really delicious, great for the holidays.  I would definitely recommend this cookbook for those who love to bake.  Lots of decadent cookies.
B004UPAIDK|5.0|Cult classic, best one in the series for it's use of dark comedy and campy special effects. Bruce Campbell is perfect for this role with his wild facial expressions and use of prop comedy. This movie will be timeless and still enjoyable in another 30 years.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Definitely a very enjoyable book. This was a book I didn't like to put down, gave me trouble sleeping cause the plot was whirling around in my head and then I planned the next day around activities that would allow me to pick it back up as often as possible. It's not the mystery you think it might be but still gives you great satisfaction. Most of the characters seem very real/plausible and behave in ways that are appropriate -- there was one or two that seemed a bit caricaturist. And the epilogue, while it was quickly run through almost like a laundry list, also gave great satisfaction.<br /><br />I hope this one gets a sequel and prequel if the author can do them justice!!
0984183523|4.0|Hoping to get into Management Consulting without reading this book is like hoping to be Usain Bolt without running!!!<br />This book helped me a lot in my understanding of the Management Consulting interview process. The only negative point I would mention is the lack of chapter on \\"Brainteasers\\".
1592536913|4.0|This is a beautiful book with many creative steam punk pieces, but I was really interested in clothing and that section wasn't that big. Overall, it's a very reasonably priced, well done book.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app puts me to sleep in just minutes every night. I have it on both my phone and my kindle fire.
B008S4FZHI|4.0|Overall it was a good book. I love Patricia Cornwall novels and especially the Scarpetta series. However, I am finding the most recent ones are feeling a little repetitive. I find I am rushing to get to the end to get to the most interesting part. A lot of the earlier books in the series tend to have more substance throughout the novel, whereas this one tended to drag a little bit and it felt a bit anticlimactic at the end. All the action happened fast and in a page or two and then it was back to narrative before the end.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it tells me the battery so when I need to know to charge it or not, I know how much too! thanks smallte.ch!!!!! ;))))
B00913P6G0|5.0|The album is very thorough cover to cover and the deluxe edition is even better. Definitely one of the best albums of our time.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I would not spend $2.99 on this game.  it froze on me in chapter 16.  The overall game is mediocre.  the graphics are good but not great.
1611761069|2.0|Maybe it's the delivery and tone of the audio book's narration that drips with malice and anger, but the extreme persecution complex distracts from the actual story. What a shame. I don't expect Scarpetta to be full of sunshine, but as a woman who works in a male-dominated field I've found that it's possible to be even minimally civil and very good at your job. Seems unnecessary to go to such lengths to show that the entire world thinks she's a b!tch. Even her husband and the man who has the most confusingly long crush in history don't seem to like her.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a great book for those of us who want reassurance that our earthly life is not the end.  Dr. Alexander offers experiences from one who is an expert in the field of brain studies, and who cannot dismiss what has happened to him as merely something brought on by biological factors in the brain.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show pushes my limits. Not the creepy scary &#34;zombie&#34; flick type, that makes  you laugh, but I see these people going through real struggles and learning how to rely on each other. They are becoming accustomed to losing members of their group.We get to see factions devolve into a more primitive society. I watch the show and some parts really make me uncomfortable. But, I cannot wait till the next episode.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|bought this game for my 5 yr old and 3 year old. they always want to play my cooking games but couldn't understand them. this one is perfect. very worth $2
B007PVHANM|5.0|Rastaman Vibration ...  For Those about Peace & Love to all Nations , Reggae Roots among the Greatest  Jamaican Kings of Reggae .
B000W44IZW|5.0|Simply a beautiful movie about apnea diving and dolphins....  The actor, specially Jean Reno is great.  l always cry at the end.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Fun story, vivid characters.  Ending is a bit too abrupt._  A bit more reflection by the hero would have been interesting.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Fantastic story, fantastic 80's history, I was really sorry for the book to end.  If you remember any part of the 80's you'll enjoy this romp through the memories as the story unfolds.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had watched this book on the best seller list and read a review long before I bought it for Kindle. Everything written about it was true. It was truely captivating. I read it in a day and a half. HIGHLY recomend for anyone who likes a good mystery.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am about half way through with this book and am not impressed. I find this book hard to follow,unlike the Harry Potter books that were so hard to put down. With all the English terms I find myself having to use the dictionary on my Kindle to find the meaning of simple words. Maybe it will get better.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Loved every song on this CD. Absolutely breathtaking. The beauty and versatily of Susan's voice is showcased beyond any of her previous albums. All I can say is WOW!
1451696191|5.0|For those who do not see how inspiring this book is, may have some problems.  Of course everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and i completely respect all opinions. Some may not like this book because it features gay people. Look past that or look into that. They are normal people like us. The fact that the book has a gay relationship in it shows how down to earth and awesome the author is.  This book truly lays out high school life years ago. I don't know about you, but this book truly opened my eyes. When I saw the movie trailer a few months ago, I looked online to see if there was a book and sure enough there was. I recommend more people do that, reading a book will really change your perspective on tthings.  Obviously an A+ smiley face star.
B007TKBE40|5.0|I used to listen to rock-a-billy fridays on KEXP-FM in Seattle and loved them. JD McPherson brings all the fun rock of the '50's back to today!<br /><br />So many great songs off this album!!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Are you kidding? A doctor that looks like Keanu Reeves? Sign me up! I still can't get over how she chooses the OLD man over that young hunkadoo!!!
0061537969|5.0|Fun fast read with heart. This is told from the dogs perspective which makes it a compelling story with an interesting twist.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|there are no problems with this app for kindle fire. only a few ads if u dont want to pay. just close them and continue. a nice change from origonal version
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|The 3d bluray is on sale today for 14.99, and i love 3d, and i would usually snap up a deal like that, but i cannot make myself buy this movie. I was so disappointed when i went to see this movie. I figured it would be about the origin of the Alien from the first movie and since Ridley Scott directed it, i knew is should have been great. But this was the most boring, nonsense movie of the summer. I did buy the bluray version of Aliens to get a free movie ticket to see Prometheus in the theatres, so that was not a total loss. But this movie really makes no sense what so ever. And what really makes no sense is that an alien is kind of thrown in at the end , just to make it seem like it was about Aliens. And the movie seems like its 3 hours long, so why would i want to see a longer version of the movie. I still dont know what the plot of the movie is. I think it has something to do with some alien race creating man kind on earth thousands of years ago, and now, they want to get rid of mankind, so they create another alien to destroy mankind?? I dont know if that was the plot but i would get the 3d version , or any of version of this movie if it was given as a gift. And i would only watch it when i could not sleep at night, its that boring.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like this game but it will not update that's what I'm raging about if you can please tell Me now
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well, I love this game, but from recent research, the Ipod version was updated to version 0.5.0 on the 15th. I love it, but I want the update.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Movie was like a documentary or a home movie. Reminds me of Blair Witch project only more interesting. Its definately something to see. My husband and I watched it at Halloween time which made it more fun.
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|It's just like a dictionary. No matter you're beginner or experienced user. You can always learn something from this book.
030758836X|4.0|this was a really good book but,it was too drawn out. It could have still the same great story and detail with fewer words
B001R4MEUM|5.0|The CD was brand new and unopened. It did, however take 2 weeks to get, but well worth the wait.
B005LTDPJI|5.0|This is a great collection. Being a fan of ELO since the 'Roll Over Beethoven' single and the albums from 'On The Third Day' to 'Time' and a compilation containing a selection of tracks from the first two albums, it is fun to relive these great albums. I already had them on MP3 downloads but they didn't contain the information and miniature versions of the original covers. Worth every cent.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I have a scientific medical background, so I enjoyed it. There is a great deal of medical information, that some people may not like or be able to follow.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Celtic Woman always put out the most beautiful music. They are very talented ladies and what they can do a song is amazing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Long term entertaning but the ads between each game gets old real quick. Even works great on my Kindle Fire.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie! Aston Kutcher is an awesome actor! This was definitely a great role for him! This movie made me laugh and managed to make me drop a tear or two!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|the powers and the characters are really cool, but there are very little levles and the milaniam falcon is a rip of.
0545128285|5.0|&#34;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&#34; was a compilation of five wizard bedtime stories for the reading pleasure of Muggles. It was a closer look at some of the essential lessons that young wizards must learn as they grow up and was highly informative and enjoyable to this Muggle. I honestly wish there had been more stories in here, but this is a good enough start. I hope that Ms. Rowling will compile more stories of Beedle the Bard eventually, because I loved this and I'd very much like to have more. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the magical world of Hogwarts, particularly at Amazon's extremely reasonable prices.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|This movie had no story and terrible acting was a great big bore. Do not waste your time or money !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. At first it is easy to play but then it gets hard which is where the fun starts. It opens up your mind with the use of puzzles and can be a very good game to relax to.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good time waster. The win comes just as I become frustrated with the losses! What more can I say??!! Good fun.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i love this game!!!!!!!! this game should be the first game you need to download on any mobile device. girls dig it yo!!!!!! 5 stars all the way middle fingers to the haters!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is the bt book I've read in a long time. I couldn't put it down. It was both heartbreaking and inspirational.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great book! Loved it! Love all his books and this was no exception. Easy read. Read it in about a week. If you like his other books you will love this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I downloaded the book and read it in a day! I am definitely reading the next one. I hope this book is also made into a movie.
1451650728|5.0|This is one of the best trek books I have read in a long time. I look forward to other trek books by David Mack.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I thought this game was great. I play it all the time. My only complaint is that it makes my kindle shut down when im playing. This is very annoying. I reinstalled it and now it shuts down less. I love angry birds, but this is just annoying
B004SBQGHS|1.0|downloaded angry birds ad free edition. I have everything except picture. Just sound when it comes up to play game. The grand kids were very disappointed. this was downloaded to my android tablet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazing game! The only problem I have is that I can't update to 0.5.0 on the play store. Runs smoothly with a few visual glitches.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend it to anybody seeking for questions about life after death. Very inspirational and positive .<br />It will give you a new perspective in life.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I liked this book so much i read it about 4 times.They way that Will and Lake met and got through the obstacles that kept them apart and the support that Will gave Lake when her mother died. Life throws you in the depend and there is always hope on the other side
B004DMTCNM|5.0|this is a old movie that i really liked its action packed and heart warming I like this movie cool
B0094OLJD0|5.0|I have listened enough to be enthralled by the collaboration of such unique talents, but not yet enough to have decided which pieces are my favorites. Density in concept and execution which leads me to believe that I will return to these tracks for some time to come. Enjoy.
B005PK553C|5.0|I love this show hope it goes one for more seasons then the 2 that are out now, awesome psychological love these movies
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It is an easy read with endearing characters. It has humor and substance. It has been a great choice for our book club.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Don't stop after this book because the next two get better and better.  Be prepared for twists and turns that make you read too quickly through each &#34;situation&#34;.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|John Grisham at his best. I loved this book the best thing I have read in years.  Grisham got me from the opening page and I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is a lot more than what was originally reported.  The budding love and people with much baggage contribute to a plot that makes it hard to put this book down.
B006G2124E|5.0|Great Story telling. An all around solid film that will be filed next to Fried Green Tomatoes and Steele Magnolias for repeated viewing in my library!
B0011NVC9I|5.0|Most stores didn't carry the unrated director's cut.<br />This is the first director's cut that I have seen that isn't much different from the movie.<br />Daredevil was apples and oranges , the director's cut for that one was excellent.<br />But it was new on time in in excellent condition and at a fair price.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Wrong colour,should be BLACK.In the literary sense not worth the paper it was written on.I am no prude but HEY!!!
B00005K3O4|5.0|Some things are hard to get and this other one of them.<br />I have picked this up for my brother and it was shipped on time and in excellent condition.<br />Also you could not get get for a cheaper price in new condition.<br />I mean CHEAP!!<br />This item was factory packed.<br />My brother couldn't believe that I was able to get it for him.<br />They thought that it would be used not new.<br />I guess this movie has a Cult following I remember it years ago.<br />Well different strokes for different folks.<br />I would tell anybody if they have it order it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I choose 5 stars because I loved this cd.  My favorite Taylor Swift cd. I like her voice. I didn't dislike anything about it. I would reccomend the cd to anyone.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I'm a long time DeMille fan, but this offering is beyond bad, it's terrible. While creative humor, sarcasm and word play are enjoyed, this publiction is nothing more than a platform for juvenile attempts, without any real story. It's boring, disapointing and in all probability my last DeMille book; save your money, it's not really DeMille.
B008VBYN80|5.0|so far the game has been fun and am yet to need to pay anything to have fun but we'll see if it changes soon.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Thanks very much for this product which was shipped packaged well and arrived as expected.  You just cannot go wrong here!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is the greatest plot Grisham has come up with yet. Couldn't stop reading once I began! Can't wait for his next book!!!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Immediately crashes. My best guess I'd that it's another application that doesn't work under o/s 4.2. What else can I say?
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This CD is great.  Love this recording artist and this is one of the best of his work.  It is so relaxing to listen to in the evening while sewing or knitting.  Arrived safely and was well packed.  Price was good.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|All I can say is that this CD is simply awesome! Alex, Neil, and Geddy have truly created a masterpiece. They never seem to lapse in creativity. Get it!
0307341577|5.0|I downloaded this e-book from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire. The author, Gillian Flynn did a good job writing this novel. This is the third novel I have read and enjoyed by this author. The main character is funny in a raunchy desperate sort of way. The Author did a good job writing the scenes with a lot of desperate characters. The Author did an excellent job layering the scenes with different time periods into a good story. I have read this style of writing before with other Authors and it didn't work. This Author made it work and did an excellent job. The story goes back and forth between different characters and time periods but was easy to follow. The Author did a good job setting the scene in Kansas. I have never been there but after reading this e-book I feel like I was there. I don't want to go back.  The novel took off and turned into a page turner with an excellent ending. The ending was excellent!  The novel was very descriptive and well written, very good! There were two typographical errors in the e-book. There were large spaces in between some of the words throughout the e-book and was very distracting. I have and would recommend this book to a friend.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|I loved this movie for it's suspense, mystery, great special effects, eye-popping gore factor, and oh yeah, story. Never mind that the behavior of some of the characters was, well, illogical. (They are still removing their helmets after one of their colleagues got deathly ill from some unknown contagian or alien life form??). I love that a number of questions were (seemingly intentionally) left unanswered. It just made it all the more thought provoking. If you liked the original Alien movie, or this sci-fi horror genre in general, I think you'll like this movie as well.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app doesn't work for the Kindle Fire HD. Hope it gets fixed soon. That was one of the reasons I wanted this.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I find Mr. Follett's character development less than satisfying, but his plots and flow are very good. A painless way to learn lots of history.
B00984668E|5.0|The Sword continues to rock hard! I loved their early Age of Winters and Gods of the Earth albums but really like the new direction they've taken with Warp Riders that continues with Apocryphon. Still hard but also more controlled and classic rock oriented. And still the best nerd metal ever!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Probably the best movie of this year. Without a doubt something for everyone exists inside this film. The story suffers a bit from the mindless action, that at times becomes a bit hard to follow bc theres so much happening. The resolution to the plot barely exists with a lot of unanswered questions, especially for noobs to the Marvel U. It almost loses track of the story in the end. I understand they wanted cliffhanger for what will undoubtably be a series of films, but this type of cliffhanger left too many questions left unanswered.
0345803493|5.0|I loved this installment of the trilogy, you learned a lot about the characters. I would recommend this to anyone.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|Actually, it was a dag fine movie. You must realize that this is simply historical fiction, & done quite well actually. I enjoyed it, like one enjoys most action movies: despell reality, facts, & the grey matter. It slowed a bit for my taste though & felt a little rush. The movie should have been stretched into a series of films, bc several time passes by unaccounted for. Maybe they will fill in the gaps with a lot of follow-ups. A lot could happen in that gap, awesome potential & many fine stories could be woven in.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is the best Angry Birds yet. The only con is that advertising pops up at time, but not a big deal.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I loaded Angry Birds for my sons; they were playing it on their aunt's phone. I did not understand the attraction until I started playing it with them. Now I get it; it's fun trying to get those BAD PIGS.
0345803485|1.0|It is a sad commentary on the quality of modern literature when a book like this gets touted as 'great'...or even 'acceptable'. I think I'll silently slip into mourning for the loss of creativity, literacy, and good sense.<br /><br />After getting only 2 chapters into this novel, I was forced to put it down. Purely out of self-preservation, you understand.<br /><br />You see, unlike Ana, I've actually benefitted from my years of higher education and was alarmed to feel myself growing progressively stupider as I turned each page. So much stupider that I actually thought, \\"Oh, I'll just finish it to see how it ends\\" (like there's any real doubt).<br /><br />But as I went to turn the next page, my inner goddess screamed at me, wrenched me out of the chair by my ponytail and bounced me off the wall a couple times.<br /><br />...okay then, I'll just log into Amazon to see if others can sum it up for me. And oh, what delight!!<br /><br />Wanna read something decent? Just click on the one-star reviews section above and prepare to be entertained.........
0385535147|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Twist and turns were pretty good. Very entertaining and a fast suspenseful read. The characters were interesting with a different plot. Would like to see the movie!
0307341550|4.0|Gillian Flynn's \\"Sharp Qbjects\\" revolves around a troubled reporter who reluctantly returns to her home town to investigate the murder of one child and disappearance of another.  The story itself unfolded bit by bit, filled with the tension felt by the main character having to deal with people and situations she'd prefer not having to revisit.  The suspense grew with each page turned, and I enjoyed the ending of the book.
B004UID2LC|3.0|it worked okay until you could only down load for like a month! it didn't work to well either it always closes
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This is one of my new favorite movies! I LOVED the quirky sense of humor, the cinematography, the simple, poignant love story. Every scene and line could be thought about and carried symbolism to  something much broader, deeper, and universal. I especially loved the sincerity and honesty between the two main characters and how that forms the basis for true love in any relationship. I enjoyed each character in the film and thought they were perfectly cast. My favorite line: \\"I'm on your side.\\" Brilliant!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Our favorite characters continue to transform.  The end story is beginning to take shape.  If you liked the first four books then this is a must read.  How long until book six?
030758836X|1.0|This book drags for half of it has a very short peak and becomes a total looser for an ending.  Don't waste your money or time on this one
0061733199|5.0|Fantastic tome of information. The only section missing was how to make a spacesuit and oxygen tank to survive floating helplessly in space...it was that thorough. Desert survival, forest survival, arctic survival, ocean survival...you name it, its included. For once you CAN judge a book by its cover. The title says it all.
B002CVQAX6|5.0|I loaned my copy of this movie out only to never get it back and I had to replace it since I liked it so much. Awesome!
B00138EV8U|5.0|What can I say about &#34;Dirty Dancing&#34; except I love it!!!  Since its debut over 25 years ago, I'm assuming that there are very few people who have not seen it yet.  Just in case you've managed to miss it, it's a coming of age love story set in the early 60's written by Eleanor Bergstein.  It was actually based on an event that had occurred in her own life.  Young teenage girl falls in love with an older dance instructor & her life is changed forever!!!  I found it very reflective of life in 1963 & Baby's (Jennifer Grey) Daddy reacted much like my Dad did during that time period.  I'm NOT going to give the plot away; however, I will strongly suggest that if you haven't seen it, that you watch it soon...especially if you like tender love stories!!!
032147404X|5.0|I bought this for my son for a Christmas present as he is getting into the art of photography, he loved it and learned a lot from it. Highly recommend this for any beginner. I didn't read through it enough myself to see if it would have anything for someone that was more advanced.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Any movie showing Channing Tatum nude & Matthew MacConaughey almost nude deserves a 5-Star rating.  However, the storyline was titillating yet somewhat lame...even for a love story with hot, sexy dancers.  I soooo wanted to love this movie, but came away feeling somewhat empty.  I felt extremely uncomfortable with Matthew playing the sleazy part which he did so well that it did nothing to enhance the experience.  Since I broke my own rule of never buying a DVD before watching first, I will be watching this again in hopes that I missed something major the first time.  Still I have serious doubts that I'll be back to update this to a more positive review!!!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Love this, but the HD part doesnt work even though I have the Kindle Fire HD. But still it comes in handle. It really light up the room.
0143121316|5.0|Henry Kissinger has provided a fascinating look at China's history, diplomacy, people, and culture. Kissinger first explains China's early history and it's interaction with Western powers, these experiences help explain China's future diplomatic policies. He explains China's experience as an early communist state, its role in the Korean War, and the Sino-Soviet Split are described leading to Nixon's trip to China. With his own personal experience negotiating with the Chinese Kissinger is able to describe opening China in great detail. He finally discusses Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms which led to a resurgent China and China's place in the world today. On China was a very insightful work, I was left with a deeper understanding and appreciation of China.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I tell you I'm not a sap but damn my wife can bring out the tears in me. Great buy especially with the DVD ensemble. Gives you al the freedom to choose where to view it without the expensive of a best buy purchase.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|In a nutshell: Is this an album worth buying? Yes! If you compare it to Christina's previous albums, I'd say that if you liked Stripped, you'll like Lotus. If you didn't like Stripped, but liked Back to Basics then I'd say only download a handful of the standout tracks rather than the whole album. If you liked both - you'll be happy with Lotus!<br /><br />For me the standout tracks are:<br />- Army of Me<br />- Blank Page<br />- Best of Me<br />- Sing for Me<br />- Just a Fool<br />- Light Up the Sky<br />- Empty Words<br /><br />I'm surprised that I've ended up really liking her track 'Circles', it has a very grungy, rock feel - similar to her track 'Make Over' from her Stripped days. It's a great track to listen to when you want to tell someone where they can stick it! haha<br /><br />One of the greatest strengths of Christina's songs is that her lyrics can really hit home and make you feel she's singing for you - not just her. You can play 'Circles' or 'Fighter' when you've been let down by someone in your life, 'Your Body' and 'Dirrty' when you're in an 'amorous' mood or 'Beautiful' when you need a 'no one will bring me down' anthem.<br /><br />Her more up-tempo tracks are good, but don't quite reach that instantly-gratifying sound of Dirrty or Ain't No Other Man - however, doesn't mean they're not good. Let there Be Love, Around the World, Make the World Move and Your Body are definitely growers with great vocals. The only song I consistently skip on the album is 'Red, Hot Kinda Love' - I just don't get it... Others seem to feel it's a 'stand out' track, but for me it's a 'should've left it on the cutting room floor' song! :)<br /><br />A track that could have been 'stand out' with a bit more production, is 'Cease Fire' - AMAZING chorus, but the verses leading into that don't seem to have been 'finished' yet. Having said that, I haven't been skipping it as I've been playing it!<br /><br />Overall, this Aguilera offering will now sit proudly next to 'Stripped' and 'Back to Basic's' on my shelf - and we'll just forget that 'Bionic' ever happened, yeah?
B003TH14H4|5.0|awesome show! great new story per episode while furthering the overall mystery of Becket's mother's murder and the sexual tension between her and Castle.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This was one of the first documentaries I saw about the state our food supply was in.  I didn't have a clue what a GMO was in 2010. Then on March 31st a good friend of mine put a brochure by the Institute For Responsible Technology in my hand.  It is a good thing I had a hard copy otherwise I might have forgotten our conversation and the name of the non-profit organization. I kept running across the brochure and I finally read it cover to cover and then got online and started doing some checking.  Just 2 weeks later Food Inc. came out.  It was everything I wanted and more.  All the dirty truthes were uncovered (I thought).  It made me disgusted with myself that I hadn't known more.  I love to read.  I can spend hours and hours in a bookstore or a library and be perfectly happy.  How could I miss this?!?  Since then I have spent every waking moment being a sponge for information on this topic and others that are related and spreading the information so that people can understand what is going on and be empowered to help change things for the better.  My journey started with this DVD and the book is even better.  I will always be grateful to and thankful for all the people who put together this information and contributed to the word getting out in a big way.  To all those like me who were eating GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisims): May you regain your health on your journey for the truth. Get healthy and if you are in the USA or Canada, we need your help in getting labeling laws passed.  Goto [...]  and find out more.  They helped me learn an awful lot in a very short period of time and they have a great shopping guide for good food and foods to avoid.  Best wishes to all.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Excellent psychological thriller related to the war on terror; character development by Claire Danes is absolutely stunning.  This season will leave you wanting more - you will not be disappointed.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I loved this book.<br />To those who say that it takes a long time to get to the storyline, this is true. But it is because the author needs you to really know the characters for you to fully appreciate what unfolds later.<br />Persevere with the start because you will learn to love, hate, and sometimes loathe the people in this book, which will make the ending more compelling.<br /><br />Since this is Rowling's only book of this genre I'd be grateful to anyone who can recommend me a book that is similar to this one as I move onto my next read.<br />Thanks in advance!
B004KNM3EY|5.0|This deluxe version of Suede's best-selling album, \\"Coming Up\\" has no less than 28 bonus tracks. Besides singles b-sides, demos and alternate versions, it has DVD videos and footage from two concert performances.<br /><br />Suede were always very large to put non-album tracks on their single releases so 19 of the bonus-tracks come from the singles \\"The Wild Ones\\" New Generation \\",\\" Trash \\",\\" Beautiful Ones \\",\\" Saturday Night \\",\\" Lazy \\"and \\" Filmstar \\". The first two are actually \\"Dog Star Man\\" singles, but the recordings do not feature original guitarist Bernard Butler.<br /><br />\\"Trash\\" was suedes biggest hit but also the subsequent \\"Coming Up\\" singles ( \\"Beautiful Ones\\", \\"Saturday Night\\", \\"Lazy\\" and \\"Filmstar\\" ) reached the top-ten rankings.<br /><br />\\"Coming Up\\" is on the whole an unusually homogenous album where most songs have classic potential. Among the album-tracks Brett Anderson's beautiful ballad \\"By the Sea\\" should be highlighted. \\"Picnic by the Motorway\\" and \\"The Chemistry Between Us\\" are also fine ballads, while \\"She\\" and and \\"Star Crazy\\" really could have been released as singles.<br /><br />The many b-sides are mostly solid enough, but few hardly really essential. As the best and most interesting I would highlight \\"Europe is Our Playground\\", \\"Every Monday Morning Comes\\" and \\"Sound of the Streets\\". The demo version of \\"She\\" is interesting - slower and more heavy.<br /><br />On the DVD Suede's version of Elvis Costello's \\"Shipbuilding\\" is a scoop. Great release and a great buy.
031618201X|5.0|Soulless is a wonderful supernatural manga! Rem's artwork is lavishing in the minute details in the setting and fashion. The characters are so colorful and lovable with their distinct personalities and British sensibilities. Although the story is tapered down from the novel, this urbane fantasy does not disappoint! So raise your parasols and your tea to Soulless!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The kids really enjoy this game and they play it a lot.  It keeps them occupied, which is nice.  The graphics are nice and it is easy to understand.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Absolutely the best weather app, and I've tried them all.  Multiple zip codes with a swipe.  Very pleasing to the eye too!
B00540G3G6|5.0|Its been a while since I've seen this movie. Mostly because its had to find. Well this combo pack works out great cause you get to watch on blue ray or dvd. Still a great movie an looks better on HD tv with hdmi.
B0091THDOM|2.0|The quality is good, but the fit is a little too tight.  So much so that even with one of the thinnest clip on covers for the back of the iphone 5, it no longer fits.
1439152802|5.0|This was my first Kate Morton book and I loved it! She did a wonderful job developing each of the main characters and taking you back in time to WWII. It takes a little while to get into the heart of the story, but hang in there! It's well worth it! I'm looking forward to reading the rest of her books.
B0086700CM|1.0|this game wont stop telling me what to do turn this way turn that way whats the fun if the stupid tutorial wont turn off even if it says it is this game sucks
030758836X|1.0|I am ashamed to admit that I finished this book instead of putting it down after reading Part I. The plot is interesting, which is why I finished it, but I can't recommend it due to the excessive use of foul language. I've never read a book that came anywhere close to including the number of F-words in this book. There were probably over 100. I realize the guy is angry, but come on! It ruined the book for me.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|Pandorum was over all a very good and suspenseful movie. I recommend it for scifi lovers such as my self. Crazy monster
B008NABUU8|4.0|Fun app that requires thought and can be used as engineering teaching tool to show kids the physics involved in building a bridge across spans of varying lengths.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|But the last book was a bore.. This one was the best of the three. Action, passion, excitement, fun characters.. But I review a story as a whole and Reached( the third book) did not impress me, it was like someone else wrote it and sucked all the life and energy from it.
B000UAFDP2|2.0|The above heading doesn't reflect my opinion of the film,but the Blu-ray its self,I love this film it's a typical American over the top action movie,but I love it,but I think this Blu-ray thing is a con designed to suck more money out of people,or maybe there is a difference if it's a new film and not a convert old film to digital and of course to see a real difference without scrutinising every minute detail with a magnifying glass you need a giant screen not my 27 inch one and very expensive equipment,so far I have bought 2 Blu-ray films and both are no better that the DVD versions except they cost at least twice the price of the older format,maybe as I only have a PS3 and a £300 computer monitor is the reason I can't see a difference,but I seriously doubt many people have the money to get the best out of the system,so from now on I will be saving my money buy buying DVDs instead.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|This is by far my favourite bond movie ever. Great script, great acting, great visuals and all that ... I love the fact that this bond is a real person, i will say no more in order not to spoil this great movie. Highly recommended even for someone who is not traditionally a bond fan.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I loved the condition and time span it came between. The dvd was perfect! Now i can share with my daughter and she loved it as well. Thank you!!!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|This third book of the Fifty Shades series &#34; FIFTY SHADES FREED&#34; is disappointing because the author seemed to not take as much care with the plot and the drawing of the characters, taking it for granted that the reader has read the previous books.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I felt the story started out very intriguing. I was glued to the narrative and the Abby/Travis relationship. I felt the novel really made you pull for these two at first. Eventually the story got pretty unbelievable. The level of violence that was portrayed as allowed on a college campus was a bit ridiculous. That made me lose interest in the story. There was also a lot of editing problems, both grammatically and narratively. It was mostly in the last third of the book, which is not the timing in a story where you want to lose your reader. It was a good book but would I tell friends it's a must read? ... Ehh, probably not.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Such a good read. Action, heartbreak, suspense, twists and turns, it was awesome. I can't wait for the next.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was an excellent book - really gripping read, and consistently avoided following the \\"obvious\\" (and boring) plot path, with surprising twists at every turn.
B000XR49VQ|2.0|UPDATE:<br />As noted elsewhere, until an authentic US/Canada release is available, the Australian \\"Peter Greenaway Collection\\"  DVD set includes the best DVD release of Prospero's Books at this time.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0044NGJWW Peter Greenaway Collection (The Draughtsman's Contract / a Zed & Two Noughts / Drowning by Numbers / Prospero's Books / the Baby of Mcon / the Pillow Book / 8 W...)]]<br /><br />The DVD is region 0, so even though it is in PAL format and will not play on TV from a DVD player (unless it is a multi-format player), it should play just fine from your computer and you can rip the DVD with HandBrake to play on your TV through an Apple TV (or similar device).<br /><br />This entire collection deserves to be brought out on Blu-Ray in the US and Canada.<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST:<br />Having this DVR from the NTSC video tape is better than nothing, but a remastered HD Blu-Ray NTSC USA version is sorely needed.  The cinematic tableau are completely lost on the VHS version.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|A simple game to play when with the grandkids. One of many Kindle games which keep the little ones busy when Grandma's tired!
1400052181|5.0|A fascinating account of medical research and a sad tale of one family's chronic problems--the intersection of science and culture makes for intriguing writing. Rebecca Skloot's decade of research and writing is well worth it for this must-read book.
1451683405|1.0|Simply put, this book is not worth buying. It merely proposes a groundless assertion that human beings have no free-will without providing any new ideas that any other books of its kind doesn't have.
B009VB97EY|1.0|It was terrible. One is expecting to laugh, to have a good time and it was just dull. Is a wannabe drama of a frustrated stripper with some funny dialogs. The acting of the girl simply sucks and the issue is even a little bit repetitive... What a shame, with that plot they could've done a very fun, hilarious and entertaining movie and they did neither a drama nor a comedy.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Very interesting book with a new take on vampires and witches.If you like vampire books this is more interesting than others.  Much less violence, more head games.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|The idea of putting Angry Birds and Star Wars together is great.<br />I have really enjoyed Angry Birds Rio and Seasons. These formats were great and fun. Some levels were difficult but I could eventually figure them out. I liked being able to go to other scenarios when I was frustrated with the one I was in.<br />Star Wars is way too difficult to enjoy. There is no where to go if you are stuck...there is only one other scenario and it is locked. You can pay to get to one other...I didn't mind paying the price for that one...but again it was too difficult.<br />Simply put....this version is NO FUN at all!!!
0393339882|5.0|Like the book. Best of all I did read the last 30 years. Just, if you want to know and understand the \\"Nature of Reality\\", you first need to know \\"Absolute Truth\\". And we all agree that \\"Absolute Truth\\" does not exist.<br /><br />But, as Feynman says:<br /><br />\\"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.<br />--Richard P. Feynman

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I reluctantly started this trilogy thinking it wasnt my kind of book and ended up being completely lost in it. Couldnt put it down, AND recommended it to others. LOVE IT
0544045203|5.0|I actually bought this book at the airport because my daughter had packed hers in our checked baggage.  I figured this book was safe since it was about a kid.<br />My daughter read this book in several days and my parents (from India) really enjoyed the type of conversation sparked from reading this book. We even held off watching the movie becuase she was so insistent on finishing the book.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|REVIEW:<br />Cry Baby  (1990)  Johnny Depp, Ricki Lake, Amy Locane, Susan Tyrrell<br />Rated PG13<br />Tagline: Good girls want him bad. Bad girls want him worse.<br /><br />Evil genius John Waters,  that lovable, card carrying oddball director, has actually regurgitated a virtually squeaky clean but goofy musical satire for the ignorant masses. Unbelievable and one of my perennial favorites.<br />Lower your standards for an hour and a half and check it out.<br />So deliciously tacky it hurts.<br />So, what does this movie have exactly?<br />Well, let's see:<br />Bad taste galore.<br />Honeys painted up like trash.<br />Redneck hellcats.<br />Motorsickles, the kind your momma warned you about.<br />Juvenile delinquents who sing and dance.<br />Evil rock and roll.<br />Black leather.<br />Delightful degenerates<br />Colored people!<br />Grease was never greasier than this.<br />Johnny Depp is at his dreamiest (or so I've been told)<br />Oh, boy, being bad has never felt so good--or kinky.<br />Amy Locane is the quintessential 50's pony tail blond, and they don't come more mouth watering than her.<br />Puberty will never be the same.<br />Shut up and see it or you ain't cool.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Ignoring what others have already gone into detail concerning obvious plot issues and problems with some of the characters in the film. It was entertaining and worth the few dollars to view. A worthy prequel to the Alien franchise and left me wanting to see more.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I ended up returning the case because the volume buttons would not work with the case on.  I also had trouble hearing during a call.  Great idea, just needs a few tweaks to clear up these difficulties<br />I did the waterproof test and it is waterproof!
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Let me start by saying that Lizzy Grant/Lana Del Rey (from Lake Placid, NY) is, hands down, THE most alluring breakout artist of 2012...I would say \\"new\\" but under her born name, she released an album on the tiny 5 Points label (produced by the notable David Kahne (The Bangles and others) which had limited reach and was quickly pulled when she changed her name and signed her deal with Interscope/Polydor/Universal.<br /><br />The fact that the original \\"Born To Die\\" had more Euro/UK appeal and she attracted as many people as she repelled in the US...made me wonder why this was completely ignored on critics' year-end 2012 lists...people are talking Frank Ocean, Frank Ocean, when LDR SHOULD be the focus as breakout artist of 2012...no Grammy noms either, weird...because she has an utterly beguiling, addictive, unique sound that could be seen as a musical narcotic...fresh and retro, cinematic, even a bit dangerous...VERY Lynchian and Tarantino-esque in that she captures what they do cinematically into her music...and she IS a great vivid songwriter, no doubt.  Her own vidclips, many of which she shot & edited herself, like \\"Videogames\\", which captured the world blogosphere's interest in summer 2011, and got LDR her deal...accurately reflect her own music.  Sure, her chanteuse-ian approach has been done before, just not in a while...the most recent artist to have a similar style is NYC's own Nicole Atkins, and LDR is similar in her lower vocal register, but Nicole is more indie/singer-songwriter, even a drop Jenny Lewis, but LDR mixes her style (calling her cold and unemotional is wrong and inaccurate) with triphop beats and atmospheres instead...and most Americans are not as familiar with these styles as much as Brits and Europeans are, which explains why she appeals more over there than here.  She's even appeared on Brit & Girls Aloud member Cheryl Cole's 3rd solo album, 2012's \\"A Million Lights\\", on \\"Ghetto Baby\\", a fleshed out version of one of her own old demos, on backing vocals.<br /><br />The music itself on \\"Born To Die\\" is amazing and fully formed...vivid and memorable, impressionable and highly detailed, great headphone music and remix friendly, utterly beguiling...as good as any classic debut album in recent memory, to be totally honest...history will be kind to this record...from the opening title track where she's a ghost thinking she's alive and reflecting on her life...you hear her ask \\"Hi, what, me??\\" after you hear some guy faintly yelling \\"Lana!! Lana!!!\\"  What an opener.  Then the interesting tracks continue their dark twisted cinematic path, retro yet modern...\\"Off To The Races\\" (with its hiphop cadence and her Lolita vocal turn), the lovely \\"Blue Jeans\\", the attention-grabbing \\"Video Games\\", twisted, catchy & dance-friendly \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\", the GORGEOUS \\"National Anthem\\" (which reminds me weirdly of \\"Graduation\\" by Vitamin C...remember her??), the just as pretty \\"Dark Paradise\\", which should have been a single, a contender for fave track here, \\"Radio\\" (which has a lyric that has you repeating the track to figure out what she's singing...what on the radio??), \\"Carmen\\" (the song that had to grow on me the most...liked it the least at first), \\"Million Dollar Man\\" (a tale of a prostitute perhaps??), the also-gorgeous \\"Summertime Sadness\\", the beguiling & smart \\"This Is What Makes Us Girls\\"...then the 3 great bonus tracks...\\"Without You\\" (killer), \\"Lolita\\" (her theme-song??), and amazing \\"Lucky Ones\\" (produced by Rick Nowels...who worked with Stevie Nicks and Gregg Alexander, pre-New Radicals)...<br /><br />Then came the subsequent add-on EP \\"Paradise\\", whose songs are just as great as \\"Born To Die\\" but also serve as a roadmap for her next project, which I look forward to with ample anticipation...starting with the amazing epic, desert-dusted roadtrip of a track \\"Ride\\", produced by Rick Rubin...he must have been beguiled with our heroine and understood her direction 100%...it's a killer tune, kind of like a ballad but it has this momentum that builds and the melody on the chorus is neck-hair-tingling...then \\"American\\" which shows her love of Bruce, among other things and the song itself is solidly great...then, um, \\"Cola\\", a great UN-PC, gleefully un-kid-friendly, song...just as lyrically frank and sexually upfront, that it's as refreshing as the drink in the title...then \\"Body Electric\\", which is the most Lynchian/Tarantino-esque song here...just the opening lines alone made me think \\"Wild At Heart\\"...\\"Elvis is my daddy/Marilyn's my mother/And Jesus is my greatest friend\\"...seedy, dusty and trailerparky in the grandest way possible...then \\"Blue Velvet\\", a perfect cover if there ever was one...the song fits her cinematic style, the production is retro-modern, and the fact that one of David Lynch's key movies is \\"Blue Velvet\\" is not lost on LDR one bit...then, um, \\"Gods And Monsters\\"...\\"Cola\\" was just a taste for this track, just saying, this one goes all out that it's frankly startling...in a good way of course, haha...then \\"Yayo\\" and \\"Bel Air\\"...2 lesser cuts that are good but have to grow on me more...then Target released an exclusive version of this EP with 2 bonus remixes of \\"Blue Velvet\\", which are nice to have...one of them, the 5+ minute \\"Penguin Prison Remix\\" is on the picture disc 7\\" vinyl single that is included with the import boxset version of this masterpiece of a record.<br /><br />Ah yes, the BOXSET...this thing is BEAUTIFUL...it has 4 discs, 4 frameable photos and that 7\\" picturedisc vinyl single, all packaged in a lovely compact square box (the size of a 7\\" vinyl) with her name and title embossed in gold letters on top of the pic shown.  The BTD album (15 tracks) and \\"Paradise\\" EP are packaged together nicely in, not a jewelcase, but a slightly-larger-than-a-CD, mini-LP, gatefold, jacket/CD wallet with a lovely cool drawing in the middle, a booklet in one of the sleeves with all lyrics from both discs together, and the discs protected in pic-enhanced inner CD sleeves...BTD in black and coloured feathers and Paradise in a shot of clouds.  Then, under the album, an 8-track, 39-minute, remix CD (4 BTD tracks...\\"Video Games\\", \\"Born To Die\\", \\"Blue Jeans\\" & \\"National Anthem\\", 2 remixes each...not typical mixes either, more deep-house or trip-hop-styled)...blue/grey mini-LP jacket with white inner CD sleeve, and lastly, on the bottom, a DVD (region 0) also in a blue-grey mini-LP jacket with white inner DVD sleeve, half-hour-long, of her 6 amazing cinematic videos from the album...the famous/infamous \\"Video Games\\" (that got her noticed and her Interscope/Polydor/Universal deal), the controversial \\"Born To Die\\" (besides the carcrash & fire and embrace with Mr Tattoo, the scene with her in the church/museum/I don't know, sitting on a throne, with 2 lovely but dangerous tigers lounging beside her, one on each side, is 100% worth thr price of admission, woah), \\"Blue Jeans\\" (both versions...the B&W poolside one with the same tattooed guy from the \\"BTD\\" clip and the LDR-directed one), \\"National Anthem\\", 7-minutes and my fave one, where it takes place in the 60s, she portrays a Jackie-O-type of president's wife, and this is like Kennedy-meets-Obama, where the president is black, they have bi-racial kids, and pres gets killed in a drive-by a-la Kennedy...VERY controversial and darkly cinematic...amazing...icing on the cake, her singing \\"Happy Birthday Mr President\\" at the clip's beginning...a black & white photostill from that scene is one of the photos included in the box with a part over her eyes saying \\"Tell Me I'm Your National Anthem\\"...cool, amazing and wild...then \\"Summertime Sadness\\", which shows a dark obsession with a friend and suicide...this girl is dark to say the least...even dangerous...but utterly beguiling, artful and memorable.<br /><br />Album of the year 2012??  Maybe.  Debut and breakout of 2012??  Most definitely!!  This box was so worth the $58 bucks I paid.lad but it has this momentum that builds and the melody on the chorus is neck-hair-tingling...then \\"American\\" which shows her love of Bruce, among other things and the song itself is solidly great...then, um, \\"Cola\\", a great UN-PC, gleefully un-kid-friendly, song...just as lyrically frank and sexually upfront, that it's as refreshing as the drink in the title...then \\"Body Electric\\", which is the most Lynchian/Tarantino-esque song here...just the opening lines alone made me think \\"Wild At Heart\\"...\\"Elvis is my daddy/Marilyn's my mother/And Jesus is my greatest friend\\"...seedy, dusty and trailerparky in the grandest way possible...then \\"Blue Velvet\\", a perfect cover if there ever was one...the song fits her cinematic style, the production is retro-modern, and the fact that one of David Lynch's key movies is \\"Blue Velvet\\" is not lost on LDR one bit...then, um, \\"Gods And Monsters\\"...\\"Cola\\" was just a taste for this track, just saying, this one goes all out that it's frankly startling...in a good way of course, haha...then \\"Yayo\\" and \\"Bel Air\\"...2 lesser cuts that are good but have to grow on me more...then Target released an exclusive version of this EP with 2 bonus remixes of \\"Blue Velvet\\", which are nice to have...one of them, the 5+ minute \\"Penguin Prison Remix\\" is on the picture disc 7\\" vinyl single that is included with the import boxset version of this masterpiece of a record.<br /><br />Ah yes, the BOXSET...this thing is BEAUTIFUL...it has 4 discs, 4 frameable photos and that 7\\" picturedisc vinyl single, all packaged in a lovely compact square box (the size of a 7\\" vinyl) with her name and title embossed in gold letters on top of the pic shown.  The BTD album (15 tracks) and \\"Paradise\\" EP are packaged together nicely in, not a jewelcase, but a slightly-larger-than-a-CD, mini-LP, gatefold, jacket/CD wallet with a lovely cool drawing in the middle, a booklet in one of the sleeves with all lyrics from both discs together, and the discs protected in pic-enhanced inner CD sleeves...BTD in black and coloured feathers and Paradise in a shot of clouds.  Then, under the album, an 8-track, 39-minute, remix CD (4 BTD tracks...\\"Video Games\\", \\"Born To Die\\", \\"Blue Jeans\\" & \\"National Anthem\\", 2 remixes each...not typical mixes either, more deep-house or trip-hop-styled)...blue/grey mini-LP jacket with white inner CD sleeve, and lastly, on the bottom, a DVD (region 0) also in a blue-grey mini-LP jacket with white inner DVD sleeve, half-hour-long, of her 6 amazing cinematic videos from the album...the famous/infamous \\"Video Games\\" (that got her noticed and her Interscope/Polydor/Universal deal), the controversial \\"Born To Die\\" (besides the carcrash & fire and embrace with Mr Tattoo, the scene with her in the church/museum/I don't know, sitting on a throne, with 2 lovely but dangerous tigers lounging beside her, one on each side, is 100% worth thr price of admission, woah), \\"Blue Jeans\\" (both versions...the B&W poolside one with the same tattooed guy from the \\"BTD\\" clip and the LDR-directed one), \\"National Anthem\\", 7-minutes and my fave one, where it takes place in the 60s, she portrays a Jackie-O-type of president's wife, and this is like Kennedy-meets-Obama, where the president is black, they have bi-racial kids, and pres gets killed in a drive-by a-la Kennedy...VERY controversial and darkly cinematic...amazing...icing on the cake, her singing \\"Happy Birthday Mr President\\" at the clip's beginning...a black & white photostill from that scene is one of the photos included in the box with a part over her eyes saying \\"Tell Me I'm Your National Anthem\\"...cool, amazing and wild...then \\"Summertime Sadness\\", which shows a dark obsession with a friend and suicide...this girl is dark to say the least...even dangerous...but utterly beguiling, artful and memorable.<br /><br />Album of the year 2012??

B008N7Q2SQ|5.0|Had no problems getting product especially when I did not have to wait long to get. Instantly, a life saver as I needed the book as soon as. Thanks again
0446580848|3.0|Let me begin by saying that I have read every book that Mr.De Mille has written and this was, by far, the most disappointing to this loyal fan.  Respectfully, I would say that it is not so much the Corey character that is worn out, but the use of one-liners, cynical jokes and scathing sarcasm has killed the character. I thoroughly enjoy these techniques in a book but this was far too overdone, and, for me, it ruined the book.<br /><br />I would like to see a return to books such as Cathedral, the Talbot Odyssey, The Generals Daughter, etc. Recurring characters diminsish a writer as brilliant as is De Mille. If are familiar with DeMille , read this book.  If you'd like an intro to Mr. De Mille's novels, let me suggest reading the older novels first.

B0076D21O2|5.0|A great film if you are interested in the theatre, Shakespeare, or just a good mystery.  Fascinating hypothesis on who really wrote the plays and poems attributed to William Shakespeare.  After seeing the film, I was curious enough to do some personal research on this intersting subject.  Worth your time!
B0039TD826|5.0|English rock and rollers The Rolling Stones' classic double studio album entitled Exile on Main Street (which was the band's second under their own Rolling Stones record label under distribution with Atlantic Records) was released in May of 1972.<br />The Exile on Main Street album was the band's only double studio album to be released in the initial vinyl era but is still one of the greatest double studio albums which ranks up there with Pink Floyd's The Wall, The Who's Tommy and Quadrophenia, The Beatles' White Album, The Clash's London Calling, Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti and Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway among others (as I found out when I got on cassette in December of 1989 on Rolling Stones/Columbia/CBS Records).<br />Before guitarist Keith Richards' heroin addiction took over for some time in the mid-1970s, he was what the late producer (of this and its three predecessors Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed and Sticky Fingers and Exile's successor Goats Head Soup) Jimmy Miller called a \\"workhorse\\". The album was recorded at Keith's home in France and at Olympic Studios in London, Muscle Shoals in Alabama and Sunset Sound in Los Angeles with engineers Glyn Johns, his brother Andy.<br />Keith's music and frontman Mick Jagger's lyric writing was arguably at its peak on Exile on Main Street.<br />Songs like the opening rocker \\"Rocks Off\\", the 50s sounding rocker \\"Rip This Joint\\", the Top 10 hit from the album \\"Tumbling Dice\\", the country stomping of \\"Sweet Virginia\\", Keith's classic Top 30 hit being the rocker \\"Happy\\", the brilliant closing \\"Soul Survivor\\", the rocking \\"All Down the Line\\" (which had some of Mick Taylor's ripping slide guitar here) and the soulful \\"Shine a Light\\" all are standouts which sound like they could have been recorded yesterday. Another favorite of mine on the album is the Jagger/Richards/Taylor collaboration \\"Ventilator Blues\\" which just rocked like no tomorrow<br />The other tracks on this album like, for instance, the cover of Slim Harpo's \\"Hip Shake\\" as \\"Shake Your Hips\\", \\"Casino Boogie\\", the acoustic tinged numbers like \\"Torn and Frayed\\", \\"Sweet Black Angel\\", \\"Loving Cup\\", the bluesy \\"Turd On the Run\\", the gospelish \\"I Just Want to See His Face\\", the epic \\"Let it Loose\\" and the bluesy cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" are all essential Stones tracks.<br />Exile on Main Street would be the band's second consecutive US #1 chart topping album and another million seller. The tour in support of the album saw the band getting bigger and bigger and cemented their place as The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band.<br />In 1994, EMI reissued the CD with original artwork and mastering by Bob Ludwig then again in 2010 on Universal Music by Stephen Marcussen and is not bad actually. The CD was also re-released with a second disc of outtakes as a deluxe version and looks to be excellent!<br />This album is hugely recommended!ke, for instance, the cover of Slim Harpo's \\"Hip Shake\\" as \\"Shake Your Hips\\", \\"Casino Boogie\\", the acoustic tinged numbers like \\"Torn and Frayed\\", \\"Sweet Black Angel\\", \\"Loving Cup\\", the bluesy \\"Turd On the Run\\", the gospelish \\"I Just Want to See His Face\\", the epic \\"Let it Loose\\" and the bluesy cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" are all essential Stones tracks.<br />Exile on Main Street would be the band's second consecutive US #1 chart topping album and another million seller.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|It pulled me in from the first few pages and it was hard to put down.  I read it every chance I could.  I would not have guessed this was the authors first book.  It was intriguing amusing and haunting all at the same time.  It kept me guessing un till the very end.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Excellent--however--too much on the death of mother.  I understand the desire to point out how important this even was----<br />Some photographs of author would assist in the understanding of ths author-----<br /><br />DEC
B004LWZWGA|2.0|First. Those bashing the Ultraviolet. If you haven't checked of late, you can link your UV copy to your Vudu account, and download it to your pc, console or mobile device (Flixster, PS3, XBOX, WIIU?) , and watch it WITHOUT an internet connection until you delete it. The Vudu digital copy I might add, is HD, whereas any of the iTunes digital copies I've got are SD. So enough already.<br /><br />Second: The Dark Knight Rises had the impossible task of rising (pun intended) above The Dark Knight. So no surprise that it wasn't able to achieve that. The attempt was probably one of the worst I've seen in a long time. First problem. They've time jumped 8 years since the Joker was captured. Batman doesn't appear, in costume, until about 45 minutes into the film. The movie itself is like a poor mishmash of KnightFall (from the comics) and the Dark Knight Returns graphic novel. There are some terrible leaps in logic, as well as plot holes you could fly The Bat through, but the main cast does well with what they are given. The exceptions being Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, who's acting is terribly corny. Which is strange, because he's amazing in Looper. That and Tom Hardy's Bane who's voice was initially so hard to understand, they had him overdub his dialogue, which sounds strangely Sean Connery-ish, and never very threatening. Bane's motivations turn out to be nothing like they were in Knightfall. Ras Al-Ghoul's daughter does appear as well, most people figured out who she was before the movie even opened, and she has probably the most ham handed death scene I've ever seen in a movie. The final \\"wrap-up\\" scenes didn't surprise me at all. Typical comic book cliche stuff. A scene by Alfred early in the film, basically gives the ending up right then. So when you see it again, you knew it was coming and it's absolutely no surprise. I find it amusing for people who praised Nolan for making his Batman movies with a \\"realistic\\" feel, so hard pressed to defend this entry, as it's one of the most unrealistic, and comic book like of the three Nolan Batman films. Loved Batman Begins, and loved The Dark Knight. Did not love this. Worth a rental, but utterly forgettable.
0143119680|5.0|This book is really well written, it's clever, funny, and smart. The summary doesn't do the book justice - it's amazing! I was hooked from the first page and read it in a day and a half - I couldn't put it down! It's an interesting take on supernatural beings and how they interact, a  great mystery, adorable love story, and had wonderful historical references. Highly recommend.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|My son has this and he really seems to like it! He has played the others before but really likes space.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Although I haven't finished this book yet, I really like it. It's letting me know that it's okay to be quiet and prefer to be alone sometimes. Especially in such a noisy world, oftentimes I feel like I'm wrong for feeling this way, and that if the room is noisy, I should keep up with them and that only those who speak up are good enough. This book can be read by anyone, I think. Just keep an open mind, and it can help you learn more about those around you.

B00008GKEG|5.0|Instead of going into details about \\"Anthology\\", I will proclaim that this is the ultimate gift for a Beatles fan. It is a bit expensive, so I'd think that there are many fans who don't own this. I know my 20 year old cousin would enjoy this, as she is just now beginning to explore the Beatles' music. And, yes, this is a great gift for YOURSELF!!! I haven't gone into detail about what's on these DVDs because the other reviewers have done a great job describing it, for the most part. This is The Beatles' story, in their own words, as honest as their memories can serve us. I would say it's the most accurate account of their history.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Who did what to whom?  Don't want to give away the plot, but this book will take you through a marriage that (like most marriages) is an E-Ticket ride.  I definitely kept turning the pages till the end -- had to see how Gillian Flynn ended the book.  At times you don't know who to root for and who to hate.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Although deemed to be fiction, I believe much of the subject matter is realistic. Such is the way of the world, filled with corruption, greed and some good people with a moral compass, love for America and the ability to effectively fight her enemies.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I agree with the reviews I have seen that argue that the program to make the camera work should have been included with the product. I think that the reason the camera faces the person using the computer is so that people can communicate with pictures with others. I have not yet learned that skill. So far I have taken one picture of someone on the other side of the table from me but that is a rather awkward process. How much more money would it have cost to put a camera on both sides so that with a tap of the screen the person using the computer could take a picture of themselves and with a tap of of a different spot on the screen the person using the computer could take a picture of something that they are looking at?
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Great book.  Philippa Gregory doesn't disappoint. I wish she had been my history teacher. Love to get the perspective of the women who watch and wait.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this particular application. First thing in the morning I find out what the weather will be and also can find out what clouds and rainfall are anywhere nearby.<br /><br />I can compare the weather where I am with the weather where my friends live. In addition with the map program, if I want to, I can actually view the houses and neighborhoods of my friends. I consider it to be a magnificent application.<br /><br />The videos are also wonderful. Having a choice of videos to watch that tell me of various weather events in other places is delightful. Especially while I am smuggled in a warm bed first thing in the morning.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|so it will work on my kindle fire hd 8.9, works great on my droid bionic and i love it but keeps closing  on my kindle, I sent details to the developer and am willing to wait  :) it gets five stars on my phone but since this review is about the app on my kindle it gets one star since i can't use it and i had to purchase it twice,once for the phone and once for my new kindle.
B0017I1IZA|3.0|I have so far enjoyed all of the books in the Stephanie Plum series (I am reading them in order), but Hard Eight was not as tightly constructed as some of the previous books.  The book was enjoyable, but relied too heavily on the established formula for the series, and the ending in particular was disappointing.  The ending almost seemed edited drastically to meet a publisher's deadline or page limit.  I will continue to read the series, though, as I enjoy the lighthearted intrigue, and Stephanie Plum's character just makes me laugh out loud at times.
B0045XICB2|2.0|Rented this movie with my wife. like the rest of the movies in this series, the acting is terrible and the plot sucks. If you are looking for a mind numbing terrible time, this is the movie for you...

B0041KVW2K|2.0|As a \\"first generation\\" Beatles fan, the magic of the Fabs on vinyl began for me in February of 1964 when my parents bought me \\"Meet The Beatles!\\" the weekend after their first Ed Sullivan appearance. Owning every Capitol release, I then discovered the UK issues in the mid-seventies in the \\"import\\" section of my local record shop and pieced together the entire catalogue within about a year. In the early eighties I landed upon a \\"BC13\\" set that I welcomed to replace my well-worn UK discs. I had enjoyed the magic of the Beatles on vinyl spanning three decades when I opted to hop on the digital bandwagon in the late eighties and, regrettably, sold my vinyl. Someone in one of the comments section of one of the reviews here said that pressing vinyl is \\"a lost art; no one has the expertise to do it anymore.\\" Having enjoyed the resurgence of vinyl over the last few years, I beg to differ with that comment. I have enjoyed countless releases on vinyl in recent years and, with an exception or two, have been very happy with the quality of the pressings and the sonics. With that said, I can't begin to tell you how excited I was to hear that the Beatles catalog was being reissued on vinyl.<br /><br />I received my FIRST set on release day. The packaging concerned me as the set was loose in an oversized box with (mostly popped) inflatable bags surrounding it, but the box set was okay. The box itself is beautiful, following the same packaging art as the CD set from 2009. Once opened, the records and book were packed inside with 2 pieces of protective foam. My confidence was high. I decided to listen to the set in reverse chronological order, picking Abbey Road (the last album actually recorded) as my starting point.<br />As I started the album, I started with the volume down and raised it up just as \\"Come Together\\" started. Great sound - less harsh high end than the CD, and better dynamics...but as Come Together was fading out, my jaw literally dropped as I heard a literal ocean roar of surface noise. This was apparent throughout the album. After that I tried \\"Let It Be\\" and had similar results. Skipping \\"ahead\\" to \\"Revolver\\", the beginning of \\"Taxman\\" was buried under a sound I've seen described as \\"no-fill\\" which sounds like a combination of static and a zipper being zipped. Wondering if I had stylus trouble (I should also mention here that I clean my records and stylus regularly) I put on a recently acquired reissue of Revolver from the 1995 \\"Anthology\\" era, and the vinyl was quiet as a mouse. A dead mouse. Contacted Amazon for an exchange, and to Amazon's credit, they had my replacement to me in one day with a call tag for the bad set. Again in an oversize box, but this time the box set was in an additional factory box with die-cut foam surrounding the set inside. Put on \\"Abbey Road.\\" Better, but not perfect. To make an already long story short, I played every record in the set except the \\"White Album\\" and not a single album doesn't have incredibly distracting artifacts, whether it be roaring surface noise or the \\"no-fill\\" areas. This set is going back and I'm not bothering with another. There is an obvious QC problem with this set, as we all can see by most of the other 30+ reviews already present as of the writing of this one.<br /><br />So the \\"review\\" is this. We know the music. The package is beautiful. The album art is faithfully reproduced, but they are NOT replicas; the UK album covers were always coated (at least on the front) with a glossy laminate - these are not. The \\"Beatles For Sale\\" gatefold exits the album in a \\"normal\\" fashion rather than from the inside. \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" contains the booklet tucked in the front half of the gatefold. None of that would be a deal-breaker for me. The sonics of the recordings are good; I won't jump into the whole digital vs analog debate. I judge with my ears and, to me, the sound is good. The included book is so beautifully done, it would be tempting to keep the set if it weren't forthe $320 price tag. Every page in it screams labor of love. Heavy stock paper, many, if not most, of the photos on glossy stock. Great, though no revelatory, text throughout. Many pictures I had never seen before.  This set could have been GREAT. I debated between 2 and 3 stars. It IS the Beatles, after all. But the pressing quality is HORRIBLE and I can't in good conscience recommend this set to anyone, unless they are willing to exchange Lord-knows-how-many sets to get a good one, or just want it in their collection for the artwork, or just for completion sake. I AM (well, WAS) a completist, but this set is where I draw the line.
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|Not fun.  Too much chasing dead ends.  No helpfor the lost.  The website indicates early clues that Are Not in the game.

B000SEFNMS|2.0|I am an avid adventure story reader. I was looking forward to hearing about Alaska and living on the land, instead this book is about a young idealistic man who is pitiful. I was disappointed to hear of this person's total disregard for the forces of nature who actually allowed himself to starve and perish through his own non efforts. Everyone dreams of an adventure,luckily most of us are more realistic in pursuing it. I could not even finish this book.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|A terrific movie for an average couch-ridden night.  A few laughs? Sure! The ever-striking Johnny Depp? Absolutely! Yet, a couple of plot inconsistencies bothered me... (except, that they were not inconsistencies, but very intentional Burtonisms) SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />First, why did the ghost of Josette appear to Vicky after Barnabas' arrival?  So, she said he's coming, he did, good!  Ghost, go to the light, but nooo - she kept on appearing and saying \\"help me\\" and throwing herself off that splendid chandelier over and over again, yet that story line leads nowhere... Vicky doesn't help her in any way and the ghost is nowhere to be seen at the end.<br /><br />Second, why does Vicky walk off the cliff after the witch has died?  The curse should have been lifted, by all fairytale standards; it just doesn't make any sense.  Alas, this is a Tim Burton movie, and the darkness that permeates it is above and beyond anything you should expect from a mediocre Hollywood picture show.<br /><br />It dawned on me - this subtle and, I dare say, dysfunctional, obsession with the macabre and death, that Mr. Burton harbors, has found an interesting way of expressing itself - Josette is telling Vicky to throw herself off the cliff throughout the film in order for Vicky to gain the everlasting union with Barnabas (there is no curse, Vicky jumps of her own volition, is about to die, and just like she planned - he turns her into an immortal, blood sucking monster, weird kissing of the undead ensues).  Well, my mind is boggled, Mr. Burton, disturbingly but nicely played!<br /><br />Also, having Josette and Vicky mastered by the same actress blew my mind, I did not even realize they were played by the same person at first.<br /><br />All in all, this might be what they call entertainment...
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I enjoyed the game but thought that some of the flow was off. I was annoyed to have to travel from one end to the other repeatedly to find objects. it kept me busy and the puzzles and graphics were good. I did have some freezing issues on my kindle fire.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Great entertainment - plot was not what I expected and it was very good - some friends watched it and good Sci-Fi
B003MC5N28|5.0|I first read this book when I was in the sixth grade and have never been able to forget it. Easily one of my favorite novels. I have probably read this book five times.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Better than I expected - have seen non 3D so this was great - have shared it with friends and they agree
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|the app has help organize my to do lists and has ready helped keep me on task in my professional and private life
B009UMTMKS|5.0|This is a great mashup of the work being done by Steve Blank, Alex Osterwald and Eric Ries.  Very well done and extremely useful.  If you are considering an idea and trying to determine if it has economic value and can be a business this is a great place to start.  Great addition to the Lean LaunchPad online at Udacity.
B0028E9VVA|5.0|I LOVED 4 and truly enjoyed the series. Listen to your sense that toasts the Hemingwayesque herO. The HERO IS CLINT, NiCK Adams and Gary Cooper. Heap loss and tragedy with pop cultural and English mnajor references (not enough)and you have a really fine show called, PRISON BREAK. Try to ignore the critifcs who probably have issues with Wentworth. Great show!
1449389627|5.0|Well written and on point book.  Used excellent examples of points being made.  Done with a bit of humor and some great lessons to learn.
B005DD7JL2|3.0|I recommend this movie for the people who enjoy martial arts movies. It has great actions! I loved the mortal Kombats movies so this movie is very similar so I think you will enjoy it as well.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was the fact that the main character its small and looks like a teenager!
1594488886|5.0|Great and heart wrenching story. It reflects the situation of women in Afghanistan in a very emotion appealing way, and helps us all understand the challenges women face in Afghanistan. Highly recommend.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Please add option to put notes on keys and maybe a side scroll of the music on a music staff, to help me learn the notes I am playing. Also the other hand auto playing throws me off on the third song.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love the challanges yet not to difficult to figure out. Lots of puzzles to keep me busy for a long time.<br />The color makes it more fun to complete.
B005K17RU0|5.0|application installs well and works well. keeps current and pushes.alerts of pending weather events. provides all of the needed information to plan
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show! It is simply amazing and it will make you laugh until you cry. This show is funny without it be raunchy and extremely dirty. I will continue watching this show as long as they keep making episodes.
0385344333|2.0|Not one of his better books as I was concerned.  Too prosey he went on & on telling you about the landscape & roads in Nebraska & Iowa.  The story just dragged.  The best part was probably the last 2 chapters.  I love the Jack Reacher character but not in this book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very good game for improving and challenging your mind. Also just fun to play. Would like a few more free helps.
030758836X|1.0|I read all the reviews which were very good so I bought the book.  The book is written in he says, she says.  One chapter is a he says the next is a she says.  That's how the whole book went.  Read the whole thing when I was on vacation in Cancun while sunbathing to pass the time.  I still can't figure out what the big hoopla was about the story.  Maybe it was the format?  It was a real waste of money especially when I could have purchased a much better book.  Not likable characters especially the girl.  The guy was a wimp.
1609611543|5.0|I got this as a gift for my husband.  He read it in one sitting and immediately put some of its concepts to work.  Within a very short time, he had lost 20 lbs, had regulated his blood sugars, and was feeling like a new person.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is everything I could have hoped for. I wish I was Tina Fey. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure I'm Liz Lemon.
0345803485|5.0|Although I agree with some of the reviews stating that there are a lot of repetitive moments in this trilogy, I loved it!  That didn't bother me as much because it was a great story that kept me entertained.  I read all three books twice.  Even though this is cleary not real life and a fantasy, you get lost while reading it and go through all kinds of emotions.  I laughed, I cried, I sighed, etc.  I haven't picked up a book in a long time because of my busy schedule, but I am glad I did with this trilogy and I hope there is more to come.  A deep and touching story.  I know some people are not big fans of the first book, but give it a chance and pick up the second one.  It only gets better!<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />I would love to read more from Christian's point of view.  It was interesting to read about his thoughts.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote for everything! Makes it so convenient to access, edit, print, and share thoughts, lists, ideas - anything really...
B004L03B3S|5.0|Have you noticed they are very close? This wonderful film is about the extraordinary love between two half-brothers. A love which seems a bit over the top for even their family who fear that one day these two young boys will begin sexualizing their relationship with each other. Francisco, the older of the two, is very protective of his younger sibling Thomas. Thomas in turn, idolizes his big brother/hero. They are virtually inseperable, although too young to understand their feelings may get a bit more confusing over time.<br /><br />Notable quotes from the film, at least for me seem to come more from Thomas, whose display of his young ability to count exhibits itself through his remark: \\" one weinie plus one weinie equals a little weinie and a big wieinie\\". The film is tastefully done with no child nudity, even in the bathtub they are wearing swim suits, and not until they are both grown is there any display whatsoever of nudity. Even then, only brief moments of partial nudity.<br /><br />It is a poignant look at love, tenderness, affection and incredible bonding. The kind which might one day lead to a sexual manifestation, but is certainly not created through such a relationship. It is created only in their hearts. After the death of their mother and Francisco's father, Thomas' father feels he should move on and leave these two to live their lives as they choose, never too far away to offer his support to both. Strong familial bonds throughout lend support to the theme of the film.<br /><br />As adults the committed love of these brothers is tested, as Thomas, true to his young words that he will one day swim as well as his brother, is invited to train for the Olympics, but must relocate to Russia for three years. I won't tell you how the film ends, but I will tell you that it makes sense and when it's over, you feel you got some kind of ending that you deserved for investing one hour and 40 minites of your life waiting for. The only slow moments are really near the end as it might spend a bit too much time with Francisco's search for a way to cope without Thomas in his life for the very first time.<br /><br />The film is set in beautiful Brazil, in Portuguese with English subtitles. AS with any foreign film, the subtitles can pass rather fast at times and be difficult to keep up as you would prefer. The acting is SUPERB all the way from the young boys who will knock your socks off, to the handsome young men who take the plot to completion. Sound and picture quality is also excellent, and I must admit that this film far exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about this one, but as it turns out, very much worth while, the best \\"feel good\\" movie I've seen in a long long time. The storyline is believable, the acting is effortless and realistic. I immediately wanted to watch the whole thing again as soon as it was over. I didn't want it to end. I HIGHLY recommend this film. You will be greatly surprised how well done it is and I highly doubt the theme of this incestuous relationship will bother you in the slightest.
B005LMEB8E|5.0|i love this album and it's way cheaper than Itunes! I buy all my music from here because the downloads are cheaper and faster plus you can still play them on Itunes!
B009Y2KGSQ|5.0|Give it a try..very much worth the time. Not so fond of the Joe Perry sound on a few songs but Steven is up to par for his part. Carrie Underwood great on one song. Classic Aerosmith. I think so many people are stuck in the old songs of Aerosmith and won't give the new ones a chance. For some good old rockin' Areosmith 99% of this album delivers! Welcome Back Boys!!!!
B008CYDD7I|5.0|I loved this movie when I found it online. I watched the two movies that came after it as well. Not as good but entertaining. This one has to be one of the best zombie films of the 80s. Jeffery Combs, you are just too good.
B001EOOR8C|5.0|God how I miss the vibe of the time in which this seminal album was made! Kantner and Slick were fearless and their creativity was peaking, making this a definitive representation of the era. The sound is great on this iteration and I was touched by the beauty of Grace's piano playing...put this one on late at night after some good wine or maybe a puff or two...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game a lot.  It's one of my favorites! It's not as good as most game's. But I still like it a lot.
1611761557|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Duran fan. I have been following the band and all the side projects since the 80's. That  said I tried to be objective and not just a Duranie while reading this book. I must say that I was very impressed by this book. John paints a very honest and sometimes heartbreaking picture of a Lost Wild Boy dealing with fame and excess in a time when fame and excess were the norm, when Duran Mania was at its highest peak, and when most young men are struggling with self identity. This well written, well paced book gives us a peak into the wild ride that was/is Duran Duran. John's brutal honesty about his insecurities and drug addition are both insightful and sad. His triumph over his addictions and journey into peace of mind and spirit inspire and comfort. One of most heartbreaking parts of the book comes near the end when John struggles to deal with his father's illness and death.<br /><br />I purchased the audio edition of this book and I have to admit that usually books read by the author are not that great. Let's face it most writers are not readers and most of the time I find books read by the author hard to listen to. This was not the case with In The Pleasure Groove. John's reading is very well done. He makes it seem as though you are in a room with him and he is talking to you and sharing the secrets of his heart. All in all I would say to all fans of Duran/JT give it a read or better yet give it a listen. You just might find yourself In The Pleasure Groove.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is a must see show. It keeps you thinking about what is really the underline story. The characters are all well developed and its never just one story to follow.
0394818237|5.0|My daughter suggested this book as a gift for my 3yr old granddaughter.The family had another copy but it was tattered and worn by much reading and use by the birthday girls 3 older siblings.The book is delightful and appeals to a broad age range.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Just an awesome show...  The main characters are great...  I highly recommend the show to family, friends and my co-workers
B007SGM084|5.0|Great book. Love the fact that it's delivered right to the kindle with in seconds. Awesome way to get books!
B00004SZWB|4.0|Such a beautiful CD, lifts my spirits whenever I listen to it.  Very easy listening, great background music when you're entertaining or crank it up for a party.  I love Stevie Wonder and in my opinion Hotter than July is one of his best works.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I love this movie. I am a mild Alien fan. I have seen all ther movies, never went to a theater to see one. I went to see this movie having no idea that it was tied to the sieres. So it was a huge suprise to find the connection. If you have ever been genuinely suprised by a movie, for me it is a very gratifying experience - extremely rare.<br />Even if the suprise put the movie over the top, the movie itself is a masterpiece. The acting is flawless the story is riveting and completely original. The final priase for the movie is the 3D. I bought a 3D TV and again was blown away by the effects. Every bit as good as in the theater.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wow! What a great read. More often than not I end up not reading this genre, but I am glad that I didn't miss out on it. I wasn't too sure what to expect when I first picked this one up, but Ernest Cline definitely didn't disappoint. I found myself unable to resist reading, even in the most inopportune times, just because I couldn't stop wondering what would happen next (I love books that do that to me).<br /><br />As someone who reached her teen years in the 1980's, I loved the blasts of nostalgia that were woven throughout the story. As someone who has played MMOs, video games, and spent a lot of time online, I found parts of the story and characters to be spot on....for both 2012 and 2044. That being said, this is a great read whether or not you are a gamer or a child of the 80s. :)
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I will start off by saying that I am a gen Xer. The grunge movement was the best thing that ever happened. It was amazing to live through. I am so grateful that it happened. I grew up listening to heavy metal. People treated you like there was something wrong with you if you listened to a Black Sabbath album.<br />When Nirvana came out, it didn't sound that different then what was I was listening to, (Teen Spirit) extemely heavy. I remember thinking this can never be popular. It can never happen. Then the world turned on it's ear and for a few years and a form of rock that was more genuine and moving then everything I had ever heard, was main stream. I formed a deep relationship with Soundgarden. One of the best bands of all time. Easily in the same breath as Led Zepplin and Black Sabbath. Never been a band like them before or after. Hearing this album was an amazing event for me. It was like seeing a member of an extinct  species that ran wild when you were young. Not just a member of the species but you see the leader of the pack... still alive, stronger than ever and even more real and beuatiful then you remember him to be.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy having a solitaire app on all my gadgets for downtime. This one is easy to play with  a single finger tap used to auto-move cards instead of dragging them. There are choices for card and background colors. As a free app, this one is well designed.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game entertained me for hours! Fast paced game with lots of action! Jet Pack Joy Ride on skies! Worth the dollar!
0756405890|5.0|I usually am not a huge fantasy fan.  There are lots of genres I usually prefer over fantasy.  So when my oldest son recommended \\"The Name of the Wind\\" I kind of hemmed and hawed around before deciding to read it.  But he is also the one who kept nagging me to read [[ASIN:0544003411 The Lord of the Rings]], my favorite book of all time (once I finally read it).  So I took my son at his word and read this book.<br /><br />Do you want to read a saga you won't forget and will have a hard time putting down?  I felt like I was in Kvothe's world, living with the troupe, living in dire straits in Tarbean, finding my way to University, toiling at a small inn.  What a world of pathos, of happiness, of music, of magic!<br /><br />A little bit of Anne McCaffrey and Pern; a bit of Rowling and Harry Potter; a bit more of McCammon and [[ASIN:1416552502 Speaks the Nightbird]], all tumbled together gives us the fantastical world of Kvothe - with fae and draccus, with love and hate, with times of wonder and times of deepest sorrow.<br /><br />I'm reading the second book in the Kingkiller Chronicles series now - [[ASIN:0756407125 The Wise Man's Fear]] and enjoying it just as much as \\"The Name of the Wind.\\"  I just hope it doesn't take as long for author Rothfuss to finish the final book in the series.  That's the only problem with series or trilogies - the wait!  My memory isn't as good as it used to be.  At least I am getting to read books one and two together.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|WORST DIARY OF A WIMPY KID YET IT WAS THE WORDT BOOK EVER ALL THE OTHER ONES WERE GOOD THOUGH
B0027BOL4G|5.0|For one thing as far as I'm concerned I'm not embarking much into all the hysteria of nice peoples becoming vegan only \\"because it save the planet\\"... This very well-done and well-documented serious documentary will probably not turn any reasonable person into a vegan overnight, but it will probably encourage him/her to begin buying only organic things and shop at the farmer's market where the meat is made in a decent way... They show how the meat industry have come from one of the best jobs one could possibly dream to have in the US during the forties to an industry where 4 companies control 80% of the meat market and where they have agreement with the police so they would not arrest more than 15 illegal workers a night so it would not disrupt the \\"assembly line\\"... They show that this job have become so dangerous nobody want to do it anymore; the giant slaughterhouse located in the city of Tar Heel, who is one of the poorest city in the US, have to bus in workers from a 100 miles radius... They also underline the problem of genetically-engineered food; those who don't care about that kind of food will learn that the company Monsanto who produce the genetically-modified seeds have private investigators and are prosecuting farmers if their fields are \\"contaminated\\" with patented Monsanto seeds; the farmers then have to prove in a court of law that they didn't plant these seed intentionally, that they're present only because all their neighbors have some... It should be noted that the company Wal-Mart among others is one of the very very few who accepted to collaborate to the making of this documentary. At the end they show there's hope for the future since organic food is one of the fastest-growing area in the USA currently; as they say \\"you can vote to change the situation; three times a day\\"... Overall I would say it's a must-see for anyone who feel concerned about those problems, even if only because it's well-done technically and also very entertaining...
0553386794|4.0|GRRM was new to me but I began to read these novels while becoming enamored of the HBO(?) series. This is the best of the bunch but I still feel compelled to finish the series.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This novel is written in language appropriate for a young reader.  The subject matter is appropriate for everyone.  I read it for book club reluctantly and waited until the last minute because I didn't think I would like it.  I am an adult and I like literature and fiction that challenges me.  However, the story is quite compelling and I ended up reading it much farther into the night than I should have.<br /><br />The story is written from the point of view of the boy and the people in this young boy's life.  The reader sees what the malformed child sees and feels, as well as those around him.  Although the language is simplistic, the story and feelings are not.<br /><br />The story is about bullying and empathy and how one state can become the other. It is sad, but encouraging, because it has a very optimistic outlook.  It is a lesson for young and old.  I am not sorry I read it and I would recommend it for children to discuss with their adults and adults to read and discuss with their children.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As expected of John Grisham, this novel has characters who are well filled-out. You never know exactly what's going on so the final passage was surprising and well-worth the read.
0525953728|5.0|This book was incredible, at least to me. I, like most Americans, wanted to know more of the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden. Mark Owen did a fantastic job of revealing what happened through his own eyes without revealing things that I feel would cause security issues. I appreciate being able to see what it was like from the point of view of someone who was actually there and actually risked his life, rather than seeing an interview from those in the Situation Room watching it. He explains the emotions the members of DevGru all felt, and that made me realize how much of a sacrifice these men make every single day. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those interested in Operation Neptune Spear and the world of Navy SEALs.
B000QUCPWU|5.0|I ordered this for my husband after he began to play Booker T and the MGs constantly while sitting at his computer. Now it's a necessary part of his auto music.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|So far, so good. I've listened to Sgt. Peppers, Abbey Road, Rubber Soul, and the White Album and they all sound fantastic.  The sound isn't quite as live as the USB key, probably due to the lack of limiting/compression, but they are pristine, clear, quiet, and nice and warm.  Definitely have that \\"analog\\" feel.<br /><br />I'd ask those who claim these to be made from the 24/44 master to cite their source, as I've done quite a bit of Googling and the apparently best sources say these were pressed from 24/96 masters that had been equalized from the non-compressed/limited 24/192 digital remaster.  24/96 is plenty good and thus these are theoretically the highest resolution versions yet available of the 2009 remastering project, which even Dr. Ebbets agrees had fantastic results.  If you, like me, loved the 2009 versions and wanted something even higher resolution than the USB key, this is IT!<br /><br />What I don't get is people complaining that these weren't taken from the analog masters of yore.  They already printed those - if you want that, go buy that.  This set is the (stereo) vinyl representation of the 2009 remastering project and that's the point.<br /><br />Vinyl is never perfect, but so far these are up to the standard of most of my other 180G audiophile pressings (not a small sample size).  I definitely recommend this set!
0446556750|5.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors and I am always on the lookout for new novels. I didn't think I would enjoy the Mickey Haller character as much as Harry Bosch but he is a welcome addition to Connelly's family.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very rarely it seems do you discover a new author and series. My Kindle allowed me to do just that. Being my first review, I want to inspire any hesitant reader to fully enjoy the Wool series. Well conceived and exceptionally well written, the characters and story will stay with you for a long time after you turn your last page. Thanks to Mr. Howey for an outstanding couple of weeks of pleasurable reading.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I was not familiar with &#34;Castle&#34; at the time my daughter bought me this season. I enjoyed it so much that I went and bought the first season. Now I'm a full fledged fan. DVR it just in case I can't watch it.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|We loved thismovie in theatres and the soundtrack is great. It's nice to be reminded of good times when we were younger.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|This book is decent, but I tire of the poor writing and constant back patting.  I concur that this guy is pretty awesome, so I don't need to be reminded of it God only knows how many times.  Typical of what to expect...\\"some people say I am a hero, others say I am a guy who is a relentless perfectionist honing my craft one kill at a time.  I guess they are probably both right.\\"  That is not an exact quote, but you get the idea.  It would be interesting to count the number of times the SEAL appears in the text, as I suspect it will be hundreds.  OK, so what Chris did was pretty amazing.  Being a SEAL is amazing.  The risks he took are much greater than I have ever or will ever take.  Definitely a great American and I hope his book sells well.  All that said, this book is ok.  The story is ok.  Just ok, but still ok.  ok?
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Loved thismovie and was so glad to find in on DVD to have forever. Love stories do exist even if the ending is sad.

1936608898|5.0|Super motivating and realistic. I have never been able to feel like a diet book would be able to change my habits enough to become a lifestyle, but this book has done it!!! The meal-maps help teach you how to cook so you don't have to spend two hours in the kitchen every night and $200 at the grocery store each week following actual recipes.. Buy this book! I wish I could buy it for everyone I know:)
B001VIMCW4|3.0|Lots of action, hard to follow.  There needs to be a little more story to go with the action, it left me confused.
0345475674|5.0|Any time I read a novel related to historical facts it really catches my total attention, so I learn because I want to know more about the time and the facts.
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|Deep story about self expression and individualism vs collectivism.  A much needed lesson for today's world of big government control.
0812984412|4.0|The structure of the novel -- a kind of bell curve from the past to the future to the past -- was fascinating, and the varying dialects from 19th century Dickensian formality to an imagined future dystopian patois made each story a richer tale.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Works great for a basic calculator. My daughter is learning the basic trigger functions and she appreciates the basic layout and function.<br /><br />It would be nice if it had a ribbon display up to three previous results. But none the less no flaws.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My kids love it!! Great overall game! Requires some thought to it! The kids like building and making it to the finish line!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Loved it every time I read this super novel.  Will read it again and again. One of my favorite books of all time.  The classics always stand the test of time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If its free I guess any basic calc will do. The great thing is this is a great calc that has many functions and IT is free.  Even if it cost a little it would still be a good buy. So... my reviews are usually short and sweet... get this app.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am loving this series so much more than 50 shades. The characters are well-developed and you can understand the undeniable attraction between them. I cannot wait for the next book.
B005VPRETE|3.0|The set itself is cute, and it has some fun details, but the minifig doesn't move the same way that regular Lego people do--specifically, the hands cannot rotate nor can the legs separate. What's more, the only piece of the figure that is interchangeable with regular Lego minifigs is the hair, which was disappointing as my daughter and I were really looking forward to seeing how Olivia would look in a spacesuit or with a pirate hook instead of a left hand.<br /><br />The blocks themselves can be combined with other Lego sets, so that is a plus. However, creatively mixing and matching the minifig pieces to create new characters is one of the fun things about traditional Lego, and this element is conspicuously lacking in the \\"Friends\\" line. Swapping clothes and hairstyles between the \\"Friends\\" just isn't the same.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game works great and is so much fun! The games are really cool. Works awesomely on the kindle fire.

B008D28HYS|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I've been addicted since I downloaded it. I was lucky to get the game free when it was the free game of the day on my kindle. However, if u are a fan of logic games it is totally worth the price. This game has given me countless hours of entertainment. Also, new games are added often so u never run out of games to play. I highly recommend this game. One of the best games I've ever downloaded. I really can't say enough great things about this game. Give it a try, it is very addictive. I play it at lunch time at work and in the car on long rides. The pictures are actually very surprisingly well done. Download and enjoy!
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|great action movie and i really enjoyed every minute of action and story line they really keep you drawn in

B0030MM68O|4.0|i'm formerly of the Marine Corps and an iraqi war vet. this movie does well to capture the look and feel of iraq. there are many technical and tactical flaws in the movie. but, for the sake of entertainment, movies often need to deviate from \\"how it is\\". it is entertaining. i enjoyed Sgt. James' character. again, there's really no need for emotionally unstable cowboys especially in the EOD field. but, it worked for the big screen. i enjoyed watching this movie several times and do recommend it for it's entertainment value. do not look for too much in the way of tactical value. take it for what it is.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|this is a great movie because it has action and love it is great because it allows for a different view of the future
B002SAUCBC|3.0|This is the first Stephen King book I have read in a long time. A friend recommend this to me because I liked The Hunger Games. If you are a reader that needs everything explained to you in the story this is not the book for you. This story left a lot of questions for me and I like closure when I read a book. Maybe Mr King is not really my kind of author. With that being said, I did like the story so I gave it three stars.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|this is a great action movie about the underdog holding to the end to become a top dog fighting the champs
0345440900|5.0|Excellent book - I buy it for all my girlfriends' baby showers.  Of course you take some of it with a grain of salt b/c her advice won't appeal exactly to everyone... but definitely the E.A.S.Y. steps of how to raise a baby end up working (with all 4 of my children!) and bring much peace to the parents.  My kids were all trained to sleep at least 7 hours straight per night by 3 months on Tracy's method.  Babies are more content when they are set to routine and so are the moms!<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone I meet who is a bleary-eyed and exhausted mother...  Give it a try!
1439102430|5.0|I love Temperance getting involved with the detectives on a case and reading about the scrapes she gets herself into and out of. I hope there will be more Temperance Brennan novels because I have just read the last in the series. She is great.
1609611543|4.0|I was in less than great shape for most of my life because I didn't really enjoy exercising and because my mom didn't cook.  We ate out a lot.  To make a long story short, when I was about 25-ish (I lived with my parents until I was 27 because I was unable to make a living wage at the full-time job I had), I learned how to cook, cleaned up my diet, and joined a gym, which resulted in me losing about 45 pounds.  I made clean eating and exercise a habit, and I still do...or thought I did.<br /><br />I live by myself now.  I own a house, which is expensive and comes with a variety of bills...so when buying my own groceries, I have supplemented with cheap things like pasta for meals.  Sometimes I would have spaghetti three or four times a week or more to try and keep under $30 a week for groceries.  I never ate out and always did my own cooking.  I worked out about five times a week, although my workout time over the last year had been cut down somewhat due to my job.<br /><br />I noticed at the beginning of this year that I had been gaining weight.  Not a lot, but more than I had wanted.  I joined an additional gym (I work on a military base, so I have access to the base gym, which is also crowded) and started working out more.  I was in the gym regularly for three hours a day at one point.  No results.  Where exercise before had made me feel energized, I was now always constantly exhausted.  I ate toast in the morning for breakfast because it was fast and would feel hungry an hour or two later.  I didn't lose any weight, so I hired a personal trainer, who I worked out with for two months.  The diet plan he gave me recommended that I wasn't eating enough calories and that I should also be eating \\"healthy whole grains.\\"  So I made up for extra calories with that.  I took sandwiches for lunch instead of drinking protein shakes, which I had done for years.  My bodyfat percentage when I started had been about 22.5%, and my goal had been to get down to 19% in three months.When I finished with him, my BF% had gone up to 23.5%, and I had gained about six pounds.  Some of it was muscle, sure, but shouldn't my fat have also gone down?<br /><br />I started counting calories religiously and joined a website for calorie counting.  I kept an obsessive food and exercise log.  I started p90x and did cardio for 50 minutes at lunch and then a session of p90x in the afternoons.  I got to day 45 but hadn't lost any weight.  In fact, I had gained five pounds and my bodyfat percentage had also gone up.  I was constantly feeling exhausted.  I didn't sleep well.  It didn't matter if I slept for 6 hours or 16 (which happened sometimes on the weekends).  I would feel terrible and unrested upon awakening.  At work, I would occasionally have days where I was so tired it was anything I could do to keep from falling asleep in my chair.  Sometimes this even happened while I was driving.  I knew it couldn't go on.  My brother has severe sleep hypopnea...maybe I did, too, and maybe that's what my problem was.<br /><br />I went to the doctor to get a blood test.  He commented on the size of my thyroid and had it tested.  I thought maybe I'd finally have my answer...but nope, all my levels came back healthy.  So why was I still gaining weight despite eating healthy and exercising regularly?  Why was I so exhausted?  He didn't have an answer.  He didn't order a sleep study and was dismissive of my weight gain, as if I were lying to him about exercising and eating right.  He told me to take melatonin and get more sleep.<br /><br />Three weeks ago, I was in Barnes and Noble and saw this book.  I'd seen reviews for it online but hadn't bought it, dismissing it as possibly another one of the many fad diets there are (my mom lost some weight on the Atkins diet in the early 00's but gained it all back and I didn't want a \\"diet\\").  However, at this point, I was willing to try anything.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and very persuasive.  There is a good mix of scientific study and case studies of Dr. Davis' patients, who all seem to have pretty remarkable results after eliminating wheat from their diets.  I had no idea how much wheat had been changed in such a short time, and what is presented in the book seems to make perfect sense.  It does get a little bit repetitive, since the point of the book can be summed up as \\"wheat is bad for you, mmkay\\" and it rehashes that quite a bit.  Since he's not really selling anything other than a couple of books, I feel more inclined to trust Dr. Davis than if he were touting this as some kind of miracle \\"diet.\\"  What he is proposing is more of a lifestyle change for better health; that some people also manage to lose weight with it is just an added bonus.<br /><br />I'm not a scientist or a doctor, but certainly a lot of the malaise I'd been feeling seemed to coincide with the upswing in my own wheat intake.  Even though I was \\"perfectly healthy,\\" could I have been poisoning myself in ways I didn't even realize, by trying to get in more calories that I supposedly \\"needed\\" to keep my metabolism going?  After dismissing the recipe section as stuff I knew I wouldn't like, I quit eating wheat products, pretty much cold turkey.  I noticed that even the brand of whey protein I had been drinking for lunch (a different brand than I'd used to drink) contained wheat and stopped doing that, as well.<br /><br />I feel a lot better since I have.  On two instances where I had things I knew contained wheat (a small piece of cake with lunch for a special occasion, and a couple of gyouza last weekend), I felt terrible and experienced energy crashes shortly afterward.  Was wheat my problem all along?  Maybe.<br /><br />I've also gained two pounds.  That said, I'm going to keep wheat products out of my life, since feeling better and being less exhausted will probably help my workouts, at least.  The next thing in my diet I'm going to attempt to eliminate is dairy, which will be more difficult for me personally, but not everything in life worth doing is easy.<br /><br />Read this book and follow its advice to feel better, but take all the remarkable case studies with a grain of salt.  Different people will respond differently.  Hearing that people did nothing other than eliminate wheat from their diets and lost 20 or 30 pounds is inspiring, sure, but don't expect that to happen and don't be angry when it doesn't happen for you, since it's not the book's fault that some people responded more quickly.  Time will tell whether or not it ends up working out for me.  Three weeks is still a relatively short time.  I'll update this review if things end up changing at all.
B0057MFA42|1.0|I can't believe the gall of the publisher to post something in the Product Description area claiming there are no sync issues.<br />I'm using an up to date Oppo blu-ray player, Samsung plasma TV, and a Pioneer receiver, all of which don't have any issues with other blu-ray discs.<br /><br />All you have to do is watch the 2nd song, Aneurysm, and watch Dave Grohl's drum parts. Something is off, just slightly, but it's off. It's obvious. Do a search...it's all over on other web sites.<br /><br />So disappointing. This should be a monumental release. I would suggest not buying this version.

1250006341|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which goes into the background and research involved with the making of Downton Abbey.  Some of the detail is really impressive and it is now obvious why the story, plot,settings and actors are able to weave such an extraordinary experience for the viewers of the series.  British dramas have always been favorites of mine, but I had to practically tie my daughters to chairs to get them to watch seasons one and two - which they were certain would be the bore of all time.  Suffice it to say, they became totally hooked within a couple of episodes, and with the book adding more to enthrall them, they are now asking every week when season three will be starting! The book is well worth the price and is a great resource when questions arise.
B009B2VBWE|2.0|I'll say right up front that I've been a fan of Diana Krall's for almost as long as she's been recording.  She has a gift for interpretation, no doubt, and that's important in jazz and blues.  She has the chops, and she has the pipes.  I've also no doubt that she can sing blues ... but this album of songs from the '20s and '30s is neither/nor.  Rather, it sounds like she watched one too many episodes of Boardwalk Empire in a row, got depressed and wallowed in the fake-happy cynicism of the music of that era (especially as presented in that series, which worked there but doesn't here), then decided to record some while she was still feeling really bummed.  Which left **me** bummed and wishing she'd return to her wonderful piano playing, if this is all we can expect from her vocal choices now.<br /><br />Have I always liked her choices?  No, not always, but I always respected them and understood what she was trying to do.  Until now.  Does it work this time?  Not so much.  A pretty cynical move putting her in lingerie, too, like she was one of the dance-hall girls back then; but I couldn't care less about the cover, really, as long as the music's good ... and this time, it's well done but still grossly underwhelming.  She wasted herself on this.<br /><br />Like a few other excellent pianists who discovered they could sing and garnered a much larger audience that way -- Nat Cole and Harry Connick Jr. come to mind -- Krall seems to have forgotten her piano playing (unlike, for example, the magnificent Shirley Horn).  Krall has an inventive keyboard style that always pulls you in and delivers, whether she's playing jazz or blues, but it's gone or lost here amid all this heavy melancholia.  I love her ballads, but not here.  Instead of wrenching your heart, they simply drag you down.  If you're disappointed in this, give a listen for comparison to All Night Long on Only Trust Your Heart, Clint Eastwood's Why Should I Care from When I Look In Your Eyes, or, for that matter, the previously recorded Garden In The Rain from Love Scenes -- which she did so beautifully on that album that I'm puzzled why she rerecorded it for this album with such morbid results.  She knows how to do a heartbreaking song when she wants to; I'm thinking of Goodbye on the Charlie Haden Quartet West album Sophisticated Ladies.  But this?  Feh!<br /><br />If Krall wanted something that called back to Prohibition or the Depression era, she'd have done better to have taken her cue from Lil Hardin Armstrong and Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, Kid Ory or the piano players of the era:  Jelly Roll Morton, Duke Ellington, Willie 'The Lion' Smith, Art Tatum, Earl 'Fatha' Hines, Mary Lou Williams.  Seriously.  There was more than enough good music back then to make a suicidal album like this unnecessary.<br /><br />In fact, the more I listen and think about it, the more I conclude that what all these songs wish they could sound like is the moving Cry Me A River from The Look of Love, which has the same sensibility as most of these songs but is much better done (and doesn't wallow in its misery).  We know you can do it better, Diana ... so go back to the studio and show us, yes?  This ain't it.  Oh, and get a better set of sidemen, too; dump the twangy stuff and get back to a real jazz trio behind you.<br /><br />Final grade:  D for depressing.  Buy one of her earlier ones instead.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie surpassed my expectations. Anytime a classic story is remade with a new twist, I'm usually very skeptical as for one thing, they story is by definition, &#34;predictable&#34;. I liked that this high budget version was made for teens to grown ups and in the style of an epic adventure. The special effects were not overdone and it was well acted. Charlize Theron was amazing and Kristen Stewart turned in a decent performance. The ending was a little dissatisfying as it seemed to end a bit abruptly. Although we get s sense of where they will take the story in a sequel, they could have set it up a little more.

To make it even better they have added new puzzles twice since I purchased it.  It is always nice to see additional puzzles to complete after you thought you went through all the puzzles.

No more of the \\"my prince will come\\" nonsense;strong,empowered girls are where it's at now, and as a grandfather I want to see that message passed along.<br /><br />Won't even mention any details of the story, you really have to see it yourself.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of my friends suggested that I should join the millions of other fans and read this book. Once she told me about the characters and the content, I decided to order it and started reading it that night. I finished the first book in 2 days and the entire trilogy in a week. I enjoyed the drama, the romance, the eroticism and the characters. I can't wait for the movie and see who was chosen to play the characters of Christian and Ana. I have a few actors/actresses in mind as I am sure every reader does. I wonder if E.L. James will be able to top this 50 Shades trilogy. I look forward to seeing her try.

Point being:  It was as fun watching the audience as it was watching the talented cast...<br /><br />I will say, we have been happily married for 30 years and really can't relate to this movie except for the fact that our grandparents ALL slept in separate beds; therefore, we deduced that THEY had the same problems....  TLJ and MS probably should have portrayed a couple married 40 years...  We are early 50's and they are both a good 10 years older than we are...This is why I gave the movie 4****s instead of 5.<br /><br />Otherwise, I recommend this movie to ALL married couples, regardless of age!  Who knows...maybe this is all the \\"therapy\\" they will ever need.  Isn't it true that prevention is the best medicine??!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The 50 Shades of Gray series is the best I have ever read.  When the first book ended I couldn't wait until I started the next one and I felt the same way after the second book.  Christian Gray has to be the sexiest man on earth.  It was so good I plan on reading all 3 books again.  Also it would be nice if E.L. James wrote a sequel to the 3rd book.  My friend and I just didn't want it to end.  They just didn't have enough time to explore each other before she had the baby.  It would be interesting to find out the lives after the children are grown and out on their own.  Looking forward to the movie but don't know how they could show what I read.  Loved them all.

It's so real, honest, funny, sad and when I was reading it I was honestly just an emotional wreck because for the first time I felt like someone understood me. For once in my life I didn't feel alone. I strongly recommend this book to any teenager whether you're going through hard times or not this book. Stephen Chbosky is an amazing writer and I'm so sad that he hasn't written any other books. Please go pick up a copy of the perks of being a wallflower you will not regret it. I really don't know what else say because words cannot describe to you how happy this book has made me.

I broke it out to watch with my family and my Mom one night and they were all apprehensive because it looks like a movie about football.  While the premise of the movie (it's a true story by the way) is about football, it's about so much more than that.  Before the movie they barely wanted to give it a chance, but trusted me and at the end everyone agreed that it was one of the best movies they'd seen.  My 9 year old had to write a sentence about her favorite movie the next day at school and she picked Rudy!<br /><br />If you enjoyed movies like Invincible or The Blind Side Rudy is a must see for you.  It's a great addition to any family movie collection.
B00A0NOF7G|2.0|Cute young Lexi´s ex-boyfriend is murdered by poisoned cupcakes that came from Lexi´s own bakery. The investigating detective happens to be very handsome and happens to live next door to Lexi. Lexi´s grandmother has her own \\"detective club\\" together with some other sweet old ladies at the Retirement Community and they join in to find the murderer.<br />It is not badly written but it is so very simple, cute and utterly predictable, the romance is obvious from chapter one and you can guess who the murderer is from the moment that person enters the story. There is really no point whatsoever in reading past the first few chapters!<br />If a story has some interesting characters or a lot of humour it can make up for a weak plot and you go on reading anyway just for the fun of it, but this novel, I am sorry to say, has neither.<br />I enjoyed Nancy Drew novels at the age of 10 or 12. Now when I am an adult I want my mysteries to be more intriguing, exciting and captivating.

Indigenous rhythmias and arrhythmias, Phil Spector-ish Wall of Sound avalanches (cutting back to the stripped down full body contact sport of \\"Plain Gold Ring's\\" minimalism), a voice that can coo one minute and then wail like a banshee the next, funky skintight grooves (\\"Good Intent\\"), retro-pop (\\"Cameo Lover\\"), quietly aching sonata-like dirges (\\"The Build Up\\") - this chick is wicked Newtonian smart, with multiple colors at play. I have a tendency to get hooked on one or two songs, so I got lost in \\"Old Flame\\" for about 3 weeks, before moving on to \\"Plain Gold Ring\\" (cover of an old Nina Simone hit; both versions will keep you inflamed for days on end). I keep coming back to \\"The Build Up\\" these days, but I could still live off bread and water and the \\"Old Flame / Plain Gold Ring\\" infusion, as long as I've got a little trickle of electricity on my desert isle. Adding to the wonder of this album is the fact that most of these songs were written when Kimbra was 16 and 17. For more fun, and while you're waiting for her to come to your neighborhood, I suggest you spend some time watching the Sing Sing Studio videos of her on the Y-tube: she delivers. Lamentably missing from my CD (though it seems it has appeared on releases in other countries - not sure) is the sublimely beautiful \\"Wandering Limbs.\\" The connection may not seem readily apparent, but as one who has grieved the too soon passing of Teena Marie, Ms Kimbra Johnson righteously steps into that void with her own stunning versatility.

B005RJ6AIK|5.0|After watching the movie, I purchased this CD.  Great addition to my Hawaiian music. Nice combination of contemporary instrumental and vocal songs that have a traditional flavor.
B002ZG983M|1.0|I would probably give the movie a higher score if it weren't for Hit Girl and Big Daddy killing everyone.  Hit Girl is 10, maybe 12 years old?  Big Daddy, played by Nick Cage, is her father, who gives her butterfly knives for her birthday, and gets her into the vigilante business.  It a fantasy movie, I guess, but it's just so inappropriate.  I think Hit Girl stabs, slashes, and shoots more people in this movie than John McClain does in Die Hard.  In one scene, Hit Girl and Big Daddy have a gangster handcuffed in an SUV in a car crusher, and she pushes the button, while her dad looks on approvingly.  Big Daddy also racks up a pretty significant body count.<br /><br />It's not that I'm advocating total non-violence in movies.  I understand the ironically excessive use of blood and violence in Kill Bill and Robert Rodriguez' movies, but it doesn't sit right with me when a father tells his young daughter that it's time to put away the homework for some 1st degree murder.<br /><br />I know the movie is rated R, but it just aired at 5:30 p.m. on basic cable.  They censored some of the language, but not much else.<br /><br />Pre-teen vigilante going around killing people?  Totally inappropriate.  Fail!  I really can't get past that, to find any redeeming entertainment value.

0140120416|5.0|This is very, very good for teaching yourself Russian, or supplementing your courses. The thing I love about this book is the approach to grammar and examples, it's all very well done. It really covers everything well, and gives you a lot of resources. Follow it chapter by chapter, take notes on the grammar and vocabulary, and you will be very well off. Like any book on learning something you need to invest some time into it. But if you do it will pay off. You should note that it does not contain audio. I find that the lack of audio is perfectly fine for me. This book is good if you're a little lazy to use audio or are more of a book learner like me. In terms of pronunciation, the book does a very good job teaching it. To supplement the audio, I would recommend looking up some Russians speaking and trying to imitate it. On YouTube there will be some &#34;learning Russian&#34; audio clips, and you can listen to them and see if you can understand what is said. Personally, my approach was to learn the grammar and vocab first, then focus on audio. I think that was a slight mistake, I should have focused on all three, but in any event it worked. Overall this book is amazing. Follow it chapter by chapter and take notes on everything, study and learn it. One thing I would recommend is making exercises for yourself. There's only so much a book can do. I like to make larger exercises every couple chapters: &#34;write a paragraph about blah blah blah using these grammatical forms at least # of times&#34; etc. Use this book!

B007V508CC|1.0|I am a huge Maroon 5 fan. I have all their albums. I read all the negative comments about their latest CD and wanted to hear it for myself. Unfortunately, I have to agree. I was cleaning the house one Saturday and decided to play their 1st album and each one in order up through their latest. Wow, what a difference a few years make! Too bad it's not for the better. If you take out Adam's voice, you wouldn't even recognize the music as Maroon 5. I really hate this latest venture, but I am still a huge fan. I just don't listen to this one anymore.
0741470314|5.0|As I have always been a fan of Michael Jackson, when I had the opportunity to read \\"Defending a King ~ His Life and Legacy\\", I want to commend the author, Dr. Karen Moriarty for allowing her readers to gain a new perspective of Michael Jackson, other than what has been portrayed by the media.  Michael Jackson truly lived a challenging life as he lived under the scrutiny of media, paparazzi, and his fans.  I understand now why he chose to live in seclusion, raise his children in privacy and as we can see, his children exude the love that Michael Jackson instilled in them as he raised them as a single father.  I recommend this book for fans who will learn more about Michael Jackson's challenges and his resiliency to live his life as he chose to live it, while sharing his love for his fans and humanity with his generosity.

My blu-ray player is not old.  I do not understand why this happens.  Forget blu-rays!  Stick to regular old DVD's which work.<br /><br />UPDATE: Several people have suggested I check to see is my Blu-ray player software is up-to-date.  I have checked my player and it indicates the software is current.  I still have the same issues.
B004P7CNUY|3.0|This review is for the Echo Bridge single-feature DVD release of Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.<br /><br />First off, I strongly prefer H20 to all of the other sequels - so much so that I actually only really like three films in the series - Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween H20. The beauty of H20 is that it ignores the increasingly bizarre and unbelievable events of Halloween 3-6 and brings the focus back to the series' original protagonist, Laurie Strode, played once again by Jamie Lee Curtis. Smart, modern (even today), and full of plenty of shocks and surprises, Jamie Lee proves why she is the ultimate Final Girl of the horror genre.<br /><br />When Disney and Miramax parted ways, home video distribution of their film titles became very scattered. Most of the studio's prestige titles like the original Scream trilogy, The Others, Chicago, and others are handled by Lionsgate entertainment, and the content of the home video re-releases generally remains the same as their original releases from Disney. Anchor Bay has released some titles too, including Scream 4. A good amount of titles, however, have been licensed to budget company Echo Bridge, which has been a well-known company among the $5 WalMart bin and $1 DVD rack aficionados for a long time now. These days, Echo Bridge and Mill Creek are branching out beyond the public domain fare and licensing more titles from major studios to varying results.<br /><br />I had actually bought a 4-movie set called Masters Of Terror from Echo Bridge featuring four horror sequels from Dimension Films that included H20 for $5 at a local grocery store that was packaged with Echo Bridge's DVD of From Dusk Till Dawn. All four films, as is typical for the company, are squeezed onto a single dual-layer disc. Despite compression, most films in the set are watchable, but H20 had a very choppy laggy feel during motion. Felt like a badly encoded AVI file one would have downloaded off a torrent. Not to mention each film only has fourchapters.<br /><br />When I came on here and saw that the standalone DVD was $2, I figured it might be worth it, and hoped it'd be better, and it was. The motion is definitely smoother on this disc, and Echo Bridge is far more generous with the chapter stops, giving the film 15 of them this time. Other issues remain, such as dirt, specks, DNR, MPEG2 general issues, etc. And yes, it's not the theatrical aspect ratio - it's been opened up (NOT cropped) to 16:9. While I'd rather have the original 2.35:1 composition, I'm ok with this as no information is lost AND it's anamorphic, which is the one advantage this disc has over the original disc from Disney. Audio is 2.0, but I only have a 2-speaker setup so I'm ok with this, but since the film IS mixed in 5.1, it'd only make sense for them to use that. And one does wish subtitles were available, as well as the bonus materials from the previous DVD.<br /><br />I'd recommend spending $4-$5 at the most for this DVD, which has a list price of $6.99. The film could stand a better disc, both SD and HD, from a bigger company like Lionsgate, which would have at the least retained previous bonus materials, the 5.1 audio mix, 2.35:1 composition, and offered subtitles. But for a few bucks, it's not a bad purchase. For $2, I'm happy with this disc.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I've tried several weather apps and this is my absolute favorite. Clean, clear screens that tell you the info you need to know without cluttering it up with too much detail.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book and have recommended it to my teenage grandchildren & older people.  I was particularly fascinated with the authors comparison of different religions.  I believe we are facing a time in our history in which we need to understand and respect different beliefs, and this author handled that concept beautifully, without making it a focal point in the story.  Well written book!<br />Rosalyn

B0079HLDCQ|5.0|A great read. Once again non stop excitement from start to finish. Nasty people doing nasty things but as the story unravels you can't help but get caught up in the reasons behind their motives. Thought provoking on many levels. Does our Government really work like this?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book is a fascinating read and provides insight into the daily lives of the Men and Women who sacrifice so much for our freedom. Though I disagree with the timing of the release of this account of the Bin Laden operation, I felt that Owen stayed true to his colleagues and didn't make the book about himself but instead gave much credit to many of his colleagues and provided the reader insight into the daily lives, training and sacrifices that the Navy Seals give to this country.  A must read in my opinion!!
B009YU62H2|5.0|I have to say I dont like the song \\"been away too long\\" and I hated the Avengers song. Black Rain was the only \\"new\\" Soundgarden songs that came out in recent memory that I liked.<br /><br />I was pretty underwhelmed by the first single but then again I can be a music snob. Having said that....the rest of the album is really good and nothing like the awful Cornell releases or the subpar Audioslave (okay chocheese or whatever that song is was awesome...but the rest got pretty old quick.)<br /><br />Okay so back to this album, Blood on the Valley Floor and NoState Actor I really liked and shine on this album. I love the other 4/4 tracks but they stuffed the box and checked it off, Soundgarden odd time grooves with cool lyrics.<br /><br />The album is NOT heavy but its not light and boring either. I gave it 5 stars, 4 because its good but 1 more because Soundgarden brought the boom with this one and didnt put out something lame.<br /><br />Im happy that Matt C.'s true drumming ability is being used, in PJ its kinda blah to me, but he knocks it out with this one.<br /><br />IF I could complain about anything, I would say for me the mix on the guitar solos could have been louder or brought more out front.<br /><br />All in all buy this if you liked Superuknown and especially if you liked Down on the Upside...but wanted more odd time jams like Badmotorfinger but without the drop d slug. Its sounds like a nice progression from the last album something borrowed, something old, something new. And yet is album to sound all new and stand on its own from the other long list of dics they've put out. Again I wasnt expecting this to be very good but I soon ate my words and found myself jamming along to this for days. Good work.<br /><br />I say buy it if your a long time fan like me.
B003L16FAE|5.0|I remember viewing this on VHS HI-FI Dolby Surround when it first came out and at that time it was considered by many to be a &#34;great test&#34; of your sourround system.  Well many years have passed, and watching this again on blue ray is amazing.  The picture to be an older film, really shows what the resolution of blue ray can do for a film.  Everything is crystal clear, although there are moments, especially with closeups where you can tell there was some type of enhancement done.  Not distracting though, and most but die hard HDTV nerds won't really notice.  As for the sound, the DTS Master audio track is superb!  If you really want to show off your 7.1 system, skip to the chapter where they have the big gun battle with the rebels, and where they domolish the jungle after witnessing the first &#34;real&#34; look at the predator.  Awesome surround effects that utilize every speaker, and the LFE effect is very balanced.  Not overly done, but with eonugh impact to test your subs.  Sort of how The Dark Knight's LFE is done and you know how good that is.  Overall a real must for anybody starting or continuing their blue ray collection.

B004EI3ON4|4.0|It's an album by Daft Punk. That should answer all questions about the nature and quality of the music. My only complaint is that the album isn't Derezzed over and over.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|In a world full of bands that, one-by-one, are succumbing to the radio-rock plague where everything has to be bland and mediocre, it's a breath of fresh air to have a band like The Deftones. One could think that this band would give up about now, but it's simply not true with this band. I do not understand at all how they have been prone to progressing this long, and that's in a good way. On their seventh record, titled KOI NO YOKAN, The Deftones expand their cathartic sound much more than they did on their last record DIAMOND EYES, and continue to be kings of the Hard Rock world.<br /><br />SWERVE CITY serves as a short but pleasing introduction to the album before leading into the next song, ROMANTIC DREAMS, which is similar to songs from ADRENALINE, the band's first record. It also has a classic-rock vibe to it, and it mixes very well with the 8-string riffing courtesy of Stephen Carpenter. LEATHERS has a quiet and calming 40-second intro before exploding into Chino Moreno's well-executed and well-timed high-pitched shouting that is easily the best of the genre. POLTERGEIST kicks off with a sample of hands clapping before showcasing some more crushing riffs, which is a major highlight of this musical spectacle. ENTOMBED gives us a melodic break from the heaviness, showcasing Chino Moreno's incredible singing abilities, which are the highlight of his career. GRAPHIC NATURE is heavily reminiscent of DIGITAL BATH, and is where the drumming is at its strongest. It also contains a steadier and stronger beat than DIGITAL BATH, and I know that comment seems like a blasphemy considering how remarkable that song is.<br /><br />The first radio single TEMPEST showcases the band's musical prowess throughout six minutes. GAUZE also has a classic rock sound mixed with heavy riffing, and features an instrumental interlude that bleeds into the next song, ROSEMARY, which, simply put, is the best song on this album and the highlight of the Deftones' career. The song features nothing but progression, starting off quietly, but then eventually leading into an aggressive outro that puts DIAMOND EYES to shame, before concluding with an interlude that is the most sentimental of the band's career. GOON SQUAD features a little bit of repetition, with the high-pitched \\"woo\\"s in the background of the choruses, but this is actually a good thing. The song also showcases heavy riffing mixed with classic rock. You can also very briefly hear some howling that was featured in the ADRENALINE and AROUND THE FUR days. The album finally ends with WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, which is a very different sounding song for Deftones, with a very positive pop sound.<br /><br />I held very high expectations for this record before going in to it. I can honestly say that every single expectation I held in anticipation of it is completely obliterated. This is hands down the Best Album of 2012, the best of their discography, and even a contender for Best Album of All Time. There is not one song on here that I would consider to be \\"bad\\" or \\"just decent\\". There is not a point in picking a least favorite song or even a favorite on here without feeling guilty of the other songs, even though I stated I liked ROSEMARY the best. Every song on KOI NO YOKAN is a highlight. I am so ecstatic upon how much the Deftones have evolved. It seems very impossible to follow this album up with one that's even better. Let's see if they can top this instant classic in a few years. Until that day, if you're someone who only buys two or three albums each year, it would be miserable for you not to have this record be one of them.<br /><br />TRACKS:<br />Swerve City (5/5)<br />Romantic Dreams (5/5)<br />Leathers (5/5)<br />Poltergeist (5/5)<br />Entombed (5/5)<br />Graphic Nature (5/5)<br />Tempest (5/5)<br />Gauze (5/5)<br />Rosemary (5/5)<br />Goon Squad (5/5)<br />What Happened To You?

3037783133|5.0|Though this amazing book is titled Encyclopaedia I think it's worth pointing out that this is not one of those books with hundreds of tightly cropped floral images and precise technical details of each species.  It is though a stunning visual record of flowers and I think more directed at those who appreciate floral art than a dry reference work.<br /><br />Florist Makoto Azuma and photographer Shunsuke Shinoki have created something unique here: a book of the breath-taking sumptuous flower arrangements.  All the photos were taken in a studio (between 2009 and 2012 in Tokyo) which allowed for greater control of lighting and composition.  A nice touch was photographing the group and some single flowers against a black background which throws up the extraordinary richness of their colors and you really have to see some of these unbelievable colors.<br /><br />The pages are divided into five sections: Whole (with thirty photos); Flock (forty-nine); Coexistence (sixteen); Hybrid (sixty-one); Appearance (forty-seven).  Hybrid is the only section to have close-ups of flowers against a light background.  The 203 photos reveal just over two thousand species and easily identified with the sixty-nine page index where the group shots have a large thumbnails and white numbers on the relevant flowers.<br /><br />The quality of the photographs is captured by quality printing using a very impressive screen (300 I think).  The only fault I have with the book is that it is a thick paperback which prevents it being opened flat, had it been a hardback.<br /><br />This is one of those visual books that can be opened at any page and the amazing photos will just grab you.
B000002L68|1.0|Before I write this, let me just say that I expect either harsh criticism or even abuse because I really don't like this album. I bought it because it is so highly regarded, and after repeated listening, I still dislike it - a lot. This is Jimi Hendrix meets Michael Jackson, interspersed with new wave, schmoozey jazz, pop... and it is a marriage made in hell as far as I am concerned. Sure, Prince can play a guitar. But that doesn't make it art. The missing ingredient is soul. This album is devoid of it. It is cold, clinical, unmoving,  empty. I have not seen the movie and so am not biased by having visuals to add any value that might be lacking in the music. I gave it one star because one can't give less. And now I'm going to try to sell it for $1. I don't even want this soul-less cacophony occupying space that could be filled by a genuine masterpiece.
B000XPU5NY|4.0|It's just like old time Genesis fans who think Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett made the band to criticize this live album's key transpositions. Never mind the fact that the band got back together to do a tour nobody thought was ever going to happen again with Phil Collins. I saw them on the tour when they played my local area and it sounded fantastic. I didn't even notice the key changes at the time because frankly I was too wrapped up in the music and marveling at seeing this band perform live again in front of me. You might think Phil was singing an octave lower by some of this ridiculous harping. On \\"In The Cage,\\" it's one and a half tones lower. If you think this album is somehow going to rival the likes of Seconds Out or Three Sides Live, I'll grant you that you'll be disappointed. But going into it with a slightly more open mind than that, it sounds fine. It's Tony, Mike, and Phil with Chester and Darryl, and a much better set list than the last time that live configuration toured. You really couldn't ask much more of them by 2007.

Not the best but certainly nowhere near the worst of the Star Trek movies.  We both thought this was a great addition to our Star Trek movie collection, we'll be watching it again one day.  -kd5-
1451638450|3.0|On the bright side, this book was miles better than Cryoburn (and, cross my heart, I had formed that sentence before it dawned on me that I was making a pun of sorts).  However, since I really didn't like Cryoburn at all, that's not exactly high praise.<br /><br />There were some parts that I really enjoyed, generally references back to things from other books.  When Ivan shudders at the thought of Cetagandans meddling with animal and plant genomes at the same time, of course we remember what I call the pussy willow episode from his trip to Cetaganda, and since I pretty much fell for sweet, kindhearted Ivan right about then, that's a good thing.  Ivan's grin when Tej calls him an idiot.  Seeing old familiar characters through new eyes (though of course we got that when Ekaterin came to town, too).<br /><br />Tej was a disappointment.  Not at first, when she seemed quite intelligent and competent on Komarr (the situation into which she and Rish were sinking wasn't due to idiocy or incompetence, just overwhelming odds against determined adversaries).  No, it was once she got to Barrayar that her IQ seemed to plummet and the impression I got was of a not-too-bright child saying naive things that make the grownups chuckle.  \\"'It's really *hard*,' Tej protested.  'When you don't want to.  Besides, it would hurt my hand.'\\"  I mean, really!  And that was before the - umm, lets call them off-planet visitors, to prevent spoilers - showed up, which made her even worse.  Ivan, too, seemed to get dumber.<br /><br />I'll have to re-read the older books, but Ivan's speech patterns sounded off here, too.<br /><br />And, oh, how very tired I am of the whole skin-crawlingly creepy Betan sex trainers thread.<br /><br />As I look back through the book, it seems to me that the Komarr part is good.  After that - not so much.  Right after Ivan said \\"Unhand Lady Vorpatril!\\" things started going downhill.  Perhaps she should have stopped there.<br /><br />Not the fault of the author so I didn't use this to decide how many stars to give, but good golly that cover art!  I thought the book was about Ivan Vorpatril, not Boris Vorkarloff.  And the bizarre and awkward and unlikely pose in which Tej is portrayed.  And Rish is supposed to be odd-looking but beautiful, not just plain weird.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|This is a great read, however very sad. It kept me hanging on til the biter end. I personally did not like the ending
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a quick and interesting read. The story seemed simple at first, but got much more complex as it went on.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book !Reading it was like running down a hill,you just can't quit reading !I loved the way it is written ,so light and breezy and so complicated at the same time.You really feel as if you know the characters and there are so many twists and turns.Read this book,you will have a blast
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love Pinterest and all the great ideas I find.  Works great on my Kindle Fire.  One of my favorote apps!
B004TN7QPG|3.0|Although this app looks really good and works well, data for Series and Tags has been grouped together. So, if you use tags, don't expect only tags to show up.  Series data and tag data are two different things and should not be grouped together.  I would have reviewed this as a 1 but it does function
0345803485|5.0|I could not put the book down. Yes it was pretty erotic, but it also has a great story to it. Every chapter had me enthralled.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The price is right, and its convenience, great.  Nice for simple calculaions, like balancing your check book on payday, or for grocery shopping.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of Grishams' better writings. I love all his books, but The Racketeer keeps you guessing right up until the end of the book. Loved this book and well worth the read.
0385344333|3.0|I've always been a hugevJack Reacher fan and usually look froward to each new book.  But, it looks like success has mellowed Lee and Jack.  They no longer stand out.<br /><br />I don't think Lee Child has anything to do with the actors the studios pick for certain roles but, I couldn't believe it when Tom Cruise was picked to play 6'4&#34; muscled Jack Reacher.  All I can see is Cruise jumping up and down on a late night TV show couch.  I always pictured in my mind someone like Lee Marvin plaing Jack.<br /><br />Sadly, Jack in the latest books is shrinking into the size of Tom Cruise.  Not enough hard action.<br /><br />Before writing this I read a few pages of Jack's 2nd book, Die Trying, and loved then tension I felt.<br /><br />Has anyone found a character like the early Jack Reacher by another author?  Please let me know since I miss my old friend.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vintage Vince Flynn.  It is heartening to once again read and enjoy Vince Flynn.  The Mitch Rapp character is alive again.  It would appear the next novel will develop some type of relationship between Mitch and the female member of his team (unless she is relegated to a desk at Langley)..  I note we also have an unfinished character in the senator - would he perhaps be a senator from Nevada?  I look forward to the next novel - when in the anticipated date when the novel will be available?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app the only problem is some of the controls I like the way there are 100 games in one.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|Nice long songs. Great guest singers on lots of tracks.  Im beginning to like his stuff more and more despite his personal quirks.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|I got this album after listening some of it on Youtube, and, oh my gosh, is it insane.  It's a little bit more funky than say Fuzz Universe, or Get Out Of My Yard.  Though, keep in mind that this album is not instrumental only.  There are a couple instrumentals, but not all of them are.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|homie this game is really fun and addictive but at times can be very expensive you can play this game for free but to have a fun time you need to spend a little bit of cash once in a while to make this game perfect ,....p
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Again I love this series, can not wait for the movie in 2013.  Easy read and the kids had to start when I finished them
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Good book. Great story teller. Outstanding imagination and sense of humor. I need to read more of his prose including John Corey. Well done.
B0053TMP24|5.0|It was good I love mythology it is a good read for people who like susspence and fantasy I loved it
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton's The Secret Keeper doesn't disappoint.  As usual the ending is a complete surprise and very well thought out.
0399157565|3.0|OK book.  There could be more emphasis on the characters and the plot than on name-dropping the &#34;stuff&#34; of Scarpetta's world.
B009H442DG|2.0|It's hard to make a more disappointing 'follow-up' than Two Of A Kind, but John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John have managed it with This Christmas! This is Olivia's third Christmas album, and the third to include a version of Silent Night! As far as her Christmas albums go, This Christmas isn't as bad as 2001's woeful Christmas Collection, nor is it as good as 2007's Christmas Wish, which at least had a little thought put into it's arrangements and song selections.<br /><br />Yes, I know This Christmas is for charity. That's for all the bores who assume a project like this is beyond criticism. And that includes you, Olivia! But you'll be hard pressed to find as lazy and half-assed Christmas album as this one in 2012. It's not just the songs, though it's not the first time around the mulberry bush for quite a few of these tracks for ONJ, it's the slack production, the phone-it-in 'guest stars' and the whole 'Oh, It'll do' ness of the thing.<br /><br />Take for instance Barbra Streisand popping up on I'll Be Home For Christmas for about 30 seconds. Why? It doesn't need her. It already has ONJ and JT, it's not a choir! Same thing with Tony Bennet slopping his way through Winter Wonderland with our ever-loving Grease chums. 'Oh John, Oh  Tony' coos Olivia at the end. Oh, f*&% off!<br /><br />Another thing is Travolta himself. Hardly a great singer, is he? He barely manages to keep in tune throughout but at least this is the most wholesome thing he's been involved in all year! Olivia, to be fair, does sound really good , a bit too 'bright' here and there... It just makes me long for the days she made proper albums. How many more chances will she get? Half-hearted charity albums like this (of which ONJ has made more than a few) don't sell anyway so what's the point?!<br /><br />Back to the songs, the supposed selling point of this is the duos' reteaming with John Farrar on I Think You Might Like It (don't bet on it...). It's a new recording but is so dated it could have come from the Soul Kiss sessions. It's staggeringly false and cheesy, but at least it's new!<br /><br />After this you get Xmas veteran and ultimate show-off Cliff Richard singing appallingly on Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, James Taylor adds a little class to Deck The Halls and Olivia does Silent Night. Again!<br /><br />I have to mention the cover. I can only assume the money 'raised' from this album will go to the John Travolta Decent Wig Campaign. Can you believe he goes out like that?!come from the Soul Kiss sessions.

B00A24CD40|5.0|This DVD set is a real treat as it includes all 24 episodes to date. There are seven episodes from the first series, eight each from the second and third, plus the 2011 Christmas special which was arguably the best single episode so far; it was certainly one of the most dramatic!<br /><br />The three series so far have taken us from 1912, just after the sinking of the Titanic, up to 1921. The circumstances surrounding each series have been in contrast with each other. The first series ran up to the start of the First World War, and the one of the main thrusts of the story line was the matchmaking within the Crawley family and the various financial and social influences on the choice of a suitable partner.<br /><br />The second series moves on to the war years, when Downton Abbey had been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen. The time setting is from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. This background contributes to some very interesting scripts, and whilst some felt that it did not live up to the first series, personally I thought it was excellent, but different.<br /><br />The Christmas special and the third series take place from late 1919 into 1921. The first features a very dramatic trial, and in the third series the household is far more back to the life of an aristocratic family as it was in the first series although the estate faces major challenges in the post war period and a need to embrace change if Downton is to survive. A major feature of the show is the interaction between the family and those who serve them `below stairs' and there are many strong performances amongst both groups. However, a review of Downton would not be complete without mention of Maggie Smith who, as Violet has some very funny lines and dominates every scene she is in. Shirley Maclaine was introduced in the third series, presumably as a foil to Violet and presumably to please American viewers, and the rather frosty relationship between the two worked very well.<br /><br />I am sure that there will be few viewers who have not seen Downton, which is the most successful costume drama since Brideshead Revisited some thirty years ago. However if there are any out there this will be an excellent introduction to the show for them. Even if, like me, you have seen every episode to date you will enjoy revisiting them. Although this is the definitive box set to date, purchasers should be aware that there will be another 2 hour Christmas Special in 2012. I imagine that this set was rushed out to take advantage of the Christmas trade, but it is a shame it was not delayed for a couple of months so that it could include the 2012 Christmas Special. It has now been announced that there will be a fourth series followed by a 2013 Christmas Special.<br /><br />For those of you interested in extra features, this set includes what was included in the individual DVDs for Series 1,2 and 3. This amounts to over three hours of additional material!ked very well.<br /><br />I am sure that there will be few viewers who have not seen Downton, which is the most successful costume drama since Brideshead Revisited some thirty years ago.

B00A77II0U|5.0|No issues downloading or playing on my kf. Another great game from alawar. Awesome graphics and good storyline. Very detailed.
0345803485|1.0|Best Romance Novel? Really? This book is proof that money will get you anything. The only reason Hollywood bought the book rights is because it is popular with the people. People will generate money.<br /><br />I actually bought this book because I did think it was going to be a \\"How To\\" manual for me. I mean, I personally am NOT into BDSM but I thought I would get ideas and \\"make my own rules\\". But really the book is trash. I got the entire story by just reading the first few pages, the few last pages and some pages in the middle. The writing﻿ is awful.<br /><br />For imagination I would give you a B -. It is like you wrote a paper and just filled it with nonesense. The subject matter is unrealistic. Ex. No one would pull a women's Tampn literally out﻿ of her while making love. Is she on her period? Wouldn't you discuss this before the act?<br /><br />For writing, I would give you an absolute F. The book repeats itself over and over. I got the entire story line by reading the first few beginning pages and﻿ the last few ending pages and a few pages inbetween. The rest is just repetitive. Much like this paragraph. LOL<br /><br /> I should think that your boys would be embarressed﻿ not because of the subject matter, we are all adults here, but if they followed your lead, they would definitely get an C- to D in their Creative Writing class. Overall grade of this book D. Don't buy it. My advice, if you must, and we all have needs, get what you need off the internet for all of you who have not bought it yet.<br /><br />As for me, I am not going to finish it. I am searching the internet about this book. Lots﻿ of hilarious paradies that make for a more \\"pleasurable\\" experience. I thought I would put it on audio for my boyfriend but pppfffttt, I want to orgasm not laugh. LOL There is a time and a place for everything under heaven. (Ecclesiastes 3 KJV) Yes, I went there. ;0)
B009SJ46EA|5.0|The second Season will not be as good as the first to alot of people and it is different in every way, however I still love the show and love the twists and turns. Also I would not be such a hard core fan if the actors were changed. I love each and every one and think they do a fabulous job. There might not be a show without Jessica Lange, she is the Holy Grail of this show. Zachary Quinto is like, \\"WOW\\" He is so sexy fun. He is a wonderful actor along with the rest of the crew. I really like how they are giving information in the series about things in History that most people are not fully aware of or ever even heard of before, for instance, \\"Operation Paperclip\\" Why are young people these days not learning history? Its scary these things and details are being forgot. Whoever is writing this script is genius. I hope and prey there will be many more seasons and never take Jessica away!!!!!! Jessica is the top actress ever, I could watch her all day long. Keep up the good work
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Once I started, I couldn't put the book down. It's easy to get wrapped up in it, and King does an excellent job in telling this story. Parts made me laugh, and some parts made me tear up. Its definitely a story that will stay with me for a long time.
