B000MR9D5E|5.0|Narration by the great Sir David Attenborough puts the finishing touches on the awesome video work in this series. We had stopped watching the US television version because Sigourney Weaver's zombie-like narration ruined it. This DVD set is perfectly wonderful - a true masterpiece. Each segment leaves us breathless.
0307237702|5.0|My interest in reading \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" was sparked by Mr.Obama's appearance on the Jay Leno show. What makes him interesting to me more than anything else is the image of someone in politics that appears honest.An example is his admission of past drug use as a teen. How many politicians try to pass off past mistakes with memory loss or \\"I didn't inhale\\" justifications? This guy is different!<br />While I don't agree with a lot of his views or solutions,I was impressed with how well he articulates his ideas. He has a surprisingly firm grasp on foreign policy for someone with little experience. He explains his opposition to the Iraq War.<br />I enjoy studying U.S. political history so I appreciate his critiques on past Presidents and their policies.<br />Barack Obama is one of the better orators in my opinion,and he is equally effective as a writer.<br />This book supplies the reader with a lot of biographical information on Barack Obama as well as his political solutions to our country's problems.<br />I can't say that I will vote for him,but I can recommend this book to anyone that wants to read about a man that is seen by many as a \\"uniter\\" on the national political scene.
B00007G1ZC|2.0|Good as far creative film, but hard to watch if you are looking for a plot.   I have had a few friends think I am crazy for buying these movies off amazon, but you don't know if they will make some sort of impact in you life until you watch them.  Buy them all because the more you see the better perspective you have on the film industry and on life...
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I've watched the film several times (I can watch it over and over again) and was so drawn to the music that I decided I had to have the cd.  This then lead me to purchasing a Dido , The Calling and Maroon 5 cd...all of whom I was not that familiar with.  I think this is a fun collection of music.....and I now have other new music that  I actually love....it's actually true.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|These guys show you that they don't just play their music, they can mix it like pros too!  It's almost like a different album.  I've played this probably over a hundred times.  I really like it.  The music combinations are very creative.
B000YCLRBA|2.0|Great, great performance - singing, acting, conducting - marred and denigrated by an absolutely unforgivable production and set design.  Reminds one of a high school low budget production - at the Met!  \\"Minimalist\\" it might be - but since was this something for Pushkin's Russia?  It's painful to watch, and the performance breaks your heart in more ways than one.
0765357151|2.0|Usually the book is so much better than the movie, not in this case.  First of all I Am Legend is a short story.  The only things the movies and the book have in common are:  a dog is briefly in the book and the main character's name is the same.  I was very disappointed.
B000XA5K48|5.0|I can't remember ever \\"rewinding\\" in a movie like I did with \\"Shoot 'em Up\\"  There are so many \\"I didn't really see that, did I?\\" moments in this movie, that demand you rewind (sometimes multiple times) to see that impossible stunt again.  Sure the story is weak, who cares!!!   With incredible action scenes like this movie has, in an embarrasing abundance, this will be the movie you tell EVERYBODY to see!!  What a rush!!  Love the carrots.
B000UR9T7I|4.0|You cannot go wrong with Blu Ray technology.  The picture and sound quality is great.  My son loves SpiderMan and he watches it at least three times a week.  The only thing that I don't like is the overall storyline.  Compared to the other two, this third installment seems to be fast as far as the storyline goes.
0375842209|5.0|I have read a few books about Nazi Germany.  Each time, I approach them cautiously and with great reluctance--as I would a surgical procedure... with the notion firmly planted that 'this is going to hurt a lot.'  But we understand that some things are necessary.  And it is certainly vital that we never, ever, ever forget the impact on humanity Hitler had... and the number of lives shattered... of all nationalities, cultures and religions.  In this novel, Death keeps a running count for us, reminding us that Death is no respecter of wealth, station, power or political view.<br /><br />Knopf does this book (and this author) a great disservice by marketing it as a Young Adult novel.  This would be tantamount to offering To Kill a Mockingbird as a YA because it has a young girl as a protagonist.  Like Mockingbird, this book is one for all audiences across the board, for all lovers of literature, lovers of life.  Since The Kite Runner, I've been waiting for a novel to come along that I could recommend to every single family member and friend who reads.  This one does it for me.
B000UPSKO8|5.0|This concert dvd has it all: wonderful video and audio, topnotch vocal performances as expected from the ladies and the baritone .Evidently Vargas has lost weight and some of the beautiful topend of his voice. However, for the price of the dvd who could complain?  Netrebko continues to amaze and Garanca is a wonderful mezzo.
B000R4SMCW|3.0|*Fracture* is a classic legal cat-and-mouse game.  Hopkins plays Crawford, an engineer who has shot his wife to death after discovering that she was having an affair.  He waited for the police to arrive where he admitted to murdering his wife.<br /><br />It turned out that the wife didn't die.  However, she's left in a vegetative state in a hospital.<br /><br />Gosling plays Beachum, an up-and-coming lawyer with a 97% winning rate, who is soon transferring from the D.A.'s office to a prestigious law firm.  Before transferring, Beachum hears about this case involving Crawford.  He believes that this is a simple open-and-shut case.<br /><br />However, Crawford masterminded all of this from the beginning.  As soon as Beachum takes this case, it goes downhill. The confession is no good as Crawford, representing himself in court, points out that the detective who took his confession is the man whom his wife was having an affair with.<br /><br />From there, you think that the story plot would build up to a bigger climax.  Alas, it doesn't.  So, now, you're left guessing, for the rest of the movie, who will win at the end.  The cat?  Or the mouse?
B000QEIOTO|2.0|The transfer to HD fails to meet my expectations. Sure, the picture is better than DVD but I expect more for a movie with such a huge fan base. I think they will have to re-master this and re-release the trilogy in some kind of box set. Save your money for that.  I strongly disagree that this is a \\"A must buy for HD DVD owners\\" or that it \\"looks 10 times better\\".  The film looks grainy, if this was re-mastered or intentional I find the result to be annoying.  Universal did not bother to include a Dolby TrueHD track or alternative high resolution audio format that takes advantage of the HD format. I would only recommend buying this movie if you can not rend the HD version, don't already own the DVD and can't wait for a better re-mastered version to be released.

6304711905|5.0|This is one of, if not the best western I have ever seen.  It surpasses Wyatt Earp (with Kevin Costner) by far.  Love Val Kilmner the most.
B0006GAO5Y|4.0|Excellent product, very pleased.  Overnight shipping was a bit shakey.  The item was delivered to the wrong house.  It seems that some of the drivers do not pay attention to detail, such as Road and Drive.  If I wasn't watching the online shipping status I would still be waiting for the item to arrive.
B000K15VSA|5.0|It's everything you hoped it is, and more. This set has every version anywhere and tons of bonus items that really close the deal! They took their time with this and it shows, no matter which version of this film you remember. AMAZON also had the best price and cheapest shipping I could find anywhere, IF you can find it! Enjoy, you won't be let down!
B00005JGAF|5.0|Their debut may be more historically significant, but this is still the better album. Rocket To Russia, the Ramones' third record, is one of the greatest punk records ever waxed, and a watershed moment in the tortured history of rock 'n' roll. Here, the group's signature mixture of Chuck Berry, The Beach Boys, Black Sabbath, Iggy Pop, and Phil Spector is at its absolute zenith. These songs are pure gutter angst, burnt-out bursts of emotion that ring with hilarity and hatred, joy and spite, love and confusion, apathy and honesty. And you can dance to it!  The end result is a package of pure, unfiltered goodness, full of meat 'n' cheese masterpieces like \\"Cretin Hop\\" and \\"Locket Love.\\" \\"Rockaway Beach\\" and \\"Sheena Is A Punk Rocker\\" are metallic bubblegum-surf ravers, and \\"Teenage Lobotomy\\" is an irresistible, ferocious anthem. \\"I Don't Care\\" is quintessentially bemused teenage sneer, and the cover of \\"Do You Wanna Dance\\" is just plain fun. And then there's the rollicking cynicism of \\"We're A Happy Family,\\" and the bounce of \\"I Wanna Be Well.\\" So, a punk classic then...
B000YMBBH0|5.0|Have not had a chance to watch them, but can't wait! Love that we received all three together for a great price!
B00065JTBA|3.0|It is a very good collection although most of the more popular songs are not in there.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|its a very hectic and overly fast paced flash card edited action buffet.  epileptics should skip this one.. its just gonna give ya a convulsion or two.  personally i dont care for these movies where the editing runs at such a disjointed and high speed that it makes a person motion sick.. but there are plenty of folks that do like it.. so if your into psychotically fast paced EVERYTHING then this movie is for you.  it certainly lacks the substance of the first movie and even the slwoly dissloveing plot line of the second.. it totally gets dismantled and falls into the inevitable chaos which most action serials are destined.  all that negative mambajamba said, i like the series (especially the 1st one).. and a person could do allot worse in selecting an action flick than this one.  these movies are shining examples of what action movies can be, and to an extent, should be... its not the \\"guns of navarrone\\", but then again what is?
B000059MEK|5.0|I personally love this album. I could listen to it over and over and not get tired of it. Aerodynamic is a definate favorite followed by Harder, better, stronger, faster. Actually...I just love the whole album. And if you get a chance, watch Interstella 5555. Totally worth it, it's a cartoon (animeish) to this whole album.
B00005JPXY|5.0|I've seen some bad reviews on this movie around the web which I don't understand.   I saw it yesterday and it was one of the very few movies that I didn't check my watch to see what time it was and hoping it would end soon.   This movie was very enjoyable from start to finish.   My opinion is that it was one of the best movies ever and will probably open the door for even more handheld camera movies to come out.   This one you do not want to miss at all!
B00003CX9W|5.0|I had the original of this and someone stole it.  I was thrilled  to get another copy of this and it also being the 60th anniversary  edition made it even more special.  I highly reccommend this DVD  if you love classical music and Walt Disney!
B00000I8UF|5.0|This is simply a fantastic CD.  One of the hard bop classics.  Pure soul.  Sound is great too!  All the tracks are just amazing - the playing is simply sublime.  Can't lose with this one!
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|Ordered the dvd and it came as expected from the seller. Great movie and in excellent condition.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|Elizabeth I is by far my favorite historical figure, a powerful and fair woman who defined an entire age, lifting her country out of squalor into greatness.  Although historically inaccurate, Kapur's Elizabeth is a masterpiece of cinematography.  Cate Blanchett, a virtual unknown when she was cast for the role, couldn't have been a better choice for the role of this ageless monarch.<br /><br />The film covers approximately five years of Elizabeth's reign, from her life as a Princess, to her ascendancy to the throne on 17 November 1558 to her maturing as a monarch, taking the reigns of power from advisors.  Again, ignoring the fact that some events in the film are not accurate (Kapur explains this in the bonus features), Elizabeth is a fantastic portrayal of the Tudor dynasty that died with Elizabeth I.  Joseph Fiennes was the perfect choice for the Earl of Leicester (whom Elizabeth called \\"My Eyes\\"), as Fiennes is a well known Shakespearean actor, who portrayed Shakespeare the same year Elizabeth came out in \\"Shakespeare in Love\\".<br /><br />Great cast, including Geoffrey Rush and Sir Richard Attenborough, Elizabeth is a feast of photography, words, history and acting.  I highly recommend this film, and am looking forward to Elizabeth: The Golden Age.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a great show you can watch with the whole family.  It has parts that adults can laugh at and the kids love   the colors of the fish!  I highly recommend this movie, well  worth the money.
B000TEUSJU|4.0|I was impressed with this collection. The narratives about the movie from the different actors really tell what went on behind the scenes to make this movie.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|To bad it took 14 years to do this.Great concert - Eagles at their best. A must buy
B0002XNSY0|5.0|I have recently seen Dr Strangelove for the first time, and know it is one of those rare movies that will compel multiple viewings. Peter Sellers plays a tour de force triumverate: as abashed President Merkin Muffley, stiff upper lip Group Captain Lionel Mandrake and the mad wild Dr Strangelove. He displays the full range of his comic talent. The plot, turns into a slick, Catch 22 style satire on the bad zaniness of war and human motivation and races in increasingly powerful circles towards the conclusion. There are multiple brilliant comic set pieces to be savoured over and over.<br /><br />Highly recommended as satire of the highest order on the paranoid 1960s. And with the declaration a few years ago by a Commander in the Indian Army that they could afford a complete exchange of nuclear weapons with Pakistan at an estimated loss of only 16 million people, the logic of Strangelove may hang over us a while longer.
1595479546|5.0|This book will give you the rare opportunity to read a book of wisdom written by a Roman Emperor.

B00005NB0H|5.0|The second CD version of LAL (the 1995 remaster) was my 21st birthday present to myself, and I loved it instantly.  A year and one week later, I got this expanded deluxe edition as a present, shortly after it had been released, and loved the album even more.  A good thing got even better, in spite of how I'd embarrassingly and uncharacteristically believed the rantings of a certain group of audiomaniacs who are rather high-profile in the fan community.  I had been led to believe the sound on the remaster was garbage and that it was loaded with tinny muted sounds.  It turned out that there was nothing of the sort wrong with it.  If anything, the sound quality is even better, and while the sound is a bit lower on the second disc, that's because they turned their instruments down for the Tommy portion of the show.  The softer sound actually greatly enhances it, since that whole story benefits from a gentle and more acoustic sound.  Really, the only people whining about how this remaster sounds so horrible and is the work of the Devil are audiomaniacs.  What is so much better about their hearing that they can hear problems that no one else can detect, let alone enough to raise a ruckus over?<br /><br />In addition to sounding better than ever and having nearly the complete show, this reissue also has the full-length onstage commentary.  My favorite bit of onstage dialogue is Pete's long introduction to \\"AQO,\\" which is just hilarious.  While some people prefer live albums to focus just on the music, I think having onstage banter adds to one's enjoyment of the show, makes it a more personal listening experience.  There are so many great performances here it's hard to select just a few favorites!  The Who really were better live than in the studio; while their studio albums are great too, the songs just take on a whole new dimension live, are transformed into something even better, totally different entities.  It is unfortunate, though, that the powers that be didn't include \\"Spoonful\\" on this latest incarnation and that a couple of minutes of the final two songs are missing.  I'm also not keen on how Roger stepped back into the studio all those decades later to selectively resing the vocals on some of the later songs.  His voice was just fine on them on the original releases, and after such a long intense set, one expects a singer's voice to be a bit shot.  Additionally, as good as age has been to him, a 57 year old is not going to sound as good as a 25 year old.  I also wish they hadn't broken up the running order by putting the Tommy portion on its own disc.  IOW doesn't suffer from having it broken up during the Tommy section.<br /><br />This is truly one of the greatest live albums of all time, and really changed my mind for the better about live albums.  Prior to hearing LAL, I'd thought that a live album would just be live versions of studio songs, instead of taking those studio songs and making them even better, turning them into entirely new and powerful entities.  It was my own sixth Who album, but I'd unquestioningly recommend it to any new fan as one of his or her first albums.nful\\" on this latest incarnation and that a couple of minutes of the final two songs are missing.

Queen has turned Rock'N' Roll Pop music into the finest art form.<br /><br />Since I recently discovered Queen I Lost interest in other bands. I can listen to Queen forever. When Freddie Mercury starting to sing, all other stars faint away. Freddie is the Sun. He has no equal. There always thousand great singers around but there is  only one Freddie Mercury. Brian's truly a guitar prince. The sexiest hottest the most seductive sounds ever played. Roger Taylor's drum beats all. I love love Queen

1881273156|5.0|I love this book! It is written and articulated very well. Step-by-step Gary Chapman identifies five major ways that we experience love in a relationship. \\"The Five Love Languages\\" helped me discover how I have communicated and how it can be more effective. Now I see that we can keep our love tank full by speaking our partner's primary love language because she or he will find it much easier to understand! The given examples were fun to read and it was easy for me to relate to different scenarios. It is a great book to anyone who wants to understand the dynamics in a relationship with their loved ones!      Also you might want to check out the books by Ariel and Shya Kane; they are brilliant!  The Kanes' book [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] and [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]] surprised me with a whole new perspective on relationships. I used to suppress myself thinking that by \\"sacrificing\\", I would make my partner happy and the relationship would last. Well, they didn't last too long using that approach. From the Kanes' books and the website, I discovered if I am in the moment, I can truly express myself and it actually complements my relationships! Truly magical. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to have a satisfying relationship!
B00005JPXY|4.0|Last year when \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" was released several reviewers commented that the hand-held camera movement made them dizzy. Well, I wasn't even aware of the camera in \\"BU\\" as the story and performances were so solid. But from the minute that \\"Cloverfield\\" began I was more than aware that the character Hud (would parents really name their son after a disrespectful, often vile cad?), who was capturing all the action with a digital camera, was indeed filming. By that I mean the Hud's camera jerks, flips, flops...just as it would when an amateur is filming. So far so good. The camera movements make sense on a real-life level but all the putzing around of the camera made me physically ill...to the point that I had to look away several times as I thought I would barf.<br />On the positive side: the physical production is amazing and the use of pretty much unknowns sets up a situation in which the moviemakers have to do their homework with the script, character-development-wise in order for us to invest our interest and time.<br />There is nothing earth-shaking about the story per se: a monster attacks and goes about demolishing New York City while focusing on a small group of good looking young Lower Manhattan types who take flight as the monster goes about its rampage: everyone is beautiful, everyone is sensitive, emotional and humane which sets this film apart from others of its ilk: these people are young but they are smart, upwardly mobile and more importantly care for each other. It's refreshing, really.<br />\\"Cloverfield\\" is extremely well thought out and plotted. It is also stylistically sophisticated and well written. It's definitely worth the 10 bucks and an hour and a half of your time. Check it out.
0634049011|2.0|This book would be a lot better if it explained things more thoroughly and relied less on the reader drawing scale diagrams.  Doing the work is fine but the book just doesn't explain the topic very well.  Also, I found several errors in the first 30 pages--diagrams wrong, explanations wrong, answers wrong (like, where is E#????), etc.  It does a poor job of explaining the relative relationships between scales.  I gave it  two stars because of the root positions diagrams.  These were very useful.  Could have been a lot better.

0307277887|4.0|In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, we are introduced to Dexter Morgan, a Miami PD blood spatter specialist with a rather horrific hobby: he's a serial killer. As a child, he suffered some sort of unspecified trauma which left him without a conscience, without emotion, without any sort of inner soul. In fact, the only thing inside Dexter is his \\"Dark Passenger,\\" a voice which compels him to kill. At a young age, his foster father realized Dexter's secret, and -- knowing he couldn't stop him from killing -- decided to try to guide him. Dexter, you see, is a serial killer who only kills bad people. He trails his victims, ensures himself of their guilt of their own bloody crimes, and takes a sort of macabre vengeance. But now a new killer is stalking Miami, someone whose methods are disturbingly similar to his own, and Dexter is caught between an admiration for this new fiend's work and a desire to trace him down.<br /><br />Dexter is really a unique protagonist. As a first-person narrator he's somewhat unrelatable, constantly reminding us of his own darkness and inhumanity... yet somehow, he manages to charm us as well as he does the people around him, most of whom are utterly oblivious that there's something different about him. There's absolutely nothing heroic about him, either. Some may be tempted to compare him to other killers-of-killers like Marvel Comics' Punisher, but that isn't an apt comparison. The Punisher is driven by an unquenchable thirst for revenge, a desire to snuff out all evil in a vain attempt to redeem the death of his family. Dexter has no such deep motivation for targeting murderers. He simply needs to kill SOMEONE, and was convinced by his father that it would be wiser to hunt down the people who \\"deserve\\" it than innocent victims.<br /><br />The other characters in the book aren't quite as interesting. There are three main women, all stereotypes: the political-minded, bumbling detective; Dexter's hard-nosed cop sister; and Dexter's traumatized, closeted \\"girlfriend\\" are all somewhat two-dimensional. The other men get even less \\"page time.\\" Besides Dexter, in fact, the most developed character is the other killer, who we don't see until the climax of the book. The climax is a little weak too, a real deus ex machina. The killer hinges on something from the backstory that was never even really hinted at until that point, except for vague rumblings about some childhood trauma Dexter couldn't remember.<br /><br />While there are some weaknesses, the main character is intriguing enough to make me want to read the rest of the series and recommend this volume.

B000TGELLY|5.0|Its a shame that such an epic as troy can get a rating lower then 4 stars. It has all the ingredients of a great movie. I dont care if it is historicaly accurate or not. The movie is based of the illiad and the trojan war which has never been proven to be factual according to history. As far as Im concerned it is Greek mythology and nothing more or nothing less. Enjoy the movie for what it is, a movie based on a poem written by Homer a very long time ago and trust me this movie is way better then the 3 and a half stars it is given. Its right up there with movies like BraveHeart, Gladiator and the likes of 300.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|No matter if you are an FF series player or by the contrary never in your entire life had the chance to introduce yourself to the genere. This movie will simply get you seat down on your sofa from title to credits.
B000UD0ESA|4.0|This edition of the film is arguably the best - I say that because my wife actually preffered on of the many previous versions. I happen to really like this cut. For such an old sci-fi flick, it holds up well. The extras are interesting and the price was right.    If you like sci-fi, you can't really go wrong here.    As always, Amazon delivered the goods in a timely and affordable manner.    I gie this 4 out of five stars.
B000I2MRHE|5.0|Bought it for my niece's baby girl who was less than a month old at the time and it has been a total success. Not only does she do her tummy time on it but it also compliments the baby's room decor that is accented with ladybugs.  Very nice product. I would have loved this Garden Gym when my girls (now 6 and 8 yrs. old) were babies!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|My boyfriend and I caught some of the series on TV.  After we got the PS3, this was our first blu-ray DVD purchase.  The quality is great and definitely adds to the great pictures!!  If you have a blu-ray player, this version is definitely worth it!!!
B000002OZY|5.0|Still a classic after so many years.  I haven't heard it in a long time and I had forgotten how great it is.
B000XUUQQK|4.0|The first Boogeyman movie was a psychological thriller with a bit of blood, this second in the series was a true slasher flick.  They are as different as night and day and to call Boogeyman 2 a sequel to the first is a bit of a misnomer.  Both were very good, but for different reasons.  The first had the ability to terrify you without the overabundance of blood, guts, and gore prevalent in so many horror films via the use of a supernatural killer.  The second is quite the bloodbath with a \\"real\\" sociopathic killer.  In the second movie, the killer understands his victims very well and knows how to get them.  The movie is made even better with the inclusion of the beautiful Renee O'Connor and the indomitable Tobin Bell.
B000I2K758|5.0|This is the best Rocky Horror available.  It is the original soundtrack from the movie and the songs are in the same order as they are in the movie.  It brings back old, pleasant memories every time I listen to it.  Watch out for the various other recordings of the multitude of other productions and spin offs.  This is the TRUE ORIGINAL.
0316067598|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book when it was covering the action, not the authors politically bias view points.  Democrats can be patriotic despite what the author implies.  I am a Democrat and I served in the 82nd airborne as a infantryman/paratrooper, so I know what I am talking about.      My advice is to stick with the action, and by pass the displayed political ignorance.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This was an amazingingly creepy and suspenseful season! I had never heard of this show before until some friends loaned me their season 1 set. Once you start, you can't stop watching! I'm hooked! Can't wait for season 2!!
B000VDDDVO|4.0|movie is wonderful, but when dvd was shipped, discs had unsnapped and were moving around inside the case. no problems detected so far, but i wasn't happy about that.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Very enjoyable installation in the \\"Jesse Stone\\" series.  Tom Selleck is really good in these.  Hope they make many more.
0679882820|5.0|My son cannot hear this book enough (he is 2).  So I would say that this book has passed the standard of the toughest critic (and the only opinion that matters), my son.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD set is simply amazing. I'm glad they decided to release this concert footage because there isn't anything else out there (except The Song Remains The Same). In their day Led Zeppelin shunned commercialism so there is very limited documentation of them in TV interviews or live concert footage. They felt that in order to truly appreciate the band and it's music, you had to go see them live in concert. These concerts were originally filmed for the band's own personal use and enjoyment. I know it all boils down to money, but Jimmy Page was involved in every aspect of this DVD release (the video was restored and looks sharp and crisp, the music was remastered in stereo and sounds supurb). As a result, they released a superior product. I was too young to see Zeppelin live, so this is the next best thing. When you run this through your TV and stereo system at home, you almost feel as if you are there. The band sounds great live. This is what rock 'n' roll, and Led Zeppelin, is all about. A must own for all fans of Zeppelin.    On DVD 1, The Royal Albert Hall concert from 1970 is great. The highlights of the show include John Bonham's 'Moby Dick' and the band's performance of 'What Is And What Should Never Be'. But the real treat on the DVD for me is the Danmarks Radio performance in 1969 that was caught on film. The band cranks out a live, raw, practically spot-on performance. DVD 1- Live at the Royal Albert Hall 1970 (102 min): We're Gonna Grove, I Can't Quit You Baby, Dazed and Confused, White Summer, What Is and What Should Never Be, How Many More Times, Moby Dick, Whole Lotta Love, Communication Breakdown, C'mon Everybody, Something Else, Bring It On Home. DVD 1 Extras - Communication Breakdown video from 1969 (2:24). Danmarks Radio Performance from 1969 (31:24): Communication Breakdown, Dazed And Confused, Babe I'm Gonna Leave You, How Many More Times. Supershow from 1969 (7:31): Dazed And Confused. Tous En Scene from 1969 (9:01): Communication Breakdown, Dazed And Confused.  DVD 2 is really good and features performances throughout the 1970s. The first video on here is just a montage of photos and different concert video clips for the live version of Immigrant Song (I guess they didn't have decent concert footage for it). The DVD also has concert footage from the 1973 Madison Square Garden show that never made it in the movie documentary \\"The Song Remains The Same\\". DVD 2 - Immigrant Song (live) from 1972 (4:03). Madison Square Garden concert from 1973 (23:24): Black Dog, Misty Mountain Hop, Since I've Been Loving You, The Ocean. Earls Court concert 1975 (49:00): Going To California, That's The Way, Bron Yr Aur Stomp, In My Time of Dying, Trampled Under Foot, Stairway To Heaven. Knebworth concert 1979 (50:11): Rock And Roll, Nobody's Fault But Mine, Sick Again, Achilles Last Stand, In The Evening, Kashmir, Whole Lotta Love. DVD 2 Extras - 1970 NYC press conference (3:27). Down Under 1972 (5:17): Rock And Roll, Interviews with the band. The Old Grey Whistle Test 1975 (3:47): Robert Plant interview. Promo 1 video 1990 (4:49): Over The Hills And Far Away. Promo 2 video 1990 (4:12): Travelling Riverside Blues.    If anyone is new to the band and isn't sure where to start song wise, be sure to check out Amazon's MP3 area for $1 Led Zeppelin song downloads. Start with songs from Zeppelin II like Heartbreaker, Whole Lotta Love, Living Loving Maid, Ramble On or Thank You. Or songs from Zeppelin IV like Rock N Roll, Black Dog or Stairway To Heaven. And then build from there. Zep 1: Communication Breakdown. Zep III: Immigrant Song. Etc.  Here is an interesting site that gives detailed descriptions of Zep songs and the musical influences behind each and why Zep was accused of plagarism and taken to court a number of times, especially on Zeppelin I.

B000VSBX34|5.0|In my opinion this is the best Beatle movie that is out there. The music is awesome, the cinematography is fantastic. It is as entertaining now as it was in 1965. You will not be disappointed if you buy this movie.
B000NQPZCY|5.0|This movie has it all. I would say this is one of my top 10 movies of all time and I am a huge movie critic. I don't understand how some who view ths movie being bad because it is anything but bad. It has suspense, romance, violence, drama and action. The story behind the movie is the most important however. I remember the first time I watched this move. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over and not get sick of. This movie did not get the credit it desreved.     Excellent movie!
B0007VCZ50|5.0|This video offers a rare look inside the preparations for Sting's groundbreaking concert tour with several world class jazz musicians. A must see for any songwriter or musician reflecting the processes of arranging and rehearsing songs for a Paris debut. A surprise event at the end of the film is exciting and intimate.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|Bruce Willis continues to give us an awesome performance in this series!!  This movie is OUTSTANDING! The plot and all the actors were terrific....love it and will buy this one!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas. We watched it for one of our movie nights. I loved it (as did he). I'm not a big fan of rats, but fell in love with Remy. The animation is amazing. It made me want to go to Paris! Good storyline too.
B0000025SC|2.0|Review no. 246. Band's 12th proper album, also the Gilmour, Waters, Wright and Mason line-up sawnsong release. Long awaited follow-up for 'The Wall'. Personally, I never cared much for this Floyd effort because I've always felt it was Pink Floyd in name only - certainly not spirit, vibe or musically. Even though the playing on this record is so-so, the only songs I sort of liked were \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" and the radio-friendly (over-played, at the time) \\"Not Now, John\\". Rest assure, the band's two CD reissues several years later 'Momentary Lapse Of Reason' ('87) and especially 'The Division Bell' ('94) are much better.
0375701427|5.0|This book somehow struck me so hard that I started to dream about the characters. There was something about the Swede and the narrator's way of watching and observing him and the relationship that they both had to Merry that really hit home.<br /><br />I have thought about it quite a bit since I finished the book, but I still am not really able to say what troubled me so much.<br /><br />Perhaps something about this notion of the way that we create pictures for ourselves about the way that life should be? And then something else about how we imagine our children will populate these pictures? Memory, images, ideas, reasons, dreams, hopes. Dawn and her cattle farm. Merry and her strange religion. The way that Zuckerman plays out his own nostalgia in these stories?<br /><br />All a very heady mix.<br /><br />Reading across Roth's career, I find that I enjoy his later work the most. There is something in his prose very suited to the voice of an old man. I am particularly fond of the Nathan Zuckerman books in general. This one had some really great Zuckerman moments-- his return to his 45th high school reunion, for instance.<br /><br />Recommended. No need to have read any other Roth to appreciate it. American Pastoral won the Pulitzer prize in 1997.
1591841216|5.0|Fresh!... Logic!... and absolutely magnificent!...<br /><br />It's kind a book that gonna change the way you thinking!<br /><br />a basic psychology knowledge in a good visualization!<br /><br />Applicable to general human live and in any profession!<br /><br />And it's an reader friendly book! Anyone could read it!<br /><br />Two thumbs up!.......<br /><br />Unbelievable book!........
B000JBWWRY|3.0|This is a Disney classic, and I have fond memories of watching it as a little girl.  There is one thing I would have wanted to be aware of, however, before my purchase.  Times have changed a great deal, politically and socially, since this movie was made (1951 I believe).  The depictions of native americans are very stereotypical of the time - they are dumb and ugly, and the pirates are much more accurately depicted than would be true in a movie made today.  These things do not detract from enjoyment of the film, however you might want to think twice before showing it to a younger child, or provide an explanation to an older child who is watching for the first time.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I happened to catch this movie one month on HBO and fell in love with the soundtrack.  I kept finding myself singing the songs all of the time to the point that I went in search of the movie and the soundtrack.  I had my oldest niece over one evening and she asked if she could borrow the movie.  She watched it with several of her girlfriends and they too fell in love with everything about the movie.  Needless to say, my niece recieved her own movie and soundtrack for Christmas this past year from me.  She was absolutely overjoyed!!!!  Hope that everyone else sees the beauty in this movie.
0767020308|4.0|This is an entertaining film with actors well-suited for their parts.  Our whole family enjoyed it.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Amazon was a great site that I was able to find a Christmas Gift for a co-worker-the process was easy and secure.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I found this to be one of those hidden gems of a movie that people don't know about or notice.  Sure, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was great, but this show also stands alone in greatness.  Too many people compare one Jane Ausen movie to another.  This film is excellent.  The acting is very true-to-life and I found it to be a fantastic character study.  Not everyone in the world is strikingly beautiful, and that's why this show is so realistic.  I am reminded when I watch this show how important a true and noble character is - more important than good looks.  Also - there are so many subtleties in the acting that make this film great.  The acting and dialogue are superb.  When I watch it I feel like I'm there in the time period, listening in on conversations, seeing nuances on the faces of the characters that let me know how they feel and what they must be thinking.  This is a great film and it looks like many others who reviewed it agree.
B0000C9V3T|3.0|The soundtracks for Kill Bill I and II are ok.  They have their moments.  But overall Tarantino films aren't about the soundtrack, they're about the story and the people in them.  Tarantino uses his soundtracks as a sort of subliminal plot device.  They're all kind of homages to other moments in other films and shows, just like the visuals in any Tarantino flick.  For example, the ads for Red Apple cigarettes in the airport in Japan, referring back to the Red Apple cigarettes in Pulp Fiction.    His soundtracks are really not so much about the music, as they are about adding into the story.  So apart from the few good musical moments (Bang Bang, Battle Without Honour or Humanity, etc.), there aren't a whole lot of things that are specifically about the films.  Pulp Fiction soundtrack was the same.    It just seems like the marketing machine nattering at Tarantino saying \\"We MUST have a soundtrack to flog!!  And stuffed Uma Thurman and David Carradine toys! And the Kill Bill Speak'n'Spell that only spits out four letter words for the kiddies!\\".  Marketing knows no boundaries or reality.    :-P
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|I must say after watching ALL versions I was happy to see the masterful transfer of video and sound was flawless. I am a fan of Blade Runner and all Sci-fi/horror genres, and to have the studio take the time to render this to HD was nothing  less than great. A great purchase and 1 to own for many years.
B000I0QL82|5.0|My wife religiously watches this each year. She was so excited to get the DVD version. Now she is set until the next tech change.
B000002UB6|5.0|The Beatles last studio album, Let it Be is quite catchy and special even though it's considered their messiest work ever! I didn't know what to expect but I adore this album, just as good as The White Album, Abbey Road, and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. George Harrison's two tracks I Me Mine and For You Blue are my favorite on Let it Be. The best track is Two of Us, with John and Paul sharing vocals, a classic! Some tracks are throwaways like Dig It and Maggie Mae, the songs released on this album are some of their best hits like Get Back and the title track. Nevermind the harsh reviews, I highly recommend this pop/rock masterpiece. Enjoy!
B000009VOL|5.0|this album,,is so beautiful and like others have said great to listen to while day dreaming or riding a bus where you don't really need to pay attention to whats really going on and just drift off with the music.  but Cat Power has seriously changed over the years like most artist do,,but i feel like she is just straying for commercial-sake... her albums since you are free,,started to become more and more polished and more and more produced to where she lost that edge that made her music so lo-fi (almost recorded in a bedroom w/ a fourtrack),,everyone thought they could be cat power by learning a couple cords on the guitar and piano,,and singing their heart out,,well at least that's what i thought.  i just wish she would come back to this sound, or the Covers Record sound and ditch Corporate America.  I knew it was all over when i saw her new album being advertised at Target for 9.99 or something. boo.
0800141660|5.0|I've never read the book but I think the movie is terrific! Such a great story and I love each character.
B00005JPXY|5.0|Wow.  That's what I said the minute it was over.  This was, in my opinion, how a monster movie should be made.  There were stretches of this film that were utterly intense, and I have the fingernail marks in the arm from my girlfriend to prove it.  I will admit I am a big LOST fan so I was excited about Abrams' first mainstream film attempt.  At the end of the day, this was the most fun I had at the movies in QUITE a long time.  I recommend seeing it now for the shock value, before most of the content penetrates the media in trailers and previews as I anticipate this movie will become very successful.  Solid story, and enough mystery surrounding what exactly occurred... in typical Abrams' style... the content is more than enough to leave you willing to forgive what you don't know.
B00000I924|5.0|What can I say?...I really enjoyed this album. Beck is my all time favorite musician, and he rarely disappoints me. I'm sorry I waited this long to purchase it.
0060887966|5.0|Definitely one of the best books I have read in a long while. It is a book which is both captivating as well as thought provoking. This is the first of Coelho's books I have read and will definitely read his \\"The Pilgrimage\\" next.
1577314808|5.0|Wow!  It's difficult to find the words to describe this book.  Let me just say that this is no ordinary book.  Reading it was not like reading at all; rather it is more akin to having an experience (an amazing experience).  Tolle is a master and this experience will change my life forever.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|Stardust is a fabulously funny and devilish film.  I loved all of the characters and the story.  And, if for no other reason, see it for Robert DiNiro's  roll.
B000GYI32M|5.0|I ordered the 3rd season of the OC less than a week before christmas.  I wanted to get it by christmas on the regular delivery, but i really didn't get my hopes too high.  I was so happy when i got it 2 days before christmas!! It was in perfect condition and it was just what i needed.  I was very impressed with the efficiency.  it was nowhere near how it goes when i order from ebay.  that always takes much much longer.
B000002542|5.0|For those of you familiar with the Steve Perry version of Journey only (which means, 90% of you) Journey's first album will come as a complete shock upon first listen, I bet.  This album is mostly centered around extremely heavy guitar soloing, delicate instrumental bits, and heavy guitar riffs and catchy choruses.  Sometimes the guitar riffs can be as heavy as Black Sabbath, and some of the guitar soloing seriously borders on extreme (Mahavishnu Orchestra-like extreme).  \\"Kohoutek\\" and \\"Topaz\\" are must hear songs for anyone who's curious about the early bands sound and style.  MUCH different from the radio hits you've been exposed to.  A really fantastic listen and a must own.
B000002JSJ|5.0|awesome zeppelin !   achille's last stand, nobody's fault, tea for one   all favorites! 'tea for one' is awesome jimmy page! I bought the original album in 1976. when cd's came out, I put the cd on my christmas list for years but no one ever got it for me! It wasn't until 31 years later (I'm 47) that I purchased the Presence cd from you amazon.com, to complete my led zeppelin cd collection. Thank You, It's A Pleasure Doing Business With You! fscurec@hotmail.com
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Very good; traditional Diana Krall with her \\"throaty\\" voice and jazz intrepretation of Christmas Songs.
0143038419|5.0|I love to travel and I'm in the middle of my own little existential crisis while trying to be more intentional about my meditation and yoga practice, so this book was perfect timing. Oh..and there was a brutal breakup.  This book was as much of a travel book as a spiritual guide for me, which I wasn't expecting at all. I read it the first time and couldn't put it down from a travel perspective, but then I had to go back to absorb all the spiritual takeaways, especially Gilbert's closure from her marriage.  I really appreciated how candid Gilbert was...about love, about heartache, about spirituality. I never felt like she glossed over anything, and this book gave me a lot of insight into my own practices and helped me heal from my own heartbreak more than any self help book, as cheesy as that may sound.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|It is immediately evident that there was great care taken in producing the HD version of this film.  From the flaming tower stacks at the beginning to the beautiful lighting that filters through the windows this movie was really loved by some one and it shows.  I haven't watched it in over ten years and watching it again in this medium is fantastic, as though I'm watching it for the first time again.  Since I haven't seen it in so long, I can't really tell which scenes were in the theatrical cut and which ones weren't, so I'm not really able to comment on these but I will say that if any one has an HD player this is definitely a must have.  As for the extras, there are so many it will take me months to get through all of them.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Good for people that like to see movies about relationships, emotions.  Specialy because it ends always well. Is something good to watch when you arrive home back from a bad day at work...  The mother is amazing and makes you think ...
078681859X|5.0|Purchase was shipped in a timely manner. Lower price than if bought in store, even with shipping included. Book in excellent condition, slight damage to bottom of dust cover (most likely due to shipping). Very good purchase, 5 stars.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|It was on time and I was able to give it to my son for Christmas and He has loved it.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|The best album ever, Britney sounds amazing, the best songs: Heaven on Earth, Oh, Oh, Baby and the dubsteps from Toy Soldier!!!
B00005JPXY|5.0|If you'll notice, most of the bad reviews here focus on the shaky camera movement and the unanswered questions as to the origin of the monster.  When I first saw Blair Witch when it came out in theaters, I absolutely loathed it because of the shakiness of the camera.  But upon subsequent viewing, it has since become one of my all time favorite horror movies.    Besides the fact that obviously the camera will be shaky if the person filming is constantly running away in terror, if you stop expecting the movie to be another bland. orchestrated, run-of-the-mill, choreographed Hollywood movie, you'll get past the shakiness.  In fact, the realness of the camera movement makes the movie, in my opinion. It is one intense thrill-ride.  As soon as you think it's gonna let up, BOOM!  Something else sends you reeling back into their nightmarish world. The way that one of the main characters meets their fate, I'll probably never get that image out of my head.  Seeing Manhattan destroyed through the eyes of a home video camera made it look so real, I can't even describe the feeling.       I am an end of the world, apocalyptic movie nut, so I was expecting a lot when I went in to see this movie, and it exceeded my expectations.  Is it just me, or is it true that from the time the attacks started, the camera basically never stopped rolling? That makes it even more amazing.  I loved the realism, felt like I was there.  I loved the surprises, LOVED the monster, and loved the people.  BEST movie I've seen in a while!  Did anyone else laugh at the noises the mini-monsters made when they attacked?  My girlfriend and I laughed hysterically!  We definitely got the humor.      I wish more movies were made in this fashion.  I didn't want it to end.  But the ending, oh!  Heartbreaking!  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Put aside your expectations and you will not regret the experience you'll have watching this movie.  It lingers with you long after you leave the theater.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|This movie gets a rare 5 star rating from me for originality, casting, performances and just great fun.  It is a true sleeper.  Looked great in HD!!!
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Hello,    It was great, quality stuff. It just took a little longer than I thought but its because I am in Puerto Rico....but everything else...GREAT!! Thanks..just what i asked for...
0316067598|5.0|The first half of \\"Lone Survivor\\" by Marcus Luttell describes the physical, mental, and emotional tests that instills toughness, discipline and team-work in becoming a Navy Seal that only a few achieve.  This sets-up the last half of the book that takes one through an adventurous and tragic battle between four Navy Seals and a large Taliban army of terrorists in the mountains of Afghanistan near Pakistan.  What sets this book apart from most are the incredibly informative and emotional stories of the people involved; their cultures (military members, Texans and Pashtuns), friendships, family, and the bond among Warriors.  A poignant part of this story is not only the incredible sacrifice that U.S. military members are willing to make, but also the sacrifice that Pashtun villagers are willing to make just to do the morally right thing for other human beings.  Simply, a great book!!!
B0009QQ6GC|5.0|When this album was recorded, it caused a stir. Is this jazz or is it just a hack who can't play messing around? At first, it might seem like the latter ... but don't be fooled. This album echoes through history to field hollers, and West African traditions, as Ornette bends notes, wails, and captures subtleties of jazz that would influence every great jazz player from then on, Coltrane, Miles, to name but a few. (Sharma's classic book (available on Amazon) The Death of Art mentions the civil right's context in which this music was created) This recorded version doesn't mess with the aesthetic, but simply cleans up the recording.  Enjoy and Marvel
B000F8O4E0|5.0|This was the first Album (in vinyl) that I ever bought.  \\"Fire on High\\" was the song I had to own.  An excellent instrumental that you had to listen to over and over again, until the track was worn out.  I highly recommend this to any one who loves guitar music and classic rock. Though, Bev Bevan really does a great job on the drums. Jeff Lynne was really showing his talent on this album.  The CD now gives me a clean track of \\"Fire on High\\" and all the other tracks like \\"Down Home Town\\" and \\"Evil Women\\".
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Mind you, I'm not a reviewer. Don't have Siskel and Ebert skills and I<br />don't analyze things to death (like they sometimes did).<br /><br />Look around and you won't see me commenting on many things. I mean, I<br />am a devoted (sp?) supporter of Firefly (the series) and Serenity (the<br />movie). Even then, I didn't comment. (well, sales should have said it<br />all...*grin*) So, I was expecting a \\"wanna-be\\" Bruce Willis movie ala<br />\\"Armagedden\\" (again, spelling). But, it was quite the thinking man's<br />(person's) movie. Why, might you ask? OK, I'll explain my theory about<br />heroes.<br /><br />Say you have 100 men in a platoon told to assault a hill. They know<br />it's their duty. So they make the assault (and I'm assuming) and each<br />individual hopes there will not be a bullet with their name on it. (so<br />to speak) But, as war has shown us, people die and they are pronounced<br />heroes. To me, the bigger hero is one who knows he's (she's) going to<br />die and proceeds anyway. That's a hero! This movie shows us what a hero<br />is. What a human being is who isn't \\"hero\\" material. This movie raises<br />questions about what God allows and what (people think) God doesn't<br />allow. This movie successfully raises questions about the difficult<br />decisions humans have to make in a truly difficult situation.<br /><br />While it's SciFi, it's loaded with moral questions. And, if the ending<br />doesn't make you \\"water up\\", then you need to take a fresh look all the<br />people who have died for causes so that others can live in a better<br />life.<br /><br />This move was a pleasing surprise! Enough so to make me spend time<br />making a comment. You should give it a chance.
B00005JPXY|3.0|I really wanted to give this movie 4 stars but there are a lot of questions that are never answered and things normal people would not do in real life if this really happened. I mean the movie is trying to make the audience feel like its a real disaster going on why not give the characters some common sense too.What bothered me the most is what the characters did. I understand everything is happening so fast and everyone is under stress but just some of the things they do in the movie are just so stupid.     I like the blair witch/Godzilla approach to the movie it adds to the suspence and makes you feel like your right there. The only problem is would a person really record all this on a cam corder? Probably not but its a movie so anything goes.      The movie is only 113min. long pretty weak after all the hype. I would have liked it to been at least a couple of hours. It takes to long in the beginning and before you know it right when it gets really good its over.     The creature is awesome looking and very original. It actually looks scary and very intimidating. The sounds in the movie were really cool and added to the intense moments and all the chaos.This movie really had you on the edge of your seat. It's a good movie but the majority of the bad reveiws is that it ended to soon and were all just mad because we wanted more. lol This movie really feels like your on a theme park ride. The ending is the worst part of the movie that leaves you stunned and pissed off. Overall don't listen to any bad reviews go watch it and judge for yourself. Love it or hate it It's one hell of a ride.     Maybe if were all good we can get a sequel. Where all the questions we have are answered. Cross your fingers!

B0000AUHPG|5.0|It is hard to image, but Sergio Leone saw this movie in his mind and played out ever scene to his colleges before any work started. It was storyboarded with no dialog. If you notice, in the very beginning, someone else is credited with writing the dialog, almost as a after thought.    OK, you don't have to like the dialog, or the actors, heck, you don't even have to like me! This movie laid the foundation for a whole new style of communicating with an audience.  It shortens our aesthetic distance, our comfort zone, with the actor. It makes us intensely uncomfortable. This new style had direct influences on directors like Quentin Tarantino. The Kill Bill series displays this style. It is even used in the nightly news and all of the hour long news specials. Want to make someone out as the villain? Make it a tight shot with high contrast lighting. Case in point, O. J. Simpson. Good guys? Flat lit, soft focus and pull back.

B000TGJ80S|3.0|Although it received generally positive reviews and proved a world-wide box office success, public reaction to the 1992 BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA was significantly mixed. To a certain extent, this reaction was based on the film's slightly abstract, extremely operatic visual style--a style which seemed to overpower not only the actors but the actual story itself.<br /><br />DRACULA has a spectacular visual design that mixes ideas about Victorian style with flamboyant color and ornate, border-line baroque detail that seems more suited to an Asian stage play than a film presumably set in 1890s England. The cinematography follows suit, using double and triple exposures, shared screen photography, and intense washes of color. The result is tremendously moody, both beautiful and ominious. It is also extremely distracting, and it tends to bury the actors, script, and story to such an extent that the film becomes less about these elements than about the mood and look inflicted upon them.<br /><br />At the time it was released, DRACULA was touted as the first film version that was faithful to the 1897 novel by Bram Stoker--but this is not true, as any one who has read the novel can attest. The film has been deeply influenced by the Bela Lugosi film, the Boris Karloff THE MUMMY, and the \\"Hammer Horror\\" vampire films of the 1960s; it explains how Dracula became a vampire, incorporates dollops of reincarnation, includes a very romantic subplot, and presents us with an ultimately sexy vampire--none of which exist in Stoker's novel. There is also considerable sex, and while this is a part of the original novel its power there arises from its subtextual nature; here it is rendered explicit and consequently seems less powerful than merely commonplace. Even so, the core story of Dracula's transition from Transylvannia to England, his attacks on Lucy and Mina, and his ultimate destruction remains much the same.<br /><br />The casting of Gary Oldman as Dracula and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was a stroke of genius, but sad to say the production-heavy nature of the film doesn't allow them the necessary wiggle-room necessary to create the memorable performances you would expect. Winona Ryder seems very aptly cast as Mina, as does Sadie Frost as Lucy--but the script undercuts both, leaving Mina slightly chilly and Lucy excessively overheated. As for the eternally Keanu Reeves, he lives up to his reputation as one of the least interesting actors of the era, delivering a memorably wooden performance.<br /><br />When the film delivers, it does so memorably, with the scene in which Lucy is laid to rest for once and all a case in point. But overall, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA is not Bram Stoker, nor is it actually a cohesive variation: it simply a particularly exotic vision forced upon a story that doesn't support it. The result is often darkly beautiful, but it is also somewhat sterile and surprisingly uninvolving. The recent \\"special edition\\" DVD actually undercuts the visual interest of the film; the transfer is dreadful. If you are a fan who wants the bonus material--and there is a goodly amount of it--you would do best to hang onto your original DVD copy as well, for it will be superior to the version offered here.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerf genius, but sad to say the production-heavy nature of the film doesn't allow them the necessary wiggle-room necessary to create the memorable performances you would expect.

0375847227|5.0|I am not a reader of fantasy, but I bought this book after seeing the movie preview (I have not seen the movie).  I was immediately drawn into the story, and that's all it is, a story; a work of FICTION.  It's amazing to me what people read into this book.  I am a \\"Christian\\" and was not offended by any references to God or religion.  I did not get out of it that the children were trying to kill God, and if you did get that impression, then I would truly wonder what kind of mindset you had when you read the book.  It did make me think a lot about things, but again, it was not a book against God or religion.  I would be interested to see how the movie turned out.
0634049011|4.0|VERY informative. Geared towards intermediate level. As a beginner-intermediate musician, I found it easy to follow with lots of exercises to cement the information in your mind.

0679746323|5.0|Absolutely required reading for the history buff or anyone having any need to know the genesis of present day China.  Gives wide comprehensive view of history of Asia throughout the 20th Century.  Very readable and engaging read.  While I always knew Mao was no angel, this book documents his reign as one of the great horrors of all human history. The excesses visited upon so many hundreds of millions of Chinese people leaves one speechless.

B000QUCNOK|4.0|Of all the movies about deranged killers, this is probably the most intriguing one yet produced.  Set in post-Napoleanic France, the story follows the tragic life of a man, Jean, from birth to death, and how his scent of smell leads him to do ghoulish deeds.  You see, Jean has the world's most acute sense of smell, both in terms of sensitiveness, and ability to distinguish two smells that are almost identical.  Growing up in an orphanage, his ability sets him apart from the others.  He finally escapes and discovers the smell of women; specifically attractive virgin women.  This sets him on his goal of creating the perfect perfume, one made out of the scent of virgin women.      How does one classify this movie?  It has scenes of suspense, but these are few and far between.  There is comedy, but it is black comedy that is grim.  There is murder, but no blood or gore of any sort.  And there are numerous scenes of attractive, naked women; but our protagonist only rubs their smells from their bodies without ever taking advantage of them.  It is best classified as a drama; one meant for adults only.  The story is very original, probably the most original story of any film released in 2006, even though it is based on a book.  The two main supporting actors are the only famous names in the cast; Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman.  Everyone else, including the numerous beautiful women are Hollywood unknowns.  All in all, a good movie to watch.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Former secretary of defense Robert Mcnamara provides a very frank and illuminating version of his lessons learnt which are about 11 in total.The whole film is an interview session interpersed with images  of previous incidents of world history which happened during his tenure as Secretary of defense. Each lesson or principle learned is explained by Mcnamara aided by his retrospective insight  and his personal memoirs which run along with the images of news reports, interviews and photographs. The very interesting parts are hearing the real telephone tapes between President Nixon and McNamara / President Johnson and MCnamara.    Some of the things he talks about are    (1) His taking up of the offer from JFK to be secretary of defense thus leaving the presidency of ford motors.    (2) Cuban missile crisis and how close USA and Cuba was to nuclear war. There were 170 nuclear warheads in cuba supplied by Krushchev's Russia. McNamara's taped telephone converstaions with President John F Kennedy was very      interesting.    (3) The bombing of Tokyo and how 100's of cities were already bombed to a large extent before the decision by Johnson was taken to drop the N bombs. Were the N bomb's overkill ?    (4) The continuation of american loss of life in Vietnam and the unpreparedness of the Ameican troops for the unconventional guerilla warfare there. How much of the decision for vietname rests on him and  how much on President Johnson    (5) The supposition that if JFK had lived he might have acted differently as compared to President Johnson with regards to the agressive stance on Vietnam.      (6) The misunderstood torpedo attacks reported by the sonar men which lead to bombing strikes against Vietnam.    (7) The use of agent green in Vietnam which intended as a chemical agent to removed the leaves from trees to removed enemy thicket cover was later found to also be a toxic and poisonous substance which caused loss of civilian life.    (8) His conclusion that if they hadlost the war, could he have been called a war criminal ?    In summary he calls for proportionality in war ,strict nuclear detterance and to understand the enemy from his cultural and historical standpoint to avoid misunderstanding leading to avoidable military escalations.    regards, Vikram

B00007AJF9|5.0|With 435 reviews already posted on the '98 film `Elizabeth' starring the incomparable Cate Blanchett I would venture to guess that just about everything haas been said about this masterpiece. Cinematography, soundtrack, script and cast are second to none. For me what raises its standard of excellence even higher, if that were possible, is the symbolic connection made between Queen Elizabeth and the Virgin Mary, hence the unofficial title \\"the Virgin Queen).<br /><br />Religion and personal convictions always seem to be at odds with politics and personal ambitions particularly in period pieces involving royalty and the belief in the right to rule as though by Divine Decree. This beautiful intermixing of the mundane with sacred is the cord that binds this film together adding depth and dimension to an already stellar production.<br /><br />Definitely a film that belongs in your personal, permanent DVD collection!
B000641Z90|5.0|This dvd is wonderful! high energy and anyone that likes Phill would love this dvd!
0061015725|4.0|A very good technological thriller and cautionary tale by Michael Crichton, dealing with the so called grey goo scenario (though it is never named as such in the book if I remember correctly), the hypothetical situation involving molecular nanoparticles going out of control and self replicating in a way that consumes all living matter on Earth. The novel is set on California during the recent future. When an unemployed software engineer's daughter gets a severe rash, he slowly starts to suspect this has something to do with his wife, who works for a mysterious nanotech company in Nevada. I don't want to add more, lest take some surprise away from the reader. As in some other of his recent best sellers, there are scientific footnotes at the end of the book, where he tries to justify his frightening scenario as realistic.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|This new Collector's Edition has provided so much entertainment value, I can't believe it costs so little.  I would think that an HD DVD with 5 discs would cost around $75, but on Amazon, at less than $30, it's an incredible value.  Buy it now, you won't ever regret it!  It's the ultimate existential sci fi movie for the ages.
B00005JPXY|5.0|When I saw the trailer for this movie several months ago, I couldn't wait to see the film.  As time passed, however, I grew worried that perhaps this film could turn out to be another \\"Snakes on a Plane\\"----all internet hype and buzz with absolutely no payoff.  This time, thankfully, the buzz was correct.<br /><br />  As a kid I grew up enjoying monster movies and its been a long time since we've had a really good film showing a city in danger from a horrifying and mysterious force that can destroy everything in its path.  Recently, Peter Jackson gave us \\"King Kong\\", who is a sympathetic figure taken from his home and placed in an alien environment against his will.  Jackson, an amazing director, made a good film but the first hour of his film was dull, until we finally reached Skull Island and met the giant ape.  1998's \\"Godzilla\\" didn't give us the scare I'd hoped for either.  It showed promise but in the end didn't deliver the thrill that I experienced as a kid with the old monster movies.<br /><br />  \\"Cloverfield\\" changes all that.  Producer JJ Abrams and director Matt Reeves look to enhance the monster genre with a more realistic and updated look and feel.  While I admit, I was anxious the first 20 minutes to get to the action and a bit frustrated with the shaky \\"hand-held\\" camera format, I grew accustomed to the filming and was lost to the suspense once the creature and its path of destruction was revealed.  Also, I like the fact that the cast is pretty much unknown, thus providing no distraction from the true star of the film, the monster and the carnage of New York City.  Reeves gives us just enough glimpses of the monster to pique our interest but not overwhelming us with a CGI monster that might come off too unrealistic.<br /><br />  Some people are obviously aggravated with the lack of facts and answers about the monster, its origins, its survival or destruction and other questions that the film didn't answer.  For me, I enjoyed the fact that we didn't know everything and this aspect of the movie only added to the mystery and suspense of the film.  I don't think we need answers to everything to truly enjoy a storyline in a movie or television show.  Sometimes, our imagination can fill in the blanks better than most directors can and the unknown can really be more frightening than the truth.<br /><br />  To sum up, this time, a movie lived up to its much-hyped trailer.  Congratulations to Reeves and Abrams on an interesting and thrilling movie that does justice to all celluloid monsters in the history of Hollywood.  I'll be interested to see what extras are included on the dvd, which I will be buying.  Highly recommended!ything and this aspect of the movie only added to the mystery and suspense of the film.

B0007PAMR4|3.0|Fortunately, this DVD has both versions, because the EXTENDED version is LAME LAME LAME. I watched the first 10 minutes of the extended version before flipping it back over to the original theatrical version. No wonder Lynch didn't want his name on it. For an example - the Guild creature's voice-over isn't original, and when he's talking, there's a point where he's trying to fit a paragraph in where there was originally a sentence. It was so bad it was almost funny - alas, it wasn't even funny. That's when I stopped the movie. Oh, and the use of the same flying spaceship twice in the same 5 minutes - real B-movie effects there guys.    I did enjoy watching the \\"deleted scenes\\" feature after watching the original movie, which is a better way to see them, rather than hacked in.

0525950079|3.0|I give this book three stars because Follett is a pretty good story teller.  However, his knowledge of the 14th century leaves much to be desired.  This story could have been told in any century.  His characters are all having modern conversations, and most of the women are espousing feminist views -- IN THE 14TH CENTURY!  Give me a break!    If you're a Follett fan, you'll like this book.  If you're a medievalist, stay away.

B000TGJ8IU|5.0|A lot of well thought out and written reviews here, going into specifics on the deviations between the \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Troy\\", and if one is at all familiar with Homer, one does have to take this \\"sans-gods\\" version very much with a grain of salt.  When I watched it the first time, as Menelaus bites it fairly early on, I could only wonder what the heck was going on.  I just watched the extended version, my fourth viewing overall, and despite the major changes, this is a huge larger than life epic, and I still very much recommend it.  The additional footage was wonderful, especially the anticipation sequence as the Trojans, knowing the Greeks were coming, getting ready for siege.  Excellent.  And heck, we get to see Odysseus' dog, the most famous canine in human literature.    Others also speak of the acting, and here I must disagree with most, I thought Brad Pitt pulled off Achilles very well.  Both in the physical sense and in the actual performance.  I have never seen the character as a bulked out brute.  Good call I thought.    Peter O'Toole does steal the show as Priam and his scene seeking his son's body is as expected, the most powerful one in the film.    Action too is a sight to behold.  The great fight between Achilles and Hector really stands out.  It is the close up work here that is so outstanding.  Yes, some of the AI crowd scenes are over done, but that is the epic aspect, and even those were pretty seamless, we have come a long way with computer crowds.  As long as they don't distract from the more personal interactions, and in this movie, they don't; I had no problem maintaining my suspension of disbelief.      Sean Bean was a great Odysseus and I was grateful for his additional scenes.  One really does want to see the sequel, to follow up on The Odyssey, but I am not sure that could be pulled off in a no-gods scenario, you would have to have the mythological monsters at least, or why bother?  Still, it does make one wish for the other half of the bookends, for Odysseus' journey home is equally a timeless classic.    And a note to other more professional reviewers, especially those it seems, that work for Entertainment Weekly.  This movie was it hit.  It made a half million dollars world wide, and I am tired of seeing it linked more to \\"Alexander\\" than its proper historical and economically successful kin \\"Gladiator\\".   Come on, give it a break.  This is an excellent film and I hope more historical epics like this find the green light in the future.

0525950079|5.0|So many reviews have discussed the plot etc. in detail, so here is a simple recommendation.   World Without End is a treat for lovers of historical fiction, and despite its length, I didn't want it to end. The roller coaster of complications kept my attention and the themes were thought provoking. I felt for the characters and often found my heart pounding as they encountered new predicaments (which are tied up neatly by the end). The size and Follett's rich imagination prevented the story from becoming predictable, and made me greedy to keep reading. Compelling, interesting, at times sexy and scandalous, but overall, thoroughly enjoyable and worth the investment. I hope there is a sequel based on Merthin's children.

This was a wonderfully acted picture with David Niven as the busy, worried Bishop and Loretta Young as his lovely but ignored wife.  Enter Cary Grant and wonderful things began to happen.  I didn't realize the picture was set around Christmas time, and that added to the significance of the events.      All and all, a keeper!
B000G759LW|5.0|BTW, the Christina Aguilera 2 CD collection, Back to Basics, is highly enjoyable. I've been listening to it at work this past week, and it's certainly my popular music highlight of this year, so far. (Yes, I know, the year is young, but last year felt a little weak in this regard.) The music has a bit of a jazz feel to it, and this feels natural...unforced...one gets a sense of evolution in Aguilera's musical style as a result.
1594481717|5.0|This book is very insightful and interesting to examine where and to what industry and international thinking is going towards.  This book encourages everyone to look beyond just the numbers.  It is also a great book for justifying the work of artists and designers.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Looking back at the 1970s, sometimes many forget how big the band Queen was. Even as Queen moved into the 1980s, while their popularity did slightly decline in the United States, it continued to be very high in Europe. Their performance at Live Aid is widely considered one of the greatest of all-time and their subsequent \\"Magic\\" tour is considered one of the all-time greatest concert tours. If it weren't for Freddie Mercury's death in 1991, we might still be talking about Queen being as big a band as the Beatles. Numerous compilation albums are available containing much of Queen's music. The period from 1974-1980 is considered the period where Queen achieved its most popularity - especially in the United States. Following 1980, Queen's popularity continued, but this was mostly in Europe. However, there was a lot of good music still done by Queen, thus continuing their legacy. In 1981, Queen released an album \\"Greatest Hits\\" covering that 1974-1980 period. Ten years later, Queen would release a second greatest hits collection - \\"Greatest Hits Volume II\\", that would cover the post 1980 period until Mercury's death in 1991.   After Mercury's death, Queen would not officially disband.   However the majority of the work in the 1990s would consist of \\"projects\\" or live performances.  In 1999, a compilation of this project work, live performances, and solo work would be released under the title of \\"Greatest Hits III\\".  In 2000,  These three collections would be packaged into a single boxed set entitled \\"Queen - The Platinum Collection: Greatest Hits I II & III\\".    Queen is an example of the sum of the parts actually being greater than the whole. However, if you take each of the four members of Queen, they easily stand on their own as a top musician in their profession. Freddie Mercury is easily known to be the emotional and flamboyant lead vocalist of Queen who indeed has a legendary voice. Brian May is the legendary lead guitarist and probably the second most popular member of the band. Roger Taylor and John Deacon go extremely underrated. Listen to Taylor's thundering drumming in the studio or live and one can easily understand why he was asked to participate in an All Star Drum Jam (The S.O.S. All-Stars) at the Live Earth concert. As for John Deacon, he might be one of music's all-time underrated bass players. Many of his bass lines have proven to be the foundation for Queen's musical sound. In addition to being top musicians, all four members play integral roles in the songwriting.     The first CD represents \\"Greatest Hits I\\" and covers eight of the nine albums from 1973 through 1980. The albums represented on the 1981 UK Version are \\"Queen II\\" (\\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\"); \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" (\\"Killer Queen\\", \\"Now I'm Here\\"); \\"A Night at the Opera\\" (\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"You're My Best Friend\\"); \\"A Day at the Races\\" (\\"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\\", \\"Somebody to Love\\"); \\"News of the World\\" (\\"We Will Rock You\\", \\"We are the Champions\\"); \\"Jazz\\" (\\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", \\"Bicycle Race\\", \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\"); \\"The Game\\" (\\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", \\"Save Me\\", \\"Play the Game\\"); \\"Flash Gordon\\" (\\"Flash\\"). The only album not represented is \\"Queen\\", however it is important to know that technically \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" appeared in an \\"unfinished\\" version on the \\"Queen\\" album. On \\"Queen II\\" the full version of \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" appears on that collection and that is the version that is included on this version of \\"Greatest Hits\\".      The second CD is \\"Greatest Hits II\\" and covers the five albums from 1981 to 1991. These albums include: \\"Hot Space\\" (\\"Under Pressure); \\"The Works\\" (\\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"I Want to Break Free\\", \\"It's a Hard Life\\", \\"Hammer to Fall\\"); \\"A Kind of Magic\\" (\\"A Kind of Magic\\", \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\", \\"Friends Will be Friends\\", \\"One Vision\\"); \\"The Miracle\\" (\\"I Want it All\\", \\"Breakthru\\", \\"The Miracle\\", \\"The Invisible Man\\"); \\"Innuendo\\" (\\"Innuendo\\", \\"Headlong\\", \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\", \\"TheShow Must Go On\\").     From \\"Greatest Hits III, there is a nice mix of Queen remixes, solo material from both Freddie Mercury and Brian May, material from \\"Made in Heaven\\" (the album released posthumously after Mercury's death), Queen's Christmas song - \\"Thank God It's Christmas\\", and two collaborations (also posthumous to Mercury's death) with both Elton John (\\"The Show Must Go On\\") and George Michael (\\"Somebody to Love\\").    One thing that disappoints me about this collection is that despite the fact the two volumes are divided by time, the songs are not ordered in chronological order on each disco. One reason why I like greatest hits collections to be chronologically ordered is because it often shows how a band has progressed over time. Queen originally started as a good mix of progressive rock and early heavy metal. Queen would eventually move away from their progressive roots and incorporate a variety of other types of musical genres including a more theatrical type of element, a pop element, rockabilly, and even Dance/Disco (as demonstrated on the \\"Hot Space\\" album) The shuffling of the order of these sounds really takes away from seeing how Queen evolved their sound.    As mentioned above each of the volumes are available as single volume releases.   There also is a compilation that just includes \\"Greatest Hits I & II\\".   One other boxed set worth mentioning is \\"The Crown Jewels\\".  This is a boxed set that includes all Queen's first eight albums in their entirety (but doesn't include anything from \\"Volume II or III\\").    The liner notes include a nice booklet that has a detailed discography with background on each of the songs packaged in this collection.  With the exception of \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" not being included, Queen does a good job at providing a good snapshot of their musical portfolio.  Overall, I'd recommend this greatest hits collection from Queen because it provides the most completeness and most value for your money.
0765318741|5.0|This is a great book, and I cannot stress this enough, NOTHING LIKE THE MOVIE!  You can read/see one without the other and not have anything ruined for you.  I really liked this novel, the spin on vampires.  Its reminiscent of a post-apoctalyptic zombie novel (one of my fav genres) and overall a great story.  4 1/2 stars.

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|By February, NOBODY is wishing for a white anything, but our holiday decorations have been put up for weeks.  Wouldn't it be nice to have a midwinter feast that actually came in the middle of winter?  Try Groundhog Day.<br /><br />Groundhog Day is really an outgrowth of a medieval midwinter feast called Candlemas (as well as a host of pre-Christian traditions from Ireland and other European regions).  So if you feel like you need one more holiday to get you through until spring, consider celebrating Groundhog Day.  If you don't know about Groundhog Day, this movie is a good primer on how it is celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania every year.  And, yes it has a sort of moral lesson, which is embedded with enough humor and charm to go down sweetly.<br /><br />Bill Murray plays \\"Phil,\\" an obnoxious big-city weatherman sent with his attractive, but distant producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for Groundhog's Day.<br /><br />The plot really starts when Phil wakes up the next day to discover that it is Groundhog Day all over again.  Incredulously, he relives the same events he went through the day before, then falls into bed exhausted and confused.<br /><br />The next day is Groundhog Day again - the same day Phil just lived through.  And so is the next day. Phil catches on and begins acting out his frustrations and using people, knowing he'll have no consequences. But, eventually, boredom and Phil's failure to make any headway with Rita convince him that \\"all is vanity.\\"<br /><br />Finally, two factors change Phil's attitudes toward life, toward other people, and even toward his strange situation.<br /><br />First, Phil learns compassion through an old vagrant who dies in the street late at night, moving Phil to try to save him the next day and the next.<br /><br />But the deepest change comes as Phil falls into real love for Rita.  Though Rita awakes every day disliking the Phil she knew yesterday, Phil realizes a little more every day just what Rita could mean to him. If only he deserved her, that is.<br /><br />Phil has already pretended to change.  But when Phil realizes he really needs to change, he does.  He learns to play piano. He reads good books.  He even starts becoming kind to other people.  By the movie's end, compassion and love have motivated Phil to become the person that he should have been all along.  Apparently, all he needed was a little encouragement and an apparently infinite number of tries to get it right.<br /><br />Too bad we don't get the same number of \\"redos\\" in life. Or do we?<br /><br />Couldn't every day be a bit of a \\"redo\\" if we wanted it to be?<br /><br />This movie is worth watching once a year.  I HOPE the anniversary version is worth the extra investment, but as it's not out as I type this review, I don't really know. I do know that it's easy to see why the deleted scenes on the \\"Special Edition\\" didn't make it into the movie.<br /><br />Happy Groundhog Day. Or did I just say that?<br /><br />Paul Race, Editor, Family Christmas Online(tm)er, that is.    Phil has already pretended to change.  But when Phil realizes he really needs to change, he does.

0446401307|4.0|I read very little fiction, but when I see a Michael Connelly book (in paperback) one hand goes to the book while the other goes to the wallet.  As one who is jealous of his reading time, my Pavlovian reflex says a lot about this author.  But if you have read Connelly this is no surprise.    Harry Bosch, L. A. super detective, again bucks the FBI, connects again with the lovely agent-in-charge, reminds us of earlier cases and partners but doesn't let this interfere with the enjoyment of the reader who has never before read a Bosch mistery.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|This is probably the best electronica album I have heard to date. I am a huge Tiesto, Thrillseekers, and Benassi fan... I can honestly say that nothing comes close to what was thrown down here. This CD is absolutely ridiculous. Sadly, the only down part about this album is finding music as breath taking after you've heard it. If you even remotely like DP, getting this album should be of no question
0375424474|5.0|Shubin does an excellent job of explaining the link between his two jobs: teaching human anatomy and studying fossil fish. He explains what evolutionary science, i.e. paleontology, comparative anatomy, genetics, embryology and developmental biology have to tell us about the human body, and how it came to be the way it is. Examples include the evolutionary history of limb bones in fossil tetrapods, developmental control genes found in almost all animals today, the evolutionary history of mammalian teeth, the origin of basic \\"body-plans,\\" genetic comparisons of genes important for our senses of smell and vision, and the history of the mammalian inner ear. He presents some of the evidence each field has to contribute, explains how the findings of the various fields support each other, and relates it all to his own personal research experience. Shubin does this in a way that should be accessible and interesting to most readers. The book is very readable, especially the earlier chapters. Shubin's message is positively pro-evolution rather than attacking Creationism in a negative way.
B0000009S3|4.0|The original vinyl mix of \\"Hot Rats\\" is, on a 5-star scale, a 6-star record.  Why mess with a classic?  Messing with this record is like re-editing \\"Innervisions\\" -- no, worse, it's like taking \\"Blue Train\\" and deciding you don't like the solos and the drums, so you record new bits and slip them into the original mix.  What comes out is still a good record, but not what it once was.<br /><br />There are websites documenting exactly what changed, you can do that research for yourself.  For my purposes, I'll note that \\"Little Umbrellas\\" is basically unchanged, \\"Gumbo Variations\\" is arguably improved upon by a little bit, and \\"Son of Mr. Green Genes\\" is nearly ruined by the new mix.  As the latter is my favorite track on the vinyl mix, I was certainly upset to see it butchered on this disc.<br /><br />This is still a good record, and jazz-rock fusion rarely sounds so good as it does here.  If you have no alternative channels whereby you might obtain a copy of the original vinyl mix, then by all means go ahead and try this disc.  The vinyl mix is not available on CD, so I don't know what options you have unless you have connections to hook you up with a copy of the vinyl, or the same transferred to mp3.  One of these days perhaps the Library of Congress will deem the original record historically valuable and backup the record digitally, as they did for \\"We're Only in it for the Money\\", though this one doesn't have the same cultural signifigance so that may be a longshot.  We're hitting the end of the LP record's lifespan in its physical format, and I hate to think that \\"Hot Rats\\" is melting away slowly in our record cabinets and will be unavailable to future generations.<br /><br />This is the record where Zappa first really works his magic on guitar, and the first to feature his trademark jazz fusion arrangements.  It's quite possibly the best of Zappa's albums, and worth the price.  I just wish you could hear it the way it ought to sound, not the way that Frank later decided it should sound.  The artist does have the right to control his works, but Frank made a mistake with this remix and it definitely knocks the album down to 4-stars.The artist does have the right to control his works, but Frank made a mistake with this remix and it definitely knocks the album down to 4-stars.
B000XA5K48|1.0|Shoot 'Em UP was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. The story was so unbelieveable and unrealistic.  The characters were very undeveloped. There was a lot of shooting and violence, pretty much 90% of the movie. Granted I did laugh at a few of Clive Owen's comments, but other than that I wanted to leave the theater at the very beginning, but stayed because of the people with me.

B000YPUFA6|1.0|I own a Sony Bravia KDL-46V2500 (46 inch LCD) which is full HD (1080p) and my Sony VAIO VGN-FZ180E/B 15.4\\" Notebook with a Blu-Ray drive is linked to the LCD via a Sony STR-DA5300ES receiver which has both Dolby TrueHD and dts-HD Master Audio support. I have more than 20 Blu-Ray discs, all of which play perfectly well with this setup. I bought the RE3 Blu-Ray knowing that it was one of Sony's first Profile 1.1 releases because it was promised that you could still play the disc even if you had Profile 1.0 (but you would obviously miss out on some of the special features like PIP and I was okay with that).  My software player is WinDVD BD (the latest version which doesn't support Version 1.1 playback). WinDVD came out with a press release saying that it was certified as 1.1 compliant in end Nov. 2007, but an upgrade or patch to that effect is yet to be released as far as I know. Bottom line, I have a movie I love on my hands, but a disc that doesn't work. I am sure that more Blu-ray laptop/desktop owners are gonna start complaining about this issue en masse soon..  Addendum: I've now downloaded the PowerDVD BD player which handles Profile 1.1 blu-ray discs like Sunshine and RE3: Extinction flawlessly. But, Sony's tech support was completely unhelpful with this problem though many people have complained about the same.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|We purchased this item for our daughter as a holiday gift.  Currently, it is her most listened to CD.  The tunes are ingrained in my own sub concious and I find myslef singing them.  As a purist, I would have liked this CD to have the Beatle's singing their songs, but this IS the soundtrack from the movie, so I Want to Hold Your Hand is the haunting, slow, sensuous rendition heard there.  The CD is an evocative, rich listening experience.  As the tunes are familiar, your will find yourself singing along, even if the song is being sung with an unfamiliar tempo.  This is a CD that can be enjoyed across generations.
B000002B35|4.0|For years, I stood by the assertion that without Roger Waters, it simply wasn't Pink Floyd.  This was during the time of 'A Momentary Lapse of Reason' when it first came out in 1987.  It seemed more a very slick, over-produced David Gilmour album that happened to have Nick Mason and Richard Wright play on it (with a cast of many others as well); even though I did buy it on LP at the time (then the CD later on), much as I enjoyed it, I more or less considered it Gilmour's third solo album, and not the Pink Floyd follow-up to 'The Final Cut' (itself, obstensibly the first Roger Waters solo album).<br /><br />One more 'Rog-free' Floyd album followed, 'The Division Bell' in 1994 (preceeded by a lackluster live album 'The Delicate Sound of Thunder' in 1988) and that was a better album then 'Momentary' ... in part due to more involvement on Wright's behalf (who got to sing lead and co-write a track for the first time in ages, a welcome return).  So the subsequent live album 'Pulse' the year after 'Divison' came and I ignored it until a year ago since I felt it might be no better than the other post Rog live album.<br /><br />That opinon changed when I decided it was time to fill holes in my Pink Floyd collection, so I got the 'Pulse' DVD and was amazed at how good it was, how well the band played and kept the flame going.  OK, for this die-hard Roger Waters fan, it sill felt like it missing something (Rog's acerbic, edgy bent is absent, once David Gilmour took the reins) but it's still worth having in the DVD collection.  So I chanced the live 'Pulse' CD (blinking light and all) and found that they did a very good job with 'Dark Side of the Moon' (that Rog sang lead on only the last two songs 'Brain Damage/Eclipse' means that he's vocally not missed that much) and the newer material shone bright too, as did other Floyd classics \\"Shine on you Crazy Diamond\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and all the rest.<br /><br />Goes to show that even with the most legendary of bands, if they endup where one key member leaves and there's still the remainder of the band around to keep it going, still usually better than none at all.

0805079831|5.0|Shock doctrine compares the early experiments in psycho-therapy at Montreal's McGill University using combinations of electric shocks and sensory deprivation to erase the personalities of the mentally ill; the CIA interest in shock therapy research, which continues to be the basis for the CIA handbook on interrogation (torture, some would say); and the planned demolition of state-control of national economies using warfare or natural disaster as a stimulus for change and state terror as a means of enforcing economic reforms.     Naomi Klein presents an argument that is lucid and compelling. Her research is thorough and well documented in copious notes. Despite the complexity of the subject matter and the scope of the material covered, Shock doctrine is a very readable and darkly entertaining book. It ties together seemingly disparate elements of history in a neat package that does not shave off corners for the sake of narrative expediency. This is a book that engages the reader and presents an image of the world that is profoundly disturbing. It identifies the common thread which runs through the darkest events of our times, from Argentina's \\"Dirty War\\" to the shock treatment of Iraq, and clearly describes a process that was conceived in an American university and implemented by an elite which continues to pursue its own agenda with a  zeal and brutality reminiscent of the Spanish Inquisition.     This is a book that must be read.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|It's easy to talk about the \\"guilt\\" of the man. But remember,he served presidents, not the other way around.  We learn from Morris' film that what once was thought of as McNamara's arrogance, might have actually been a certain shyness with being thrust into the limelight.  McNamara said in the film that he told Kennedy he would take the job of Secretary of Defense if he didn't have to join in \\"that damn Washington social life.\\"  It seems too easy to hate a man simply because he didn't appear as warm and generous as his boss (Kennedy).  Now that we know more about Kennedy - who was the arrogant one?

B0001XAPZ6|3.0|Once again, Studio Ghibli proves that art is often more important than story. The animation and backgrounds of this film were truly impressive, but the convoluted (and frankly nutty) storyline sucked some the life juices out of the visuals. I was left with red eyes of rage after I sat through my first viewing. My family wanted to watch it to see what could have transformed my eyes into red-hot coals of fury, so I prepared them for the eco-blather that they would soon be subjected to and played the tripped out acid lake-laced animovie. Instead of turning a frightening sanguine hue, my familys' eyes took on a glazed, \\"what the ..?\\" muted tone.    The best thing to do to make watching Nausicaa a little less nauseating is to turn off the sound.      Key things to remember when watching a Studio Ghibli film:  - Hand-drawn and painted animation is still superior to the best computer graphics  - Man is always bent on the destruction of the Earth  - Everything organic is good for you  - Technology is bad, unless it flies  - War is never justified, except when action sequences are needed  - Characters can be cloned and used again
B000000OAC|5.0|An album that's almost impossible to subjectively review, based on the first two songs at least (but first impressions count, right?) News of the World is a major change in sound from the previous releases of albums like A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. This still stands as one of my favorites.    A little background -- in 1977, punk was in full force (so was disco, but we'll just forget about that) and the artsy groups like Queen were being much-maligned by the punks (although legend has it that Johnny Rotten was quite eager to meet Freddie Mercury and snuck into the Queen studio to do so) so Queen, always one to stay with the times, decided to forego the rampant vocal harmonies and operatic bits and make this. So the result is quite interesting.    Of course, this is the album with \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions.\\" I can still handle hearing \\"Champions\\" (heck, it's a favorite of mine, maybe cause Detroit sports never win anything of importance) but I'm way over \\"WWRY.\\" It's barely even a song, has anyone ever noticed that? Oh well, they obviously did something right. Those songs are so towering, the rest of the album is generally forgotten, but there's some classic stuff here. Taylor takes a jab at the punks with \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" (\\"I feel so inar-inar-inar-inarticulate!\\") and gets funky on \\"Fight From the Inside.\\" Both are actually pretty good songs (Roger isn't exactly known for his songwriting prowess - sorry Rog!) and fit well on the album. John Deacon contributes \\"Who Needs You\\" which is a breezy Latin pop song (we've come to expect nothing less from Johnny) with a surprisingly negative breakup lyric - John wasn't exactly known for the breakup lost love songs. So much for \\"You're My Best Friend.\\" His other composition is my favorite on the album, \\"Spread Your Wings,\\" the first Queen song to not feature vocal harmonies. Calling the lyric inspirational may be a bit of a stretch, but the song works perfectly. Should have been a biggerhit, it's been one of my favorite songs for a while. Brian May contributes a lovely ballad allegedly about the death of his cat (\\"All Dead, All Dead\\"), a straight-forward blues number (\\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk,\\" which I actually like quite a bit) and an absolutely killer epic song in \\"It's Late,\\" which is the only song here in real Queen bombastic 70s style. It's a welcome reprieve and did you know, it features Brian May employing the tapping technique on guitar a year, at least, before Eddie Van Halen \\"invented\\" it. (Brian wasn't the first to do it either, but I digress.) And Freddie Mercury weirds us all out with what can only be described as a sleazy sex funk ballad with \\"Get Down, Make Love\\" which makes the subject matter quite clear, and a sexual innuendo isn't really masked at all. He also contributes \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" which is generally on the unmemorable side, but it's still a good song. That makes no sense. Oh well.    I really like all these songs. Maybe more than I should. 4.5 stars for a different side of Queen, rounds up to 5. So sue me for liking this.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Fantastic show....laugh a minute with this cast.  They portray a very real life view of how the late 20's and early 30's of one's life really can be.  So many of these skits are very close to home.  Glad CBS kept this show on.  Thank you Amazon fro bringing this hit home!
B000001EGA|5.0|This album is, in my humble opinion, Elton John's finest. Fawn over Goodbye Yellow Brick Road all you want, but unlike that double album extravaganza, there's no silly schlock here to bring the package down. All these songs are very strong, and it's a concept album too! (What can I say, I'm a sucker for concept albums. Maybe that's why I love Quadrophenia so much.)    So this is mainly Bernie Taupin's work (he was the lyricist after all, although I'm sure Elton had some input). The concept is Elton and Bernie's early days trying to make a dent in the music industry, and the album is surprisingly bitter in quite a few songs, but disguised by Elton's brilliant sense of pop melody. The first three songs - the title track, \\"Tower of Babel,\\" and \\"Bitter Fingers\\" - are just absolutely wonderful pop songs, and the lyrics - especially on \\"Babel\\" - are some of the finest Taupin ever came up with. \\"Tell Me When the Whistle Blows\\" and \\"(Gotta Get A) Meal Ticket\\" never quite struck my fancy as much as the other songs - they're not bad, they just seem a bit melodically out of place with the rest of the album, although the melody suits each individual song just fine - if that makes any sense.....and then the rest of side two is wonderful too with the herky jerky drums on \\"Better Off Dead,\\" the absolutely gorgeous chorus of \\"We All Fall in Love Sometimes,\\" and the all-encompassing repeated coda on \\"Curtains.\\" And this album also contains my all-time favorite Elton John tune, \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight.\\" Those piano runs are perfect, and it's heartbreaking lyrically, the music and especially harmonies are beautiful, and Elton's voice is in absolutely prime form - he never sounded better, hitting the falsetto effortlessly.    Certainly an essential Elton album, generally regarded as his last great one before he basically collapsed under the stress of constant touring and recording - Rock of the Westies, released just a few months later, was a huge step down from this one, and hejust never quite came close to this one for many, many years after that. A brilliant pop album. Get it. Oh, and don't forget the bonus tracks, with a couple Lennon covers (including \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" which became a hit for Elton in 1974) and another megahit, \\"Philadelphia Freedom.\\" You can't go wrong here. 4.5 stars rounds up to 5.

B00125JP1C|4.0|What is wrong with you people? This was one of the most  \\"unbelievable\\"  movies I have ever seen.It is pure fantasy,and if any of you thought this was going to be an action movie with a believable plot,you were badly mistaken.At least this movie knows it is silly and far fetched,not like the regular action movies that really insult your intelligence (outrunning explosions etc..)Those are the movies you should be mad at.Unless you actually believe that garbage,but I'm sure you're too clever to be fooled by those.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|While I agree with other reviews which accurately reveal that this adaptation is not 100% true to Miss Austen's cherished novel, it is still my favorite version of this story. Sally Hawkins is magnificent as Anne Elliot. It took me a long while to pin-point what I love about Hawkins portrayal of Anne. She is the 'llama among horses.' Confused by that? Llamas have a very calming effect on wild-spirited horses when kept in the same locale (look it up). Strange analogy it may be, but I find that to be one of the most endearing qualities of Anne Elliot- though not the most desired creature, she brings serenity to the often trivial crises in her life. As to Rupert Penry-Jones portrayal of Frederick Wentworth... it simply does not get any better.  He is the master of unspoken words and pain impossible to hide. This movie captures the morbid tension surrounding disappointed love in a fashion that I have yet to find in another movie. Having read the book, I have found distinct discrepencies. However, that falls to the wayside as the general emotion and feel of the book is perfectly portrayed. The only reason I must give it a 4 star rating is the last street scene. While I absolutely LOVED it, it would have been absolutely unacceptable for the time period. If you love Austen, have been slighted in love, or enjoy superb acting, WATCH THIS MOVIE!

Any citizen who is worried about the state of our nation, and wants to fully comprehend the damage done by the Bushies, needs to not only read (or listen to the CD version of) this book, but like me they should buy more copies and give them to others to read.  If knowledge is power, then this book is pure strength!
0374105235|5.0|This personal memoir tells the story of a war refugee and child soldier making his way out of Sierra Leone. Ishmael was a an African boy living in a small village when rebels attacked, placing him in deadly danger. He was forced to flee with his family, which he tragically lost early in the book, making him a war orphan and refugee.     The first half of the book tells the story of the young man running from a senseless war and living as a refugee. I thought this was clever: the book is actually a two-fold memoir- the one half the story of a refugee, the other the story of a child soldier. In the second half of the book, the reader sees the young man drawn into the war. He manages to escape, largely through the help of the United Nations.    This book is written on a high school level, and I believe would be a wonderful teaching tool for a high school class. The young author displays considerable writing talent, and the story is riveting. I highly recommend this book.
0679720200|4.0|\\"and the stranger - the killing of an arab\\"<br />It was those lyrics in Killing An Arab by The Cure that made me want to read this book. Plus, in high school, I thought I was an existentialist.<br />This story is really interesting and a great book to read if you're at all into the Cure - it's like adding some street cred or something - not really, but I feel somehow more orderly by having read it.<br />It's short, easy to read and gives an interesting view of life - it is written by quite a well known (ie. accessible) philosopher after all. One could call it a nice intro to existentialism or an addition to your goth music research, cuz you know you love to research music.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|What can you say about Beyonce, except she is awesome.  The price was excellent, shipping was free and the Live DVD is off-the-hook.  The live performance was so awesome I also bought one for my mom.  I popped in my DVD and watched it on on my 114\\"x99\\" remote control screen and I felt like I was at the concert.  I wish I could have been there live, because she is an awesome performer.  When I lived in the Bayarea I went to the Lady's First concert (Beyonce, Alicia Keys and Missy Elliot) and I was really blown away by Beyonce and Alicia Keys performance.  If you love the videos then her performances in real life will leave you speechless.    GOD Bless!  Cassandra

0385522401|4.0|Apart from being a literary gem, this novel gives a realistic account of the prevailing moral & sexual  codes that existed (certainly in Britain) in the late fifties and early sixties. World War 2 was over and although there were certain signs of an economic revival which would compensate the obvious shrinking of the British Empire, the country was still in a state of shock and desperately clung to the rigid  principles of the Victorian era. This mood is apparent in the two newly-weds who are vaguely conscious of the changes that are about to take place but are so conformist and  restricted by their puritan views on sex in and outside of marriage, that their feelings of insecurity and shame inevitably lead to a disastrous confrontation. The novel, of course, is more than a period piece as it digs much deeper into the human soul and illustrates how difficult it is to communicate with others let alone understand what really goes in their inner world. Ian McEwan writes in a brilliant poetic style and although at times he seems  a little too concerned with expressing his obvious scholarly attainment, he often succeeds in creating images that linger on in the reader's mind  long after the final page has been turned

B00003JRCQ|4.0|PERSUASION together with NORTHANGER ABBEY were posthumous novels by Jane Austin (published 1817) and reflect the position of a novelist whose thoughts mirror her younger, wonderful bright spirit yet somehow her softer social and feminist darts she so successfully hurled at society in her other famous works.  This particular film adaptation by Nick Dear of PERSUASION respects not only the spirit of the novel but also the station of the author.  Under Roger Mitchell's keen direction this cinematic reenactment of the belated flowering of a Anne Elliot's eight year thwarted longing for the love of naval officer Frederick Wentworth, all due to the 'impropriety' of Wentworth's financial standings of the past, is placed before us as a quietly gentle song, one that still places the scrutinizing Austen microscope on the social mores of the time and the bows to class distinctions that serve as the matrix for Austen's novels.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, with Amanda Root suitably in the background as Anne Elliot and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as the wise and slightly weathered Captain Wentworth.  But their superb performances would not be as credible were it not for the large cast of fine actors playing the superficial silly sisters and cousins and the haughty ladies as well as the warm and worthy ones.  This is first rate ensemble acting, allowing the quiet pulse of Austen's Anne to beat softly behind longing eyes, making her plight and ultimate reward for perseverance step stage front at the end of the film.  The music of Chopin and Bach flavor the score by Jeremy Sams and the presence of Rosa Mannion, soprano, singing arias and songs lends both an aural and visual credibility to the atmosphere so ably captured by cinematographer John Daly.  This is a satisfying Jane Austen adaptation.  Grady Harp, January 08

0679735909|3.0|Re-reading this novel again, I was reminded of every reason why I didn't quite fall head over heels the first time out. And there is a reason for it. I find that \\"Possession\\" really, really stalls when it comes to a repeat reading. My first reading of the book took almost a month - this has got to be one of the toughest books to get through (Ian McEwans' latest \\"Atonement\\" is another of these types of books).<br /><br />Fond as I am of exceeding detail to plot and character development, there is a point at which the writer is too good for the story he is creating. I am not saying this happened here, but Byatt's stunning use of language sometimes undoes the original intent. Readers of straight-forward novels could not possibly find it in them to sustain interest in this.<br /><br />The primary problem is a very incoherent structure. Just when a plot is being developed or a discovery being made, Byatt kills the narrative by injecting ten pages of a poet's long lost work, or the maddeningly boring inclusion of a dead poets' diary. While everything IS pertinent and makes perfect sense considering the entire books' real heroes are the Victorian poets who are under scrutiny, I could not imagine anything possibly revelatory about the characters from these humdrum passages. Seriously, I found them tiresome and extremely non-essential, to say the least.<br /><br />If you've watched the cinematic endeavor that this book spawned, you would well do to remind yourself that this holds more detail than the movie did. In fact, the main character here, who was essayed by Gwyneth Paltrow in the film, seems so unlike Paltrow in every way. Also, the two scholars seemed almost bipolar in their mood-swings, which seemed to affect their decisions and words every thirty pages or so. This was not a concern for me, just an observation.<br /><br />The good part is that the entire novel is gorgeously written, and is a very symbol of the best we come to expect from the English language. Poetry and Prose combine beautifully and its no surprise this has become essential reading in some universities. And though I do love classics, I think I'm going to probably stick to my Whartons and Burneys for now, because either I do not 'get' Byatt, or her writing style is most definitely an acquired taste.<br /><br />I would suggest reading a few more reviews before making an informed decision. Remember though - this is a book to invest yourself in completely, as it is most certainly not a fly-by-night experience.<br /><br />Three Stars.d its no surprise this has become essential reading in some universities.

0192547054|5.0|This edition contains both Northanger Abbey and Persuasion.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is quickly becoming not only my favorite Jane Austen novel but my favorite novel. It is the story of Catherine Morland, who has read perhaps too many novels. She is taken to Bath by her friends, the Allens, and there she meets Mr. Henry Tilney and his sister Miss Tilney. She is very eager when invited to stay with them at their home, Northanger Abbey, and she interprets everything that happens there in light of the many Gothic novels she has read. In Northanger Abbey, I am tickled to death not only by Catherine's naïvet&eacute; but also by Jane Austen herself. The first half of this novel is filled with the most hilarious observations which seem to come directly from Austen, and the second half is filled with the overactive imagination of Catherine Morland. In this parody of Gothic fiction, Austen pokes fun at both herself and her audience. It is truly a delight.<br /><br />Every time I read Jane Austen, a different novel stands out as my favorite, and the first time it was Persuasion. Persuasion is the story of Anne Elliot, who at nineteen is convinced by her family to reject the man she loves because of his lack of rank and fortune. Seven years later, after he has achieved his fortune, she is thrown again into Captain Wentworth's company. She must watch, her feelings unchanged, while he courts two other young ladies. Anne's courage and fortitude in such circumstances are inspiring, and the novel is one of hope for anyone who has ever wished for a second chance at love.<br /><br />The Oxford Illustrated Jane Austen is an excellent edition of Jane Austen's novels. This particular volume (Volume V) contains the original cancelled chapters of Persuasion from Jane Austen's manuscript as well as excerpts from Ann Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho and Romance of the Forest, which are both referred to in Northanger Abbey. These are must reads for any true Jane Austen devotee. I highly recommend this edition to anyone who enjoys or is interested in Jane Austen's novels.ecommend this edition to anyone who enjoys or is interested in Jane Austen's novels.
0446525537|5.0|This is such a good book. I remember seeing the movie,long time ago, and I was not that thrilled with it. When I heard that this was a book, I was a little hesistant to read this. I thought it was going to be really boring. Boy was I wrong.      The book takes place in the last 50's. Landon Carter is the main boy in the book. He is the typical spoiled, popular rich kid in the story. His family had a fewd with the Sullian family from way back.     He had known Jamie Sullivan for all of his life,made fun of her,teased her and her father. She was the religious girl who always had her bible, cared for animlals and people.    He decided to ask her to the dance, then to do the Christmas play, then it all took off from there.      The ending is very sad. I recommend getting klennex when reading this story.

And the comedy runs from the subtle to the slapstick with finesse.<br /><br />I can understand why some people might not like it.

The music alone was worth the price of admission ... all original music by the actor/musicians ... and the entire cast makes the poignant story come alive with such passion and authenticity. The story is very real and does not take the predictable route you'd expect. It is filled with genuine emotion and heart that is extremely rare in movies these days, and the story and the  draws you into the lives of the characters and enables you to like being there. The film is wonderful...not to be missed.

B000VWYJ8Q|4.0|I won't go into the plot summaries which are provided in other reviews other than to say it picks up where Bourne supremacy stops.  It is a bit of a travelogue, covering exotic locations as Jason pursues the answers to his questions and evades assassins. It's clever and well paced. The ending is a bit predictable but works.  The HD-DVD transfer is really good especially considering the high number of fast action sequences.  In a change of pace, we watch the \\"making of\\" documentary first (it's in Hi-Def) and then watched the movie. Fascinating and it does not detract from enjoying the movie. I didn't work with the U-Control feature with the Blackbriar content, but I will do that when I watch the movie again.  I suggest not watching the alternate ending on the Bourne Supremacy special edition if you are going to watch this movie

I consider this sequel a very good zombie movie.  There's action, gore, and some horror.  You just have to get into it, live it and experience the holocaust of the extinction by uncontrolled virus.  The movies make good honor of the game.  Forget the CGI, it was part of the production and it was totally necessary, besides it was good.  There will be a fourth part so you better get used to it, there will be enough RESIDENT EVIL for the next years to come, Resident Evil has proven to be a commercial success.
0743420373|3.0|I found this book to be highly informative, but overall a little redundant. The information was provide in an academic format, and the chapters are set up more like an outline, than a story. Overall, I'd say this is well worth your time to read.
B000002IGV|4.0|Pop-Metal has a deservedly bad reputation amongst serious metalheads, but that doesn't mean that there isn't any good stuff out there, with Twisted Sister's \\"Stay Hungry\\" being some of the best. \\"Stay Hungry\\" is relatively early in the pop-metal cycle, so they haven't taken it too far yet and washed away all the heaviness in a sea of overproduction.  This ain't gonna crush anyone's skull, but it's not Bon Jovi or Poison either, not by a long shot.  In short, it's pop, but it's still metal too, no doubt.<br /><br />At only nine tracks, \\"Stay Hungry\\" is relatively short and sweet, with no obvious filler.  This isn't a terribly complicated album, instead relying on a few catchy riffs and memorable vocal lines.  The band isn't likley to wow anyone with their chops, but they're tight and efficient and play with greater intensity than most of their peers.  Snider, however, is the standout.  He might not have the sorta range and technical ability found with some other metal singers, but he's a perfect fit here, creating an always effective mixture of melody and aggression.  Also, I must admit to being amused by sometimes the good-naturedly juvenile lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Stay Hungry\\" is not exactly overloaded in variety: it has a few particularly poppy, anthemic numbers (We're Not Gonna Take It, I Wanna Rock), some faster, more metallic tracks, (Stay Hungry, SMF, Don't Let Me Down), some brooding, moodier songs (The Beast, Burn in Hell) and the obligatory ballad. (The Price)  Again, everything here is definitely listenable, and there are enough true highlights to maintain interest from beginning to end.  The two most famous tracks, \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\" and perhaps most likely to grate against more hardline metalheads, but I enjoy them both immensely.  They ain't got a lotta sophistication, but they provide the sorta anthemic fun I look for on occasion.  That said, I still tend to prefer the darker, more metallic material which makes \\"The Beast\\" my easy favorite, followed by the similar \\"Burn in Hell\\", both of which are metal classics.  These two have the most powerful, varied vocal performances from Snider, and the instrumentalists kick it up too, with some moodier, more dynamic songwriting.<br /><br />I dunno how much more there is to say about \\"Stay Hungry\\".  It's just a lotta fun.  Some people don't think that metal should be fun, ever, so I guess they should look elsewhere.  But if you can take it a bit less seriously every now and then and want some melody and straight forwardness, you can't go wrong with \\"Stay Hungry\\".llowed by the similar \\"Burn in Hell\\", both of which are metal classics.

B000Z27HLS|4.0|Not a bad production, cast nicely, lovely scenery, costumes and easy to understand story, but not as true to the book as it could be.  A bit too short, for one thing.  The scene about the umbrellas is missing, some parts are condensed, to make room for others not in the book, like Cathy's gothic musings and reading raunchy passages from books, or the bedroom scene between Isabella and the Captain. Lots of cleaveage, too.  And tossing Lord Byron in the mix was so ridiculous.  Not enough time covered in Bath, nor at the Abbey, though this version did add a few quick scenes of other parts added in. The best part...Cathy finding the scrolls of paper in a hidden drawer of a Japaned chest is left out.  Instead she finds large lists in an old chest by the bed. So, if you have read the book, you realize a lot was condensed, changed about and not quite in order. Better than the recent Persuasion production, but not as gothic in feel as the Northanger Abbey of the 1980's.
B000002GAF|5.0|An excellent album.  Every track is worth it's weight in gold, make that platinum.  Gino delivers beautiful ingenious compositions and vocals on EVERY album he releases.  He is truly a gifted music.  I would be blessed to have at least 1/10 of his talent.  I'm a Gino fan forever!
0812932293|5.0|Richard Branson tells his story with an open heart, its an excellent read in which you feel as if he is telling it all, right next to you and all you want is to cheer onwards with excitement and curiosity. He is narrating like watching a movie - yet so real -, with ups and downs, filled with romance, action, passion, family and professional values...all emotions, and hard realities of life. It is a reflection of a true adventure. He proves that life is a journey and makes it fun to read and be exposed to, just like anything else that he creates with the names \\"virgin\\" and \\"Richard Branson\\" on it. Congratulations to him, his family and everyone around him, for all they have achieved with such an uplifting attitude.

He was not the only one that enjoyed the book, I'm waiting for him to finish the 2nd of the series to read it.

She absolutely loves it - she already can sing all of the songs and has probably watched it fifty times since Christmas !  I had a very hard time finding it for sale until I went to Amazon and then I was able to make one very special 13 year old a very happy girl.

B00005JPXY|4.0|This film is a true spectacle. No more. No less.  Boosted by a remarkable marketing campaign (which involved the five-minute snippet involving Lady Liberty's head rolling down a New York street, as well as misleading Japanese ads, and fake international news reports of oil rigs being mysteriously sucked down in the middle of the ocean) the film had fans lined up, eager to finally see the source of all destruction, the infamous Cloverfield monster. Producer J.J. Abrams (of MI:III and Lost fame) and first-time director Matt Reeves had a lot of expectations to live up to. And boy, do they deliver.   \\"Blair Witch\\" meets \\"Godzilla\\"? More or less, but it's more than that. While the makers of \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" understood that what you don't see is a lot more frightening than actually showing something scary, their film was all anticipation, with no resolution, and we as the audience felt cheated at the end.   It's a tricky concept, one that Shyamalan's \\"Signs\\" also tried to sustain, and almost did, but the alien revealed at the end was a lot more plain than the ones our imaginations envisioned. In terms of keeping us on the edge of our seats \\"Cloverfield\\" works perfectly, wisely panning away at the most interesting moments (Holy... did we see it? Was that a...? Argh, we want to see more!) up till the end, when we get a glorious long shot of the thing... and it's damn frightening. It could have been even more frightening, but as the US PG-13 answer to Japan's Godzilla, this will do just fine. More than that, in the midst of all other Hollywood blockbusters, \\"Cloverfield\\" stands out as one of the better ones of the past decade or so.   Like \\"Blair Witch...\\", the whole film is based on 'found footage' in what used to be Central Park, NYC. The first twenty minutes is all build-up, and for those who complained that the characters are shallow and self-absorbed, well tough, welcome to the real world. Have you been to college recently? Plus, this film is all about the ideathat it's found DV footage, and as that it works brilliantly - it puts aside such strained necessities as character development, as well as the origins of the monster (which makes it more enthralling). All the actors (young unknowns, which adds to the effect) are ultra-realistic. I especially liked the inter-cut previously recorded footage of the main character and his girlfriend having a romantic time, which keeps coming in as a shocking contrast to the current horrific events.   So everyone's partying at this dude's good-bye party, and then - boom! - all goes to hell. From then on it's pretty much non-stop action, and from the Brooklyn-Bridge destruction sequence, to the subway-tunnel chase (was there a more effective use of night-vision recently?), director Reeves knows exactly what buttons to push, and when to push them.  Sure the film is not without its flaws. Some dialogue feels forced and scripted (though not much), some events a bit too coincidental, some of the things the characters survive make you scratch your heads in disbelief...  But it's rare nowadays that a Hollywood monster blockbuster even aspires to be artistic (Batman Begins comes to mind). It's especially rare for a Hollywood monster flick to have such immediacy: certain shots from \\"Cloverfield\\" - a lone horse in the midde of Manhattan; a dark skyscraper leaning against another, the city burning in the back - are quietly devastating, alluding to our post-9/11 fears, our worst nightmares of an unknown terror. Oh, and there's that one helicopter-scene... But you have to see it for yourself...  \\"Cloverfield\\" made me smile. Here's a film that took some risks, and is exhilirating based purely on that - the originality is like a breath of fresh air, in an industry chocked up with clone-like mega-budget stinkers (hello, Michael Bay). \\"Cloverfield\\" is a helluva experience, full of sound and fury and a contagious sense of fun its filmmakers must have had coming up with it.   And this comes from a guy who's seen his share of spectacles.

B000P0J024|5.0|Twenty years ago I bought the album \\"The Travelling Wilburys\\" and loved it. It was so much in the spirit of the times. Now twenty years later I watch the DVD and listen to the extended version on the double CDs. Watching these incredible artists do their stuff so effortlessly and with such mutual respect and love for one another; it's spellbinding. Two of these greats have gone, but they certainly live on in their music. This set makes them all come alive again, and lets us revel in that once in a lifetime configuration they created. Thank God they did.   I sent this set to my sister in the States and she absolutely loved it. So you get two reviews in one. This is priceless, especially for the 60's generation.

B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is absolutely one of the best board games I've played! I'm hooked, and so is my 8-year-old son. This is a great strategy game. The rules are easy to learn -there aren't too many, and even kids can learn to play this very quickly, but the game is not too easy for grown-ups to enjoy. The game gets more challenging, as you get better at strategizing.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|**1/2 2007. Directed by Paul Greengrass. If hysterical editing and a tremulous camera are your cup of tea, this movie could please you. No second degree here, no artistic ambition, just popcorn cinema. Already forgotten.
0143038419|4.0|The character was not your usual type, and it was great to read about her thoughts and actions/antics? on her road to maturity, but you knew all along that this would not happen to someone of normal means.

B00005JKED|4.0|If there was a performance that is equal to some of the most ruthless characters in screen history, then Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance as L.A. Detective Alonzo Harris is right up there.  He is evil as he is charming.  Washington is clearly enamored by his character and any resemblance to other \\"goody-two-shoes\\" performances has been destroyed.  Ethan Hawke also give an Oscar nominated performance as the rookie trying to work the fine line of ethical behavior.  The current climate of the LAPD surely isn't going to help with this film as it's another siering indictment against the police establishment.
B000W04S6U|5.0|I've played through Halo 3 all the way up to legendary, and after playing the game that many times, I had to buy the soundtrack. It is absolutely amazing. I'm a big fan of movie scores, but this is my first video game soundtrack. The songs are exactly like they are in the game. This soundtrack makes great driving music. Unlike most of the people who posted reviews about this soundtrack, I did like the bonus song on the second CD. It makes me think Red vs. Blue every time I hear it. Maybe the people who didn't like that song would like it more if they watched RvB. At any rate, O'Donnell and Salvatori created a musical masterpiece with this soundtrack, a must-have for anyone who loves Halo. There is a theme at the beginning of the second CD that the composers called 'Leonidas Returns', a great allusion to the ancient Spartans of Greece, and a perfect comparison between John (Master Chief) and Leonidas. It is a very dynamic theme that fits Master Chief perfectly, and moves the game along extremely well. The Flood tracks, and especially the track sub-titled 'Gravemind' are all effectively creepy and easily bring pictures of parasitic Flood ticks to mind. 5 stars plus 5!

B000Z27HLS|3.0|Of the 3 adaptations produced by ITV in 2007, Northanger Abbey was the best (or the least bad to be honest). I have received the DVD now and I notice to my disappointment, anger and outrage that PBS is cheating its public by selling a cut version of the adaptation. PBS had acknowleged it was going to broadcast a cut version, but it had also promised that the full and complete version would be in the DVD, and that is NOT true. They are selling the cut version only. So beware, do not order this DVD unless you want only an incomplete version. Furthermore, it is advertised as close-captioned, and that is not true, there are no subtitles nor close caption in this DVD

B000P2A256|5.0|I am not a music connoisseur, but I just wanted to take a break to tell you how much I love this CD. I buy maybe two or three CDs a year. Usually, Amazon will recommend something that sparks my interest. Such is the case with this purchase. I've had the CD for a couple of months now, and I have to tell you, I cannot stop listening to it. I LOVE IT! It has nearly broken me from my addition to NPR! I hope that makes you want to try it out, cuz I believe this CD is worth its weight in gold - far more valuable to me than the ten bucks I paid for it. ;)
B000Z27HLS|1.0|Northanger Abbey is a hard book to adapt because more than the other Austen novels, it relies on the narrative voice, which is an often hilarious satire on the Gothic Romance (The Mysteries of Udolpho, The Romance of the Forest, The Italian especially).  These were books of kidnappings, terror (not horror), dark secrets, castles, storms, brooding heroes and put-upon heroines.  Catherine is not heroine material but she tries to make the materials given to her into a Gothic story.  She fails, but love triumphs.    Without knowing these books Austen poked fun at (as opposed to read because she was a closet romantic according to Gillian Anderson's witless intro on PBS), the discovery of ancient laundry lists in a chest has little resonance, and Catherine's suspicions about what happened to Tilney's mother really seem to come out of nowhere in this version.  Gothic romances were full of cloistered, mistreated wives, poisonings, tragic journals discovered by candle light, etc.    This adaptation moved much too quickly, compressed events too much, and seemed cheesy in its attempt to give life to her reading.  Worse still, not one of the books she was reading physically looked like a book from the period--this was very annoying, as was the overt sexuality.  Are we so dumb we can't get hints--does it all have to be shoved in our faces?     More significantly, the irony of the story disappears and this turns into just another romance about a young girl who goes to Bath blahblahblah.  Yes, there are good choices in casting, but the pace is ridiculous and story-telling suffers.  I suppose the producers think that an American audience is too jaded by thrillers to accept something more leisurely, but without a slower pace, you miss the interplay of characters, the glories of setting, and most of all, the ironic turn of events.    All that aside, there are some lovely moments, some charming scenes, and for fans of the period, a fairly decent entry into another time.  For a truly deft handling of Austen, nobody beats Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility--she is utterly true to the original book, its feeling, its style, its tone.  This Northanger Abbey is tepid stuff at best.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I was more than a little confused.  I have watched this movie over and over again and it just keeps getting deeper and more interesting.  A great film with a lot of actors you would expect for this under the radar hit.

B00005JPXY|2.0|Just one minute after this movie started, my stomach started to drop. I thought, NO, please God, don't let this be a Blair Witch one-camera movie!  But so it was. For nearly an hour, you're forced to watch the totally amateur cam recorder operator film the ceiling, the floor, the ground, never getting anyone in focus. When he does, the camera shakes and revolves and tilts until I nearly barfed. You'd think that at least for a movie, J.j. Abrams could have created a fairly experienced cam recorder operator character? Just as bad,you're forced to sit through more than 20 minutes at the beginning of a party in some very boring party in NYC and several of the no-name cast members talk into the camera. And when the hero of the movie is determined to save his girlfriend in the mddle of Manhattan, you're forced to follow the camera up 65 floors in a destroyed building before you finally find the love interest. About the only dialogue I could make out was the non-ending \\"My God! My God! My God!\\" The monster was cool looking but you wish you could have seen more of it. And now let's take up a collection for J.J. Abrams to hire a professional cameraman and crew for his next project.

B0000C8AW2|4.0|It's nice to see some positive reviews for \\"Street-Legal,\\" which has often been dismissed in the flurry of transitions Dylan was undergoing in the late 70s.  After the one-two punch of \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Desire,\\" \\"Street-Legal\\" seemed like something of a wimpy little jab; plus, released the same year as his dull, forgettable \\"Live at Budokan\\" set, it seemed that 1978 was just a bad year for Bob.  Furthermore, given Bob's much-publicised conversion to Christianity that spawned three of the most controversial records he's ever released, \\"Street-Legal\\" tended to get lost in the shuffle.     More's the pity, because there's a lot to like on this disc.  Several of the songs hearken back to his mid-60s obscure-wordplay songs (\\"Changing of the Guard,\\" \\"No Time to Think,\\") while most of the songs on what was Side Two worry the pain of a relationship's end as powerfully as anything on \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" (particularly the closer, \\"Where Are You Tonight,\\" a harrowing journey through the \\"dark heat\\" of the singer's personal Hell.)  The \\"big band\\" sound, while it killed most of the old standards on \\"Budokan\\" (let's face it, \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" just sounds awful with a gospel choir) doesn't get in the way of the words here--only \\"Baby Stop Crying\\" is really dispensible, with a big chorus that goes on far too long and ends up saying little.  Perhaps because it's sandwiched between the grandiose, Tarot-soaked imagery of \\"No Time to Think\\" and the powerful directness of \\"Is Your Love in Vain,\\" \\"Baby Stop Crying\\" just seems like marking time to get to the next good song.    I can only mention, too, the hilarious \\"New Pony,\\" with it's clever nudge-wink sex metaphors (\\"Come over here, pony/I wanna climb up on top of you,\\" indeed!) and the striking \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power),\\" one of Bob's best political songs in years.      While this album is hardly essential, and while perhaps Dylan covered many of the themes here already in greater works, \\"Street Legal\\" is still afine disc, and is essential for any Dylan fan.  Perhaps time has been kinder to it and it will now get the attention it deserves.

B000VJ271A|5.0|Filmed at Barcelona's Liceu Theater last summer, this is a superb and unsentimental production of Massenet's \\"Manon\\" that builds to a shattering conclusion. Eschewing a recent trend for updating, David McVicar's production sets the story in the exact period of the Abbé Prevost's famous novel: the early 18th century. But that does not mean that this is a quaint and prettified staging -- far from it!     Taking his cue from Hogarth's gritty period paintings, McVicar gives us a grim, venal world in which only the toughest survive. And that makes the love story of Manon and Des Grieux all the more poignant since we know that these two innocents don't stand a chance in such a setting. McVicar's masterstroke is to surround them constantly -- except in the St. Sulpice scene and during their final duet -- with a crowd of cynical onlookers, portrayed by the ballet and some chorus members; even the intimate Act 2 scene in their apartment in Paris has curious servants hovering about.    In Natalie Dessay and Rolando Villazón, McVicar has two performers who are as much actors as singers. A diminutive little gamine, Dessay has to overcome the fact that she is no beauty, while Manon is supposed to be so gorgeous that she attracts every man who sees her. But overcome it she does, and while she can't match Anna Netrebko's glamour in this part, she captures the complexity and extreme feminity of Manon's character in much greater detail than does Netrebko (whom I saw in the Los Angeles production, which, in its Berlin incarnation, is due out on Deutsche Grammophon later this year). Her voice may lack Netrebko's size and voluptuousness, but she excells in the role's colorature passages and acuti. And her more fragile sound makes her death scene incredibly poignant.    At the time of this production, Rolando Villazón was in the midst of a vocal crisis that was about to send him into the lengthy absence from the stage, from which he has only returned this month. Yet, despite a minorsense of stress in some of his loud climaxes, this is not really evident at all. His singing of \\"La Rêve' in Act 2 is gloriously subtle and tender: he owns this aria. And his acting is utterly persuasive. It's tremendously difficult to make \\"good\\" characters interesting, but Villazón knows how: his Des Grieux is by turns sweetly romantic, fiercely protective, and, at the end, utterly broken. The closing death scene between Dessay and Villazón is utterly heartbreaking, but again without any sentimentality.    Other cast members are strong, especially Manuel Lanza's robustly sung Lescaut. A minor problem is Samuel Ramey's Count Des Grieux. Now well into his sixties, he sings with a terrible wobble and really should retire so that we can remember him as the glorious singer he was. The little-known Victor Pablo Pérez conducts the Liceu Orchestra with admirable Gallic spirit and refinement. The photography is excellent throughout.    I give this outstanding DVD my highest recommendation. If you love French opera, Dessay, Villazón, or simply an enthralling theatrical as well as musical experience, buy it!
0062502174|5.0|A beautifully written fable which inspires one to follow their dreams and how to be aware of the forces that will prevent you, from achieving those dreams, along the way.    The story is set in North Africa, between Morocco and Egypt in a pretechnological era and follows a young shepard's quest to give up all and seek his fortune.      For many years I considered the book but just couldn't seem to get excited about the premise enough to buy the book.  Something finally told me to give it a shot and I'm glad I did.

B000QUCNOK|3.0|The first noise Jean-Baptiste Grenouille ever made sent his mother to the gallows, and death followed him for the rest of his days.  So begins the truly unique film \\"Perfume: The Story of  Murderer.\\"  Though classified as a German film, \\"Perfume\\" is spoken entirely in English with some French writing. Based on the German novel of the same name, the story of the life of Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) can be viewed literally or as spiritual symbolism.    From his birth, Grenouille was different. Born with an incredibly powerful sense of smell, he experiences the world (set in Paris in the 1600's) primarily through scent. Orphaned and raised into a life of near silent servitude, naturally he is socially inept, and his only concern is to experience all the smells the world has to offer.    Upon his first visit to the market in Paris, he's immediately taken in by the overwhelming smells of the places, people and products around him, particularly the perfume boutiques.    Smelling is his way of experiencing the world, but his attention is absorbed entirely when a young woman selling fruit passes him by. He follows her, becoming completely enveloped by her smell. When she sees he has followed to her home, she screams. Attempting to muffle her screams, Grenouille accidentally suffocates her, but his remorse for taking a life is immediately dwarfed by his compulsion to take in her smell. He rips her clothing off and passionately begins smelling every crevice of her body, basking in her scent. But it quickly fades, and panic sets in. He mourns the loss of her scent more than the loss of her life.    It is at that moment he becomes determined to learn how to preserve smell. He finagles his way into becoming the apprentice of Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) an aging perfumer. Grenouille wows him by not only replicating, but improving on the formula of a competitor's hottest selling perfume, rejuvenating Baldini's failing business.  As he studies to find a way to perfectly preservesmell, Grenouille shows a total disregard for social niceties, and even life itself. He eventually leaves Paris for the small village of Grasse, when he believes he'll learn everything he needs to know. Before he leaves, Baldini tells him of the 12 parts of every perfume, and the legend of a 13th part that would make the \\"ultimate perfume.\\"     13 parts to the perfect perfume It is the meetings between Baldini and Grenouille that opens the spiritual symbolism of the film. Baldini says that an object's soul is in its smell, and this simple comment reflects in everything that happens in the film. From here, the viewer can choose to see things as they literally happen, or in a spiritual sense. When his first victim died, was it really her soul that was leaving her body, or did she simply stop producing pheromones? The real effects of pheromones in perfume have been debunked in recent years, but the novel was penned over 22 years ago.    On his journey to Grasse, Grenouille is horrified to learn he has no smell/soul of his own. When he begins to target beautiful women to preserve their smells, one can't help but wonder if he's not trying to steal their souls as well.      I was with this movie until the bizarre ending, which I'm guessing is the reason Stanley Kubrick believed the book could not be adapted to the big screen.    Despite the title, the movie is not really about murder. There are no gruesome death sequences, and in fact, most deaths are not shown on screen. Instead, the focus is on Grenouille's actions to preserve them and use them as parts of the ultimate perfume. The story of a murderer really becomes the story of a soulless man looking for a way to fill the void.    Though the story itself was interesting, I was more impressed by presentation. Grenouille himself goes long periods of time without speaking, but great cinematography coupled with an intense score builds a strong understanding between the audience and the characters. I have to give a lot of credit to Director Tom Tykwer for finding a way to dramatically and accurately represent the rush of emotions Grenouille experiences from a sense that cannot possibly be shared with the audience through the given medium. I mean, how do you communicate smells on film?    This is not to say the film is without its flaws. As mentioned earlier, the ending (the last 30 minutes) lost me despite its accuracy, and some points go well past the line of overdramatic. I would have enjoyed seeing more about how Grenouille avoids being caught despite the efforts of law enforcement and how a completely uneducated man develops a system of smell preservation beyond what any other individual in the industry had done. The overall package still stands, but the weaknesses are apparent.    Final Score: 7    A good movie with a unique story. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary to watch, check this one out.

0316113506|5.0|Our doctors always say to get more exercise.  We always yawn and say of course; we've heard it all before.  And then we are mediocre in our follow up.  After reading Spark my entire viewpoint has changed.  Exercise is a master key to brain functioning.  Cholesterol and other system problems caused by lack of exercise are a bit ambiguous since we often can't directly feel them until we manifest some disease.  Brain functioning is something else entirely.  We can feel an almost immediate change after aerobic exercise.  After reading Spark I definitely have become a six day a week exerciser.  I need my brain functioning as well as possible, and the data in this book has made a believer out out of me.
B000UBMSB8|1.0|My mother wanted to give me something special for Christmas this year so I suggested this DVD as this is my favorite movie.  I had to order for her because she is a dinosaur but that's okay, it's the thought that counts.  Unfortunately she was not impressed as the DVD has several glitches and I could not get the movie to run correctly.  As I had just watched Love Actually a few days before I knew it was not my DVD player so it was a big disappointment for both of us and she is still a believer in the old ways.

B000C13Y2S|1.0|I bought this flashlight thinking it would be of equal or similar quality of the larger Stanley Tripod flashlights. I was very wrong. It is very flimsy, and cheap. The keychain part sticks down so low, that it won't stand up on it's own like it is supposed to. It does have a nice bright led light, but if you are looking for a small compact led light, there are better ones out there. If you like the tripod feature, I do highly recommend the other two Stanley Tripod flashlights. I own both the \\"aa\\" and the \\"aaa\\" sizes and they are great.
B0000027EP|3.0|Motorhead seemed to take some flack with changing up their sound with 1991's \\"1916\\" and even though it seems to show that the four year abscence of studio time seemed to hurt the band, there are still five killer cuts here that make the album worth a purchase. \\"IM so bad\\", \\"No Voices in the Sky\\", \\"Make my Day\\", and \\"Shut you Down\\" are classic Motorhead, and the Ramones track isnt that bad either. The rest seems like some bad filler, and a bit mellow for the band, but like I said it could have been due to lack of studio time, or the fact this I believe was the first album they recorded with a major label. Sometimes record companies can influence bands the wrong way in which to appeal more to the masses, and this seemed to be the case with \\"1916\\" but once again, its not all that bad and it is worth adding to your collection. The Dismal release of the next album \\"March or Die\\" was probely due to the fact that Sony Records had a say in the material they recorded, but this one at least has a few good songs that make it a solid release. ENJOY
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I first saw this epic (cut with advertising) on Speedvision in 2000  Now that my twins are eight and into Slotcars (scalextric digital) this movie was calling out to us  Nothing is better for the races than the most realistic racing movie ever (or evahh) produced  this is also the only movie endorsed buy the Ferrari factory for the realistic race scenes  if you love the smell of oil burning, the clatter of tappets and the Bark of open Megaphones then this movie is a must have
B000294SFW|4.0|Yes it is amazing that Motorhead can still release great material considering that they released the debut album in 1977. Even though there was a short period in which they released two albums that were not up to par (1992's diaster \\"March or Die\\" and 1998's \\"Overnight Sensation\\")it is amazing that the band is still rocking this hard at this point, and considering their age, its even more impressive. \\"Inferno\\" is a fast paced album with the signiture Motorhead sound, which deliever just as hard as they did back in the \\"Ace of Spades\\" and \\"Overkill\\" days. Even though the album as a whole isnt as good as the two I just mentioned (and what Motorhead albums are??) it still great that they gave such a strong effort, and still to this day have never really sold out there sound (even though they had a major label for 1916 and March or Die, they quickly ditched Sony Records to release the Metal classic \\"Bastards\\") Hopefully many rock bands will follow the form of Motorhead and just worrying about releasing great music for their fans, and not trying to get greedy and change their sound just to make a few extra bucks. Enjoy this 2004 release, and hopefully a new release will be ready for us soon, and I am sure the band wont let us down.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Short and sweet.I have never read Jane Austen's novel,but I have seen every screen adaptation.NORTHANGER ABBEY is the only Jane Austen adaptation that never worked for me.Andrew Davies' adaptation did! 93 minutes that moved along with excellent soundtrack and capturing the heart of the overly active and dramatic imagination of Miss Catherine Morland.This was not a static film.Much dialogue is couched in lots of movement and dancing, instead of dry as dust sitting around.As a screenplay, this NORTHANGER ABBEY works best FOR the screen.There is no lag or down time,and Davies knows that this is essential to hold people's attention.Highly recommended as the best screen adaptation available.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|As a kindergarten teacher, I am always on the lookout for gentle, thought provoking literature and activities that promote higher learning and creativity. I first found The Snowman in book form, and later discovered this jewel of a DVD; a wordless, kind, little 30 minute animated journey  a boy makes with his self-created snowman friend. After viewing this DVD my students write about the trips they might take with their own snow person and the adventures they incur. With no dialogue in the DVD, it opens up a new world of quiet thoughtfulness that my students have never been exposed to before. A true gem, I recommend The Snowman highly!
B0000640VO|3.0|A very charming story with a very charming actress shot and edited like an MTV video or Baz Luhrmann's [[ASIN:B000077VR3 Moulin Rouge! (Widescreen Edition)]].AMELIE,for me,was a study in stylistic frustration.The story of the young and terribly shy woman who has great difficulty touching the outside world is actually quite innovative and infectious,but I caution anyone who enjoys scenes that linger.Nothing about AMELIE lingers.There is virtually no scene that lasts beyond a five second interval with some kind of an edit.The camera angles are either above,below,sideways or right in your face.If I had been a set dresser on this filmed I would have been PO'd that my detailed work was never allowed to be seen.This is my personal opinion.Stylistically,AMELIE is not a film I would ever watch a second time.It is full of magically vivid colours and characters,but the director Jeunet's style did not lend itself to telling a story as much as the style triumphed the substance for me.A solid one time view.

1401300529|3.0|Russell Baker in his afterward says that Halberstam was a proponent of what Halberstam called the new journalism, a kind of history in which individual personalities are seen as the driving of events. This is opposed to Tolstoyian history of great forces.  By this theory \\"The Longest Winter\\" captures the essence of the Korean war, its causes and turning points.  What the book does show is that peoples lives were indeed in the cross  hairs of the events but an exaggerated emphasis of individual personalities obscures many of the forces of which they were simply a manifestation.  I think this is Tolstoy's point: that the great forces are made up of individuals but that those individuals are simultaneously driven by the same forces.  So Muscovites could fiddle while Napoleon advanced but as Marx would say of the peasantry in England they were to be overwhelmed by forces they could not conceive of.  Similarly Halberstam's picture of the cruelty of the Cultural Revolution and the US entry into Vietnam as being merely a result respectively of Mao's crippled personality and LBJ stubbornness misses much bigger forces at play.  One of the best places where the influence of personality, contingency, and underlying forces are diagnosed is in the second volume of William Freehling's of the pre-bellam South[[ASIN:0195058151 The Road to Disunion, Volume II: Secessionists Triumphant 1854-1861]].  Freehling makes the best case I know of for personality and contingency, yet the first volume  [[ASIN:0195072596 The Road to Disunion: Volume I: Secessionists at Bay, 1776-1854 (Road to Disunion Vol. 1)]] which is oriented toward the gathering forces is far more convincing.<br /> Halberstam does a better job with Macarthur, showing how his peculiarities fit  into the world view of the China Lobby and McCarthy right.  Although the book gives a good, but from my perspective not so interesting, picture of what it was for American soldiers during the North Korean drive south, the race north and the unseen Chinese infiltration and counterattack, the two years of trench warfare which made up most of the Korean war is slighted.  If Halberstam were true to his concept of history that boring slog fest deserves a narrative and should be understandable in terms of personality.  The problem is, of course, that this period lacks the drama of the back and forth battles where heroes and villains stand out more.<br /> From me the book gets mixed praise.  His narrative flair is engaging.  The moral of how much wars can be about domestic politics rather than world real politics cannot be repeated too often.  And we should not forget \\"forgotten wars.\\"  They too carve a notch out of our collective souls.  In the midst of the Iraq we should not be sitting back comfortably but raising hell as in Vietnam.<br /> In the book we do not get a clear picture of whose fault the Korean war was.  It seems that Kim Il Sung  was the bad boy playing off Stalin and Mao but we get only hints of how much responsibility lies with Sigmund Rhee and the south or what kind of a war it was for the ROKs.  It seems the North possessed more effectiveness because Kim had addressed real needs while Rhee was merely a corrupt autocratic parasite.  Were all the ROK soldiers cowards and the North Korean troops good when victorious but yellow when really challenged. I remember in 1960 or so when Fleming's book on the Cold War came out.

B000GIXEIG|5.0|I too had read Beowulf but unlike many negative reviews of this movie I must post significant disagreement with those citing \\"not true to the poem\\" reasons to dislike the movie. The recent \\"Beowulf\\" With Angelina Jolie was a suckfestival in that it did nothing for the story but make it visual. The troll was not special, just special effects. What I see in Beowulf and Grendle is not an exact interpretation but a more human view of an old legend. History is written by winners and the original writer of Beowulf either had one hell of an imagination or based his story on real events and in order to protect his head had to change names because back in those days criticism usually met a violent death. So in this intro let me regress. First of all like any movie is a certain amount of interpretation. I seen the 'Wild Wild West' and was shocked and Horrified to see James West played by a Black Man. That completely screwed with history and the original show I loved as a kid. So was James West now James Shaft West? (He is one bad Mother F... NOW SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Talkn' about J Shaft West!) Historically for a black man in that day and age being some secret agent man on many factual levels sends shivers down my back. Let us see him infiltrating some society of hard core Southerners. Shoo, can he go Chameleon and make himself white suddenly? Somehow I don't think Ulysses S. Grant would even shake his hand since he was a total racist (HISTORICAL FACT!!). I am not against black actors having lead roles at all and have seen inspired performances in many movies but Wild Wild West was one movie I refuse to own on the grounds of Distortion of American history and Distortion of an original TV show.   The movie Earth Sea was another cite able disappointment because most of the characters were supposed to be black and not white like in the original book Earth Sea! Now with Beowulf and Grendle there is differences from the original poem and granted I am not that much of a buff on Scandinavians but what I do know of them was that they were not drunk rampaging barbarians. They were in fact a proper orderly society living in very rough conditions. They were explorers and warriors that often made money being paid to fight. Like anyone that lives hard they play hard. They were a warriors and artists, craftsmen, farmers, fishermen. They were not in a hurry to go to Valhallah like many picture Vikings. But they like other gifted people had some pretty far fetched imaginations. Sometimes ordinary people do things that seem extra ordinary and become legends thaks to others telling about their deeds.  Now lets face it, not everybody has the money to throw around for serious CGI or Angelina Jolie. For what was done with this movie I got to give props to the makers of this one. it put some rather interesting twists and humanization to what otherwise was a tough story to wrap my mind around. The movie 'Beowulf' sucked  miserably in comparison to Beowulf and Grendle. Where Beowulf in the movie 'Beowulf' came off as a loud obnoxious braggart and a sea demon making babies by the Danish kings and sending them off to make the Danes suffer 'Beowulf and Grendle' portrayed Grendle as a warrior but one with more of a brain rather than have him act like a WWF wrestler yelling \\"I am Beowulf!\\" all the time. Grendle had a real reason \\"other than the noise bothered him\\" to lay waste to the Danes. Yes the movie had a gritty feel to it but then again I had a history teacher who liked to show the movie Jabberwocky (NOT Monty Python but it had a lot of the Python cast in it!!!) to us in High School because it was the most realistic look at Medieval life available at the time. People didn't bath often then and without a water heater who would? If you are looking for grandiose spectacle and fantastic structures and special effects galore and big ugly inhuman trolls go to the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. The beer hall in 'Beowulf and Grendle' would have been the biggest and best structure of the day. The ships were very period and Iceland ponies would have been used instead of regular horses BECAUSE THEY HAD TO BRING THEM ON THEIR BOATS AND REGULAR HORSES DO NOT DO WELL AT ALL IN THOSE COLD CONDITIONS!!! Back then you went with what works and small ponies fit on the boats better than large horses. Iceland ponies were bread to deal with the harsh conditions and travel by sea if necessary. There also is the concept of a troll to grapple with. It was an insult as well as a reference to a monster. The troll in the movie was a man but he was a rather big (and I mean HUGE) man and was very strong. He seemed impervious to cold. Pissed off with a big sword in his hand he would have been someone I would even question an AK-47 stopping. In that day a man like that on a rampage would have been considered a monster. Heck, even today of someone like that were to rampage they would be described and feared as a monster and not a man.  If anything take this movie with a gain of salt and think of it as what could have inspired the legend. granted it was not done by any super studio and does not have famous top name actors in it but is will shock and horrify you in ways that other movies failed! It was quirky and had a feel to it that was sincere to the medieval era. Nothing about it was anachronistic. Nothing went out into left field. Grendle was not exactly a monster. The Danes made him one. This is a movie of double revenge and twisted truth. I liked it on many levels from performance, scenery, plot, flow of story, and it did manage to keep the breadcrumbs coming until the revelation of the truth. The witch was way different as well. Not like what any would classically expect.  I may not be some college educated study on legends or writing or movies but I know what has heart and what doesn't. 'Beowulf and Grendle' has heart and a lot of it. I recommend this for at least one viewing. NOT FOR CHILDREN OR THE SQUEAMISH. Has some limited sex but it also has somevery dramatic violent moments (and I am not talking about when Grendle go on a smash-a-thon in the beer hall!). Rated R for a damn good reason. It was just a very entertaining movie and I will own it soon!

1416524800|1.0|This book is awful.  Written to appeal to the lowest common deominator of reader.  Lets start with the plot.  In an era where we have real issues., Iraq, poverty, lobbyists, illegal immigration, terrorism and a faltering economy which can make or break Presidential campaigns Dan Brown choses NASA as the central topic of contention in a closely fought Presidential election. NASA - he chose NASA!!!!! The space agency's entire annual budget is about what the United States spends in Iraq in 2 months (about 15 Bn USD).  Ok so lets say that you didnt know that salient point - that elections are not won or lost on piddly little government agencies and their 15Bn budgets then you need to experience the characters in the novel.  Every single one is either a stereotype (nerd scientist, Indiana Jones explorer) or some kind of grotesque caricature of a person - with every aspect of personality exaggerated - booming voices, preening manners, shuddering disbelief, guffaw like laughter etc.<br /><br />Is it a conincidence that Dan Brown rhymes with \\"Dumb Down\\".  The fact that this guy is a published best selling author blows my mind.  If Jessica Simpson became a writer she would write trash like this.  So buy it if you have low standards.  Its a little better than Angels and Demons and worse than the Da Vinci Code.

0151013047|3.0|Apart from the basic flow of the plot, there are certain areas which the author needs to focus on in his future works, these may be technicalities, but it sometimes can kill the overall concept of enjoying a good book, if strayed from excessively.<br /><br />usage of double negatives (not unlikely, not insignificant etc.. even used contextually, can be highly irritating after a certain point.<br /><br />I was amused as to how the author, in almost a sophomoric beavis & butthead kind of way, addresses Jim's sexuality.<br /><br />Very poor character study done of the protagonist, does not make sense to hate Americans and at the same time engage in such a conversation of such personal depth with a complete stranger, who happens to be a yank.<br /><br />Isn't the whole servile approach of South east Asians towards \\"gora\\" (means white man in Hindi) done to death, and saturated  in every book and media? Its silly for him (the bearded 'reluctant fundamentalist') to talk in such a way, for a princeton educated boy. You would think his dialogue would sound more confident, with purpose, not some 'sahib' rambling.<br /><br />His paragraph regarding the 'happy' reaction to 9/11 has zero bearing to the plot whatsoever and one begins to wonder whether it was how the Author himself personally felt towards 9/11, that he is subliminally bringing out in the book.<br /><br />The one issue that remains at large is the crucial point of how the story of Janissaries, are twisted in this story. A Muslim will always be a Muslim first and foremost, country and community comes only after that a distant second and third.<br /><br />Overall, this is an author who shows good promise and i would look forward to reading his future works, provided he does better research and shows a bit more maturity in his approach of character study.

This being one of my favorites of Jane's books I was ecstatic to finally have a movie version of this book that I will actually buy.    JJ Feild is perfect as Henry Tilney and just made me fall in love with his character again.  Carey Mulligan was also good as Isabella Thorpe.  She made me despise her instantly which is necessary.  I highly recommend it.

ALTHOUGH I WILL TRY TO KEEP IT SIMPLE, SPOILERS MAY BE CONTAINED HERE!!!! ***<br /><br />The Wonderful Adventures of Honey Honey (Honey Honey no Suteki na Boken, in Japanese)  first came out in the U. S. the early 1980's and it follows the story of a young orphan girl, oddly named \\"Honey Honey\\". Honey Honey's best friend is her cat, Lily, as Honey Honey has no parents or relatives of her own. Honey Honey works at a restaurant in lovely 19th Century Austria, during the national celebration of the Princess Flora's 19th birthday. Princess Flora is bored with her group of suitors from all over the globe. Her group of suitors include a California gold mining tycoon, Geronimo, the American Indian hero, an wealthy oil sultan, and of course, Gustav, the German military toughie. But Princess Flora was about to have more excitement than she expected, as she is charmed by no other than the good-looking Phoenix, The Phantom Thief.<br /><br />During the Princess' birthday celebration ball, Princess Flora is tricked by Phoenix into removing \\"The Smile of The Amazon\\", her irreplaceable jewel, as Phoenix claims Princess Flora's beauty is a mere reflection of the jewel. Furious to hear such a remark, the spoiled Princess places the jewel inside a fish and tosses it down the alley next to the palace. Phoenix then makes his hasty exit to retrieve the jewel, but Honey Honey's cat, Lily, eats the fish and swallows the irreplaceable gigantic diamond.<br /><br />Wanting to have fun with her diverse group of suitors who are stunned by her beauty, the spoiled Princess Flora, promises to marry anyone who can retrieve her diamond. Problem is Honey Honey is not about to give her her best friend Lily to the Princess' suitors, so she is forced to run away in the middle of the night. As she attempts to make her escape, Phoenix shows up and tries to get Lily from Honey Honey. Phoenix may be good looking, charming, and very smooth with the ladies, but he fails to surpass Honey Honey's love for her cat Lily, the only family she has ever known.<br /><br />Honey Honey's name has a simple, yet interesting origin. She was found by nuns in a flower-filled field in the Spring, the time of the year when bees come to collect flower nectar to make honey. Thus, the nuns decided to name her Honey Honey. It makes sense, I guess. :) Honey Honey later discovers her origin and the story behind her parents leaving her in the flower field. This is, of course, thanks to the fact that she is forced to leave her job and travel throughout Europe. So Honey Honey traces her destiny as she travels and experiences the wonderful world of 19th century Europe.<br /><br />The Wonderful Adventures of Honey Honey is an interesting early Japanese cartoon of the challenges and adventures of this young girl being pursued by a group of desperate suitors and the professional thief, Phoenix. Honey Honey is young and innocent, but she slowly blossoms into a young woman during her travels and discovers love for her charming pursuer, Phoenix. But can Honey Honey change the Phantom Theif??!<br /><br />Anyone who is open-minded to the pure aspect of love and the simplicity of a young girl who risks it all for the love of her cat, will certainly fall in love with this older, yet much revered anime series all over the world.cat Lily, the only family she has ever known.

0143038419|5.0|Although the author is quite self-indulgent, you can't help but love her. I would guess that women everywhere (and some men) will envy the total abandonment of responsibility and the submergence into the soul. Every other paragraph made me laugh out loud. I would recommend this book to anyone over 25.
B00005RYKU|4.0|A simple thriller like so many others. A car accident, two orphans sheltered by the parents' business associates who are revealed to have been the killers to put their hands on the money the children represent, and all that for some shady business with criminal contractors. Banal. The elder child, the girl, will try to escape and will fail. And little by little things are going down but all is well that ends well and I can't reveal the details, except that the uncle will get the kids he should have gotten from the very start since he was the only family. The thrill comes from the details of the yarn we are told which is in a way a tall tale from some Calaveras County, California and its giant leaping jumping frogs.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
1401307787|5.0|In the introduction to his classic mindfulness book, author Jon Kabat-Zinn writes, \\"This book is different.  It is meant to provide brief and easy access to the essence of mindfulness meditation and its applications.  It is offered particularly for those who resist structured programs and for people who don't like to be told that to do but are curious enough about mindfulness and its relevance to try to piece it together for themselves.\\"  In exquisitely austere prose, this text describes the rationale for mindfulness practice in daily life, enumerates formal meditation exercises, and introduces applications and perspectives on incorporating mindfulness in daily living.<br /><br />Kabat-Zinn is lightly witty throughout the text.  In `Keeping It Simple' he writes, \\"every time you get a strong impulse to talk about meditation and how wonderful it is, or how hard it is, or what it's doing for you these days, or what it's not, or you want to convince someone else how wonderful it would be for them, just look at it as more thinking and go meditate some more.  The impulse will pass and everybody will be better off--especially you.\\"<br /><br />The 10th anniversary edition of Wherever You Go There You Are is a durable paperback on heavy paper stock with jacket flaps meant to be used as bookmarks.  I made notes in the wide margin of my copy, highlighting the \\"TRY\\" paragraphs with specific meditation or reflection practices of appeal to me.  I enthusiastically recommend that you pick up this book from your local library.  You will be buying your own copy soon enough.  Each of Kabat-Zinn's three books (of which this is the second) is also accompanied by a set of audio CDs that can be ordered from the author's website.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|The amazing releases of 2007 in high definition format and standard DVDs have been astounding.  The unusually high caliber TWIN PEAKS gold box set(FINALLY!)Anchor Bays phenomenal Jodorowsky compendium and now what is sure to be the final word on THE most influential film of the past 3 decades in the 5 disc BLADE RUNNER collection.  This is a film that a generation of filmmakers, cyberpunks, and overall movie lovers have lived and breathed in its many incarnations in other films, televsion or music video.  Without going into to much detail on influences Pirates of the Caribbean 3 wouldn't look the way it does without the heavy influence of Blade Runner and its art direction and overall asthetic.<br />I have tried many times to relive the first \\"Sleeper\\" showing at midnight when my eyes and ears were opened to this new cinema, but inferior VHS incarnations and lack of projection prevented this. With this 5 disc set and the proper sound and projection setup I can now achieve cinematic bliss once again, even if my eyes are 25 years older now.  The extras included here are fascinating if you share my relish for pre CGI cinema and its production then this is a virtual bonanza, the workprint is a little underwhelming in presentation but they did their best and I love that it is included.  The real final straw that pushes this set to the top of the heap is the incredible deleted scenes reel that plays like a mini version with alternate voiceover narration that is a boon for those of us that enjoy Ford's wooden noir delivery over their groundbreaking visuals.  The workprint disc is misprinted in a few sets (mine) and I found that the final cut disc had rough edges and ran loudly in my PS3, other than the mild production hiccups this was worth waiting for as the extras and reshoots and documentaries all go into making this the DEFINITIVE release that it is.  A must own for any collector of any format.
B000PHNHMQ|4.0|Nice nailer. It is quite an upgrade from my 1 1/2 in CH. They even included safety glasses in a nice case.     But the functionality is great. Well balanced in your hand, and not too heavy.
B000JJS8TM|1.0|OK so it says clearly AUDIO DVD, so call me stupid, but when I buy oranges I don`t look closely to make sure they are not \\"juiceless oranges\\" I expect a DVD to have pictures. I have never been so disappointed and felt so violated as when I put the DVD into my player and got a crappy Logo with the typed song title.  To me this is a blatant manifestation of corporate greed.  Why would anybody go to the trouble of making an Audio DVD unless it was just to get some sucker like me to fall for it and buy it.<br />I love the music, but I also love Cirq du Soleil and that's what I expected.<br />Chuck
B000ATQYT2|5.0|The Muppet Christmas Carol - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition was an excellent seasonal movie enjoyed by both kids and adults. Highly recommended.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|This was an incredible offer from Amazon.  I originally thought the studios were going to sell a trilogy pack in HD DVD but they didn't.  So when I saw this great offer from Amazon I jumped all over it.  Great to see these amazing movies in HD.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This is a really wonderful series. It has action, humor, intelligence, swashbuckling, romance, it makes you think, and a really great premise. I can't believe they stopped making it after only 14 episodes--and we still have shows like Dancing with the Stars on TV!     The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that the actor who played Shepherd Book at times seemed a little unbelievable. I can't put my finger on exactly what it was, but he just rubbed me wrong at times. If I could be more specific with my rating, I would have said a 98.5% out of 100%. Really, you need to see this series. Great!!!
0316010669|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew.  He works as an actuary and I thought he would enjoy it.
B00005JPXY|3.0|With the advance buildup that \\"Cloverfield\\" received, the unveiling of the actual product was bound to leave some, if not most, viewers feeling cheated or disappointed to some degree.  For months (it seemed) the trailer teased and tantalized with thrilling, often incomprehensible, images of chaos and destruction in Manhattan, as frantic, attractive twenty-somethings scurried for their lives amidst fiery explosions and the indelible image of the Statue of Liberty's head crashing and rolling to a stop near terrified onlookers.    Utilizing the conceit that the entire adventure is caught on a partygoer's camcorder, \\"Cloverfield\\" immediately conjures up memories of the \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", that late nineties megahit that seemed to polarize viewers into \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" camps.  I liked \\"Blair Witch\\", although the concept of the student's terrifying journey being captured via their own video cameras was stretched very thin at times, particularly during the meltdown scenes, and those scenes when the students appeared to be in mortal danger.  However, the young people in \\"Blair Witch\\" were film students so it was possible to go along with the idea of their incessant filming.  With \\"Cloverfield\\" it's not that simple.  The protagonists here are not apparently film students but regular, young New Yorkers throwing a surprise party for one of their own, a golden boy named Rob, who has accepted a job in Japan.  Since Rob is leaving the next morning, the girlfriend of Rob's brother insists that the entire evening be captured on camera for Rob to savor in the weeks to come.  As everyone now knows, the party is seriously interrupted by something that is big and mean and clearly unhappy.  Lower Manhattan is ripped apart, the Brooklyn Bridge is demolished, Miss Liberty is decapitated, and romances are tested, friends die--and hardly a moment is left unfilmed.  Hud, the assigned cameraman, and Rob's best friend dutifully records every single moment, even as he is running down flights of stairs, jumping from one collapsing building to another, being attacked by some really icky spiderlike entities in a subway tunnel--it just doesn't work.  The only way to make this believable would be for Hud to have the camcorder strapped to his head, but that isn't the case.  I really didn't mind the fast, jerky movements of the camera--for me, it added a sense of urgency and excitement to the film. Most of all, it added much needed intimacy to these characters' plight, since we are seeing this crisis through their eyes, specifically through the eyes of Hud. However, even this does not do much to endear the characters to the viewer.  Actually, I found them to be somewhat uninvolving, at best, and irritating, at worst.  I was especially irritated that Rob would allow his good friends to traipse all the way to 59th Street from downtown with the beast from hell (and his minions) hot on their tail while Rob tries to rescue his almost-girlfriend from another unknown peril.  I was also irritated at the really stupid decisions that these characters continually make throughout the film.  Most of all, I was irritated because I really wanted to like this film and, while it isn't awful, it could have been so much better.  It's sort of like \\"Friends\\" meets \\"Godzilla\\", without the character development of either. That's not the fault of the pretty, but little known, actors--they do the best that they can with a lame and predictable script.  The special effects were good, and sometimes even great.  The few glimpses we get of the monster are effectively creepy, but the truly chilling creatures are the aforementioned spidery things which are, apparently, parasites that have attached themselves to the larger beast.  They are fast and deadly and you can't see them coming until they're right on top of you!    With J.J. Abrams attached as producer, I (perhaps unfairly)expected \\"Cloverfield\\" to be a better film. Having said this, I will probably rent it and watch it again when it comes out on DVD, just to see if I like it any better the second time.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Very satisfied with my purchase.  It's only a dvd, but it was shipped in time before christmas even though I ordered it late.  It was refreshing to order something online & it arrive in a timely manner and without defects.  My daughter enjoyed the movie thoroughly.   It dealt with the delicate issue of Santa Claus being real or not and allowed me to sit back, enjoy the movie & let my daughter decide for herself.
B000W07EKW|5.0|Matt Damon is perfect in this series.  The storyline is captivating and the constant tension and thrills continue throughout the series.  I still get excited watching each individual movie over and over.  I recommend this for any collection of best action movies.
B000002GZ1|4.0|The general critical consensus seems to be that the PBBB's second album, \\"East/West,\\" is the one to get, but I disagree. I own both, and I find that this, the band's first release, is much better than album #2. The songs here are played with more intensity and focus (the band is \\"tighter,\\" as musicians say), and the vocals and harp are tough, gritty and \\"authentic,\\" in a blues sense. In contrast, the band seems to be trying too hard to sound like great blues on \\"East/West.\\" On this album, everything feels organic and unforced. Mike Bloomfield, of course, is excellent on every track, and that makes a significant difference between this and any other \\"white boy blues,\\" or whatever you want to call it, that was around at the same time. Here, and on Dylan albums, he's really the difference between \\"good\\" and \\"great.\\" Get this one--it sounds fresh, almost contemporary, despite its age.
B000002KYR|5.0|ZZ TOP has always been know for their blues rock this album is no exception.<br />Sex, Drugs and ROCK & ROLL this album has the sex with \\"LEGS\\",\\"WELL DRESSED MAN\\" & \\"GIVE ME ALL YOUR LOVING\\".<br />This album still rocks this is one of their best albums, if not the best!!<br />If you like simple southern rock this is the one of the best to own.<br />I rate this CD a 5 of 5 stars!!
B00006RAKP|5.0|I was excited to purchase this CD set of Elton John hits. From \\"Bennie and Jets\\" and \\"Candle in the Wind\\" to \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" and \\"I'm Still Standing\\", you get the best of Elton John's music. \\"Circle of Life\\" from the megahit \\"The Lion King\\" is a nice bonus. You will enjoy this CD alot!
B00008DDRX|3.0|If you are looking at \\"Le Mans,\\" you already know at least something about the film.  The star of this film is really the race course itself, and in fact, this film works almost more as a documentary than a film.  The cinematography is fine, though I say that with hesitation because much of the film was actually shot in documentary mode, with cameras (big, old-school film cameras, not the little digital ones used for TV coverage today) mounted on one car during the race in 1971.  Other scenes were shot after the race on different stretches of the race course.  As for the writing, well that went on before, during, and after the race, and the director changed at least once before Katzin.    Having said all of that, the real kudos go to the film editors, who took these various parts and made a true homage to the race and to the middle of the Golden Years of LeMans.  The 917K and the 512 are two of the most beautiful machines designed for racing ever, IMHO, and seeing them in action is wonderful.  The overhead shots take in all of the spectacle that is LeMans.  And, of course, there is the stunt driving.  No CGI in this film, and it shows.  Take the most realistic car crashes from a modern film, and compare it with these -- not even close in comparison.    Having said all of that, the DVD only rates three stars.  If I did not like the film so much, I would give it one star.  Come on, Paramount, we racing fans waited a few years for this DVD, and all we get is cleaned up sound and film?  The so-called \\"special features\\" on this DVD are (according to the back of the case) \\"widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's,\\" \\"English subtitles,\\" and \\"Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.\\"  If you want French, you only get mono sound.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!  As I hinted at above, there is a whole story behind the making of this film which rates only slightly behind the making of \\"Blade Runner\\" in terms of drama.  No documentary about that?  You could even be lazy and include the fine documentary with McQueen's son!  No trailers?  Features about the race, the history of the cars, the rivalry between Porsche and Ferrari, NOTHING?  The film is great, and this is the only DVD, but Paramount and CBS home video owe us, the fans of this film, much better than this minimalist effort.  I would gladly pay three times as much for a well-produced DVD with extras worthy of this film, this race, and this era in racing history.  Don't even thing about offering this on Blu-Ray in this same state...
0811806405|5.0|This must certainly be the perfect book for anybody interested in the construction of a guitar... - or any stringed instrument, really. The text is obviously written by someone with expert knowledge. I´ve never read anything as thorough as this. It seems every detail and troublesome process has been covered. The illustrations could be better, though. But it isn´t a new book, so I guess we´ve just grown accostumed to colour photos.     I bought it because I wanted to get started building my own instrument, but now that I have a much better idea of the difficulties I´m facing, I´m not so sure I´ll take on the challenge. I could spend the time playing my instrument instead. :-)    But at least, if I do start building, I won´t be disappointed if I fail. It isn´t easy! Even with my new book close by.    Don´t be discouraged. You couldn´t ask for a better guide than this. \\"Courage!!\\" - as the French say.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A great work from the BBC team, it is an amazing DVD with stunning pictures of our planet. A must to have!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|As presidential primaries are gaining their full speed and candidates are presenting their plan for the new America, they are talking about the issues of today.  Although most would want us to believe that this year's elections are about \\"the economy, stupid\\", I believe that this should be defining campaign year and presidential election for the very important issue of our nation which is health care.  As all Michael Moore documentaries, this one attacks the establishement about the widely pushed indoctrination to the masses that universal health care equals socialized medicine for the likes of Eastern Europe (i.e. read socialized medicine).  We see that countries like: France, UK and Canada have prospered by implementing nationalized health care.  Even Cuba takes care of their citizens, while our citizens get complimentary taxi drop off from the hospitals unwilling to treat patients who either do not have insurance, or can no longer afford their deductables.  I only wish this film re-emerges as the presidential elections reach November.  People need to be educated about how our current health system is really working for us as it is setup today.
B00005U122|5.0|This DVD is so Incredible. What a Great 2 and half hour show. Wow, so many songs (24 of them). I am not a big Pink Floyd fan, but I do enjoy their 'The Wall' and 'The Dark Side of the Moon' and that was the only albums I know of them. I bought this DVD because I wanted to see them live and hear some of the familiar songs, and wow, I got plenty of Great songs I know and so many new ones I haven't heard of before, and I love them as well. I love everything from this show, the performaces, the Sound is incredible, the visual is wonderful and plus, it has Close Caption for the hearing impaired or you just wanted to know what they are singing about. I use the Caption most of the times. Almost every night since I bought this 3 weeks ago through Amazon.com for a GREAT Price, I would lay in bed with my 7 inch DVD player and my good headphones and play a couple of songs before going to bed. Some of the songs is very soothing and puts me to sleep because it's beautiful with the piano, guitar, saxophone and more. If you are slightly a Pink Floyd fan, then you will be a much bigger fan after watching this a couple of times, and I have watched it many times and I love it. 5 Stars all the way baby. Do you remember me saying - TWO and a HALF HOUR SHOW? I'm not kidding, 24 songs and they played them all with such beauty and perfection. Sometimes the guitar player freestyle a little and it just makes it better. GET This DVD. You will get your money's worth at a good low price.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This first episode of the Star Wars saga is a magnificant achievement. The pace is brisk, the detailed imagining of alien worlds and peoples is incredible. Special effects are the best that exist. And it includes homages/allusions to many other science fiction/fantasy classics. This is moviemaking at its best.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|It seem to be a rehash of the first two movies. The stunt work and the car chases are fantastic, but the plots are becoming formulaic. Certain activities are starting to happen in every film: the brutal hand-to-hand fight scene, the confrontation with the operator who supervised the black op in some form, the meeting with what's her name, etc. Furthermore, the revelation of his true name didn't have the impact as the revelations of the other movies. I think a rather big plot hole is there too. Focus on the guy who Bourne didn't shoot after the crash. From the breathing, it sounds like he is bleeding internally. He is kind of beat up from the crash. Yet, he was chasing Bourne to the top of the training center just a few hours later: nary a mark on him. He has amazing recuperatinve powers.    In summary, I enjoyed the movie, but unless they become more creative with the plot and not just the stunts, this series is going to run out of steam.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I thought the movie was going to be also in spanish language what can we do about that?
0143034545|4.0|This book helped me think and examine the way I work again.  I can relate to those examples mentioned in the book. The book is like an advisor that gives you advice leading you into a more effective way of living. I think this book is OK.
0765318741|2.0|I wouldn't call this a novel, it's more of a novella with additional short stories. The book was a bit of a let down and the \\"buzz price\\" of $11 was not (IMHO) worth it.  Save your money and go see the movie..
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I had a friend long ago who wrote songs. He was PHD candidate in chemistry. He played the guitar and sang his songs for my wife and me in his tiny little apartment. He was a quiet little guy with a goofy grin. He had twice as many brains than I did and was very shy, so it was surprising that he opened up to me and let me hear his songs. This movie reminded me of that time. The movie showed the openness and intimacy songwriters have in playing their songs for an audience. The hoover shop where the guy musician worked with his father looked like vaccuum repair shops in Iowa. The apartments were the apartments of people who lived by scratching out a living. The movie seemed universal to me. My favorite moment in the movie was the scene when the couple first played together in the music shop. I thought it was electric.     The movie is about two lonely people from vastly different backgrounds whose music brought them together for a short time. I enjoyed it more than my wife did. She called it weird, but liked it. The movie was magical to me.
B000VZSEWA|4.0|This is not the same as NIN's other music. This is a positive and a negative.  It's positive in that Trent Reznor is an evolving musician.  It's negative if you are looking for something like his other discs, you will be disappointed.    I like it. There are a few catchy tunes. It's still Trent Reznor's distinctive style. It's not a regurgitation of what worked in the past.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A great program to watch! Amazing how videos are captured with super clarity from all angles. A must for all animal lovers to watch and to discover the other side of the animal's kingdom.
B000ESST6U|5.0|During a youtube journey, I stumbled across this Opus Arte production. Intrigued by the evoking video clip, I bought the DVD. The reviewers were correct with their praise and critique. In addition, I found the sublime team effort utterly impressive: the whole cast, the director and conductor inspired each other obviously in this lively energetic perfomance. Age differences and cultural background of the performers were remarkable merged on the stage along with the sweeping music beat. Although still young (some critique her voice),de Niese is already a big stage personality with a inspiring demaneour. I found the vision to present Handel like this very convincing. A refreshing performance, you will talk about.
B000GLKLCK|5.0|After trying various sets and individual concertos by Barenboim (II), Ashkenzay, Curzon, Anda and Uchida, this is my keeper. Perahia plays wonderfully (sample the slow movement of no. 15 K 450), the ECO always seem to be on the same wavelength as him and the sound is excellent. I've been listening to works from this set for months and consistently find myself absorbed by the music-making.
B0011EP0S6|5.0|When I saw that this movie was described as a musical I was not expecting to enjoy it. But because it was filmed in Dublin I agreed to watch it with my wife. Never judge a book by its cover, nor a DVD by the blurb written on the sleeve. This movie scales heights that are rarely found in any musical. Not only is it a plausible unconsummated love story but the songs and their music will delight even the hardest heart. I went out and bought the Collector's Edition soundtrack the next day. Don't miss out on this - buy it, rent it, steal it if you must, but see it and listen to it. Be amazed.
0736063684|4.0|The illustrations in the book are great, maybe a little too good for the younger crowd as there are some nude sketches. Aside from that, the book is indexed for each major muscle group and has caution page for each muscle group explaining possible injuries and how to avoid them.  Good book for the beginning weight lifter!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I have watched this movie for years on tv and finally I made the decision to own it so I can watch it whenever I wish to.  I love Judy Garland, while I don't care for all her works there are some that just stand out as super special, and this is one of them.  It also carries a special place in my heart since I am from St. Louis, and the songs are great from \\"Meet me in St.Louis\\" to \\"Have yourself a Merry Little xmas\\".  So now on a cold snowy day I can curl up on the Sofa and get warm fuzzies when I put this show on and think about \\"lovely Old St. Louis\\" in bygone days, when the newest and greatest was the Worlds Fair coming to town.
B000UBMZ4S|3.0|It was nice having all the versions of Riddly Scott's Sci-Fi classic \\"Brade Runner\\", all in one place.  It was very nice to have the Narrated version, which Riddly didn't like, but most fans prefer. (Harrison Ford's Narration was excellent.)<br /><br />My main complaint about this product, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I purchased the HD DVD version and I expected HD quality.  Though it was in HD format, the picture was as grainy as an average quality normal DVD formated movie...in fact I've seen less grainy normal DVD movies.  If you're going to port something over to HD format, enhance the qualtiy to take advantage of the improved resolution.  This film did not....I should have saved money and bought the non-HD version.
B000CNE092|5.0|Very good service.  Ordered for Christmas but due to late order, did not expect for Christmas but arrived the day before and was new, in excellent condition as ordered.
0143038583|5.0|This is the most outstanding book I have read this year on this subject.  Pollan is extraordinarily informative, sensible, expressive (often witty) and clearly addresses some of the most important issues in our daily lives---eating properly, taking care of ourselves and our families, broad-based environmental concerns and (not least) the political issues that inform current and past farming policy. Although he writes primarily about the US, what he says rings true to this ex-pat now living in England. We have similar problems here also.  I have read his gardening books in the past, which are delightful, but this book was a tour de force.  I am buying everything he writes from now on.
B000YMBBH0|2.0|I was excited to get the trilogy for my son, but when he opened it Christmas morning, he couldn't play it on his dvd player.  Until we get an hd dvd player, we will not be able to watch them...
B000VSBX34|5.0|This was a gift for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas.  We have watched HELP! so many times already and laugh and sing loudly every time.  It is funny, sweet; no sex, drugs or violence, good clean enjoyable film! And it goes without saying the best music EVER....Buy it and watch it soon! The reproduction is amazing!
0393316041|5.0|I have re-read this book at least a half dozen times, and always find it a fresh read. Too bad there are not enough teachers out there with is spirit and interest in not only 'finding things out' but in getting the students to think differently, to want to find how nature works.     His zany adventures growing up, during the war and thereafter are funny and irreverent , inspiring in their own way; there are serious moments in the book as well, pertaining to education, books, and the Challenger disaster.   If you enjoy this one, read Tuva or Bust as well.
B00005JPLW|5.0|i think this was the best movie of 2007 by far a great action flick and actually a good movie

A Highly recommended film and one should keep this set in his home library and the whole world will be in his HOME.BBC has took lot of pain to shoot this documentary for the mankind of Planet Earth.BEST DOCUMENTARY OF THIS CENTURY    Ashok Dave
B00006IU73|5.0|I'm a recent fan of Porcupine Tree, and I've finally found the Prog/Space/Rock/Metal I've always wanted. I now own several PT releases, but this one eclipses them all, at least right now, and depending on the day. At other times, another PT album is my favorite.<br /><br />Music is all about taste, so I don't bother with highly analytical reviews. It's about what the music makes me feel. The following things are certain, for me:<br />* the songwriting, musicianship, and production are complex and ingenius<br />* when this music is playing, I cannot ignore it or otherwise avoid listening<br />* after listening to this music, I don't want to hear anything else<br /><br />This music has softness, melancholy, heaviness, longing, shredding, and thoughtfulness throughout. If you like Prog/Space/Rock/Metal or can relate to anything I've written here, I defy you to be disappointed with this release.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|This version of Persuasian was at times silly (Anne running all over Bath looking for Wentworth - Oh Please... how un-Jane Austen can you get.) and unfaithful to the book.  The acting was pretty bad too....    The costumes were wonderful, so was the music.    The 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds was much better and was faithful to the book.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is a film for romantics of every age.  The music is gorgeous; the story is sweetly simple and poignant;  Warning!  The songs  cannot be erased from memory; I may have to buy a cd for my car, as a great love of mine recommended.  We're both 70, by the way.
B000LC4TJ0|5.0|Mozart's Figaro ranks high up there with the Magic Flute, Cosi and Don Giovanni. Add the wonderful list of singers/actors and the minimalistic sets that don't take away your attention on the music......you have the best production of this opera that I have seen.    Keep your eyes on the second cherubino!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Actually just finished watching this series for the first time recently and it is definitely a must watch.  Everything done to create Band of Brothers was done well and really gives you a great look a war and what war does to people.  It is not your typical \\"action, shoot-em-up\\" series, but a deeper look into the lives of the people fighting for a better future.  By the end of the series, you really get attached to the characters - and what is even better is that these accounts are based on real-life events.    I definitely plan on watching it again so I believe it is worth buying as far as re-watch value goes.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|With interest I watched the latest production of Persuasion, broadcast on Masterpiece (anybody know what happened to the word Theatre, PBS seems to have dropped it) in January. I was very disappointed, especially by the acting.    This version of Persuasion is still the best. Amanda Root does a wonderful job of going from someone that everyone ignores (but really desperately needs), to a woman who realizes her mistake at being \\"persuaded\\" to turn Capt Wentworth down 8 years earlier, to someone who makes amends. It takes just about the entire length of the movie for Amanda to speak up, but in the end she does.  Alas true love never goes away...     The cast is impressive, Amanda Root, Ciaran Hinds, Corin Redgrave, Phoebe Nicolls, Sam West, Sophie Thompson, Judy Cornwell, the late Susan Fleetwood to name a few, all fine actors and actresses.     My favorite part of the entire movie is the kiss near the end, it sums up the entire story....first hesitant,  then tender, then sweet - then at last.... surrender !
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It has a little bit of everything: comedy, drama, etc.  The setting and the theme are marvelous and make the movie even more enjoyable.  I've watched it more than a few times!  The idea of a married man and woman meeting at a resort and having an affair isn't so far fetched, but the idea of them agreeing to meet each year the same time is quite unique.  The casting for this movie was \\"right on.\\"  I'll watch it again and again!
B00004VVNB|4.0|This movie is OK for Sci-Fi. However, because there is no originality in Hollywood, the movie \\"The Island\\" with Ewan McGregor is a remake of this movie. \\"The Island\\" is so very similar, just an update of \\"Logan's Run\\". If you like originals, get this movie.
B000002ADT|5.0|Yes, this is absolutely brilliant album Miles' playing is divine and his cohorts are equally impressive...<br />And, since this album is owned by almost everyone who likes good music (including those who, as a rule, have no interest in jazz), I'd just like to suggest some other artists and some other brilliant jazz recordings to explore. Try it, you might like it.<br /><br />First there is a Jon Hendricks album with a vocal take on Miles' and his band's \\"Freddie Freeloader\\" (featuring other jazz singers), and then there are some other great, styllistically quite diverse stuff...<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000034UG Freddie Freeloader]] , [[ASIN:B000003N7R Duke Ellington & John Coltrane]] , [[ASIN:B000SQJ2H8 Count Basie at Newport]]<br />[[ASIN:B00004W1YV Ride, Red, Ride]] , [[ASIN:1452142726 Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Webster]], [[ASIN:B00020QYXA Jazz on a Summer's Day]], [[ASIN:B00000472M Pres and Teddy]], [[ASIN:B000002ADP Louis Armstrong Plays W.C.

B000VL9XE2|5.0|It's ironic how a band that's pushed the boundaries of heavy music time and again, gets shot down for doing it once again. I'm one of those fans who absolutely live for EVERY DEP release, who believes that Greg is the best frontman for the band, and that doesn't care that Chris Pennie has eloped with Coheed, as Gil Sharone is equal to, if not better than Chris anyway. People who cry for Mike Patton era Dillinger don't GET what this band is all about. As with all bands that's ever released more than one album, there will always be those fans who believe that the band \\"sold out\\", \\"lost their mojo\\" or \\"simply forgot how to make music\\" after the first release, but just like the band I don't care what they think. Nowadays it's relatively commonplace to have weird time signatures, vocal chord destroying vox and songs that ALL sound the same. Dillinger Escape Plan perfected it, and thankfully evolved and got smarter with every subsequent release. The heavy parts sound SO much heavier when interspersed with crooning, singing, noodling and whatever else these guys might come up with next. There's much more texture to the music because of it, and having Greg display the FULL range of his vocals is a personal highlight for me. Well done to DEP for keeping us on our toes and delivering their most accomplished and varied album to date. Yes, the EP's were awesome, and yes I still wear my Calculating Infinity shirt every week, but let's face it; no matter what the haters say, Miss Machine and Ire Works will go down as two of heavy music's greatest albums ever.
B00004VVND|4.0|If you saw \\"The Terminator\\", it began here. \\"Westworld\\" is really good and gave the people in Hollywood another movie idea to steal from. This is a great movie especially, if you like originals.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|As a filmmaker, I can appreciate the work that has gone into this fabulous series from the BBC. I loved it as it aired in HD on Discovery Channel, but find it that much more breathtaking on Blu-ray DVD. David Attenborough narrates instead of Sigorney Weaver. She must have been used just for the US telecast. Whether Weaver or Attenborough, this is a spectacular series filled with stunning images from space, helicopters, airballons, and on ground and sea, using state-of-the-art cameras including some 1000 frames per second scenes and motion control systems. The producers went out of their way to capture rare sights and little known creatures. If you have an HDTV, this series is a must-have in HD, and Blu-ray leads the way. Amazon had the best price anywhere!
B000YPUF9W|4.0|This was a great 3rd part, I thought it was just as good as the first two the acting,story and special effects was great looking forward to the 4th installment.......Enjoy.
B00005JPXY|3.0|\\"Cloverfield\\" is about equal parts 9/11, \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", with the latter providing the technical model, the center film providing the manifest content, and 9/11 providing the questions that are put forward and left unanswered by the film.<br /><br />If you haven't heard, \\"Cloverfield\\" is the story of a group of 20-something Manhattanites whose late night party is spoiled by the arrival of a monster in New York that goes around killing people, knocking over tall buildings, collapsing bridges and wrecking things a la Godzilla.<br /><br />The production is cleverly modeled after Blair Witch Project, with the entire 90 minutes of goings on filmed by a hand held camera. The computer-generated scenes of monsters, wreckage and the headless Statue of Liberty (check out the scene that comes up with this title) are all done very well. I doubt they took the computer-generated scenes then filmed them a second time with a moving camera to get the ship on the rolling seas affect; it was compelling however completed.<br /><br />The narrative story is full of exciting moments, one of which -- a moment where the hero has saved a damsel in distress and escapes midst up close warfare between the giant and the military -- left my heart pounding and my breathing accelerated when quiet returned in the theatre. The sound effects also work to the advantage of this actioner, which won't be very cogent when you see it on your television unless you have a screen at least 60 inches across.<br /><br />The storyline, as we know from films just like this one made half a century ago, isn't about an actual monster; it's about the war on terror. Just like the dinosaur that invaded New York in the 1953 sci-fi classic, \\"The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms\\" -- which was a metaphor for communism -- the monster that invades New York this time is the reincarnation of the 9/11 terrorists come for a return visit.<br /><br />That beast from the 1950s was killed by the military and we were all saved from the ravages of communism. Here, the outcome is less clear. Because of the way the story is told, it is clear in the filmmakers mind that terrorists are winning this war, or at least making a dent in our way of life. Because of the way the movie ends, it is unclear if they think we (members of the good old U.S.A.) are making headway against our 21st century worldwide adversary.<br /><br />Even without the metaphor, \\"Cloverfield\\" is an exciting afternoon at the theatre and, for people prone to seasickness, a wild and dizzying ride. If you choose to see this film, and discount the supplementary metaphor, this movie won't make much sense and will leave you frustrated. When you put all the parts together, you'll see it's a contemporary story told pretty well in the clothes worn a half-century in our past.. Here, the outcome is less clear.

B00028HBKM|4.0|Don't listen to the liberal Arthur's review below. He's your typical left wing smear merchant who flood amazon's reviews and slam Christians and President Bush. So, disregard all the 1 star reviews by the left wing loons and read this. They provide no evidence and only throw out labels and name's. A typical Left Wing Tactic.    This movie is as close as a movie has ever been made to what really happened to Jesus Christ. The movie is good. I say anyone at the age of puberty should see it. It's true, straight from the Gospels and some of the Old Testament, with some info from the Catholic Church to give it some more story which probably did happen or was consistant with what did happen.     Now for my 2 gripes...Jesus was nailed through the wrist, not the hands. I figured that Mel Gibson would have got that right with all the research he did. My second gripe is for all the 2 hours of blood and gore, which was necessary, there is no reward at the end. It just ends abruptly. There should have been a bit more, or a prequel and a sequel. Watching this film one would learn nothing about Jesus except he was crucified. You need to go in with some knowledge of History regarding God.     So, it's a must see, right along with 'Jesus' starring Jeremy Sisto, which is to this day the best account and up to date movie about Jesus life.    Oh, and this movie grossed 10 times more than it should have thanks to the left wing media slamming it left and left. BACKFIRE! LOL
B000UBMWG4|4.0|You either love this movie or hate it. Very few people have ever said they just liked it. I loved it and the complete set on Blu-ray just made it all that much more enjoyable. Having the 5 different versions and all of the behind the scene work is really great. This movie had so many innovations and set so many standards that are still followed to this day. If you loved the movie, you will not be disappointed with this one.
0743454529|5.0|I realy enjoyed the book a lot. It is the first book I read from Jodi Picoult and will for sure not be the last one. I read it with the speed of the light and left a lot of thinking behind. Wonderfull story with a lot of pertinent questions. What would I do as a parent, if i was in the same situation as the one apearing in the book. What is the right thing to do...
B000K15VSA|5.0|This is a great movie for starters, but when they decided to re-release it with a ton of extras I was excited, but they also included the long out of distribution version where Harrison Ford has a narration...this to me made it an ultimate purchase!  To get all the goodies I speak of you must purchase the 5 disc set, but it is worth it...it comes in a very cool spy suitcase with the title on the outside...and inside has many collector lithographs along with descriptions of what is on each disc and background information...don't miss out on this one!
B000N3ST7A|5.0|We had a chance to listen to Crystal Visions and I really enjoyed hearing Stevie all over, she is a really great singer and now we have most of the favorite songs together. We had some friends over for New Years Eve and it was good to listen and say which songs were favorite.  My husband is a fan forever and really had a good time listening, he always remembers Stevie Nicks at Red Rocks in Colorado and how he can't forget hearing her sing.
B000W1V5VU|4.0|entertaining action film continuing the \\"ocean's\\" latest series. don't need another.  liked matt damon in this.
1416523359|5.0|I rather enjoyed this more simple of King's novels.<br />It was a pleasant read.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|excellent action film continuing the Jason Bourne series.  hope there will be a fourth.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|One of my all time favorite albums growing up.  I burned through my parents' cassette copy of this, but for some reason didn't buy it on CD until a few months ago.  I'm glad I waited, as the reissue sounds dynamite.  Of course, anything probably would, after the years of abuse that cassette took.  I've always been a fan of the folk-acoustic genre and Simon and Garfunkel are at the top of their game here on their last release.  The title track is starkly beautiful, the vocals passionate.  \\"Cecilia\\", \\"Keep the Customer Satisfied\\", and \\"Baby Driver\\" are all up-tempo acoustic rockers.  \\"El Condor Pasa\\" is a wonderful folk ballad with traditional instrumentation.  Their cover of the Everly Brothers' \\"Bye Bye Love\\" is very well done and is probably the weakest song here.  The ballads \\"So Long Frank Lloyd Wright\\" and \\"The Only Living Boy in New York\\" are both well written, with an air of melancholy.  \\"New York\\" in particular always seemed to sum up the whole experience of living.  And those heavenly background vocals!  \\"Why Don't You Write Me\\" is very catchy as well.  There's not a bad song to be found here.<br /><br />Still, the mainstay for me, the song I listened to over and over, was \\"The Boxer\\".  The excellent arpeggiated guitar part that opens it, the seen it all lyrics, the drumbeat that accompanies the haunting \\"li-la-li\\" choruses.  Even in the years between when the cassette gave up the ghost and I purchased the CD, I still knew the lyrics of \\"The Boxer\\" by heart.  An amazing song and an amazing album.
B000UPSKO8|5.0|Stunning performances. Netrebko is, of course, brilliant. A boring stage and lack of decorations is compensated by extremely good DTS sourround sound. Your neighbours might not like this DVD as much as you will.
B000000WJ2|5.0|Keith boasts on \\"Wicked As It Seems\\" from Main Offender.  The best album the Stones never made, it's better than anything they've put out in over a decade.  Keith shows why his half of the Jagger-Richards tandem is the strongest with these ten solid tracks.  The recent Stones' albums have suffered from excess, in that some of the weaker material isn't pared out, often to the detriment of the entire album.  Conversely, this album is like a concise sucker-punch to the gut.  Rockers like the explosive \\"999\\" and the sly \\"Wicked As It Seems\\" share space with the acoustic ballad \\"Demon\\", possibly the best such song since \\"Wild Horses\\".  Keith's other influences shine here as well, most notably the Motown soul of \\"Hate It When You Leave\\" and the reggae number \\"Words of Wonder\\".  \\"Eileen\\" is a spirited number in the manner of Happy\\".  \\"Yap Yap\\" is a wry song about an overly-loquacious female friend.  \\"Runnin Too Deep\\" and \\"Will But You Won't\\" are both riff heavy mid-tempo rockers.<br /><br />Say what you will about Keith's voice, but it fits the material here in a way that a more polished instrument would not.  Keith's band is both tight and loose all at the same time and brings a level of urgency to these songs that a Stones' album hasn't had for quite some time.
B000K15VSA|5.0|The Blade Runner 5-Disc Collector's Edition is exactly what I was looking for.  I've wanted the Original Cut for about 20 years and it's nice to finally have it along with the other versions and the Final Cut.    The product comes in a very nice presentation case and would make a great gift.  Additionally, Amazon has the best price - you can't go wrong buying this collection.
B000000WGL|4.0|While Mick Jagger was busy making lousy records and even lousier movies during the Stones' late 80s' breakup, Keith Richards made this album with a group he called The X-Pensive Winos.  Neither Stone would enjoy the commercial success they enjoyed in the band, but Keith won the critical battle easily.  This album, featuring the Winos as well as guest stars like Bootsy Collins and Bernie Worrell, went back to the roots of what the Stones were all about, great rock and roll songs with R&B leanings.  Check out the wonderful \\"Locked Away\\" and the incredible duet with Sara Dash, \\"Make No Mistake\\".  There's rockabilly on \\"I could Have Stood You Up\\", a little funk on \\"Big Enough\\" and plenty of attitude on \\"Whip It Up\\" and \\"Take It So Hard\\".  This album was a great return to \\"The Human Riff's\\" roots and a statement on just who the talent is in the Jagger-Richards partnership.
B000MRAAJW|3.0|My brand new version of this came with major scratches on 2 of the discs.
0887081770|4.0|this book is very small - about 5\\" x 7\\". the pages unfold in creative ways and the story is cute. beautiful illustrations.
B000VR824S|5.0|An astonishing pack of performances from three generations of blues players.  I particularly enjoyed seeing Winwood and Clapton together again, playing the Blind Faith songs that I remember from my teenaged years - but now with more guts.  In addition, there were inspiring performances from John Mayer and Tal Wilkenfeld - wonderful young musicians who (if they stay clean) are fully capable of carrying on the tradition for the next 40 years.  If you are into 60's blues and rock, this DVD will make you very happy for 4 hours, and for another 4 hours if you play it again.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|this CD is great, a couple of songs i skip over but all in all this CD was worth the money, it's fun and a little 80's-wannabe...in a fresh way.
009917331X|5.0|There can be no argument that Richard P Feynman was a genius. He has been a hero of mine since I was very young, probably because my father also greatly admires him and spoke to me about Feynman and his unique personality from time to time.    There are some great stories in this book and they will make you laugh out loud. Feynman was always so full of life and he was curious about absolutely everything from a very early age. He would always want to know, \\"How does that work?\\" or \\"Why is that the way it is?\\" or \\"Is there another way to do that?\\" He would also latch onto something and decide that he wanted to do it, and to do it really well. For example, witnessing the bongo-playing in Brazil inspired him to learn to play like that and not like some studio-taught purist. He achieved it through dedication to his objective and sheer passion.    What made Feynman a genius? Well, there were lots of factors that contributed to his status, many of them discussed in other reviews of this book, but, my reason for putting him into that classification was that he was capable of explaining the most complex of matters to a five-year-old. That is TRUE genius.    I have read this book many times. It is a short book and will remain amongst my collection until the day that I die. If you haven't read it already, you should. You really need to read this book. I can guarantee that it will change at least one aspect of your life!
B000S9C8M6|3.0|Sirenia's new album had a lot of hype surrounding it that got me interested; a few test tracks and I was sold. I got the album itself for Christmas, and was very disappointed. Each track follows functionally the same construction as every other, with a few exceptions. The production values are high, but the lyrics are cheesy and, at times, banal. Their new singer has the chops, but their songwriting needs work.
0375704027|5.0|This is my first experience with Murakami, so I can't compare it to anything else written by him, but from what I understand, it's quite different from many of his other novels. I've heard that there's a bizarre aspect to quite a few of his books that's not so prevalent in this one. This book is mainly a love story and a quite beautiful and tragic one at that. It's set in Tokyo and other parts of Japan in the 60's and follows a young college student by the name of Toru who is in love with Naoko, the girlfriend of his best friend who died in an accident a few years back. There relationship begins with silent walks around Japan, both of them recalling thoughts in their own minds of their pasts with their lost friend and their relationship eventually blooms into something more than just a friendship. But a night of intimacy with Toru reveals a tortured side to Naoko and she leaves Tokyo to examine her life and her problems. They exchange letters back and forth leaving Toru unsure of where anything is going between him and Naoko and he isolates himself, retreating even from the one amazing, unique girl that he's met, Midori, who's willing to do anything to be with him.    This is not a happy book, but it's a beautiful book, a serene book. The Japanese have a true gift in their story telling that echoes in aspects of their culture. I always get a sense of peace when I'm reading a Japanese novel or short story and this was no exception. As tragic and lost as these characters seemed at times, I always saw hope for them, always had a vision of calm. This is a book that will definitely pull at your heartstrings and draw you into the characters. Murakami really has a gift for making his characters real. I kept thinking that this must be somewhat autobiographical of his own experiences in the 60's, but the afterword says that it is not at all, that he actually had quite a boring life in the 60's and put nothing of himself in this novel. If that's true, he's extremely perceptive of other people.    It's also been said that this is the most erotic of his novels, and there are quite a few sex scenes in here and they're extremely voyeuristic. This goes back to him making this such a personal book. At first I thought that the dialogue was really awkward during the sex scenes and it was going to be a complaint of mine, but then I realized that what was awkward was just the fact that he was including sexual dialogue where I didn't expect it...it was reality and a real intimate look into these characters lives.    This book was extremely well written and a great introduction to Murakami in my opinion and I'd definitely recommend it as a starting point to anyone else looking to pick something up by him. It's also only 296 pages which is short compared to many of his other books! I think I'll read Kafka on the Shore next.
B000URDEB0|4.0|First, a word to the diehard - I was a fan of Tarja, I am a fan of Anette.  I don't judge music based on band composition or drama.    Moving on, Dark Passion Play is a fantastically solid new move for Nightwish, stylistically; they maintain their dramatic, symphonic quality and add to their repetoire of darker themes and melodies.  A few of the songs were disappointingly vanilla, or just plain badly constructed (Bye Bye Beautiful, For the Heart I Once Had), but these are more than outweighed by the fantastic symmetries of Sahara, 7 Days to the Wolves, and Amaranth.  Songs like The Islander are also very interesting and while not strictly metal complement the rest of the album nicely.
0553381695|5.0|this book is quite an epic! It's the second book in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series and picks up where A Game of Thrones left off. I read A Game of Thrones last year and believe it or not, I actually got through this one faster. That's by no means attributed to it being a dull read, it's not a dull read in the least bit...but it's mighty involved.    This series is certainly considered high fantasy, but as I said in my review of A Game of Thrones, it broke the barriers of what I thought high fantasy to be. I've always seen high fantasy as focusing mainly on the quest or the war and not so much on the characters. Martin balances these aspects of the stories perfectly and creates an amazing cast of characters that are all intricately carved. He's created some of my favorite characters in modern fantasy, Daenerys, mother of dragons, Bran, a young heir to a king who is disabled and unable to walk, Jon Snow, a bastard child of a king removed from his siblings and serving with others who have been stripped from their families, and Arya, the daughter of a king who defies gender boundaries and seeks to make a name for herself. For those who have read this, can you tell I like the Starks?    A Clash of Kings picks up as a war between four kings is beginning. The war will decide who is the one true ruler of the Seven kingdoms. There are tensions between the many families involved and even tighter tensions within some of the families involved. There is treachery, betrayal, sorcery, jealousy. It really is a thrilling ride. Each family is willing to stop at nothing to claim what they think is their right to the throne and no family is willing to form a truce or share a throne. Whatever chance there was a peace is slowing being destroyed by the atrocities committed out of spite and anger for past crimes.    Each chapter begins with a characters name and the chapter focuses on that characters story line, though other characters' storylines' interweave within thechapters. I love this way of telling the story and it works perfectly for this series. His characters are created so well that there really wasn't a single character whose chapters I didn't look forward to. Though there were some that I would be more excited about than others.    I also loved the scenery, the battle scenes, the cultures, the history, the castles, the food, the palaces...all of this stuff that he created. He put so much detail, description and effort into this series. Really an excellent job.    Martin's writing just amazes me. As I read this book I just remained amazed by the enormous task of putting something of this scale together. He's a genius writer and this is really becoming one of my favorite series out there. And there's dragons in it now :) If you're a fan of fantasy books and haven't read these books, I highly recommend that you pick these up. I'd consider them a must read even if you don't think you like high fantasy...I certainly didn't think I would. I'll be reading book 3, A Storm of Swords soon, though not right away. I need a break from these massive books.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|The 20th Anniversary Remaster of THE JOSHUA TREE is great. I remember being asked for a dance to the original version of this album in the 90s at a party with my program in Connecticut, and the sound of the band, especially the rhythm section, was so ill-defined that I'm surprised the young woman who asked me didn't get told by her staff to \\"quit being pushy\\", so poorly mastered was this album. Fortunately, everything's been fixed up so that you can now hear a rich, fully-defined sound as U2 meant it to be heard. Larry's drums and Adam's bass are especially well-defined, but The Edge's guitar and Bono's vocals also benefit from the improvements. This album, along with its predecessor, THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, inspired my belief that the reason Sarah Michelle Gellar is so slender is because G-d made her that way rather than due to an eating disorder. If the original version of this CD didn't inspire that belief, or encourage families to settle their differences, hopefully this version will.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|2 of 2 people found the following review helpful:   Stunning Performances by the principals., Jan 3 2008  By  Hazel Smith (Sudbury, Ontario, Canada) - See all my reviews       I saw the HD presentation in 2007 and was so impressed that I went back for the encore two weeks later. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that the Met would get a dvd of the production out so fast. I pre-ordered 2 copies the minute it was advertised. I am a devoted fan of Renee Fleming and she didn't disappoint; nor did Dmitri Hvorostovsky. Ramon Vargas was in excellent voice. The setting(for me) emphacized the isolation of the Russian steppe-vast landscape with few people. The ballroom scenes, with chairs hemming everyone in, seemed to symbolize the constrictions of conventional society. I know some people objected to the minimalist nature of the sets, but they worked for me and underlined some important facets of the opera. Aside from the glorious singing and acting, I loved watching Valery Gergiev conduct. The bonus features backstage were great. Thanks to Robert Carsen for another fabulous production. I've watched my dvd twice already. I just can't get enough of the \\"letter scene\\", the \\"polonaise\\", or the final duet. Enjoy!!!!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|In one word - excellent! Amazing value for the price. I bought this for my PS3 blu-ray player, and the images are stunning. Even more stunning is the sound quality (if you use Dolby 5.1ch). I now believe switching to blu-ray was worth it!
1594200823|5.0|The mark of a great book is that on top of great writing and engaging subject matter is its impact on people's lives.  Given that criteria, this is a great book.  I read it several months ago and it has stayed with me when I make food choices for myself and my family.  It's actually changed how I eat and how I think about food.  Put into context I worked as an engineer in the food and bevera ge industry for over a decade and during that time I thought I was well-educated with respect to the ingredients that go into processed, organic, and sustainable foods, but Mr. Pollan taught me quite a bit more and actually showed me the impact of my choices.<br /><br />His research into corn was perhaps the most enlightening and disturbing.  That we've turned what ought to be a diverse diet into one predominated by processing this single crop is troubling.  That our diet is poisoning us and producing obesity in waves isn't coincidental.  High Fructose Corn Syrup revolutionized processed foods, but not all revolution is good, it's just change. We use it in everything as the all-purpose sweetening ingredient. The more HCFC used, the more unhealthy the product.  Corn feed used for cattle, poultry, and pigs produces meat that's mostly corn and much less healthy than when animals grazed on grasses, rooted, and ate nuts and seeds.  Pollan got me thinking about the amount of corn we consume and that we really need more diversity to be healthy.<br /><br />The next great discovery in this volume was the importance of grass farming.  In short, Pollan explores a particular farm, Polyface Farms - owned by Joel Salatin - which uses traditional grass farming techniques.  Animals graze through the pastures in cycles that mimic those of a natural biota - where pigs or cattle dig up the ground, birds come through behind them and feast on the bugs, seeds and worms, and all of their excrement fertilizes the ground and the grains grow healthy.  All together this diversity produces a reasonable amount of calories per acre when compared with single-crop industrial agriculture, but with the benefit of increasing soil richness rather than depleted it and bathing it in destructive chemicals.  I'm now a believer, Mr. Pollan did his job well.<br /><br />The book goes on to discuss the arguments for and against vegetarianism, which I felt to be a balanced discussion, but not the strength of the book.<br /><br />His final meal - one hunted and gathered was interesting and more anecdotal pleasure than informative - a really good story in other words.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone interested in food, health, and understanding where our collective diet's gone wrong.<br /><br />- CV Ricks per acre when compared with single-crop industrial agriculture, but with the benefit of increasing soil richness rather than depleted it and bathing it in destructive chemicals.

B0009SS00A|1.0|Dan Brown is a great author.  His books after this one were fun, fast, and the example of a \\"page tuner\\".<br /><br />Like many people when I find a discover author that I like I devour the books they have written.  In this Case I wish I'd missed this one.  Mr. Brown must have thought the public was stupid as he gives the bad guy up in the first 50 pages.<br /><br />While writing about the best code breakers in the world and telling us what they look for, he gives his bad guy with the most simple \\"code\\" for the reader to discover.<br />I do look forward to his new book but I am done with his early stuff.<br />Digital fortress is a great example why publishers avoid first books.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|I will not say this is the worst movie I have seen all year.  It, in fact, is the worst movie I have seen in many years! What were they smoking when they made this? If you like looking through little peep holes, if you like not having a plot to a movie, if you like not having the characters introduced, if you like watching a twenty year old play a physicist - not to mention the other twenty year olds pretending to have intelligence somewhere behind their lifeless eyes and extremely poor acting ability- then you may like this movie. It in fact made no sense at all.    You are thrown on a 'ship' that you concur is near the sun. Why and what they are doing really is never established. They 'discover' (again not established really how or why) a previous ship that failed in its mission. Do they continue with the course they are ordered to follow, considering the fact they only have enough food, fuel and supplies to complete this particular mission?  Oh, heck no. They are supposed to convince you they are heroes of some sort, but fail in their accomplishment of this.       We shut off the sound the last fifteen minutes and looked for another movie we wanted to watch. We hoped that somewhere, at some point, we would discover a 'surprise' that would bring it all together and make the first forty minutes of torture worthwhile to have indured. But, alas, this was not to be. The movie simply was as bad at the middle, end and beginning.     Save your money,time and patiene from being pushed to the limit. Watch something else.
0446530573|5.0|I am Italian and consider myself an excellent cook. I was thrilled to find the recipes in this cookbook to be so authentic. The Sunday Gravy could've been my recipe. It is how I was taught by my mother and my grandmother ! We have always made our own pasta and zeppoles and our family recipes match or come very close to the recipes in the book. I bought 3 more to save them for my own 3 daughters for future use. This is definitely a must-have book if you like authentic Italian cooking!
076781214X|3.0|Peggy Sue (Kathleen Turner) is facing the prospect of her 25th high school reunion.  Making it even worse, she and her husband, high school sweetheart Charlie Bodell (Nicolas Cage) are in the middle of a divorce because Peggy Sue has finally gotten tired of his affairs.  And so she shows up with her daughter Beth (Helen Hunt).<br /><br />Things are actually going well until Charlie shows up.  Then Peggy Sue wins homecoming queen.  It's all too much for her, and she faints.<br /><br />When she comes too, Peggy Sue finds herself back in 1960.  She's eighteen again and reliving the last few months of high school.  Between panic attacks about what this could mean, she tries to grasp her second chance at her life.  Can she avoid the last 25 years of pain?  Does she really want to?<br /><br />The movie walks a fine line between comedy and drama and never quite seems to strike the right balance.  There are some very funny bits, but those just make the drama seem more over the top and over wrought.  And the comedy is stuff we've seen done elsewhere better many other times.<br /><br />The cast features a number of early performances from actors better known today.  Besides the ones already mentioned, we see Jim Carrey and Joan Allen, for example.  Most of the cast is fine.  My biggest problem was with Nicolas Cage. For some reason, he gives Charlie a weird nasally voice.  Frankly, it makes me wonder what Peggy Sue ever saw in him.  On the plus side, he gets to show off his excellent singing voice.<br /><br />Finally, there's the story.  It works.  But it is left too open ended.  That's probably caused by an ending that is way too abrupt to deal with everything brought up.  It asks all kinds of questions, but the answers are thrown at us so fast it doesn't really explain how the characters arrived at them.  As a result, the ending goes from being open ended to unsatisfactory.<br /><br />The movie isn't bad, but it's really not good either.  It's certainly fun watching if you are a fan of the current work of this young cast.  But if you haven't seen it, you haven't really missed much, either..  But if you haven't seen it, you haven't really missed much, either.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have never really been into period pieces, they just didn't interest me.  I DVR Masterpiece Theatre mainly to be able to watch the Prime Suspect series.  I had Jane Eyre on my DVR for about a month after the series finished and decided to give it a try.  Within the first ten minutes I was just amazed. I have never read a Charlotte Bronte novel.  Never seen any of her books made into movies.  This just blew me away.  Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens were amazing.  The younger actress who played Jane as a child really had me feeling every bit of torment she went through.  No spoilers here for any who haven't seen it, but this is definitely one DVD I plan to own and watch over and over again.  Thumbs up to BBC and PBS for this amazing film.

B000VDDDVO|5.0|Great, classic movie. Too bad movie writers today do not have, or use, the talent to write movies with such great story lines and acting rather than appealing to the sensual and violent. Enjoyed the colorized version.
B000K15VSA|5.0|For any fan of this film the five-disc collector's edition is a must have as it contains every version of the movie that is currently available (the workprint version being exclusive to this edition).  The briefcase is quite sturdy and contains nice artwork and a lenticular film clip.  The unicorn and Spinner car replica are very 'plasticy' and as a result feel cheap and appear easily breakable.  Both would have benefitted from being manufactured from a metal of some sort to prolong their life.  Don't let the low quality of these two items put you off purchasing this however as the real quality lies in the DVDs and a truely ultimate Blade Runner experience.

B00009UW0N|5.0|When Jamie Lee opens the door to the bedroom and finds her friend dead on the bed next to Judith Myer's headstone, it still sends chills after all these years. Purchased this 2-disc collector's DVD for my wife who is a rabid Halloween fan and it doesn't disappoint. Packaging is decent and includes a 14 page story booklet. Divimax HD transfer is very good, and the 2.35:1/16:9 aspect preserves what Carpenter wanted & reveals side-screen material you may have missed watching the annual 4:3 old-school TV broadcast versions. The 5.1 audio makes a big difference and adds great realism. After the feature, we watched the audio commentary vesion: we learned alot about the production, but John C., Jamie L.C. & Debra H.(producer) had a tendency to go way off course on the commentary and it becomes very long-winded as you watch and hear very little of the movie itself.<br /><br />The bonus disc is great and includes an interesting and enlightening 87min documentary, as well as a 10min featurette re-visting the original Michael Myers house (I won't spoil & tell you where it really is), the original TV & radio spots, trailers, pics & bios and some DVD-rom features including 2 screensavers and the entire screenplay in .pdf format.<br /><br />There have been so many sequels (some ok, most really bad) to this film, but this one remains the classic must-have.
B00006JKOM|5.0|An excellent concept album with just a couple of mediocre tunes. The bulk of the mix is Ian Anderson at his poetic best. I enjoyed the added tunes from the original release on vinyl, particularly the very Broadway, 'Small Cigar'.
0143034901|4.0|I feel like this book did a great job of creating an accesable bridge between literature and trashy bestseller.  This guy can write, and has a truly great style.  Sadly the plot is cheesy and unbelevable, yet interesting enough to keep any reader on their toes.  I think its a good alternative to much of the crap that hits the bestsellers lists.

0767812166|5.0|Starman  DVD<br /><br />This film is simply impossible not to like. Jeff Bridges is unforgettable as an alien from an incomparably advanced race who is stranded on Earth (after taking human form) and seeking to return to his own civilization, and his excellent performance as such earned him an Oscar nomination. He really gets into the role, and plays it to perfection. His gestures and mannerisms as the alien trying to understand human beings are uncannily plausible. Karen Allen is also superb in her role as an ordinary human being caught up in the struggle between Bridges, seeking to escape the Earth, and those darned nasty Big Government agents who fear the alien and seek to capture and destroy him.<br />There are few special effects in the movie, and none are needed--this is a movie that gets through by sheer excellent storytelling and wonderful acting by Bridges and Allen. It manages to be touching without being sappy, and although our human government is viewed as being narrow-minded and overly paranoid, the alien in the end forms a high and joyous opinion of mankind, which I found uplifting and optimistic.<br />Well worth watching and owning.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Science Fiction fans.<br /><br />Gunner January, 2008
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Many people have been giving these Masterpiece Theatre movies bad reviews, and I can almost understand why. I watched Northanger Abbey last night, and I was very pleased, as it was quite like the book, and very interesting, opposed to the BBC version in which you almost fall asleep of the bore. The characters had depth and it was very well acted. Kathy and Henry make a great couple, Henry being up there with Bingley, Darcy, (and, from Elizabeth Gaskell's books,) 'Hamley', and Thornton. Kathy is very loveable and innocent, especially when it comes to Isabella.  (Just one quick note of WARNING! For younger children, there is one scene with Isabella and Captain Tilney that is not in the book, but is after the fact, and is on the edge.)  I really enjoyed this movie and would advise all to see it, all women, that is.   +Though reading the bad reviews for my favorite Austen book, Mansfield Park, I intend to watch and hopefully to enjoy it, when it airs.+
0143038419|5.0|I don't understand what all the negative reviews are about. I truly loved this book. I think these people are too critical and need to lighten up. I could hardly put the book down. I thought it was funny, light hearted, and an interesting adventure. I could see many people, including myself, fitting into situations she wrote about. If you want an easy and fun read, and learn a few things along the way, read this book!

0743486285|5.0|I LOVE this book!! It's complicated to read because it's in diary form and these are the thoughts of someone in the middle of a drug induced psychosis. It's a great insight for fans of Nikki Sixx and Motley Crue. The book brought back alot of memories because I have been a fan since those years of excess. Even if you aren't a fan, it's an amazing look at the effects of drugs on the human mind, body and soul.

B000UCEJEQ|3.0|Songs of Mass Destruction burns with the usual Annie Lennox fervour. Her voice has darkened in timbre, and she can no longer hit her upper register with the ease she once did. But her voice is so singular that it makes the material worth listening to no matter what she is singing. Unfortunately, Glenn Ballard's overtly  commercial production sterilizes them songs which makes many of the sound no different than the latest Madonna or Beyonce product. Several stellar tracks,( Dark Road, Love is Blind, Smithereens and Ghosts in my  Machine) coupled with Lennox's expressive alto make for a worthwhile listen overall. While Annie's glorious voice is always worth listening to, much of Songs of Mass Destruction isn't.
B000T7FO6E|3.0|Ringo Starr has released almost as many concert albums as he has studio recordings.  But the 2007 LIVE AT SOUNDSTAGE, to my knowledge, is only Starr's second live release with his band the Roundheads; his other concert C.D.s came from the All-Starr tours he's done since 1989.<br /><br />Ringo and the Roundheads did this live show in 2005, which was their eighth year writing and recording together.  The relationship shows, as LIVE AT SOUNDSTAGE offers crackerjack versions of \\"Octopus's Garden,\\" \\"Boys,\\" \\"I'm The Greatest,\\" \\"With A Little Help From My Friends,\\" \\"I Wanna Be Your Man,\\" \\"Choose Love\\" and \\"Photograph.\\"  The last band with whom Ringo Starr recorded for eight years was the Beatles.<br /><br />In fact, the LIVE AT SOUNDSTAGE take of \\"I'm The Greatest\\" shows Ringo Starr's sense of humor rubbing off on the Roundheads: The lyrics have Starr singing, \\"I'm only 32,\\" his age when he recorded the song three decades earlier.  But for this 2005 rendition, the Roundheads reply, \\"plus 32\\" when Ringo, age 64, sings that line.<br /><br />I have seen several Ringo Starr shows and LIVE AT SOUNDSTAGE is the fourth of his concert albums I own.  Has Starr ever sung all the words to \\"It Don't Come Easy,\\" his post-Beatles signature song?  He seems to regularly omit the \\"Forget about the past and all your sorrows\\" and \\"Open up your heart, let's come together\\" parts, instead singing the \\"Peace remember peace\\" part two extra times.  I don't ask for much, I only want all the words to Starr's greatest composition.<br /><br />This long-time Ringo Starr fan would still like live recordings of \\"Oh My My,\\" \\"Only You,\\" \\"Goodnight Vienna,\\" and \\"In My Car.\\"  I am not even sure if Starr has ever performed those songs in concert.  But then, he's only 32, plus 32.
0440238609|2.0|Having viewed many reviews which comment, positively or negatively, on Pullman's anti-theistic intent or the heavy-handed allegory, I find myself puzzled -- puzzled because so many people are taking so poorly plotted a series seriously. If the man could write, I might take delight whatever notion of the cosmos he was inclined to offer, especially since his fantasy offered a pre-adolescent girl at its center -- just the sort of item to appeal to my own daughter.     I enjoyed the movie. I opened the first book, and found myself somewhat taken by Lyra and pleasantly amused by Pullman's fantasy world. Then he began concocting his plot -- evidently by adding a new world, a new invention, or a new type of character at every whim or every onset of writer's block. Thus perils without evident cause and rescues from without (the literary flaw known as the 'Deus ex Machina')abound, compound, and multiply.     There happens to be an armoured bear ... who happens to be rightful king of the bears ... there happens to be a balloonist ... Ms. Coulter happens to show up at the precise moment to rescue Lyra from seperation. All these coincidences appeared in the first book, and I forgave them as I forgave them in the movie.     Then I reached the second book with the coincidences multiplying in the fashion of tribbles in heat. As Will met Lyra in the universe of the conveniently dead, I stopped reading -- hurling recriminations at the author. I picked up the book again, a few days later, and completed the series -- I wanted to read what happened.     When I reached the third book's anti-climactic arrival and death of the churchly assassin, I managed nothing more than a slight shake of the head. By this time I knew well that resolution would always come from the author's intervening hand.    I won't comment on the disappointing ending, except to note that it was in one fashion foreshadowed -- by that time I was fully cognizant that Pullman would resort to at least five illogical andunanticipated twists to offer his final point.     It is a shame that a writer who could fashion such an interesting character as Lyra should prove incapable of walking her across the street without revealing his own hand thumping across his keyboard. After the movie, I was hoping for much more. I was hoping for a series worth the time my daughter is devoting to her reading of it.
0553805460|3.0|Reading \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" is, in some respects, akin to engaging in one of the drug binges Mr. Belfort so adeptly, albeit redundantly, describes in his self-serving but humorous depiction of that type of guy those losers out here (i.e. us -mostly- law abiding and taxpaying citizens) love to loath but often secretly wish to emulate.  While you know better, you just can't put it down until you crash -- and glance through the set up for his inevitable sequel.  Perhaps \\"The Shark of Hollywood\\"?  Mr. Belfort's tale is a long (too long?) exercise in self-indulgement; it is also at times wickedly funny.  Although the writing is largely mediocre and riddled with clichés, his vivid descriptions of his family members, associates and others who crossed his path paint a \\"Norman Rockwell on acid\\" pastoral of the cultural wasteland that is Long Island, NY, both WASP and Jewish enclaves alike, and the morally destitute universe of off Wall Street. [nB. The reviewer is from a comparable wasteland, New Jersey, and is a corporate lawyer so there's no stone throwing].  The dialogue between Mr. Belfort and these characters is often remarkable.  On the downside, Mr. Belfort obviously embellishes and has an annoying tick of trying to show all the ways in which he was (is?) really, deep down, a decent guy who just spun out of control.  (Notably ridiculous is the scene where his angry but silent chauffeur confesses how much he actually admires \\"J.B.\\")  Mr. Belfort, as described in his book, was not, whether on the surface or deep down, a decent guy.  (Indeed he has very little to say about the folks who ultimately lost investments in securities which Mr. Belfort's firms manipulated).  He was, simply put, a con man -- a gifted, more generous than average and likeable one, but a con man nonetheless.  Given his talent for spinning a tale and his monstruous ego, I'm sure we have not seen the last of Mr. Jordan Belfort.  The Wolf is Dead, long live the Wolf.

It is fun to watch but it has all been done before and better. Ed Norton really disappointed me as he is usually a good actor. Marky Mark is not a good actor and neither is Mose Def or Seth Green. Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron must have felt like gods among fools working with these schlubs. That said, I still like Jason Statham. The guy has charisma.

B000BI0WOA|4.0|I tried other Dire Staights compilations, and was never happy with them until I found this one. Right off the bat the first disc draws you in with the great \\"Telegraph Road\\", and all 14 minutes of it. It then spreads out across the Dire Straights discography. But one thing I would recommend, is to pick up the Imported version, as it will contain an additional track or two from the US version, most notably one of my favorites from the \\"Making Movies\\" album, \\"Skateway\\". All tracks are the  full cut studio version, and not the stripped down or live versions, such as \\"Money For Nothing\\".    True, the second disc is made up of mostly Mark Knopfler solo tracks, but so what? They are all great tracks and fit in well with this project.    I would recommend.

B000Z27HLS|3.0|\\"Northanger Abbey\\" is the Austen novel that has received the least attention from adapters during the Jane Austen craze of this and the last decade. Perhaps the reason is that, even more than the frequently ill-adapted and much greater \\"Emma,\\" it relies for its genius heavily on the ironic observations of the authorial voice. Without recourse to endless voiceovers, it threatens to devolve into just the standard Regency Gothic romance its witty author was largely bent on parodying. Not surprisingly, such voiceovers are largely missing here. While it is a vast improvement over the 1986 TV production, this adaptation remains as a consequence mostly deficient in capturing the youthful author's satiric wit and charm.    Further, Catherine Morland at the outset lacks the clueless nature that is a large part of her attractiveness for Henry Tilney. She sounds more like a would-be Elizabeth Bennet than a good-hearted but amusingly ignorant country girl on a first visit to fashionable Bath. Henry Tilney, in turn, lacks the sprightly wit of the novel's character, emerging as more of a sugarstick than a wonderfully clever clergyman. Catherine complains of his incessant teasing, but any noteworthy, verbally memorable example of such is hard to find. Consequently, their exchanges pretty much fall flat.    The adaptation is thematically faithful to the novel in an important way, though: its ironic insight that life IS truly horrible, though not in the manner the heroine expects. True horror in the England of the day doesn't involve ghosts and murdered wives in old abbeys replete with secret passages. It rests rather on \\"crimes of the heart,\\" here those inspired by a shameless love of money before all else. General Tilney and Isabella Thorpe emerge for this reason as true comic monsters, but of a sort Catherine had least expected to find around her. Still, though, except for the General's shocking eviction of Catherine from Northanger, the treatment of these characters is far too heavy-handed, lacking anything of the \\"light, bright, and sparkling\\" that gives the novel its witty balance.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Classic American film. Wacky humor of a much more sophisticated level than most current 'college-films', i.e. American Pie etc. Perhaps it's a generational thing but film humor,of this genre, has become debased into vulgar,locker room street language. Current film makers should study this Classic before scripting any more vulgar, vile attempts at filmic humor aimed at the unsophisticated American  youth of today.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|This is a poor man's version of Austen's late masterpiece. Full of odd cuts, misrepresentations, and a generally rushed job feeling throughout, this adaptation makes one wonder who considered it worthy to film in the first place. Some of the Complete Jane Austen entries, after all, will be repeats of earlier TV versions, and the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds \\"Persuasion\\" of several years back is in all respects infinitely superior to this mishmash. The closest equivalent to what has been done here to a great work is what the Reader's Digest routinely used to do when it would blithely maim a novel of merit and then foist it upon the general public as \\"a Condensed Book.\\"
B000U0F7RG|4.0|This series was purchased as a Christmas present for my daughter.  She loves it.  She has been glued to the TV every spare minute.  HOWEVER, there have been several problems with the discs.  There have been some discs that have tiled up, some where the picture would pause and then would jump ahead and some would lose the audio.  These problems are the only reason I give a rating of 4 stars instead of 5.

His favorite part is opening up the back flaps with Darth Vadar and Luke Skywalker and having a mock battle with their light sabers.

B000WCDI5K|2.0|I'm underwhelmed. This seems like a sort of cash-in...a collection of rejects and covers, and curious covers at that, what with the note-for-note redux of Kenny Rogers' Ruby-(Don't Take Your Love to Town) and Dire Straits' Romeo & Juliet, Joy Division's Shadowplay, plus a dance remix of Mr Brightsides, a hospital zone version of Sam's Town and a rather pointless redux of Change Your Mind.     There are a few good tracks on here, a few of which were B-sides, but in the day of the CD, why weren't these included on the original releases? And why release them now? Did Sam's Town tank or something? Does anybody buy singles any more?    Even when some of the covers sound like they might be a good fit, they disappoint; they start out like good ideas but are marred by an out of place, over-the-top vocal delivery. Some tracks sound like dressed up demos. It isn't a mystery why many of these stayed in the can, especially the duet with Lou Reed, Tranquilizer, which sounds like a dis-interested Reed mailed in his vocals.    I have no idea why they'd record a song like Ruby...to introduce a new generation of listeners to Kenny Rogers and The First Edition? I'd rather hear Condition in that case. Maybe it was done tongue-in-cheek. Hard to give them the benefit of the doubt what with the slap-dash effort in some of these songs. I don't know why lead singer Brandon Flowers feels the need to go for Star Search gold on these songs, when a more sedate approach would have sufficed. Proof once again you can't let the quarterback coach. The band has some rather good moments, but like I said before, the vox detract from what could have been releasable songs.     Boy, after neo-wavers Hot Hot Heat lost their formula after one album, it looks now like these guys have. I liked Hot Fuss a lot, but thought Sam's Town underachieved as a follow-up. After this release, they should change their name to The Fillers.
B000J103PC|5.0|I had no pre-conceived notions about this film, which I knew little about before watching.  However, my incredibly neutral viewpoint quickly disintegrated into genuine enjoyment just a few minutes into the film.  Meryl Streep is as gifted as they come, and sometimes her facial expressions can steal the scene - that is, unless her biting dialogue hasn't already done so.  The fact that Streep's vocal inflection is fairly low key and steady makes the words all the more amusing (of course, they'd be far from amusing if this was your actual boss in real life).  Sure, there are cliches, but virtually every Hollywood movie has them nowadays.  Enjoy it for what it is - two hours of humorous escapism that you'll probably revisit every year or so.
0307387151|4.0|Atonement started out slow and dull, picking up pace and worth only at a snails pace.  This is not a good book choice for a reader with little patients. In the beginning I was irritated by the lot of unnecessary words used to describe one simple scene, however Ian McEwans writing style grew on me bit by bit.  Patient reader or not - keep with it.  I didn't fully appreciate the novel until the last few pages, and only then did I ponder its significance.
B00005JPXY|5.0|In spite of my anxiety over its months-long hyping, I found that \\"Cloverfield\\" met and exceeded my expectations. The film kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. My stomach was so tight that I had lost any interest in eating after the film. Or maybe that was the extreme \\"video-verite\\" shaky camera handling.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" follows a group of successful 20-something New Yorkers, whose celebration of the imminent departure of one of their number is interrupted by the arrival of a horrific, building-bashing monster. The conceit of the film is that is was recorded by a group of five people who split off from the party. Following some Gen-Y (\\"Y\\" for YouTube) impulse to record everything, they drag their camera along through military counterattack, destroyed buildings and over-the-top mayhem. The medium gives the film a gritty man-in-the-street feel, and also gives the filmmakers a perfect rationale for not telling us where the monster comes from and what it wants -- we know only as much as the film's participants can see.<br /><br />But the film also has other strands and layers, which take it a notch above other monster films. The film is imagined in layers - we are movie viewers in a theater, watching a film located and studied by the military, which was shot by a group of New Yorkers, which itself was recorded over another (and important) piece of tape. The filmmakers carefully attended to the complicated layers of human relationships, which in a few visual strokes early on, built up a surprising amount of emotional complexity. Smart, serious, hunky Rob is crazy for gentle, gorgeous Beth, but is distraught that she attends the party with a new beau. Goofy, loyal Hud is nutty about snide/reclusive Marlene, who gives him as much attention as she would a 6-foot tall cockroach. Rob's bro Jason is madly in love with Lily. Each is played by a newcomer, so there's no star power to distract from the thesis that Bad Things Will Happen To Ordinary Well-off Young People. The whole going-away party episode may seem stuck on to some, but it is integral to the relationships that develop between the characters throughout the film.<br /><br />The film's effects were eye popping and very in-your-face: buildings collapse, bridges are wrecked and cars are stomped aplenty. The army has its hands full, and more. The monster, especially in the film's first half, is seen only in snippets. As with any monster movie, the less seen of the beast the better, and when we do get a fuller view, it's a bit of a letdown. But through all the carnage and devastation (Manhattan gets TRASHED!) the characters' initial (and realistic) shock and confusion gives way to a simple, logical yet foolhardy rescue attempt.<br /><br />Maybe because of their anonymity, the actors were able to meld into a realistic group, rather than fighting for star standing. And thanks to the excellent writing and directing, the characters were recognizable types. Though I hardly knew the characters, I nearly wept when one lost his life. And I laughed as Hud, Rob's boisterous and randy best friend, spent time running at the mouth or (between horrifying escapes from the monster) hitting on hard-to-get Marlene. These touches gave the viewer a delicious sense of the complexities brewing even in the most terrified of brains.<br /><br />The 9/11 links were understated, but omnipresent. So much so that some viewers might wonder if \\"Cloverfield\\" was a subtle allegory of that attack and the military response to it. Nevertheless, the parallels were sometimes unnerving -- an unexpected danger shocks an unprepared city; paper floats from damaged buildings; a skyscraper collapses and sends dust clouds into the street; evacuees clog bridges; the city canyon's walls echo the wailing sirens of emergency vehicles. If they meant nothing by the parallel, the filmmakers at least mined the store of commonly-held images of that day.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" had a few plot holes and implausibilities--horrific injuries do little to slow down important characters?. But the film maintained its consistency throughout, and never found really stupid reasons to keep the camera rolling. For a great film about the way a group of unprepared, ordinary people react to a vicious and implacable threat, \\"Cloverfield\\" has few equals. A great time and a smartly-done film.nt characters?.

B000YA82F6|5.0|From Kitty Pride giving up her baby to Elektra for adoption to the mighty catchphrase, \\"Thundercats are go!\\" The comedy/drama Juno can be summed up in many ways, but nothing as great as being \\"true\\" and \\"real.\\"<br /><br />Starting with author and screenwriter Diablo Cody, who has certainly given all of us a different and lighter take to a normally grim situation--unexpected teen pregnancy. Actor turned director Jason Reitman who did a splendid job in communicating Cody's story to the big screen. Ellen Page (Juno MacGuff) who played a convincing 16 year-old. (Do teenagers really talk that way these days? Its like a whole new language that I can understand, yet not speak. Care for some \\"tunnage?\\"). And the rest of the crew: J.K. Simmons (who plays the laid back and understanding Mac MacGuff), Allison Jannay (as Juno's step-mother Bren), Jennifer Garner (who as Vanessa Loring, plays the passionate adoptive mother to be), Jason Bateman (as the shackled husband--Mark Loring), and Michael Cera ( who is--the runner with a good heart Paulie Bleeker) who made me believe that I was more than a spectator.<br /><br />Juno is certainly a movie that shouldn't be missed and a DVD that you shouldn't pass on.

I think this can be enjoyable, if you can take some changes to the story. I thought Sally Hawkins did a wonderful job of showing her great regret, she pulled you in to her sadness. It was very heart-renching to see. I thought the overall casting was good, with a few exceptions (Amanda Hale as Mary Elliot was a bit of a cartoonish character). After I saw this on PBS, I went ahead and purchased the DVD.  I think it is definitely worth adding to my collection.

0061142026|2.0|I really did. I've heard so many good things about this book, so I went out and bought it. I loved the idea of it. I thought it romantic that a young man would go in search of a fallen star for the woman he loves. But the woman he loves is so obviously disinterested in him, I had to wonder why he even bothered. There were a couple times in the book I wanted to just forget it, but I forged ahead hoping it would get better. I'm sorry to say, for me at least, it didn't get better. Tristan and the star were the most interesting aspects of the book, but it wasn't enough for me. And the ending was so...blah. I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it, but I expected more of a reaction out of Tristan at the end regarding Veronica...Victoria? I've already forgotten her name. It just didn't do it for me.

B0009FU0ZQ|3.0|This is a movie based upon the book by the same name from Robert Parker.  It does reflect more modern production than some of the earlier Spenser movies also based upon books by this author.  Unfortunately, the characterization is weak, maybe as required by TV values.  Who knows.<br /><br />It is only a rough approximation to original text.<br /><br />The movie is worth watching on a rainy day but is likely to disappoint anyone who values the craft of dialogue and plot of Parker.

B000YA82F6|4.0|I have never been the only male person in a theater audience before. Ever. But now as I have gone to see \\"Juno,\\" I know what that feels like. From all the hype surrounding this movie, and Roger Ebert himself calling it the best movie of the year, I decided it would be worth walking down to my theater in below 20 degree weather to see it at a 2:45 matinée on a lazy Sunday afternoon. So I did.    First and foremost--the film is over-hyped, but I still loved it. Juno (Ellen Page) is a weird, abnormal, yet stunningly cute teenager who messes up and gets pregnant by her best friend Paulie (Michael Cera). After choosing not to abort the baby, she decides to find adoptive parents, but in turn must face being pregnant at school, at home with her parents, and of course, trying to balance the everyday challenges of teenage life. As expected, there are bumps along the way, and that's why I think Juno is not so much a movie about teen pregnancy and the dangers that come with it--but as a dramedy about growing up.    There are a lot of original, fun, quirky ideas that come along with Juno--one, primarily, is Juno's character, who you can't help but love. She's weird and rebel, and doesn't try to be popular, yet of course, she gets some unwanted popularity eventually. Ellen Page does such a seamless job portraying the character, I would not be surprised if she was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Then we have Juno's best friend Paulie (who gets her pregnant), who is the nerdy, skinny kid who dominates the track team, plays guitar, and puts deodorant on his legs. The adoptive parents--Vanessa, the baby-obsessed lady who wants a child so bad she's ready to jump off a building, and Mark, the musically obsessed Sonic Youth lover who forms a friendship with Juno. I could go on and on and on but you get the picture...the film is quirky and lovable by everyone.    The film has a very indie feel to it that is paired up with a cute, indie acoustic soundtrack that I absolutely loved. The acting is without question some of the best I've seen in 2007 films--the dialogue is very witty, quirky, and entertaining, and forces a smile upon your face. Ellen Page gives a phenomenal performance as the weird, pregnant Juno and she is paired with outstanding performances by Jason Bateman, who you might remember from Arrested Development, and Michael Cera. Unfortunately, though I really liked the film, it is extremely over-hyped. It does not deserve a Best Picture nomination and certainly not it's 8.4/10 rating on IMDb. The strongest point of Juno is its indie -feel and originality--the weakest, unfortunately, is the way it is executed. I can't help but think Jason Reitman, the director, sort of mishandled the film and couldn't decide on whether he wanted it to be a comedy or tragedy. Also the first half hour or so of the film is very, VERY slow and lacks charm that is found in the second half. The idea, story, and structure for Juno is absolutely brilliant--but it could've been handled so much better.    Contrary to popular belief, Juno is not just for preppy teenage girls who have dumb boyfriends who want to knock them up. Like I said earlier, this is much more than a story about a pregnant teenager--it's a story about growing up and facing the world's challenges. Paired with wonderful acting, superb dialogue, a cute soundtrack, and a brilliant story, Juno turns out to be a great, cute film, whether you're old or young or male or female.

B000XRG9IW|5.0|Black Mountain exists in a swirl of heavy, grimy, vaguely psychedelic hard-rock, redolent of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin (with maybe a touch of the Velvet Underground and Pink Floyd).<br /><br />And the band is in fine shape in their sophomore album \\"In The Future\\" --  they introduce some new musical twists, while still keeping their signature sound. It's a powerful, intense collection of hard-rockers, but with a few softer songs sprinkled in to show their range.<br /><br />It opens with a grimy riff, a dark stomping bassline, and some smashing drums -- and for a minute, the appropriately-named \\"Stormy High\\" whips itself into a barely-restrained frenzy. When Stephen McBean's wailing vocals join the mix, the song straightens out into a solid, intense rocker that blasts its way down, reeking of classic rock concerts and apocalyptic fury.<br /><br />Having reeled you in, Black Mountain turns out the bluesy \\"Angels,\\" with McBean lamenting, \\"Come on, lay your head on down/angels, lay your arms around/every city's singing saddened songs....\\" And that quieter song is echoed in some of the others -- mournful folkiness, haunting fuzzy songs, or the ethereal closing lament \\"Night Walks.\\"<br /><br />But they haven't abandoned the harder music, thankfully. This is where their real power erupts out -- simmering hard-rock, gritty psychedelica wound with synth, stormy twisting electro-metal, and the penultimate song -- a seventeen-minute epic journey through explosive hard-rock, solemn organ instrumentals, and an earsplitting finale.<br /><br />Whoo. What a ride. It's been only three years since Black Mountain came out with their self-titled album and EP -- it was great music, but still raw and unformed. They've obviously done a lot of work in that time, because \\"In the Future\\" is a whole different beast -- they're more polished, focused and eclectic in their sounds.<br /><br />Like any good hard-rock album, it's got loads of twisting, undulating riffs and heavy basslines, fused into strong, muscular melodies -- also mix in smashing drums, tambourine, some somnolent organ, and acoustic guitar. And the band can switch styles in an instant -- for instance, \\"Tyrants\\" effortlessly flips between wistful Renaissancey ballads, and epic, powerful sweeps of hard-rock.<br /><br />Also take note: there's a lot more synth in this album than in their previous one. It's all very early 1970s -- colourful psychedelic ribbons wound through \\"Wucan,\\" plenty of harmonium, and strangled keyboard notes.<br /><br />McBean's voice hasn't changed, though -- he's still high and waily, and in the louder songs he sounds like he's leading an army (\\"The heart it waaaas/howling in the heavens... we will come together!\\"). He shares vocal time with Amber Webber, whose smooth wistful voice sounds at home whether she's dueting with him, or singing the softer songs by herself.<br /><br />\\"In the Future\\" is the natural evolution of Black Mountain -- a powerful, polished, intense retro-rock collection.

B000T0XED6|5.0|Pollini was wise to save Beetoven's Op. 2 piano sonatas for late in his complete cycle, having begun with the late sonatas over three decades ago. He's achieved such ease and mastery that these early works roll off his fingers with silken effortless that masks a lifetime's attention to touch and insight -- I doubt any contemporary can match him at this point. One can alight on any single movement, such as the Adagio of Op. 2 no. 1, and the variety of tone, the eloquence found in simplicity, testify to a rare match of artist and composer. Or consider the arpeggiated runs in the Rondo finale to Op. 2 no. 3, which define that cliche, a gossamer touch.<br /><br />The product description and first reviewer here at Amazon try to sell Op. 2 as dramatic, fully realized Beethoven, but in truth there's plenty of Haydnesque classicism in them. What's so marvelous is that Pollini doesn't make the music sound backward-looking, much less dainty. He achieves a feeling of Beethoven's strength without pumping the music up. It's a matter of poise and balance, allowing Beethoven's special excitement peek through whenever it appears. (Richter, who also favored early Beethoven, tended to punch it out and play over-aggressively at times, although that can be exciting in its own right, of course.)<br /><br />Probably this CD will appeal in the end mostly to Beethoven completists, Op. 2 being overshadowed by the \\"name\\" sonatas of the middle period and the revolutionary accomplishment of the late period. But to anyone who loves Pollini, here's an installment in his cycle that brings as much admiration and delight as any of the others.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|It is not Lawrence of Arabia, but this film, when I saw it in its initial release on the great curved screens of yore, dazzled me completely, and it still does,even in its OK DVD manifestations from other countries, and  its non letterbox format on VHS. It has tremendous imagination behind it, and Anthony Mann's sublime direction, is, as ususal, first rate in delivering many imaginative elements that stay with you for years. The film's score cannot be ignored..Miklos Roza at his best, and there is Sophia Loren and she makes everyone look fabulous. Charlton Heston is appropriately dignified in this role, and because the film moves ahead at a good pace, we do not notice the sameness of his approach to epic heroes from film to film.    It is, at last, out on DVD in its proper design, and with booklets and features, etc., as it should be.    See this and revel in its magnificent epic sweep and moving conclusion.

The extras, esepcially the commentarier by the various actors and actresses are very entertaining. It gives a new and deeper insight into a very good show.

B000V8I2QU|3.0|I'm of course aware of Bruce and E-Street, but I've never purchased an album and actively listened to their music, until now.  This music is so visceral and full of imagery.  I'm very impressed and would like to experiment with other albums; however, I find the sound engineering in this album so completely dissatisfying I fear wasting further money. This is one of my top-ten worst experiences with poor sound engineering.  It's awful.  The sound is so compressed it's near impossible to make out all the dynamic nuances.  It sounds like one master instrument is producing all the sounds at once.  What is wrong with these engineers?  Do they pass these projects off to interns or do they think people actually like this sound?  And what about the artists; don't they care their music is downed out and, IMHO ruined?
B000LY5QQS|4.0|If there is an example of star charisma pulling a movie through, then it is here, in Brosnan's second Bond outing where he appears effortlessly cool and comfortable in the role.  Every time he is on screen, the film works.  The director (Roger Spottiswoode) is new to Bond movies, and yet he manages to pull off something that looks just like a Bond movie should - harking back to the Moore era, with quips and the odd comedy moment to add levity to the proceedings.    After a standout opening sequence where Bond infiltrates an arms bazaar on a mountain top before reducing most of the materials on display to scrap, the plot revolves around a media baron out to achieve global media domination.  It's a neat updated twist on the megalomaniac idea.  To do this, he is engineering a war between Britain and China in order to breach the Chinese media market - this means Bond has to work with a Chinese agent (who coincidentally happens to be a beautiful woman..) to stop the madman before WW III erupts.  You know, business as usual for a Bond movie.  One of the standout elements of the movie, is David Arnold's terrific score - finally, someone has taken on John Barry's mantle, and taken the Bond themes and not just run with them but given them new life, livening them up for a new generation - fantastic stuff.  Other ingredients which hit exactly the right note are Judi Dench as M, Teri Hatcher as the (rather short-lived) Bond girl, Michelle Yeoh's spunky Chinese agent and the remote control car chase.  There are however some real problems with the movie.  One or two of the action scenes are a little too orchestrated... the helicopter trying to slice up Bond with its blades must have looked great on paper, but fails to convince.  And then the old Bond movie dilemma - when the bad guy is not good, the movie falls flat.  Jonathan Pryce is never really menacing - He doesn't even look as menacing as the real Rupert Murdoch!  He just looks like an actor spouting menacing lines.. and speaking of lines, the script veers from some real witty quips (Admiral Roebuck: `With all due respect, M, I think you don't have the balls for this job.' M: `Maybe. But the advantage is, I don't have to think with them all the time.'), to some real clunkers that fall flat on delivery  (`There's no news like bad news ` - how long did it take to come up with that classic??).    The great thing about Bond movies is how they walk the tightrope of cliché to deliver the same old Bond film ingredients, but with inventiveness.  With the Bike chase, the car chase, the quirky and interesting secondary characters, that is exactly what this movie does - for the first half.  Then, the second half falls into the trap of just being Bond running about killing people, waving a machine gun around instead of killing carefully and with precision the way he ought to, trying hard to kill a guy with grey hair and glasses.  It's as much action as we have seen in a Bond finale in a long time, but it does not really thrill.  That aside, if you can try and ignore the ubiquitous product placement, then the cocktail of Brosnan excelling in a role he seems destined to play, David Arnold's exciting score, and Michelle Yeoh matching Bond bullet for bullet and kick for kick rather than be the dull women on the sideline, makes this worth a watch.    As per the other Brosnan releases, there is a gaping hole in the extras where we might expect a retrospective documentary, however that quibble aside there are plenty of other extras, with two commentaries, storyboards, deleted scenes ( none of which are memorable) and a couple of fluff pieces about `the making of' that offer no insight into the genesis of story or movie in general.  Good, but not quite `ultimate'.  Picture and sound are perfect, as we have come to expect in this remastered series.

0141439661|1.0|Seeing how Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen barely makes any sense, I wouldn't even touch this book again, even if you paid me. Extremely long and mundane, Sense and Sensibility is a book that actually requires effort and stamina to go through the entire thing. To me, the three-hundred-and-fifteen-page book translated to absolute gibberish as I did not understand, nor really cared to understand what was going on.<br /><br />Seeing how the there was no purpose to the plot, I was left bored from the first word to the very last. I really did not see the point of writing a story about two well-off, high society women court other men. There was absolutely nothing interesting about that in the story. No one really cares if the ladies must suffer through heartbreak because in actuality, everyone does. Jane Austen could have done a much better job in piecing a more attractive and purposeful novel together.<br /><br />As I read, the more I learned about the characters, the angrier I got. Why does every character have to be a member of a high social status? To me, everyone was snobby, everyone was self-indulged, and everyone was too one-dimensional. The characters were too well-off to even sympathize with. I did not care or feel emotionally attached to any character whatsoever. Each individual was not self-motivated, and they came off as stuck-up characters. I was just waiting for someone to do something, but no, each character has to wallow in his or her own self-pity. People have worse problems to worry about than worrying about the problems the character has. I kept going through the story and saying, \\"So what? Who cares? Fix your own problems.\\" The characters were too detached to make me feel interested.<br /><br />All in all, the story was just bad. It lacked purpose and meaning. Although you have to admit Jane Austen constructs beautifully crafted sentences, sentence style could only take the story so far. If you have time to actually read this book, I suggest you spend your time doing something worthwhile instead of wasting your life on Sense and Sensibility.
B000001ESN|5.0|I'll open up by mentioning that I'm no Rush fanatic.  I generally really like what I've heard, but my overall exposure is pretty much limited to the classic Rush period from \\"2112\\" until \\"Moving Pictures\\".  I like all these albums a lot, however, and \\"Permanent Waves\\" is probably the best of them.<br /><br />Though they still use a fairly progressive sound, Rush have cut down on the lengthy arrangements and the technicality somewhat here when compared to \\"Hemispheres\\".  Of course, Rush always had some shorter, more conventional songs and they still include a few epics, but the overall balance has shifted somewhat.  These changes should be evident on the opener \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", which is one of the more straightforward, poppy Rush songs I've heard from the era.  This has Lee's catchiest, most melodic vocals on the album along with piercing, memorable guitarwork from Lifeson.  Also, they don't totally eschew the more bizarre songwriting methods, as exemplified by the weird reggae-rock closing.  All in all, an excellent opener.  \\"Freewill\\" is another definitive Rush track, which mixes more conventional melodicism with proggy time changes and a more dynamic arrangement.  It's not as good as \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", but it's still a fine companion piece.  Next we have \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", the best track on the album and perhaps my favorite Rush song.  At seven minutes this is a relatively minor epic in terms of length but this allows it to have a unity which is often lacking in this sort of material.  It's primarily an instrumental track driven by Lee's pulsing, powerful bass which is overlayed by atmospheric guitars and synths.  It's just a fantastically evocative and interesting track, particularly during the middle break.<br /><br />The second half of the album isn't as strong as the first, but it's still more than solid.  We have two more straight forward tracks, \\"Different Strings\\" and \\"Entre Nous\\", which are both a bit more gentle than the openers, but they're still quite effective and provide a nice change of pace.  Finally we close with the 9-minute \\"Natural Science\\".  At first this one kinda pales in comparison to \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", but on further listens it stands on its own quite nicely.  It's a bit more of an old school Rush epic in that it is more clearly subdivided into different movements.  It's not the most immediately memorable song here, but it eventually reveals some dynamic, layered instrumentation which makes up for the lack of traditional memorability.<br /><br />In closing, I should  mention that Rush are something of an acquired taste for the modern listener, what with Lee's odd, high vocals and the sometimes cheesy synths.  Personally, I found these elements pretty repellant for a long time, but once I finally really listened to Rush they grew on me very fast.  All in all, I think anyone with an appreciation for sophisticated but still memorable rock songwriting ought to find a lot to like in \\"Permanent Waves\\", and in late 70s/early 80s Rush in general.tive and provide a nice change of pace.

1593080255|4.0|A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet gripping<br /><br />Oscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her.  We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.<br /><br />The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds.
B000002KLG|5.0|This album was excellently produced, engineered and performed.  It is, in my opinion, one of the best albums of the last century.  Rod Temperton (of Heatwave) contributes to this album (he wrote many of Michael Jackson's super-mega hits) and the George Benson and Rod Temperton combination is pure musical heaven.  A truly must-have in any jazz aficionado's collection.  This album brings back many good memories of the late 70s and early 80s.
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden is well-written book, a classic deemed worthy of reading. Steinbeck does a great job of making the piece of literature entertaining. I felt glued to the book many times because the plot would be wonderfully constructed, leading readers on an adventurous journey through the lives of the characters in the Salinas Valley.     What surprised me the most were the characters in the story. Each individual character had his or her own unique personality. Each person seemed real and true to life. I would be going through the book and start saying to myself \\"oh this character reminds me of so and so.\\" Plus, the characters are dynamic and many of their personalities are not at the extremes, but instead they have both the good qualities and bad qualities of mankind. I love how I can read into each character and judge him or her through his or her actions. The subtlety in revealing the motives behind each character was astonishing. The way Steinbeck depicted the characters through their dialogue and actions was overwhelming as I soon developed my personal opinion on each character. It made me feel like I was involved in the story itself.     Adding to the amazing characters is in intricate, well-developed story line. The plot was complex in that there were many subplots running through the main action. However, when I was reading, the complexity of the story did not hinder my progression because everything seemed to flow. The story was being pieced together in a rhythmic fashion as one event leads to another. The biblical allusion to Cain and Abel was also a fun thing to locate. After reading the story of Cain and Abel, I would go through the East of Eden and get excited when I would notice the similarity or the differences between East of Eden and the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck truly does a fascinating job of weaving his story together.    Although the book is rather long, the wonderful characters and amazing plot line makes up for it ten times over. East of Eden makes you appreciate good writing.
B000V6BE6C|3.0|now dont get me wrong the album is by no means a bad album. its just simply weak in comparison to all their other albums. its not has heavy, and the guitar work is watered down. they seem like their trying to get more listener friendly on this album. best way to put it is....this is a very good hard rock album but a very weak a7x effert. city of evil is acully my favorite album by a7x. i loved the more technical big epic sound they evolved into on that album, and its no where to be found on this album. huge disspointing follow up to a outstanding album.....
0451528956|5.0|A wonderfully crafted masterpiece, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one of the must-reads of all time. This beautiful piece of literature appeals to many different senses and emotions. It is inspiring to see a plot so innovative and novel in the way the story presents itself. This story is just absolutely amazing.    Written like an investigative report, Robert Louis Stevenson slow guides the reader through the story. The story progresses, not to slow and not to fast, but just enough to get the story moving and not lose the reader's interest. The story tells of how a Dr. Jekyll is able to separate the evil in him into an entirely different form- Mr. Hyde. I love how the reader is always anticipating what happens next as the reader is fed clues throughout the story, but the answer remains dangling and untouched- tempting readers to continue and read. The story is well-constructed in that readers can also see into the view of other characters and not just Mr. Utterson himself.      Stevenson's portrayal of the good and bad side of man is wonderful. I have never seen a book where the author portrays the evil in a person by an entirely different character. The different transformations and continual action scenes in the book kept me on my toes. The mood and atmosphere is set by Stevenson's vivid description of the environment. Because Stevenson's style is not complex for his sentences are really direct and straightforward, it was not burdensome to read the book.     I guarantee if you read this book, you will not be disappointed. It is a light and easy read, which you can probably finish in no time at all because Stevenson's writing makes you glued to the book- always anticipating the next action. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is an absolute must-read.
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden is an unforgettable book because of its brilliant plot and characters. Steinbeck sets the story in Salinas Valley, his hometown, and focuses on two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The story passes fairly quickly from one generation to the next in the three sections of the novel.      Its plot is filled with Biblical allusions, specifically the stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel. Steinbeck explores brother rivalry in two generations as the father favors a son, causing the other to experience overwhelming jealously and anger. The novel is profound as it explores this and other deep emotions, such as guilt. In the end, timshel emphasizes that forgiveness is necessary to allow one to move on in life.      The characters are entertaining with their contrasting personalities. Cathy especially interested me as I questioned if she was completely evil or not.     Also, Steinbeck's style is enjoyable because it is easy to understand.     Even though the novel is long, the reader will love every page as they watch the amazing story unfold in front of their eyes. This book is a must read as it teaches many things and entertains at the same time.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|This album is the product of a musical genius. I had been a casual SOAD fan over the years, but never was overly impressed with them. I picked up this CD as an impulse purchase out of curiosity to see what direction Serj was taking his music. What a pleasant surprise!    Everything from the music to the lyrics is masterfully implemented. His solo work is so much more powerful than before. Since I am not a diehard SOAD fan I cannot really say whether or not a big fan of the band will like this album, but I can say that this album is excellent and displays the incredible ability of Serj Tankian.
158542627X|5.0|I bought this book about a year ago, and have read and re-read it almost daily(and I'm still not done with it). My life has changed so much because of it.

0143038419|1.0|I also wish zero stars was an option!  Gilbert's shallow writing style combined with her self-indulgent point of view make this book nauseating.  I received it as a gift but otherwise never would have read it.  I kept waiting for the \\"good part\\" which NEVER came.  Worse yet, Gilbert's narrow perspective exoticizes and orientalizes everything \\"different\\" or \\"new\\" that she sees.  She belittles the people that she meets as they try to fit into her Gilbert-centric universe.  Her book is the worst possible example of American travel writing.  Spare yourself the pain and skip this book!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|We don't watch LOST during the season; we wait until the dvd hits the market and watch it marathon-style.<br /><br />There are few series which get progressively better, tighter, and more exciting. LOST 3 is one of them. The strength of the series lies in the ensemble cast (we lose a couple of them this season) and the delicate balance of the story line between reality and other-worldliness.<br /><br />LOST 3 is a must-have: dramatic, susepenseful, humorous, and ironic.
B000056NX5|4.0|I am a huge fan of Ted Neeley (1973 movie as well as stage productions) but just saw JCS live again yesterday and although he is the first and best Jesus, he is...well, aging. I got home and went to pull out my DVD of the 1973 movie and found this one. I had never watched it and thought it was worth a shot. I'm so glad I found it!   During the opening scenes I was skeptical. Judas sings right to the camera and the set is very similar to a stage production. Then Jesus comes out and is dressed in cacky pants!? That song makes it seem like a gay musical (not that that would be bad, but was unexpected for this particular movie). It's very hard to get over seeing Jesus look anything different than Ted Neeley!  By the 3rd song I was hooked and by the end I was crying.     A couple pros and a couple cons.  First - I LOVE the 39 lashes scene. The way they did this was very much like a stage show where the \\"mob\\" does the lashing and uses their hands to smear the blood. Much better than the live show I saw yesterday where he just jerked around and there was no blood or anything to give you the true feeling of how it would have been.  Second - Ciaphas, Annas, Pilot, and Herod are awesome! Great acting and singing.  Last (but not least) - Jesus is awesome! He is beautiful, and has an excellent voice. I kept thinking he would be a wonderful Tommy in \\"Who's Tommy\\" - maybe it's the hair!  Still AWESOME!!!  For the cons - the biggest one is Judas' singing. His high notes are very whiney and straining on the ears.  The only other one would be the costumes. The apostles have hair highlights and Judas wears leather pants and cowboy boots?! Trying to be too modern and it makes it look like an MTV video from 1985.  If you are a Jesus Christ Superstar fan, I definately recommend you see this version. (But only after you watch the original 1973 version!)
B000RW3YYA|4.0|The story lines and acting are superb in Season Three of Stargate Atlantis.  The best thing about the series is the varying episodes emotions from humor (Tao of Rodney & Irresistible) to sadness (Sateda & Sunday).  I really feel the actors are comfortable with their characters and are willing to explore more.  As always, I love the extras.  The behind the scenes and the commentaries are always good.  This is definately worth the purchase.
B00005JPXY|4.0|It's already a cliché to call CLOVERFIELD the \\"Blair Witch Meets Godzilla\\" movie.  But that's about as accurate a snapshot of this film as you could want.  The entire experience is seen through the point of view of one guy who starts out by filming his friend's going-away party and becomes his video of the attack on Manhattan by a Godzilla-like monster.    This method accomplished several crucial things:    1) It allows the movie's very low budget to get stretched even further and in fact, makes the low budget a non-issue.  Everything looks a little grainy in this film...and if the filmmaker's can't afford to SHOW you something, you can just HEAR it.  2) It injects a new life into a tired genre.    3) It actually becomes a little poignant, because occasionally the film fast-forwards and we see snippets of the video that was on this particular tape BEFORE this monster video was taped.  These snippets show the early days of the love story between two key characters.  The way CLOVERFIELD is made allows these scenes to be integrated in a completely organic way.  4) It creates a \\"you are there\\" feeling that makes the film work...much in the way this method made BLAIR WITCH work.    The story itself is nothing new.  Big monster attacks big city.  Mass destruction ensues.  The military is ineffective.  Many people get squished.  But what creator J.J. Abrams has managed to do is find a new way of telling the story that makes it seem at least a little fresh AND makes it almost real time and quite visceral.  You are \\"on the ground\\" as events unfold.  Just like the main characters, you get NO information on where this thing came from, what might be happening anywhere else in the city or the world, etc.  The movie doesn't have to answer any questions, because the videographer of the movie wouldn't have gotten any answers either.    It's fast-paced, funny at times and absolutely scary at times.  You'll jump more than once and you'll have a good time.  Your brain will be engagedfor a minimal amount of time...you see this film at a gut level.  In terms of accomplishing what it set out to do, CLOVERFIELD gets close to knocking it out of the park.    There are weaknesses, of course.  The film is very short (less than 90 minutes) and even then, the opening scenes at the party feel like padding.   Yes, we get to meet the characters who become central to the rest of the film...but watching a bunch of strangers partying is about as exciting as it would be to see a home movie of a friend's party.  Also, the actors are mostly unknown, and they aren't the greatest.  No one gives a true stinker of a performance but neither is there much above average.  (The one exception is Lizzy Caplan [best known for MEAN GIRLS], who gives a little depth to her role.)      Finally, my biggest problem with the low-budget was that Manhattan wasn't crowded enough.  If something like this happened, the streets would be absolutely choked with people.  But the crowd scenes make it seem as though the city has been mostly abandoned already.  You just have to go with it.    So CLOVERFIELD is solid, exciting entertainment.  It won't be a classic, but it does rise above its genre trappings through its inventive setup and a few truly jolting scenes.     --Visit my site [...] for more reviews
0743298039|5.0|My only regreat with this book is that it has to end and the author has not written another book for me to get lost in!  This book has held me spellbound----the author has created such an atmosphere of English culture, gardens, decor, and ettiquette that I am vicariously living there. It is a beautiful fascinating read.

0393307050|2.0|I came to this book as someone with great interest and reading background in the Napoleonic era.  I'd also seen \\"Master and Commander\\" and the A&E Hornblower series (twice) and the Gregory Peck Hornblower movie as well as \\"Damn the Defiant!\\"    I read \\"Beat to Quarters\\" a week or so before this one and speaking now as a novelist, I think that while O'Brian may sometimes seem a better writer than C.S. Forester line-by-line, he's by no means a better story-teller.  The sense of detail in language and character interaction is terrific (at first), but the nautical details become tedious, as does the doctor's excessive use of Latin and sesquipedalian words, especially when whole sentences go by and you have no idea what exactly is happening. I began to feel that the author was showing off his research, which is always a danger writing historical fiction.     The book badly needed a glossary--particularly for the nautical terms--and it also badly needed editing.  O'Brian is far too fond of skipping transitions between places and of describing something just after it happened in a sort of mini-flashback (why?)--both of which make the narrative murky when it should be clear.  What's wrong with telling a story like this straight ahead? I'm an attentive reader and at least a handful of times I had to reread something to figure it out or figure out what I missed.     \\"Beat to Quarters\\" was more consistently thrilling, exciting, and engaging. O'Brian does go more deeply into his characters than Forester does, but that doesn't necessarily make for a stronger novel, since the reflections aren't always interesting.  My main problem with this novel is that it meanders just as the Sophie does around the Mediterranean.  Sadly, a blizzard of period detail can't make up for a weak story-line.
B000069KE0|5.0|I recently picked up the Rhino remaster of this amazing album and it sounds great. It's strange ... when I go back and listen to albums like 16 thru 19 (which featured some great Chicago tunes in their own right), that material sounds dated to me, yet on this masterpiece the music does not. In my opinion, side one of this record is one of the best album sides ever. I still get goosebumps sometimes listening to songs like Movin' In and The Road.
6305263248|3.0|John Frankenheimer's film regarding  a team of rogue agents hired to obtain a mysterious suitcase for their obscure employers.  The plot is rudimentary with a loose story and undeveloped characters but presents some good action sequences with exciting car chases.    Frankenheimer tries to present the theme of the rogue agent by obscuring the purpose of the mission and the true motivation of the characters involved.  Unfortunutely, this leaves the film with a minimal plot where no one knows much about the background of the characters or the real purpose of their mission.  What is in the box?  Who are all of the characters really working for?  What are their backgrounds and real specialties?  Nobody knows.  Nice try but this attempt at presenting a plot of mystery seems to misfire leaving simply no real plot at all to cling to.  Good car chases but somewhat your typical Hollywood exagerrations with infinite obstacles avoided at unbelievable speeds and, of course, your gratuitous scene showing the spontaneous combustion of car wrecks.  The gun fights are completely unbelievable and make you wonder where these agents were trained to be so brazen in accomplishing their mission.    In short, the film has some good action sequences but leaves much to be desired in terms of plot and character development making it just another average action/suspense thriller.

B000VBJEEG|2.0|This movie has it all - it's scary, it's violent, it has making out, alcohol abuse, illegitimate children, and weapons are drawn and used - repeatedly.<br /><br />And it's a G movie!<br /><br />The first inkling of just what kind of movie it will be is during the first scene, when the star of the movie, Remy the Rat (voiced by Patton Oswalt) and his brother Emile (voiced by Peter Sohn) get caught in a farmhouse kitchen, and the previously sweet old lady who is always asleep in her armchair jumps into action and proceeds to unload dozens of rounds from a shotgun at the pair of rats - the shoot `em up scene lasts a good solid 10 minutes, all told, and at several points it looks as if she has blasted the pair into little rat puffs (although in the end she hasn't).<br /><br />All this leads to the entire rat colony having to move out of the farmhouse, and so the next scene is the rat evacuation through the famed sewers of Paris, during which Remy, afloat on a book, ends up going over a scary waterfall, and being tumbled about underwater.<br /><br />Once back on dry land, he scurries along the beams of several buildings - indoors so that we can see down into the various rooms - and passes by a couple who are arguing - the woman aims a pistol at the man, he jeers \\"Go ahead, you don't have the guts\\", we hear a gunshot, then we see them and it's clear she missed, and they fall into each other's arms and make up.<br /><br />Then ensue many minutes (in two different scenes) of Remy trying to stay alive in a restaurant kitchen. Much hurling and heaving of knives and cleavers. When Remy is finally cornered and caught in a glass jar, his captor is instructed to \\"kill him.\\"<br /><br />This is directed to the newest addition to the kitchen crew, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano), who turns out to be the illegitimate son of the original owner of the restaurant - now deceased and appearing to Remy as a either a fantastic communication or a figment of Remy's imagination - we're never quite sure which.<br /><br />The female lead, Collete (voiced by Janeane Garofalo), charged with taking Linguini under her wing, advises him \\"welcome to hell,\\", and then introduces him to the rest of the kitchen crew.

Yeah, it's animated - but yeah, it's pretty overt making out.<br /><br />Meanwhile, to convince Remy that humans are not to be trusted, Remy's father takes Remy to a shop and shows him a window filled with dead rat carcasses hanging from what look like little meathooks. A pretty horrifying visual given that by this time, 3/4s of the way through the movie, all of the children in the audience have bonded with the adorable rats.<br /><br />Frankly, we were shocked that this movie was rated G.<br /><br />Even the children we know who have seen this movie were surprised that it was not rated at least PG, if not PG-13.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|I enjoyed the book, I loved the movie, and I was blown away by the soundtrack - it's my favorite album of 2007.  The heartbreak of the movie is perfectly expressed in the soundtrack, both in Eddie's covers of Society and Hard Sun and in the original numbers.  I was pleased to see that Guaranteed won a Golden Globe.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|I remember the David Attenborough series \\"Life on Earth\\" from the '70's. In fact, I own it on a wellworn VHS set of tapes.  The photography at the time was revolutionary and stunning, and Attenborough's narration was one of awe and wonder.  The technological advances of this series are apparent in the incredible clarity of the photography, but I honestly find the sense of wonder and awe missing from it.  It's good, yes, very very good: but to me it lacks \\"soul.\\"

I love it also because I can make it a short read (not that many words) or draw it out into a 10 min read by talking about the colored keys or to point out the moon and the balloon in almost every page or to find the mouse.      There are so many great details in the photos.    I love this book and so does she.    Jason

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the BEST movie I have ever seen!  I have the complete set and actually have rewatched it over and over again.  The set not only includes the movie but it also includes extra things about the military like maps, dates of each battle, the original bio of the men the movie is based on, etc.  The collector tin that the movie comes in is wonderful and it keeps the movie safe.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, rather you are a history or war buff like myself or just like movies that have an AWESOME story line.  This movie has some funny moments and some real moments that make you think and even cry.  You wont regret purchasing this movie!!!
B00005M1Y2|1.0|Nice DVD, however I would have prefered a big, fat, WARNING written in bright red letters that stated that this disc was for non-US REgions! THis DVD is for playing REgions OUTSIDE of the US!!!  What does that mean??  It will not play on any US DvD players!!  ugh!
B000W4HJ44|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that we've watched several times already.  It's a fun, feel-good movie that chases away the winter blues.  The dance sequences are exciting, and we just had to buy the soundtrack the songs are so catchy.  Highly recommended.
1401300529|4.0|Having lived in Korea 1960-62, with a father who served in the Korean War, I was eager for the book.  It has always seemed odd that so little was spoken, written or reported about that war.  I confess to hearing the abridged version of it, rather than reading it.  What I heard seemed to me very poorly edited, often repetitive, and rather lopsided in its emphasis on the period till MacArthur was sacked.  It seemed like a first draft instead of a last draft.  That said, Halberstam's reporting is first-rate, and his conclusions about the effect of the Korea War on later foreign policy seem right on.  An important book!
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|Here's some cool trivia:<br /><br />The original 1988 Die Hard is based on a 1979 novel by Roderick Thorp titled [[ASIN:0345287819 Nothing Lasts Forever]], which was a sequel to Thorp's book [[ASIN:0385294697 The Detective]] that was made into the movie [[ASIN:B0007PALXE The Detective]] starring Frank Sinatra in 1968. [[ASIN:B000244EMO Predator]] Director John McTiernan directed Die Hard.<br /><br />In Die Hard, Hans Gruber is played by Alan Rickman, now more famous for his role as Servious Snape in the [[ASIN:B000W4B8NC Harry Potter series]]. Rickman and Jeremy Irons, in my opinion, could easily be confused with each other...especially when they're heavily costumed.<br /><br />Die Hard 2 was based on the book titled 58 Minutes [[ASIN:0812510038 58 Minutes]] by Walter Wager. The plane crash at the beginning of the movie is consisdered one of the most horrific ever filmed (according to [[ASIN:B000T8XYOW Maxim]]).<br /><br />Die Hard 3 has John McTiernan back in the director's seat, and DH3 is the only one of the four to have been written by a screenwriter. It stars Alan-Rickman-act-alike Jeremy Irons as 'the bad guy'.<br /><br />Die Hard 4 is based on a May 1997 [[ASIN:B00005N7TL Wired]] article by John Carlin. DH4 is directed by [[ASIN:B000TGJ80I Underworld]] series master Len Wiseman and stars that dude (Justin Long) who's more popular from his stint in the recent Apple Computer commercials than his past acting roles.<br /><br />The Blu Ray compilation of all four films is a great package. Chances are that you're here (like I was) because you've already seen the first three, and you're wondering if it's worth it to buy the entire collection in order to get the 4th? I'll say this: the fourth (Live Free or Die Hard) stands out as one of the best, if not the best, of the series. So if you've always wanted the Die Hard series in your collection, go with the [[ASIN:B000W4HIY0 Die Hard Collection]].<br /><br />Like the previous 3 movies, in Live Free or Die Hard John McClane (Bruce Willis) is seemingly indestructable, surviving death defying feat after death defying feat. Willis' banter with costar Long is witty and funnier than anything from the first three movies combined. The action is non-stop, and the supporting cast is fabulous (especially [[ASIN:B000O5B4BU Deadwood's]] Timothy Olyphant).<br /><br />Add the collection to your cart or Die Hard.ng death defying feat after death defying feat.

B000YIGNKE|2.0|I agree with the most recent reviewers.  The screenwriter chose to substitute the sublime denouement written by Austen with a most un-Austen-like, undignified chase around Bath, culminating in a public kiss -- Jane would have been mortified!  I'm not a purist if the change improves the product, but this one doesn't.  Perhaps the screenwriter shouldn't have aspired to best Austen.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|It'd get my vote, and the year has only just begun.  Radiohead's new album 'In Rainbows' hearkens back to some of their best work, in every aspect, lyrically and musically.  While not as dark as 'OK Computer', it still manages to evokes a darkness and edginess that appeals to this listener.  I'd say it falls closest to 'Kid A' in style and mood.  Anyways, the album is solid throughout, with not a bad track on the disc, but my favorites are 'Reckoner' and 'House of Cards'.  Radiohead embodies the passion that is missing from much of music today.  I can't speak more highly of them than that.    Some have criticized the band for the packaging of this cd, but I sure appreciate being able to pick the disc up for less than the average cost.  I think Radiohead wants to avoid being too commercial and for that I thank them and congratulate them.    Lastly, if you haven't seen it yet, go find scotch_mist on youtube.  This is a video the band did for New Year's, and features all the songs from this magnificent cd.    I'm very impressed with this cd, and highly recommend it to all music fans.
B000Z27HLS|2.0|Lev Raphael's review said it best, so I'll add only this.  Jane Austen didn't write this novel as a romance novel, but as a parody of one.  This irony escaped the screenwriter as well as Gillian Anderson.  In the book, Tillney's feelings for Catherine remain ambiguous to the end (note to readers: a spoiler comment follows) -- does he propose because he loves her or because his father forced him to court her and he now feels bound by honour to marry her?      Jane Austen was so much more than a romance novelist -- why do adaptations insist on reducing the complexity of her?  I agree with other reviewers -- for the real Jane, try Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, and the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth.  Other adaptations fall too far short.
0765318741|4.0|The story is absolutely FANTASTIC, but beware that this book is I Am Legend coupled with several short stories.  There is no indication of this to be found anywhere.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind except that I was a few \\"chapters\\" past I Am Legend thinking the story just took a massive twist before realizing what was going on.  Do you have any idea how dissatisfying it is to finish a book without knowing it haha?<br /><br />Just something to keep in mind, but aside from that, I fully recommend this book.  I Am Legend is a GREAT story.
0142000655|5.0|When it comes to human's struggle against evil, John Steinbeck has it all. Through the coexistence of Cathy and Sam Hamilton, the two main opposite forces in East of Eden, Steinbeck immediately foreshadows that a moral fight would be the essence of the novel. The book centers on two brothers' struggle to please their father, who then favors one and scorns the other by accepting the gift of only one son. Sounds familiar? Yes, it is the famous story of Cain and Abel. (Reading the fourth chapter of the book of Genesis would greatly help in understanding the plot and its foreshadowing.)    One might wonder: so why base a book on such story? The answer is straight and simple: it is part of us and we tend to deny it. The story of Cain and Abel is the second story accounted in the Bible after that of the Creation, therefore making it one of the most important, original ones. Although being one of the primitive stories, the account of Cain and Abel holds numerous themes found in quotidian life. The opposing characters of Cain and Abel represent the forces of evil and good, respectively, in human nature. While Abel represents the love and innocence in our nature, Cain represents the jealousy and hatred. Abel, as described in Genesis, is a young, innocent shepherd who offered to God \\"the firstborn of his flock and of their fat,\\" which demonstrates his unfailing love for his Creator (NKJV, Gen. 4.4). Because God chose Abel's gift over Cain's, the latter became jealous of his brother and a feeling of hatred started to foment inside of him, resulting in the tragic death of Abel and the unbearable  punishment of Cain.    One of the highlights of this novel centers on the discussion of knowledgeable Lee about the meaning of timshel. According to the original Hebrew translation, the word means \\"thou mayest,\\" a translation that illustrates a human being's ability to choose between Good and Evil. In order to make such a decision, one must first know the difference between each choice. The character of Adam evolves from an obscure, ignorant follower of Cathy's evilness and cajolery, to a potent, dependent man, able to overcome his trepidations and Cathy's temptations. Adam succeeds only after realizing Cathy's genuine persona. Adam's evolution parallels Genesis, which says, \\"Then the Lord God said, `Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil'\\" (NKJV, Gen. 3.22).     The struggle that Adam faces and finally overcomes is a reflection of humanity's ability to overcome any trepidation that it might face daily. In a sense, it gives hope to the hopeless, happiness to the sad, destination to the adventurer, goal to the living, life to all.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Simply put -<br />This movie is superb!<br /><br />If you can't stand the traditional musical film/play genre, this movie is for you.  It's so tastefully done!<br /><br />Broadway has its musicals (and I can't stand many..), but \\"Once\\" is a great film portrayal of the time leading up to making a splendid album.  It also takes viewers along the path of friendship between two musically talented strangers.  It feels so down to earth.  I find this medium to be a fresh way to intertwine original music and film.

B000Y2WAKM|4.0|If you are new to the Eels, this is a fine introduction.  Eels fans may quibble about the best choices for a collection like this, but I like what was chosen here.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Eels, you probably have their albums, and thus you have most of the audio tracks here.  There are still two reasons why you might want to get it.<br /><br />1. (lesser reason) It has two audio tracks that were previously unpublished.  But of course the companion \\"Useless Trinkets\\" collection has 50 B-sides, soundtracks, rarities and unreleased tracks, plus a DVD with six live performances, so that's the one to get for previously unpublished content, if you could only choose one.<br /><br />2. (bigger reason) The companion DVD in Meet the Eels features 12 music videos (one is a live performance).  Some of these videos were previously released on CD singles, but they seem to be higher quality here.  It isn't HD or even modern DVD quality (some of these are >10 years old), but they are much better quality than the tiny versions they put on the CD singles.<br /><br />In particular, the video for \\"Last Stop: This Town\\" is a most imaginative and appealing music video; you'll have to see it to believe it.  Watch in amazement as a carrot... well, that would be spoiling it.<br /><br />About my rating: I would give it 4 1/2 stars if it were an option.  Anthologies are rarely as good as the complete original albums, but this one offers more in the form of the videos.

0142000655|5.0|On first picking up East of Eden, I wondered if I would or could like such a book. After having read Steinbeck's other work, The Pearl, I thought that East of Eden might end up being a long, overly drawn-out description of some vines running along a white wall. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this masterpiece, a great retelling of two classic biblical tales. The characters, if anything else, make this a fantastic read.    Like a good 90% or more of Steinbeck works, East of Eden takes place primarily in the Salinas Valley of northern California. It details the lives of the Trask and Hamilton families, particularly of Adam and Charles Trask--the first generation, and Aron and Cal Trask--the second. Between each set of brothers stands the unequal love of a father, a darkness within a man's heart, and the recurring scar which comes to mark those who are \\"darker.\\" From Adam and Charles to Aron and Cal, both sets of brothers face trials in their relationships, between the dichotomy of love and hate. This varying dynamic, polar in its nature, is touching in its realism. The depth of the characters, from their good sides to their bad, their joys and sorrows and triumphs and jealousies, make each pitiable and sympathetic in their own way. Cal, who is somewhat of a protagonist in the second half, strives to find a balance between the good he wants to see in himself and the bad he knows is there. This battle, in his soul, is easily relatable to--a young boy who wants to be loved, doesn't know who he is, and wants to be more.    Aside from the male figures, one of the other main characters, Cathy Ames, is considered the Eve of the story. While conventionally seen as a figure of pure evil, the bringer of sin into the world and upon men, I find her the most intriguing--and the most inspiring, of all. While she is depicted to commit evil after evil, senselessly drawing men into their dooms, feeling no remorse whatsoever, there lies the greatest hope in Cathy, who like Cal,seems aligned to the dark side in her nature. But for all of her evil, for every terrible act she makes, the hope of something good within her stirred more hope than any other element of the story. Cal, while inspiring in his struggles, is different from the tragically alone Cathy, whose seeming fall into the darkness draws me in more than anyone else. For her, I truly hoped some light would shed.    All in all, I am delighted to have been able to read this novel. Though it was a rather long read, and for academic purposes, it was so enthralling that it drew me in from the get-go. A good two days into it and I was possessed, unable to put it down until I had finished. I would truly have to recommend this novel to anyone who has the time to sit down and plow through 600 pages--it's well worth it.

1847242537|5.0|This is a multi-layered crime book that breaks several rules, all for the better. The title is a misnomer. The original title translates as \\"The Man Who Hated Women\\". It's complex, layered and endlessly engrossing. Every time you think it's coming to a conclusion, it moves to another rewarding track. It doesn't cheat but rewards the reader. Despite the book's relentlessly dark tone, the real sadness is in realizing that no more than the three books Stieg Larsson have written will be published. He died unexpectedly soon after submitting them to his publisher.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|Janis Joplin's [[ASIN:B0000024WN Pearl]] (1971) was recorded during September 1970. The last song they cut was Mercedes Benz, one of two songs on the album written by Janis. It was taped on Oct. 1, 1970, just three days before Janis suddenly died. It's sung a cappella and a little tongue-in-cheek, but the song really does have some \\"social and political import\\" (as Janis says introducing the song) regarding materialism, economic class and religon. It's really sort of sad to hear it sometimes, knowing that she unknowingly had only three days to live at the time. At the end of Mercedes Benz, Janis laughs and says, \\"That's it!\\".<br /><br /> [[ASIN:B0000024WN Pearl]] is a great album, maybe Janis Joplin's best, and it highlights her talent in a variety of musical settings. And what talent she had! She was dramatic, soulful, expressive, tough yet vunerable and beautifully feminine in her own way. A real \\"Pearl\\" (also Janis' self-chosen nickname).<br /><br />The first and only album she recorded with the Full Tilt Boogie Band, [[ASIN:B0000024WN Pearl]] has a cleaner sound, more polished and less experimental than her earlier work. That's not to say the album doesn't rock. It does! The first two songs are good examples. Move Over (written by Joplin) and Cry Baby are both classic Janis, rockin', bluesy and tough.<br /><br />A Woman Left Lonely is slower, as in the slow piano blues tradition, but just as direct and completely satisfying. Half Moon is a lively rocker with funky guitar, spacy piano and a spirited vocal performance from Joplin. It's one of my favorites here. Get It While You Can is another winner that rocks the blues in classic Janis Joplin fashion.<br /><br />The big hit from the album was fellow Texan Kris Kristofferson's Me And Bobby McGee. Janis plays the acoustic guitar herself on this one, and she and the band end the country song with a vigorously wide-open improvisational rock coda.<br /><br />Janis is the star on [[ASIN:B0000024WN Pearl]], and the Full Tilt Boogie Band allows her to shine while providing a competent backdrop for her stirring and genuine vocal performances.

It is like others have said a very light hearted and uplifting album.  As to some of those that are complaining about her voice being modified or made to sound better, you are all idiots to think that any artist goes into a studio, sings their songs and doesn't have them \\"fixed\\" to sound better.  As to the person that stated \\"Gay boys and teenage girls will love this\\", you are also an idiot to stereotype like that.  I happen to be a 26 year old wife and mom to three children.

0393061310|3.0|The book deals with universal history using a new approach, and I think that Diamond does a very good job of dealing with the topic, making the book fun to read and providing food for the mind. Certainly, the books presents some important limitations as commented in other reviews: the deterministic bias, the lack of consideration about free human will in the study of human history (I am sorry, but explaining the extinction of dinosaurs cannot the same as finding the causes of the conquest of America by Europeans), the quick dismissal of facts that contradict his theory (his explanation about the difference between the history of Europe and China is, at best, poor, at worst, pathetic).<br />Overall, the book is worthy of being read. But I am afraid that 'Collapse', his following work, is probably a continuation of the same stuff. Do not count me in for reading 400 pages of the same story. One book was enough.

B000YAFJYS|5.0|(The following review refers to the original French version.)     \\"Persepolis\\" is a French animation with a bitter-sweet story. It is about Marjane Satrapi (or \\"Marji\\"), only daughter to Iranian family living in Tehran. This is an autobiographical film that covers the life of Marjane Satrapi (who wrote the original graphic novels and also co-directed this film with Vincent Paronnaud) from the year 1978 when Marji was a 9-year-old girl who is a big fan of Bruce Lee. The time was just before the Revolution happens in Iran and Marji's coming-of-age story unfolds against the background of the modern Iranian history since then.    The fast-paced narrative of the film is brilliant, especially in the first half which shows the impact the Iranian Revolution gave to the ordinary people, all seen from the perspective of Marji (Chiara Mastroianni as teenager and adult). Marji's parents (voice by Simon Abkarian and Catherine Deneuve) welcome the big social changes at first, but soon start to fear as their acquaintances start to leave the country or just vanish. Then a war breaks out.     The film is historical and even political, but its story has also a personal aspect which would appeal universally. Marji slowly realizes what is going on around her after the Revolution, but naturally rebellious girl Marji no longer feels comfortable. Knowing that Marji talked back to her teacher at school, her worried parents (and they have to worry because they know the worst possible scenario waiting for her) decide to send her to Vienna. But still Marji senses that she does not belong to Europe either....    Episodic nature of the film may be a little disappointing to some viewers. Most of the European characters are unmemorable, compared with the colorful Iranian characters surrounding Marji, especially Marji's wise grandmother (voice by Danielle Darrieux) who is outstanding. Obviously Marji's story (real-life or fictional) is very large and the film's second half would be better with less episodes or the film needs more time to allow us to get emotionally involved with the story, its romantic part in particular.    Except three brief segments about the Paris airport, the film is shot in black and white, or I should say, black in combination of white and grey. The hand-drawn type animation creates the mood of each scene effectively with sparse soundtrack - sometime grim, sometimes funny and often beautiful (opening credit should not be missed).    \\"Persepolis\\" is a film about a life of a person. The person herself may not be perfect, but her story is universal.

B000002B7U|5.0|After reading bad reviews about this album for years, I finally feel the need to defend it. This was the first Ozzy album I ever bought, 22 years ago. After finally collecting everything Ozzy since then, I have to say this is his one album I can still listen to from beginning to end. Ozzy doesn't like these songs himself because the album was rushed, so he vowed not to play these songs in concert (I could be wrong about this, but that's what I read somewhere). But this is the only album from Ozzy that I have on my ipod in it's entirety, and to this day I still listen to all the songs. I can't say that about any other Ozzy album (although Ozzmosis and No More Tears come close). It's just a great, great album. Are there any individual songs on here that will be listened to 100 years from now? Probably not, but I still think, song for song, it's one of his best albums.
B00005JLK1|3.0|I will say right off that I am not a fan of horror movies, especially the gory kind.  Which this is.  But I was a captive audience and, to my surprise, it was better than I expected.  The story was predictable but the film itself was fairly well done with enough horrific special special effects to please any blood thirsty adolescent movie goer.  The movie reminded me a tiny bit of \\"Alien\\" with a strong female character surviving while the men were picked off.  I hated all the male characters, so this worked well for me.<br /><br />The bottom line is:  Do not spend a lot for this movie.  Rent it or buy it cheap to watch on Halloween or when you have some friends over who are getting ready to leave for a cruise.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|It is hard to imagine why anyone would make a film of Jane Austen's Persuasion without any respect for the majesty of her words.  This production pales in comparison to the complexity of the book and serves as  a reminder of how wonderful  the 1995 film staring Amanda Root was.<br />  Just a couple thoughts: no well-bred young woman would run wildly  through  the streets, certainly not Anne Elliot. And why have the book end  with Wentworth purchasing Kellynch?  Isn't the reason that Mr. Elliot is in the book because he is going to inherit the entailed property and wants to insure any way he can that nothing comes between him and his inheritance?  He courts Mrs. Clay because he thinks that Sir Elliot may marry her and produce a new heir who could then inherit in his stead. The ending was just plain dumb.  This film lacks the tenderness, the thoughtfulness, and the regret that are the hallmarks of the story.
0060855924|5.0|I first read The Color of Magic years ago when it first appeared in the USA and I have eagerly awaited each new Discworld book.  I envy anybody who is new to these books because they will have the pleasure of reading their way through this delightful series.  It is one of the few series where the sequels actually GETS BETTER.  Discworld evolves, often in unexpected directions.  This culminates in the newest Discworld book, [[ASIN:0061161640 Making Money (Discworld)]]<br /><br />Like all good fantasy, Practchett's work functions on two levels.  First there is the level where a wizard is a wizard is a wizard.  But as the books go on, Discworld begins to slyly reflect the problems of our own world.  And solves them.  Makes me wish Lord Ventinari could run our own planet for a while!<br /><br />The only quarrel I have with the books is that I would like my favorite characters to return or at least hang around a little longer.  I always want more of the Luggage.  To his credit, though, Pratchett does not hesitate to finish up with a well loved character and come up with new ones.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Of course the Holy Grail for American HMOs is maximization of profits, not preventative or universal health care. Moore's Sicko is probably the best way for burnt out Americans to get that message: through entertainment. One could only hope that the film's impact will be felt at the polls.<br /><br />Nixon, one of our sickest psychos, began the dismantling. Now, who will be the hero or heroine to make their name in presidential history and dig us out of our current health care barbarism? That 'hero' will probably have to see the average joes and janes in America screaming at the top of their infected lungs and demanding the same health coverage your average congressman receives.<br /><br />As one of the English Labour Party old-timers Moore interviewed said-- and I'm paraphrasing here--, if we can construct an economy designed to kill (referring to WW II), surely we can spend the same amount of money on national health.<br /><br />Hopefully in my lifetime.

B000GIXE4K|5.0|I don't think it's possible to listen to this album and not have goose bumps crawling all over the flesh. Lately Nightwish has been my music of choice and I can't seem to get enough, the louder the better! Often I find myself craving their mélange of rock, symphonic power metal and opera like vocals - even at work, with headphones on of course, don't want to scare the socks off my coworkers, and I am constantly lost and mesmerized by the harmony of vocals and power that sound like a rock concert in tall halls of Valhalla.    The guitars on this album shred the air like hungry sharks and the vocals are haunting. Much to my delight I can certainly see that Tuomas is greatly influenced by movie scores. I adore them too so to me music doesn't get any better than this, and for a kid who grew up watching Conan movies and war epics this music pumps my blood in all the right places.    This album is very operatic, but also grandiose and full of metal - and even better, it's from a live concert, so it really sounds real. With the fans clapping and people screaming I feel connected, almost as if I was there myself. The lead singer - Tarja is a brilliant artist, even thought she is no longer with this band - I recommend her solo album \\"My Winter Storm\\"  for the fans of this genre. Her first single off that CD is coincidentally called \\"I walk Alone\\" maybe she misses this kick a@@ band...    - Kasia S.
6305327041|4.0|With todays film makers more concerned about the latest SFX technology rather than actual story, Four Rooms is a great reminder that people have been making quality movies long before the digital revolution. Instead of trying to distract you with usless 3D characters and HD backgrounds, Fours Rooms uses script development, formidable acting and the lost art actually having a plot to deliver this rollercoaster ride of entertainment. With some really outstanding performances from this truely All-Star cast and showcasing the directorial talents of Allison Anders, Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and Alexandre Rockwell, Four Rooms is a light hearted, tounge-in-cheek picture that doesn't take itself too seriously. Fans who enjoyed it back in 95' will find that none of it's sparkle has faded and will still find something to laugh at even now.
0393061310|5.0|Diamond proposes that geography is the ultimate cause for explaining why societies developed at different rates across different countries. The idea is not new, but Diamond's book is probably the only book of its kind to cover it in detail while making it accessible to non-specialists and non-academics.    Although the book is far from perfect (and Diamond addresses many of its weaknesses throughout), the central thesis is supported extremely well and deserves a perfect rating. It is a very important book that should be read widely because it deals with a topic of immense importance. It has tremendous explanatory power about the world and acts as a formidable rebuttal to theories based primarily on inherent biological factors for explaining history.    Some quibbles:    1) The book is often repetitive. This may have been done to drill the point home, but it was not necessary    2) The idea that large mammals became extinct because they were not afraid of humans (because they evolved in isolation) in the New World, just seems absurd since there are many animals that evolve apart from humans but are nevertheless afraid of us. A combination of ice age and hunters without understanding of conversvation and preservation likely led to their extinction, and that's that. It may also be the foundation of such concepts of \\"respecting Mother Nature\\" that Natives learned as a result of their unwitting decimation of former game animals.    3) The role of human biology is ignored a priori in the book's hypothesis. Since we know that individuals have had tremendous effects on the course of history, biological factors also must serve as ultimate causes for the shaping of societies and history. I realize that this is a much less tractable factor than environmental causes, so it's understandable to focus only on the latter, but there can be no doubt about its significance.
0553584537|5.0|Looking for a new author, I picked this up in a bookstore and hunkered down with it.  Once I started it, I could hardly put it down.  So often with a lot of books, I end up skimming pages waiting to get to another good part, bored with what I'm reading but this book kept me turning pages, kept me completely interested, kept me flipping pages wondering what would happen next.  I never got bored, I never lost interest and it was a welcome change for me in a book.  I love Gardner's style of writing.  Dialogue was good, plot was good, whole book was good.  So I came to Amazon to see what else she'd written and am happy to see she'll keep me busy for awhile.  Can't wait to read another one.
B000GRUMPU|3.0|Poseidon is a great ship, a massive cruise liner with all the amenities, a disco, a lounge singer, a giant ballroom, and all sorts of top of the line bells, whistles, and ritz. It doesn't matter how much you spit shine the Titanic, however, it's still going down. Naturally, a tragedy is about to strike the ship.<br /><br />Evidently there are things called \\"rogue\\" waves, gigantic walls of water that come from nowhere and are impossible to predict. This \\"rogue\\" wave blasts the ship, flipping it on its side, and nearly capsizing the Poseidon. The buildup and explanation of what's happening is non-existent during this portion of the movie.<br /><br />Eventually, the ship turns upside-down, like a cup in the sink. What follows is a race to climb up through the bottom of the boat, an escape from the probability of a watery grave.<br /><br />The acting is neither the saving grace nor the downfall of the movie; it's simply adequate. There was fairly little character development, letting the viewer establish the character traits from the action on screen.<br /><br />Kurt Russell plays the tough guy, concerned father, expedition leader fairly well. He exudes strength and confidence while displaying highly uncommon heroism and sacrifice. He provides at least two genuine goose-bump scenes.<br /><br />Josh Lucas is the confident loner - who plays poker professionally - he's the brash risk taker desperate to exit, willing to risk it all.<br /><br />The rest of the escape crew fills in the cracks admirably, providing tension, excitement, and a helping hand in the escape.<br /><br />The added bonuses to this movie, of course, are that Leonardo DiCaprio is not a star, and an old lady doesn't mindlessly chuck a priceless diamond into the ocean at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is slightly anticlimactic, and somewhat unreal (who knew there was so much material on board of a ship that was incendiary), but it's a very good thrill ride nonetheless. The ending is what the viewer wants, and it's a worthwhile movie that had several exciting scenes, some stunning CGI, and enough action to enthrall.several exciting scenes, some stunning CGI, and enough action to enthrall.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|In this latest BBC rendition, the characters of Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth lack depth, but Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones still manage a more than creditable job in their portrayals.  Hawkins is believable as the chronically sad baronet's daughter who turned her back on true love, and Penry-Jones really does look like a man whose heart was broken.  What class the film has can be ascribed to these two.    That said, this film is horrid.  Uninspired screenplay adaptations have been spoiling Jane Austen novels since the early 1940s, but this latest Persuasion screenplay by Simon Burke deserves special censure.  The plot is disjointed and the characters shallowly drawn, but the screenplay's worst offense is that it deprives the film of the grace and wit which abound throughout the novel.  The novel Persuasion is so packed with sparkling dialogue and astute observation of manners that a competent screenplay would merely have to trim it to keep it real and convey its emotion; Burke's effort doesn't get it done.  By eliminating critical dialogue and presenting major scenes out of sequence he manages only to confuse and frustrate viewers, and his apparent attempt to make the characters more modern causes them instead to seem inauthentic.  Anne Elliot is a sensible, confident woman--but she is still the daughter of a baronet.  To present her, for example, sprinting through the streets of Bath in search of Wentworth--while the supposedly crippled Mrs. Smith runs beside her to fill in the neglected plot line--is beyond ludicrous.    At 90 minutes the film is too short and required too much editing, but the 1995 BBC Films version (starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds) was a mere 104 minutes and still came out a masterpiece because its faithful Nick Dear screenplay sprang to life under Roger Michell's direction.  This latest effort relied upon director Adrian Shergold, best known for his work on Inspector Morse episodes for Masterpiece Theatre's Mystery series.But Shergold could work no magic here.  Burke's screenplay was simply too full of holes.    On the strength of the actors' work, this turkey gets two grudging stars.

0440419514|5.0|I saw the movie \\"Golden Compass\\" this Christmas and, must admit, I was fairly impressed by Philip Pullman's parallel world of dæmons, witches and Panserbjørne. My wife and I have always been fans of fantastical worlds and have travelled them widely as often as our day could spare us...while I am more into epics like The Lord of The Rings, Beowulf, Kalevala etc. my wife is an ardent fan of Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia et al. Last year, with Harry Potter coming to an end (hopefully), she had been filling the void with Bartimaeus Trilogy when His Dark Materials came along. The story involves fantasy elements but alludes to a broad range of ideas from fields such as physics, philosophy, and theology. We found something for both of us...For my part, I liked the epicish approach (evident from grandeur of scale and title of the series which is suggestively derived from, again, an epic), dealing with much broader subjects through a gripping storyline. Rest is not to be told, only to be read and experienced.    As for Amazon's service in delivering the order, it was again, I must say, most impressive. I only wish they shipped more products to my country as even from across the ocean there service is impressive and flawless.

1594489505|4.0|Dedicated to Afghan women, this story vividly traces the exclusion of women from public life, their lack of human rights and gender equality, and the suffering they have long endured before and during Taliban rule.  Khaled Hosseini lets us sense the social shame that underage girls experience the moment they are first ordered as wives to hide themselves forever behind a burqa that trips their feet. The idiotic and self-serving justifications given by fundamentalist Islamists for why women must be rendered invisible, powerless and nearly blind are as grotesque and disturbing as the inhumane forms of mistreatment these women regularly sustain.                   Streaking rockets and fighter jets have replaced the kites of Hosseini's earlier book, \\"The Kite Runner\\" (page 206). Searing descriptions of tragic abuse accompanied by thoughtfully placed summaries of history, politics and the continuing impact of long-established tribal divisions together make this book instructive and at least as engrossing as its predecessor. It's an irresistible page-turner; a flawless, smooth and fast-paced story of suffering amid striving and prayers that eventually culminates in a rejoicing of freedom. A broad mix of characters  introduces us to a wide range of opinions about Afghanistan, and, yes, there are a few men who want women to realise their aspirations and express their hearts and minds but they too are imprisoned by the dictates of the same social and political structures that oppress women.      It is nigh impossible to read this book without asking oneself and whoever is nearby for answers that no one actually has. Page after page, this story begs a balancing of the ethical rule that says we must help strangers in dire straits with the other rule that says countries need to be left to work out their own destinies. (Focusing on Afghanistan while an entire population in Darfur starves is an example of our duplicity.)  I still don't know why a Communist coup in Afghanistan later supported by a Soviet invasion was so bad a thing that the USA armed the Mujahideen to resist it while an American-led invasion in 2001 against those very people who resisted Communism and whom the US had earlier armed would garner our trust, funding and applause. It's all so perplexing.             Against this background of essential yet unanswered questions, this story, as compelling and enjoyable as it is, seems too pat and predictable, as though the author is pushing a neat agenda. Readers and female characters are handed what they would like to believe - that the Taliban was squelched in 2001 and that Afghan women became freer to make their own decisions. My disappointment with this story is that by ending it in 2003, 4 years before this book was published and just two years into a war that had continued for 6 years by the 2007 publication date, the author has left readers with the mistaken impression that Afghan women, on account of NATO's action, were freed of the cultural forces and institutions that destroy their lives.     Between 2003 and 2007, a lot happened - the resurgence of the Taliban, a loss of influence by our military forces, the development of new terrorist methods, the increase in roadside bombings, kidnappings, protests over soldiers' killings of civilians; the hundreds of attacks upon women students and teachers and their schools; the self-immolation of women to escape their misery; a lack of food and health services, and the doubt registered by citizens of NATO countries as to the efficacy of presuming that our military action stands any chance of altering cultural beliefs and objectives that are so far outside our grasp.  In 2006, Karzai approved a proposal to reestablish a Department for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, a notorious Taliban symbol of misogyny and arbitrary abuses leveled mainly against women and girls.    A brief addendum from Hosseini, one of my favourite authors, just acknowledging what has happened since 2003 would have made it clear that the NATO mission, by the time this book was published, had abysmally failed. Or even a note to the effect that women are still working and risking their lives to attain the state of freedom that this story purports them to have been given. Such a note would not have hurt his story at all but simply allowed readers to put his story in a contemporary context.

0142000655|5.0|Amazing. Six hundred pages of amazement. This novel is a page turner and will keep you occupied. With an equal distribution of suspenseful plot and biblical allusions, John Steinbeck adds a twist to the well known Cain and Abel story, creating two generations of brothers who endure all, injury, betrayal, isolation, curiosity, faithfulness, appreciation, doubt, and deceit.     This story begins with Charles and Adam Trask who are brothers who constantly bicker for their father's attention. When Cyrus, their father, publicly favors Adam over Charles, Charles becomes consumed by his jealousy and goes so far as an attempted murder. After this incident, Charles and Adam are not the same towards each other again; however, isolation and much time apart have partially repaired this broken brotherly bond. One day Adam meets Cathy, a beautiful yet weak girl, who he nurtures and eventually marries. Cathy and Adam have twins, Cal and Aron who are representations of Cain and Abel. Similar to the process that their father went through, Cal and Aron also bicker for Adam's attention. Since Aron is liked more by others and seems to have a bright future (his incredible knowledge that will land in college), Cal wonders why he cannot be like Aron, and so he begins finding answers by searching for his runaway mother, Cathy. When Cal learns about Cathy's real character, he wonders if a part of her is within him and if it is causing all the pain and darkness he feels. He wants to find himself and discover who he really is instead of whom people think he is.     Based off of popular biblical stories, this novel is incredibly well written, yet easy enough to read without a dictionary handy. Despite its length, this novel is not drawn out and the events occur fast enough to forget about its length.
0224062522|5.0|This novel is an astonishing achievement from one of Britain's leading modern day novelists. It contains three very individual pieces of descriptive writing. The first is about family tensions in an upper-middle class English family in 1935 - in particular the tensions between two sisters and with a handsome young man who is suitor to the elder. There is an undercurrent if not of menace certainly of unease and when the climax comes it is no surprise. Here passions, mendacity, jealousy, snobbery and ultimately violence bubble inexorably to the surface. The second piece describes what happens when the grievously hard done by young man from the first part gets caught up in the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940. Again the description is brilliant - harrowingly complete and at times horrifically graphic in its gory detail.  The third part is a description of how the now adult younger sister copes not just with the aftermath of the tragedy of 1935 but also with her determined effort to atone, partly by training as a nurse in a military hospital. The strengths of \\"Atonement\\" are the gripping plot, brilliant writing and the fine portrayal of both the principal and the supporting characters.

B000VUDSH6|4.0|I did not enjoy the previous effort of a Benny Chan directed Jackie Chan film in \\"New Police Story\\" that I was definitely worried about a \\"Three Men and a Baby\\" inspired effort.  The result was mixed, but going in with low expectations I was pleasantly surprised.  \\"Rob-B-Hood\\" (US release name is a bizarre name change to \\"Robin-B-Hood\\" though in this movie there is no stealing from the rich to give to the poor; neither title is very good) is the third film in the collaboration between Benny Chan and Jackie Chan and Benny's first attempt at a comedic action film.  While this film was successful in Asia it was not theatrically released in North America and most of Europe.    Jackie Chan and Louis Koo Tin-Lok star as mediocre bad guys Thongs and Octopus.  Jackie Chan tired of stereotypical nice guy roles wanted to play a criminal, though his character Thongs is a burglar and compulsive gambler, the \\"good guy\\" nature of his character comes through quite clearly and his performance does not veer far from most of Jackie's previous personae. This role is a good step in broadening his experience as an actor.  Octopus is a married womanizer who works with Thongs.  He married very young to Pak Yin (the terminally cute Charlene Choi) and is doing his best to woo wealthy young women while avoiding his wife.  Thongs and Octopus both work under the guidance of the Landlord (Michael Hui) a conservative criminal who hoards his theft while the other two spend their \\"earnings\\".    The Landlord has had his loot stolen by another criminal (he suspects everyone after this) so he allows himself to get contracted to a nefarious case to kidnap a baby for seven million dollars and give the infant to the possible grandfather to test if the baby is his sons (the son is dead and currently frozen in a very expensive decorated freezer).  Thongs and Octopus both need the money so they acquiesce and help the Landlord with the felony.  Of course, Thongs and Octopus, through a partially botched kidnapping attempt, are forced to take care of the cute defecating infant until they can reestablish getting the kid to who hired them.  And, of course, they get attached to the baby (I cannot believe the baby got nominated for Hong Kong Film Award's Best New Performer category).      Some of the negatives of this film include the ill-defined female characters (it seems they would have been better characterization in the original three-hour workprint, but that meant a whole lot more exposition); especially Gao Yuan-Yuan's Melody character who I had trouble figuring out what her relationship with Thongs was the first time I watched this.  Some of the baby poop jokes were overdone as well as some of the infant's scenes in general (reportedly the child was an enfant terrible on the set; delaying shooting and helping push the film over budget).  There is only so much you can do with a babbling, spitting, crying child with flatulence.  Yuen Biao's Inspector Steve Mok character is definitely underused (as well as Michael Hui), though at least he gets more than a cameo in this film.  And then there is the horrible overuse of Pepsi advertising including one scene where Jackie slides down a pole revealing the largest Pepsi graffiti I have ever seen.      I did end up liking this film though.  There is a certain congenial innocence with the lead characters that works well in this comedic action hybrid.  In most Jackie Chan movies there are little stunts that sometimes seem as throwaways but are quite dangerous and are done with Keatonesque ease.  In this movie Jackie slides down a staircase column and props himself up with ease at the end.  If he fell on the wrong side he could have been seriously injured, but since it is so effortlessly it seems so simple.  Jackie Chan has used more wires in his stunts and it definitely shows in this film, but I do not fault him for it, since his body cannot handle the punishment like it used to.  The stunt where he jumps from air conditioner toair conditioner to the bottom of the street is impressive (even if a wire was used) and his and Louis Koo's stunts in the amusement park owned by the grandfather (location was Ocean Park) were quite good.  In fact Jackie was said to be impressed of Koo who was willing to do many of his own stunts in the movie.    There could have been more fighting in this movie but there is a good scene in the apartment of Jackie between Jackie, Yuen Biao, Ken Lo and more.  It is inspired by a similar scene in Project A (this is also mentioned in the Benny Chan commentary), but still pleasant.  While there are many faults in this film and I think that many action purists will not like this film, I found much that was enjoyable from the comedy to the action and stunts.  Now please Jackie no more movies with babies.    ***½/*****    The extras on the Dragon Dynasty DVD are quite good though they have stupendously stupid names.  The best is a 39 minute interview with Jackie Chan named \\"Crashing the Hood.\\"  In this he talks about how he wanted to be more serious as an actor and how he wanted to play more of a bad guy (this would be repeated on most of the extras) and how he had trouble passing the script through China.  He talks about how he wants to work with more of his Peking school brothers (Sammo Hung and Yuen Wah) and some of his experiences with Michael Hui on \\"Cannonball Run.\\"  He even talks about his changing belief in CGI, how he channeled his Mom's stroke into this character and his non-use of storyboarding.  He does make a mistake stating that this is his first main bad guy role (that would be \\"Killer Meteors\\" (1977) plus he did a couple of \\"thug\\" roles even earlier in his career).  The most telling quote is when he states \\"I control the whole movie\\" dispelling any notion of the director as auteur for this film especially since this movie is produced by Jackie's company JCE Movies Limited.      \\"The Hand That Mocks The Cradle\\" is a 16 minute interview with Benny Chan thatrepeats much of what is in the commentary except that he does state that Jackie Chan micromanages much less now then he did when he first directed him in \\"Who Am I.\\"  \\"Baby Boomer: A featurette with costar Conroy Chan\\" (14m) is interesting because of so much of what Conroy actually does.  He is an X-Games promoter, was an electrical engineer in college, is a rap group member and has an Australian accent.  However, he has a small role in the film.  \\"Playtime for Adults: On the Site of Robin B. Hood\\" (22m) and \\"Robin-B-Hood: An Original Making Of\\" (22m) are typical \\"making of\\" fare that were originally (along with the director's commentary) put out on the R3 release.  Luckily those two features have scenes of Yuen Biao being interviewed.    Now where are the deleted scenes?    The audio commentary by Benny Chan (with two interviewers who do not state their names), which was ported over from the R3 disc, is informative if not a bit dry.  The Dragon Dynasty cover has a mistake in advertising stating that Bey Logan is on the commentary.  He is not -- to the condemnation of some and to the happiness of others.  Benny Chan talks much about how many scenes were cut (the work print of the film was three hours long; though he states he prefers the shorter version; thank goodness) and that most of the cut scenes were non-action.  He also talks about some of the influence of Project A and Winners and Sinners.  It was the first comedy for Benny Chan and Benny talked about how the baby was very difficult - this was echoed in much of the extras.  Most of the commentary was scene-by-scene discussing where the missing scenes were, who some of the cameo actors are and his personal feelings on several scenes such as his struggling with the rationale of the \\"shocking\\" scene toward the end.

0345350499|2.0|Your first reaction to this book may go along the lines of \\"wow, this is long\\", and I completely agree with that statement, this book feels like it never ends. Sure the ideas are great and the feminism and twist on Arthurian legend are great additions, but I still cannot get over its length. Nine hundred pages is an unnecessary length.    In this lengthy novel, a different perspective of the often told Arthurian legend is present as it is a narrative from Morgaine's perspective. The plot is definitely suspenseful and interesting, but when it is stretched to cover nine hundred pages, it becomes boring. Morgaine's step brother Arthur, King Arthur of Camelot, weds Gwenhwyfar who has a love interest with Lancelot. On the other hand, Morgaine is also in love with Lancelot; typical love triangle. Well maybe not so typical because here comes the twist: Morgaine bears Arthur's son, Mordred, yes Arthur, as in step brother Arthur. Eventually Arthur and Mordred, his son, have a showdown, but you must read this incredibly never ending novel to find out what happens next. If you are an impatient person, the internet is always an option.    The Arthurian legend is actually a very interesting legend, but if you have never been exposed to its wonders, do not read this book because it may forever ruin your opinion and it will cause you to forget what this legend is all about because there is too much information in this giant novel to recall anything.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|\\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a nicely done screen adaptation of one of Jane Austen's earliest novels. The familiar elements of a Jane Austen are here, along with a surprising dollop of satire.<br /><br />The heroine, young Catherine Morland (played with appropriate wide-eyed innocence by Felicity Jones), a middle class addict of gothic novels, is invited by wealthy family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen to accompany them to Bath. Bath is the big city for young Catherine, who is dazzled by the shops, the night life, and the young men.<br /><br />In the course of her travels in Bath with Mrs. Allen and with young friend Isabella, Catherine meets and is almost immediately wooed by two very different gentlemen. The aggressive and rather obnoxious John Thorpe is brother to Isabella, who shares Catherine's taste in Gothic novels and who is about to become engaged to Catherine's brother. The Thorpes are under the impression that Catherine's family has money. The second gentlemen is Henry Tilney, quiet, unassuming, yet witty and with an air of mystery about him. Henry's father, the dour and forbidding General Tilney, shares the impression that Catherine comes from money.<br /><br />Catherine finds Henry and his sister Elinor to be better company, and is ultimately invited to the family seat of Northanger Abbey, where Henry's mother died a few years earlier. The air of mystery about the Abbey excites Catherine's already overheated imagination, and she puts at risk her budding relationship with Henry by entering the forbidden chambers of the dead mother. Her thoughtless act triggers unhappy confrontations with Henry and with General Tilney. A saddened Catherine returns home, vowing to put Gothic romance behind, only to get another chance at happiness.<br /><br />\\"Northanger Abbey\\" features excellent period costumes and authentic sets. The movie is fairly brisk at just 90 minutes and seems to be hurrying itself along in the last half hour, during the scenes at Northanger Abbey. The acting is good to excellent, especially Carey Mulligan as the selfish and duplicitious Isabella and Felicity Jones as the innocent and imaginative but good-hearted Catherine. This movie is highly recommended as good entertainment for fans of Jane Austen and PBS's Masterpiece Theater.is good to excellent, especially Carey Mulligan as the selfish and duplicitious Isabella and Felicity Jones as the innocent and imaginative but good-hearted Catherine.

6304907648|4.0|After The Silence of the Lambs and exactly in the same year as Seven, Copycat had some strong competition on the market of serial killer films. Hence this one has to look for originality because the rhythm has to be the same and it is. First the common points. The main cop is a woman (The Silence of the Lambs). She gets the help of a convicted murderer who is in prison (The Silence of the Lambs). There is some enigma that determines the series of murders in order, in nature and in all particular details (Seven). When the \\"model\\" is found, then you can run ahead of the murderer (Seven). Here the model is a lecture delivered by one of the protagonists, Dr Helen Hudson, on serial killers. The rhythm and the peripeties are good and well devised. Then the original elements are essential to compete with the others. It is just as gross as the others though some images are slightly curbed, hence for maybe a slightly younger audience. The profiling is very interesting though slightly rudimentary. We can assume the killer had a domineering mother, but it is not that clear. This mother is reproduced in his wife he neglects completely and he tames into finally killing her by killing other women as exemplified and listed in the lecture of the Doctor in criminology, Helen Hudson. Then he follows two lines: his liberation from his mother and wife which will take several substitute murders to bring to the end; and the series or list of serial killers Helen Hudson has provided him along with her audience with. At the same time this film is very clear about the police inside story and how right decisions (not to kill a menacing criminal for example) may lead to the death of a cop. It shows how easily fooled some simple cops can be. They are not great brains and they neglect their assigned duty for reasons that are beyond understanding. But the film also has weak points, particularly one. At the beginning and at the end Helen Hudson is confronted to a murderer in exactly the same situation. We are never explained how she managed to escape the first time, and she did since the criminal in that case is her \\"informer\\" in prison. And the situation the second time  is difficult to accept and the murderer makes a sloppy mistake by not realising the cop he shot twice in her chest did not bleed and hence is not dead, at worst stunned because in such a situation a cop is necessarily wearing her bullet proof jacket. It is those details that cost the film the excellence the two others I quoted before have. It is well done, entertaining, thrilling, but a few details are slightly loose.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesation.

B00125WAWS|5.0|`The Great Debaters' offers what great movie viewing is all about.  Based on a true story, the film takes us to Wiley, an African-American Methodist college in Texas during the Depression in 1935.  Inspiring, harrowing, and uplifting, the film gives proper transcendence especially during a time and place that didn't offer many breaks.    We are first introduced to Professor Polson (Denzel Washington), a tenacious idealist and poet.  As professor at Wiley and debate coach, he hardly yields on any of his principles.  Inspired by the man who is named for the heinous lynching, Polson tells his debate recruits that it was in Lynch's best interests to keep Black people, \\"Physically strong, but psychologically weak.\\"  It is with this explanation that we understand his zealous approach to his debate team, and why he makes their training so rigorous.      Entering the field are forty-five tryouts, of which, only four will be selected:  two representatives and two alternates.  Of the three who make it, we get to know Henry Lowe (Nate Parker) a charismatic and bright figurehead who is easily distracted by beautiful women and hard liquor.  Joining him are Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), the first young woman to join the debate team, and James Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker)  forever young at age 14, but an ever resourceful scholar and son of a minister, James Farmer, Sr. (Forrest Whitaker).  [No real life relations.]  As he notices a romance start to blossom between his teammates, his resentment grows. As the one who researches many of the arguments Henry and Samantha provide on the podium,  he is put on the sidelines both in terms of the limelight and the love light.     As you might guess, Wiley enjoys a certain amount of success, and the price of success is opposition.  Polson spends a great deal of his time and rhetorical talent organizing a sharecroppers' union, much to the chagrin of Sheriff Dozier (John Heard) who won't have unrest in his sleepy Texas town.  In one scenethe Farmer family is making a trek by car on a rural country road as they pass a poor white farm.  The children who seem so mischievous run alongside the car as they pass along, unaccustomed to seeing a \\"Negro\\" with an automobile.  Perhaps distracted by the nearby children, he runs over a pig, and in a quietly intense exchange between Farmer, Sr. and the owner, is extorted of a month's paycheck.  This reminded me of a similar scene in the 1980's movie, `Centennial,' and showed the contrast between a good film with a similar theme and a great one.    In another part, the debate team makes their way by night to their debate destination when they come across a truly horrible sight.  What they see through the windshield reveals a mob of white men who don't like having their heinous deeds brought to light.  Shaken, they each try to come to cope with their discovery as they often lose focus and courage in the face of Polson's opposition and the violence laid before them.    Always kept in check by their unyielding leader, the debate team holds out for all possible opportunity.  Audacious but unflinching, Polson invites Harvard to a debate match. One of the master strokes of the movie is how the debates and their topics match the action that goes on all around them.  Show and tell is mixed expertly for a meaningful movie experience.     `The Great Debaters' is a top-echelon movie experience.  Although it is reminiscent of movies like [[ASIN:B000059TFO Mississippi Burning]], [[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)]], and [[ASIN:B000G1R38U Akeelah and the Bee]] it captures a fulfilling true life story in a way that doesn't feel like rehash or contain a wasted scene. (Directed by Denzel Washington and screenplay by Robert Eisele)

B000K15VSA|5.0|There are enough versions of this movie to give me a headache, and I love this film. If you are anything but a hardcore lover of this movie, you do not need to purchase the high end five disc set in a plastic case with skimmer model, movie cel, and origami unicorn; you can simply purchase the final cut dvd, enjoy a remastered classic movie set to the Director's standards and be done (and none the worse for wear). I had to have the complete case with cheesy accessories.
B000YKFJ66|3.0|This was an excellent idea for a movie that simply fell short.  The concept is incredible and it lends itself to endless jokes, gimmicks, and plot twists that simply weren't there.  In the end, this movie came out only so-so.  Nicolas Cage was fine (though his hair is getting stranger as he gets older), Julianne Moore was ok but her character was not terribly well developed, and Jessica Biel was cute, again her character was not so interesting.  The plot could have been bigger and more believable, the effects were fine and probably the best part of the movie, and the acting was sub par.  I would recommend you ignore this title much like the box office did, unless you have absolutely nothing else to watch.
0060763892|5.0|First I read the book and then I listened to the audio book because the voices of the characters sounded so unique. While reading the Judas Strain, each character comes to life from a unique personality. Each personality fuels their actions. An old adage says that character is destiny. In his own style, Rollings shows us how personality propels the individual into action and down a path to fate. He doesn't pause to ponder the difference between character and personality. Rollins tells a story that requires lightning speed reactions and extremely on-your-feet fast thinking.<br /><br />Rollings's characters are foisted into situations where they must rush to solve unusually complicated scientific puzzles. He surprises readers, though, because he subverts the thriller genre by developing characters particularly in terms of how their personality influences their actions, their decisions, and ultimately their survival. Beneath the scientific and historical themes, this element in his writing strikes me as his signature ingredient in storytelling in all of his novels. He has mastered the art of `historic-scientific thriller' and takes this one step further with his subtle character developments that propels the rocket-fueled action.<br />As in his novels, the stories do not delve particularly into deep psychological insight, but they do show how unique personalities collide or unite, fall in love or seek to destroy or move with the mental agility to handle seemingly insolvable scientific mysteries.
B000SQJ2SC|4.0|Kanye West is a genius.  Not only does he flow with a barbed wit, he is able to take a variety of forms to add to his hip-hop, rap base.<br /><br />His latest C.D. `Graduation' picks up where `Late Registration' left off.  His theme demonstrates the difference between our dreams and life's disappointing realities.  Slicker than his last outing, Kanye's titles tell much of the story, but his lyrics nail the subject matter thoroughly.  Even the artwork tells his audience volumes.  Not as punchy as `Late Registration's \\"Sierra Leone\\" or \\"Gold Digger,\\" he manages to get ethereal for the opener \\"Good Morning,\\" \\"I Wonder,\\" and \\"Flashing Lights\\" which add formidable rap to the traditional pop mix.  His humor is in finest form on \\"Barry Bonds,\\" with a stinging anti-glamour rap that goes off in several directions but ends up at a certain destination.  There's resiliency added to the mix with \\"Stronger\\" which is only familiar for its clich&eacute; refrain:  \\"That that don't kill me, can only make me stronger.\\"  In my opinion, \\"Champion,\\" with its native rhythms and synthesizers is the most outstanding track.<br /><br />Between sweet sounds, perceptively sharp lyrics, Kanye has finished his trilogy on a good note. \\"Big Brother\\" is both a celebration and a protest against the trappings that put him on top.  Even obtaining one's goals has its downside, too.<br /><br />As for the rest of us we have to hold onto our dreams and try to bridge the gap so aptly stated by one of the best and biggest wise guys recording today.  GO KANYE!
006017322X|5.0|I read this book in school not that long ago. That was the THIRD time reading that book. I can't get enough of it. It is an amazing story taking place in 1930's Alabama. The story is seen through the eyes of a 5 year old girl who's father, Atticus Finch (one of the most well known characters in literature), is defending a black man. This book is all about the way humans react to one another and how cruel people once were, but there were the seldom few like Atticus Finch that did care and tried to make a point to those who did not. There's so much to say about this magnificent book that can't be put in one review. I recommend it to everyone from 12-any age because this story is a life lesson that everyone must learn. it is a book that will stay with you the rest of your life.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|\\"A guy walks into a bar, stalks some babes, and kills them with his muscle car\\"-- THE END. And that's about it.  If you're a Quentin Tarantino fan like me, you'll appreciate that Tarantino style, such as the over-dialogue in the script, and the homage to 70's B movies ( the 'film' is filled with splices and poor editing-- that's brilliant!!)  You can tell that Quentin had fun with this-- he puts HIMSELF on the screen-- that's how he does it.<br />But I found myself waiting for something more, and then just kept waiting.  Yeah it's got gore, yeah it's got muscle cars, and yeah it's got babes.  So for that-- good job Q.T., but this ain't no Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill.
B000M341QE|2.0|Fine acting aside, the story is confusing as anything.

Overrated and clearly merited only as a lifetime achievement award for Martin Scorsese.
1400079179|5.0|I loved this book - even after a few years, it stays firmly as one of my favorites.<br /><br />In this novel by Dan Brown fiction is artfully mixed with history to create a plot thick with interesting characters, mystery and intrigue, that sucks you in until it's virtually impossible to put the book down and when you are not reading it you are likely thinking about it, at least some of the time.<br /><br />Another part I very much like about this book is how Mr Bornw includes little known facts about how many of the holidays and customs typically though of as belonging to the Christian religion have actually been adapted from earlier, older religions - I think this might be useful in inspiring more respect for other people's religion and for religious freedom in general.<br /><br />One small let-down is the end, typically Dan Brown's weak point: his novels seem to head off to a great start and quiockly and passionately develop a life of their own, until it's time to bring them to and end, and it usually is something that doesn't make the novel justice; however that is a small price to pay for such a wonderful book. I wish there were more like this!

It took her about three hours to read. When she finished, she said it was probably best for 6th and 7th graders, and pointed out how each page really only has a paragraph or two worth of text.<br /><br />As for myself, I especially liked that the story is not just a retread of the earlier title. Some of the funnier moments involve Greg's little sister Manny heading off to preschool on Halloween, and Greg's mom playing Dungeons and Dragons. Though it's anything but a serious novel, this fun read is an engaging and, in its own way, realistic portrait of early-teen angst. Like those in the first book in this comic-inspired series, every page is illustrated.

B000MNP2KI|3.0|To be frank, I never really had any desire to watch Casino Royale. Two years ago (2006), I was quite content with pretending the movie never existed and that James Bond had died when Pierce Brosnan was fired. Nevertheless, somewhere around November 2007, I picked up my Mom's recorded DVD of the film (she recorded it for me, as she too, had no desire of wanting to see it either), I fell victim to my curiosity and stayed up until 4:00am in the morning watching it. Then near the end of the year (December 13th, 2007) I grabbed the decently priced official copy of Casino Royale and watched it again.    Sufficed to say, the movie isn't bad, but it's not excellent either. To put simply, this is not \\"Bond Begins\\" in the general sense that Casino Royale is an origins film. Its not. (That ideal was obviously scrapped with EON failed to find themselves a young actor, under 22, and stumbled upon the realization that an film-based-Origin Story on a British secret agent life before he gained the License to Kill would not blow over as well as a two-hour film devoted simply to the Origin of Bruce Wayne, via Batman Begins). As we already know this is an entirely different Universe in the James Bond franchise, Casino Royale, is simply the beginning of James Bond's career as a 00-Agent set in what people love to call the \\"Post-9/11 Era\\". (Why movies like this and War of the Worlds are defined by that era, are beyond me.)    The film begins with James Bond (Craig) confronting the corrupt MI6 section chief, Dryden in his office in Prague. This sequence is frequently interrupted with flashbacks showcasing Bond trying to kill Dryden's \\"hit man\\" in a shady looking bathroom. Both sequences end with the Dryden and the Hit man's death. Fast forward to the present, James is sent to Madagascar by MI6 to apprehend an \\"international-bomb maker\\" named Mollaka, with another MI6, Carter, (Joseph Millson).     However, Mollaka catches sight of Bond's partner and makes a run for it. Carter attempts to pursue, but fails in his endeavor. James follows after the bomb-maker in his stead. This in ensues in one of three of the longest action sequences in the style of free running by Mollaka, while Bond struggles to keep up with the spry man. Once Mollaka is apprehended though, Bond sees fit to kill him, and blow up the front of African Embassy (as he already has what he came for). After a tongue lashing from M (Judi Dench), Bond heads to Miami to chase the trail of Alex Dimitrios -- fellow bomb maker, I believe -- which ensues into second of three big action sequences, when Bond discovers that Dimitrios' henchman plans to destroy an airplane own by Skyfleet. The sequence ends with another dead hired hand and more loose ends for MI6 to clean up, courtesy of James.    Determined to get the bottom of this mess, M, sends James to Montenegro, accompanied by Vesper Lynn (Eva Green), a liaison agent from the HM Treasury's Financial Action Task Force, to enter a Poker Tournament at the Casino Royale. While he is there, Bond encounters and confronts Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a mathematical genius, [banker for terrorists] and the mastermind behind the events taking place in the film. Along the way, Bond allies himself with lone-wolf MI6 agent, René Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) who aids him in his mission, and CIA Agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) when he looses the game to Le Chiffre.      Given, that I've never read Casino Royale, I can't say whether or not if the modernized film is true to most of the events of the novel (but, given that this a film-adaptation, I'll assume it really isn't all that faithful). That aside, the opening sequence (Vector-Art Style) is probably the weakest since Tomorrow Never Dies. Except, instead of shadowed women and computer chip textures, you get poker chips and silhouetted men duking it out. Chris Cornell's \\"You Know My Name\\" suffers from the same water-downed audio that Cheryl Crow's title song did in the aforementioned film.     Royale's biggest weakness are the action sequences; The first two are so over-the top (and entertaining the first time `round) that what little storyline there is lost in the blood, smoke, and debris. Your so caught up in watching the action sequences unfold, you hardly busy yourself to remember what the movie is about (why Bond is chasing \\"Mollaka\\" or \\"Carlos\\") until its all over and your wracking your head, trying to pick up where the storyline and plot fell off the speeding Aston Martin. This is one major problem at the end of the film, during an action sequence concerning a sinking building in Venice, Italy. You actually forget the reason why Bond is perusing Vesper and the men who have apprehended her.     The scenes concerning the Poker game are the slowest and most uninteresting part of the film and makes up about half of the second hour of the film. There's also the subplot concerning one of the characters turning out to be a Double Agent working for Le Chiffre that could`ve been written a little better. There's no warning or hint to suggest that the character is so, Le Chiffre just announces it and that's that. The torture sequence critical reviews and magazines seemed to describe as excellent, is gloriously, over-glorified and overrated. The entire sequence was overacted on Daniel Craig's part (especially the \\"scratch my balls\\" quote.); I was latterly laughing and hiding my face in shame. The only compelling moment in that scene was the skittish composure of Mads Mikkelsen's character, Le Chiffre.    Another problem with the film are the characters; The majority of them, mainly the focal characters, lack in depth personality (mostly due on the actors and actresses part) with the exception of Jeffery Wright, who portrays a very interesting Felix Leiter (a character whom I never encountered, until now), the only riveting part of the Poker Game sequences. Mads Mikkelsen portrays Le Chiffre in a mild and sinister manner that is quite appreciated, but his character hardly chalks up to anything besides a right hand man. Le Chiffre is hardly and a compelling villain and ends up sharing fate identical to Elektra King (portrayed Sophie Marceau) in The World is not enough, near the semi-end of the film. Judi Dench as \\"M\\", gives the usual performance of the hardnosed and no-nonsense head of MI6; I cannot help but enjoy every moment when she gives Bond the tongue-lashing over what he did in Madagascar, like she was scolding a schoolboy (ha-ha!).    Eva Green as Vesper Lynd falls between average or charming enough to make you smile. However, Green's dry and monotone voice and delivery of lines are probably the most irritating part of her character. However, there are moments, [particularly when discussing \\"Dinner Jackets\\" or \\"Financial Aid for James\\"], where personality inserts itself into Lynd. However, her romance with James Bond, in short, unbelievable. The chemistry between Green and Craig evaporates as soon as the two get together. Mostly, because, you know, James Bond will not be with her for long (thankfully).     Of course, on the subject of Bond Girls in this film, it's nice to see that the film has decided to take the focus off the sexuality of the females and simply characterized them as people, even though they fall back into the position that they were meant for. Having sexual relations with James Bond (the sexual content in this film ironically is more PG-13 friendly than any of the previous films of Pierce Brosnan's Bond era).      Daniel Craig as James Bond is all right at best. At times, he's charming (the scene when he drives around the hotel after inviting Solange to his \\"home\\" is an example), funny even. But, in all in all, Craig is not a very compelling actor for this role. For the most part, the majority of Daniel Craig's performance consists of going through the motions. Staring intensely at something or frowning in contemplation, or rattling his lines off in a monotone tone of voice like Eva Green. His James Bond is characterized like a true Thug or Hitman (obvious cues taken from movies like Munich and Layer Cake). Craig lacks the power of emotional range and that quirky personality that I loved from the previous Bonds (excluding Moore and Lazenby), continuity not withstanding here.      Another irritating part of his character is the simple fact that he obviously acts before he thinks [hence the \\"blunt instrument\\" quote]; Bond made more mistakes than I've ever seen him make in one movie and his solution to the problem was a bullet from the gun or a dinner knife. He never thinks of the larger picture unless its to his benefit. EON's attempts to \\"humanize\\" the secret agent falls flat in places like the train scene where Vesper and James play tick-tat-toe with words to guess their character and upbringing or Bond's overly sappy speech that was featured in the theatrical trailer (*puke*) to Vesper. However, I think I do like him most when he attempts to comfort Vesper in the shower scene. When concerning his looks, Craig has never been the best looking or the most handsome man ever to grace the screens, so he makes up for it, with his acting. Overall, I like Daniel Craig as an actor, just not as James Bond. His demeanor just does not suit the character or the title.    David Arnold has created a score for Casino Royale, which I have ended up loving. His previous endeavors for the James Bond films (1997-2002) were perfectly suited for the films, but as standalones, they were weak and uninspiring. Thankfully, this problem seems to be omitted and on its own, the score for Casino is an excellent listen. However, there are moments, where the more somber themes seemed forced, as they lacked a real emotional sound that failed to reach me.    On one final note, the Second Disc containing all of the special features (which are about, three or four featurettes if memory serves) could've easily been slapped onto the Feature Film Disc. That said, aside from the featurette \\"Bond Girls Are Forever\\" (something I think I remember seeing on television or something), the other stuff is forgettable. Other than that, the Audio and Picture Quality of the DVD is standard \\"DVD Perfection\\" and clear on my television screen.    Overall, Casino Royale is an entertaining Weekend Popcorn flick, but the fact that it takes itself too seriously and its atmosphere demands that you do as well, kills the enjoyment factor. In the end the movie's subplots and storylines never seem to come together to create a coherent story that works to the fullest and the characters could`ve been better developed in terms of personality. Factoids like \\"Realism\\" and \\"Gritty, More Realistic Bond\\" are instantly forgotten, because they have no presence in this film --- as Casino Royale is far from the quotations. Its just another Bond movie. ---- [3 out of 5]
1594489505|5.0|Though A Thousand Splendid Suns speaks of death, violence, and despair, Khaled Hosseini is able to bring sun to the night of the human condition.  He gives readers a thousand splendid suns.  The narrative spans thirty years of Afghan history--the Soviet invasion and occupation, the Taliban and the post-Taliban.  Hosseini weaves the historic facts through his narrative while describing the suffering of three generations of Afghani men and women.      He speaks through the perspective of two main characters--women, Miriam and Laila.  Their voices describe in specific detail the devastating roles women play in the culture.  Miriam and Laila dispel stereotypes.  They are real people the reader can identify with, who fall in love, who laugh, who cry, who are angry, and who continue to hope in the midst of evil. Both women were married off to the same man, Rasheed, who treats them with violence and disregard.  Ultimately while living as prisoners at the whim of this heartless man, the women bond.   They support each other, and Laila's two children.    In the last scene Laila muses on her deceased friend Miriam, who had been tried, convicted, and put to death for the murder of Rasheed, who she had killed while he was attempting to strangle Laila.   With the sun on her face Laila relishes Miriam's presence in her heart, and in her surroundings.  She sees Miriam in the restoration of the orphanage, in the trees that she and Tariq have planted, and in the warm blankets that have been bought for the children with Miriam's inheritance.  Laila hears Miriam in the children's laughter, and in Azizia's prayers.   Laila feels new life within her, the new child of her loving husband Tariq.  Full of contentment, Laila sees life as full, full of a thousand splendid suns.

0736063684|5.0|This book is fantastic.  I'm a former pro triathlete and I always get people asking me about working out and fitness and I always recommend this book.  The illustrations are amazing, the book demonstrates exactly what muscules each excersise uses, and its shows the correct way of doing the motion and the proper use of equitment.  The book points out how easily injuries can happen and how not to do excersises.  Every day I see people working out incorrectly and getting so little out of their work out, they just strain and sweat for nothing, they are lucky if this is the only outcome and they dont actually hurt themselves.  This book is not that expensive and it's value for working out far outpaces the expense of the book itself.  I could not recommend this book more, it is by far my favorite work out guide.

0307387151|3.0|McEwan exemplifies that classic question of beautiful prose vs. telling a good story. And, of course, what we get here is the lofty and well crafted sentences around something that just doesn't merit strong story-telling. I am not sure why this is so with so many writers who are deemed: \\"literary\\", but it almost always seems to be the case. A young girl's guilt just does not carry it. Without giving what story there is here away, I couldn't help but find much grandiosity in this person having such \\"guilt\\" to atone for in the first place. Very big of her to think herself to be so powerful. You know, this sort of thing. And no, it simply does not make the read worth my while. Give me a real story! At least, that's how I see it. Perhaps it's rare to have both beautiful prose and a powerful story--they do exist.     For this reader, MIDDLESEX, THE KITE RUNNER, LIFE OF PI are some strong examples of good prose and a compelling story.
0812550706|4.0|If you are you looking for an enjoyable, interesting, fast-paced sci-fi novel that draws you in, then Ender's Game is a book for you.  Before receiving this book as a gift, I had not been a huge fan of sci-fi and did not know about Orson Scott Card's work.  I was not sure that I would like it, but it soon had me eagerly turning the pages.  I was first drawn in by the complex characters.  The main character, Ender, is a young genius, who is taken away from earth in order to train to eventually become the leader of the earth army in the fight against the alien buggers.  Card does a commendable job of expressing Ender's \\"adult\\" maturity while having him retain his youthful characteristics.  Even with not much change occurring in the plot, this book still held my attention.  Card creates a bond between the reader and Ender, making it easy to relate to him, and wanting to know how he will face his next challenge.  Though a short read, I found this book compelling and I was unable to put it down.  I would recommend this book to readers of all ages, including those who don't consider themselves fans of science fiction.
0780628551|1.0|I'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp, but this movie was absolutely horrid.  I honestly can't understand how anyone could give this movie a good rating.  It was achingly slow and dreadful to the point where I nearly couldn't watch the entire movie.  The plot seemed promising and the actors very enticing, but this movie failed to deliver in every way imaginable.  I am so thankful that I didn't actually purchase this film (it was a gift).    If you must watch it - borrow it or rent it, but save your money and don't buy it.
0765318741|4.0|Sure, I'll admit I never heard of Richard Matheson or I AM LEGEND before the promo for the new Will Smith movie started.  But I'm glad I know of them now.  This was an amazing story, scary and hard to put down.  It's definitely dated (having been written in the 50's), but that doesn't detract from it's readability.  I enjoyed seeing how Neville reacts to so much isolation over time, and how he dealt with his fear.<br /><br />I understand that the movie is like the book in premise only, which doesn't surprise me.  A Will Smith flick couldn't end the way this book does.<br /><br />I recommend getting the version which also includes several short stories by Matheson.  The ones you must read are:<br />- Prey<br />- Mad House<br />- From Shadowed Places<br />- Person to Person<br />Outstanding, original, edge of your seat stories.<br /><br />The pretty good ones are:<br />- The Near Departed (very short, predictable, and quite funny)<br />- Witch War (freaky little girls!)<br />- Dress of White Silk (what really happened...!?)<br /><br />The ones that didn't do it for me:<br />- Buried Talents (intriguing, then leaves you hanging)<br />- Dance of the Dead (too 'arty'?)<br />- The Funeral (good idea, not so good story)<br /><br />Overall, you need to check out I AM LEGEND, and most of the other stories are worth your time too.

0140277447|5.0|.....is condemned to repeat it. I remember the storm of controversy over this book when it came out ten years ago, and the torrent of abuse that Miss Chang had to take. Some, like G. Gordon Liddy, openly supported her, but too many did not. While no reasonable person today denies the German murder of Jews, many highly placed people still deny that over a six week period begining December 13, 1937, the Japanese army murdered upwards of 400,000 Chinese in Nanking...they did, and Miss Chang has the evidence to prove it.....<br /><br />When WWII ended, German war criminals were made to pay the price, or to become hunted fugitives. Some Japanese leaders, did, indeed, hang for their crimes, but many, of high rank and low, lived openly while proclaiming their deeds. You see, we needed Japan as a trading partner, and, besides, China had gone over to the Dark Side. Is that so strange to us? Phil Sheridan and David Hunter lived out their days with \\"respect\\", and if Beast Butler was held in contempt by his own troops, he was still able to hold political office. And no Union soldier ever paid for his war crimes, which I admit are nothing in comparison with the story told here. Miss Chang was right; the capacity for atrocity exists in EVERY nation, and race.<br /><br />In the midst of great evil, there was still great good...the International Safety Zone, organized and run by Nazi businessman John Rabe, saved around 200,000 lives. Oskar Schindler is renown, as he should be, but John Rabe is known to but few. [The parallels between Schindler and Rabe are uncanny, and , ultimately, sad].<br /><br />I think Miss Chang missed the boat on one or two points; she accepts religion as a motivation for murder in China, but dismisses it in Germany; it is true that Germany was Christianized, but the Lutheran Church had embraced Augustinian Amillenialism, which ultimately makes the Jew an unperson, then makes it OK to kill him. Read Martin Luther...a truly vile anti-Semite....<br /><br />This is one of the most profound books I have ever read...you NEED to read it, though, be warned, it will make you sick. The documented detail is too great to refute, and those who deny the Nanking massacre need to be marginalized with the Nazi Holocaust deniers. God rest Iris Chang's soul...in the end, it was too much for her to live with...may it be too much for all of us to tolerate....Never Again....oks I have ever read...you NEED to read it, though, be warned, it will make you sick.

1594489505|4.0|Khaled Hosseini tells a good story, eliciting empathy for both his female main characters while using the recent history of his native country as a backdrop that nourishes while educating his audience about a culture and place of which few have knowledge.<br /><br />Unlike his first novel, \\"The Kite Runner,\\" \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" does not depict an immigrant's journey from a troubled Afghanistan to the melting pot of America a la Elia Kazan's classic \\"America, America\\".  Instead it focuses on two Afghan women who as contemporaries display vastly different vantage points in terms of their individual gender freedom.<br /><br />Mariam, reared as a harami (illegitimate child) in the smaller village of Herat, lives on the outskirts of town with her mother, fallen woman Nana who succumbed to the attractive Jalil, rich owner of the cinema, husband of three wives and father of nine legitimate children.  As a harami, Mariam quickly learns that the world of Herat and her father's smaller privileged universe proffer her only the sad wisdom of rejection and endurance. Married off as a teenager to a 40-something-year-old shoemaker named Rasheed, she finds herself in the large city of Kabul where Rasheed's imposed dress code of the burqa in public becomes an oxymoron of sorts--a comforting form of anonymity after years of self-imposed insecurity and harami notoriety and a convenient cover up for the consequential markings of his anger when she cannot provide him with a child .<br /><br />Not so for Laila, Hosseini's second protagonist. Born in Kabul of educated parents, Laila's potential for success ranks her highly amongst her peers during the pro-woman Communist reign.  Always encouraged to pursue her dreams, she finds that only her country's turbulent history encumbers her ambitions. After the Soviet Union's departure from Afghanistan and the mujahedeen infighting for control ensues, a stray rocket blast kills Laila's parents and through a stroke of ill-fate she becomes a member of Rasheed's household, alas her bright future eclipsed by the same dungeon of unenlightenment as that of the hapless Mariam.<br /><br />The beauty of Hosseini's tale comes in his ability to draw the reader into the lives of these two women.  Although introduced with a certain amount of predictable melodrama that sweeps us along with the implacable rhythm of a 1970s television mini-series, by the time Laila and Mariam physically unite in Rasheed's household we are sold, living and breathing each and every trial and tribulation.  Of these, there are plenty, Hosseini paints a cruel picture of Afghanistan's intolerance towards women during not only the Taliban era, but within the confines of their supposed sanctuary of home.  Intensely, we experience the beatings these women routinely receive and cower instinctively as the Taliban patrol wanders the streets of Kabul seeking out stray women to disfigure.<br /><br />Shamelessly, Hosseini's technique relies on the interjection of improbable occurrences that add to the tension on the reader's heartstrings.  This is nothing new in literature; Charles Dickens employs the same coincidental manipulations quite successfully in his classic serializations.  However implausible, we are absorbed within the pages, reliving in nightmares some of the brutally repugnant scenes of blatant misogyny depicted so vividly in Hosseini's detailed account.  We cringe and cry and await retribution.  Like \\"The Tale of Two Cities,\\" we are rewarded with a modern day execution where innocent love and unselfish sacrifice allow another's happiness and ultimately the irrepressible good triumph over the miserably evil.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Khaled Hosseini writes well in the female perspective; his account of the fictional Mariam and Laila brings home the abject suffering of the senseless mistreatment of women in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.  In the telling of their story, he links them with women all over the world through both the smalland large events in their lives.  Simultaneously, he educates his audience to the history of his native country, the differing racial factions and the indisputable effect of religion and culture on the larger terrain of the soul.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"eously, he educates his audience to the history of his native country, the differing racial factions and the indisputable effect of religion and culture on the larger terrain of the soul.

B0000931QA|2.0|I can't believe how many reviewers give this album 5 stars!  I can only imagine that most of these reviewers are biased metal-heads that don't have much of an appreciation for wide varieties of music.    Now read a review from someone who appreciates good music, from electronica, groove, world music, rap, hip hop, funk & disco, indie rock, all the way to hard rock/metal:    Say what you will about Concept albums, how great the lyrics might be, blah blah, blah: the bottom line is that the musical compositions on Operation:Mindcrime are BELOW AVERAGE!! There are TWO excellent songs on this album (Revolution Calling, I Don't Believe in Love), and 3 others worthy of SOME praise (Mission, Needle Lies, and Eyes of a Stranger).  Otherwise the music ranges from average to embarassing.    Word of Note: this reviewer puts Queensryche's 1986 \\"Rage for Order\\" on his Top Ten albums of all time, really liked the EP and The Warning, and even liked a handful of songs off the sell-out album (Empire).  Tate's voice was one of the best rock/metal voices ever, and Degarmo and Rockenfield are masters of their instruments.    But listening to Mindcrime from start to finish is simply an exercise in torture!
B000LXHK2C|2.0|I give this film two stars for photography. Russell Crowe is a fine actor but totally miscast in a comedy. The film is weak and anyone praising it will settle for almost anything.  I think that the two Rs..Russell and Ridley, know that this is a dud and anything made afterwards will have to be much better. I am looking forward to American Gangster and the re-made 3:10 to Yuma because I think Russell will more than make up for this error in judgement.
B000001FV1|3.0|I think this album has one good song, the title song; Fantasy Factory. I enjoyed it in the 70's, often when I was smoking weed.    But now the weed is gone and we have Ipod's instead. So now it's like buying one joint (never did myself), we can also just buy one song and download it.    There you have....rock on....
B000YA82F6|4.0|An interesting phenomenon is happening slowly in Hollywood. The offspring of some of the movie industry's best directors have begun to assert themselves with their own, distinct voices.  Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), whose father is Francis Coppola of The Godfather fame, Nick Cassavetes (The Notebook) whose father John Cassavetes pioneered independent films, and now Jason Reitman whose father is Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame, have all proven that talent can be in the genes.  Reitman has perfectly realized his vision of a coming-of-age drama, Juno, based on a fabulous script by newbie, Diablo Cody.  This small, original film has enough intelligence and creative filmmaking to stand among bigger budgeted studio releases as among the best of 2007.    Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a sixteen year old high schooler whose planned sexual encounter results in an unplanned pregnancy that causes a sensation among her classmates and at home with her dad and stepmom.  A smart, sassy-mouthed loner, Juno, after deliberating on whether or not to abort the unborn, takes matters in her own hands and decides to donate her baby to an adopting, yuppie couple, Mark and Vanessa.  Life is not so easy as situations change suddenly, and the dynamics of Mark and Vanessa throw everything into a tailspin as Juno's life becomes much more complicated.   Wondering if couples can ever really stay together and if true love can exist, Juno makes some hard, mature choices in her life.      The movie is presented in a unique format with actual, script lines subtitling the bottom of every shot.  It's almost as if the DVD extras are being used onscreen.  This device, while interesting, can be a bit annoying too.  A series of ballads punctuate and underscore the narrative much like Cat Stevens did in Harold and Maude.  It does enhance the story and mood.  The structure of the narrative is sectioned by the seasons beginning with autumn.    High school life is portrayed in a convincing manner withthe behaviors and interplay dead on target.  Some individual scenes like Juno's parents first hearing and fearing what big announcement Juno has in store for them, or the confrontation with the ultrasound technician are pretty amusing.  And there are quiet, introspective moments like between Juno and her dad or with her `boyfriend' Bleeker that are quite touching.      Ellen Page already made her mark with the recent Hard Candy and showed her versatility in X Men-The Last Stand, but to exhibit that rare combination of drama and humor in a believable manner is quite a feat.  There is not one false note in her impressive performance.  You begin to place yourself in her position and empathize through her joy and pain.  The rest of the cast is strong, and each has good portions of dialogue to capitalize upon.  J .K. Simmons is quickly becoming a go-to character actor as Juno's dad, and you wish Allison Janney had a bit juicier part to fly with as the stepmom.  Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are quite good as the prospective, adoptive parents.  Michael Cera (Superbad) and Olivia Thirlby make convincing schoolmates.    We discover with Juno that life can be full of unexpected surprises and twists, and it is how we deal with those events that can have a profound and lasting effect on one's future and happiness.  (I can't wait for writer Cody's next story.)  When you think about it, the screenplay rings true throughout without being preachy or awkward; it just sounds like it could really happen.  That's what makes Juno a terrific slice of life tale, a deceptively simple story with a rich core of acting and words.   Oscars love this kind of independent jewel.
B000002GVO|5.0|There is truly not even ONE of the 8 main songs on this CD that could be considered weak.  I would agree with a previous reviewer that if one was FORCED to identify a song that was less strong than the others, it would have to be the popular hit \\"Life in the Fast Lane,\\" or perhaps \\"Try and Love Again.\\"    The remaining 6 tracks are nothing less than masterpieces!    The passage of time is the most true test of quality songwriting. There was a ton of similar genre material during this time period which was considered great at that time (even by me), but upon listening to it now I can only think \\"Wow, how could we actually have thought this was GOOD??\\"    For example: I can appreciate a handful of great Styx tunes, but play any of their albums from start to finish, and you'll hear that the majority of their songs now sound sappy, dated, infantile, or just plain BAD.    However, over THIRTY YEARS later, these songs on Hotel California are still amazing: the album still stands as not only The Eagles' best work, but also one of the best Rock releases of all time.    Put on the headphones and turn up the volume for a blissful experience.

0446310786|5.0|Whenever you think of heroes, most of the time you think of superhero tiers like Superman, Spiderman, and Batman; I think of Atticus Finch from Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird.   Although he possesses no superhuman power or abilities, he possesses characteristics few others have.  Not only intelligent, respected, and calm, but he also is humble and just.    Lee sets her story during the 1930s in Maycomb, Alabama from the perspective of young Scout recounting her story of growing up with her brother Jem and their father Atticus.  Over the course of the novel, Scout develops from a naïve innocent girl to maturity and acknowledging the evil in the world.    Deeply rooted within this town is severe racial prejudice.  Atticus exemplifies his justice by defending a black man, Tom Robinson, in a lopsided courtcase about raping a white woman.  Subject to the town's attacks, Atticus persistently determines to defend his client, and ultimately proves Robinson innocent.  Yet the biased jury thinks otherwise and still convicts him, despite the indisputable evidence.    The mockingbird signifies the innocent in the story, which in the end is tarnished by humanity's evil.  The two most prominent representations are Boo Radley and Tom Robinson.  Boo Radley is distorted by society to nothing but a myth, but as the story progresses, the children discover more about him. Culminating down to the conclusion where Scout finally meets him in person, she realizes him to be truly good and acknowledges him as a human, quelling all theories she had of him before.  Tom Robinson, on the other hand, is ruined by the white jury, despite Atticus' sufficient proof to show his innocence.  Convicted and sentenced to jail, he attempts to make his escape and is shot and killed in the process, capturing the book's title.    The story is not too difficult of a read, but the meaning is extremely insightful, containing profound commentary about good and evil, bravery, and innocence.  In essence,I have never read a book as good as this one.  It should be on everyone's top 1 list of greatest books of all time.  Period.  If it is not, something is seriously wrong.  You better be changing it.
B000002HK4|4.0|I was watching a DVD the other night called \\"Five Years In The Life of Dream Theater\\" which is the second disc of the \\"Images and Words Live\\" DVD and I selected to hear the band's commentary which by the way even had them laughing at the idea of talking about themselves for 2 1/2 hours solid. Anyway at one point, somebody mentioned that they hated the medleys in Rush concerts and made up a song about it. I f****** hate the medleys in a Rush show, why can't they just play the whole damn song. That pretty musch sums up my feelings about this.<br />I bought it just for \\"Funeral For A Friend,\\" even though I don't like Elton John. There was a time when he was almost tolerable and FFAF from Goodby Yellow Brick Road is about as good as it gets for EJ. He was never that good again. Fact of the matter is that FFAF sound like a perfect cover of the original. It's too bad that the same care wasn't given to the other cover here. As I said \\"Why can't you just play the whole damn song?\\"<br />The Rover just gets going and then stops and Achilles last stand wasn't worth the effort if you ask me and same as all of the others.<br />Which brings me to the title track: 23 minutes and damn...I listend to it for the first time in my car and even sat in the lot until it finished playing. Some pretty incredible playing, I admit, but a little bit much to digest in one sitting. I'm not criticizing it for that reason. It probably took a while for people to get used to \\"Close To The Edge\\" or \\"Relayer\\" so I'll contimue to listen because mainly I am impressed by the level of musicianship and didn't someone once remark that excess is a sign of genius. We'll see and anyway I just bought the DVDs mentioned above and the new one Systematic Chaos, which is another thing I like  about DT - cool song titles and album titles.
B00005JPXY|3.0|Cloverfield (2008). Rated PG-13. Running Time: One hour, 24 mins.<br />Directed by J.J. Abrams and Bryan Burk. Written by Drew Goddard.<br />This film had a gimmick for itself beginning with the magazine poster art we saw last year, in the Entertainment Weekly magazine, of the beheaded Statue of Liberty and New York City being ripped into. J.J. Abrams would be one of the producers and of course we knew him for the LOST tv series and the upcoming [[ASIN:B001AVCFJM Star Trek (Two-Disc Digital Copy Edition)]] film.<br />  By the way, if you see &#34;Cloverfield&#34; in a movie theater right now, you will see a teaser for STAR TREK with the voice of Leonard Nimoy.<br /> About &#34;Cloverfield&#34;, we began to learn that it is a monster film attacking New York City. Some people thought it was [[ASIN:B000KJTGBA Godzilla: King of the Monsters]] again. It is not Godzilla.<br />  No pictures were released of the monster, creating the curiosity that you would have to see the movie to satisfy your itch.<br />  The Cinemark theater I went to posted a warning that this film was shot with the hand-held camera technique (a la the college experiment film, [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]]) and that the shaky motion of this film might make you sick.<br />  I was just fine when I saw the film, but I really did not care for the jittery hand-held camcorder technique.  While it does create the illusion that you are right there with the group of five friends, you never really get a good still look at the monster as the camera keeps moving.<br />  This film would have been much better if it were filmed in the normal way.<br />  The film begins with a surprise party for one of the guys who will be leaving to go to Japan. This hand-held camera thing really goes on too long at this point to really enjoy the film, but when some of the people go outside for a while, the action begins. It does scare you a little bit.<br />  We  follow the 5 young adults (Michael Stahl-David, Jessica Lucas, Lizzy Caplan, T.J.

B00002ND77|5.0|This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.  I love it.  Spike Lee did a fabulous job in putting Malcolm X's autobiography into film.  I also highly recommend the book.  It's got WAY more information in it (obviously) and is an excellent read.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I saw the Constant Motion video in the Music Choice Section of On Demand under metal. Those who have cable know what I mean. DT was the only metal band I'd heard of. Anyway, I thought I'd take a chance and watch this video on my coffee break. It actually reminded me of the years when bands actually could play their instruments. DT was shredding, God I'm alive again. It made me want to go home and practice. DT is for us folks that liked bands to actually be able to play their instruments. I know everyone says \\"Constant Motion\\" sounds like Metallica, but there are those who recall when that wasn't a bad thing. Other influences aside from Metallica include Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and Yngwie Malmsteen. The influences of every band that ever mattered can be felt here and that's what the secret is. While every other band on Earth is content to sound like the Cookie Monster on crack or something, DT proudly displays their realm of their influences and I'm not joking when I include Yngwie amongst ELP, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Metallica and occasionally I here some riffing in there that would make Tony Iommi proud. These are the most influential bands of the last century and DT borrows respectfully from all of them often at the same time.<br />The secret ingredients to the greatest heavy metal bands have always been the musicianship not the snotty attitude, and that's what DT have - the culmination of all their influences and then some distinct qualities all their own.<br />Robert Plant once said,\\"It's not that we think we are the greatest band in the world, it's just that we are that much better than whoever is number two.\\" I think the same is true here.

B000Z27HLS|3.0|I hated the version of Persuasion that they just broadcast, but this one does a nice, concise job of telling the tale and it's fairly easy to follow for non-Janeites.  It's actually better than the murky one done years ago with Peter Firth as Tilney, so that's something.  It isn't the greatest, but it's a bit better.
0767812166|4.0|One of the first film treatments of the ET visitor phenomenon. Karen Allen works well with Jeff Bridges in this lighter touch on a serious topic. A little dated now in light of UFO literature and Spielberg's more profound \\"Taken\\" series. Nice cameos from Harvey Keitel and Charles Martin Smith(often underrated but fine actor). Fun two hours for space movie buffs and suitable for family viewing.
B00005JPXY|3.0|You know you're in for a thrill ride when the theater posts a warning about motion sickness. \\"Cloverfield\\" is the b monster movie for modern times. Use the technique of \\"Blair Witch\\", throw in a dash of \\"Alien\\" and a big heaping footprint of \\"Godzilla\\" and you've got \\"Cloverfield\\" which clocks in at a brief but intense 84 minutes. J.J. Abrams and his collaborators writer Drew Goodard (a writing alum of Abrams' \\"Lost\\" and \\"Alias\\") & Matt Reeves (another long time Abrams collegue who also shot \\"Homicide: Life on the Street\\" as well as episodes of \\"Lost\\")put together a wild ride of a monster movie recalling \\"It Came from Beneath the Sea\\" and, more importantly, \\"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\\" with its focus on a famous city terrorized by a larger than life creature.<br /><br />WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW!<br /><br />The film is told from the point of view of Hud who is documenting his best friend Rob's going away party. It seems that Rob is the new VP for a company in Japan and the big celebration put on by his brother Jason and his girlfriend. Rob has a blow out with best friend and long-time crush Lei. Then all heck breaks loose as the Creature begins tearing apart Manhattan and bowling with the head of the Statue of Liberty.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" looks quite good on DVD. While this single disc edition doesn't have as many extras as I had expected (Best Buy has a bonus disc with a 24 minute behind-the-scenes featurette composed of, naturally enough, camcorder footage!). We get an audio commentary track from the director (he discusses how Abrams was inspired to create \\"Cloverfield\\" after going to Japan and seeing a store full of Godzilla toys. He though we deserved our own giant lizard, too), outtakes, deleted scenes, a pair of not-so-different alternate endings AND an amusing Easter Egg.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" isn't a deep film and isn't meant to be. While it does make reference to 9/11 because of the stark images of destruction and our knowledge of that event (as well as the characters reaction to what is occuring around them), \\"Cloverfield\\" doesn't take that analogy too seriously instead focusing on scaring and startling us. Still, the Creature as terrorist (when is a terrorist NOT a monster?)provides us a window into a world rocked by destruction and a glimpse into the sometimes brave sometimes idiotic reaction of human beings in a crisis situation.<br /><br />The characters are pretty well drawn considering that our only knowledge of them comes from what we see via the camcorder (including footage that survived being taped over--a very clever way to give us a backstory on the main couple)but the technique means that there are limitations--we know only what the group of characters we are stuck with know becoming part of their group via the camcorder and Hud's occasionally insightful and idiotic musings.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" will never be \\"The Godfather\\" but it's a very good film within a genre that has varied from the idiotic (\\"The Giant Gila Monster\\") to the exceptional (pick any of the ground breaking monster-on-the-loose movies you'd like)and it is an enjoyable ride. If it is the cinematic version of junk food, it's extremely tasty and enjoyable junk food. Could it have been improved? Sure--we could have had better acting, character development, background which the director could have introduced in the same format as the other stuff but for its limited scope and ambitions its a fine film (that's even comparing it to Abrams' other film projects from \\"Regarding Henry\\" to \\"MI:3\\" or \\"Lost\\").<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" takes the film as amusement park ride one step further than many others have with its jittery camera work and \\"you are there\\" approach to documenting the destruction of \\"Manhattan\\".

B0000042MY|5.0|Very happy with cd soundtrack. I purchased this for my partner, whose favorite movie is Last of the Mohicans. He has been after the soundtrack for years. I was able to access this cd online at Amazons.    Thankyou very much,  Satisfied customer.
0440238609|5.0|Have just finished the third book in the trilogy. The first was pretty good, but I was wondering what all the fuss was about. By the time I got halfway through the third it was clear! The great theme of the books - the perpetual struggle for freedom and against authoritarianism - is captured splendidly and in a suitably grand way (and on the grandest of scales!). The characters are well developed and sharp, and then incidental plots are always supportive and never intrusive. Basically a great read...
B0000071GA|4.0|As one reviewer already said, Krokus are not my favorite band, however this release was a stellar effort indeed. It's got tons of energy and the tunes are solid. Screaming in the night is a great tune, but what really get my blood pumping are the opening tracks on this cd. Headhunter and Eat the Rich are awesome songs and really get this cd off to a fantastic start. I saw these guy in Montreal Canada way back when opening for Def Leppard and they were frikin' awesome!!<br /><br />It's to bad they didn't stay with this sound and approach to their craft as this was by far their best release ever!
0765316978|4.0|Old mans war is excellent - the best sci fi to come along in a long time, everyone should read it, it's packed with wonderfully rich ideas that stay with you.    Book 2 is great, full of engaging ideas, good characters, I loved it.    The last colony is the first two without the editors flogging John into superior fiction, and it really does show.  The book is engaging, entertaining, without a doubt a solid read and you won't regret the time you spent.  That being said there was a great deal of odd grammar, misspellings, and plot lines that truncate unexpectedly, which is very unlike the other two books.  There is even a magical element that gets our heros out of their scrape. Doh.  And the ending is an artificial wrap up I just couldn't get on board with - their universe is modeled on our world, CU=USA, Conclave=UN and through both previous books he stuck to a complex love/hate, power struggle that felt very believable.      *SPOILER ALERT*  He drops it in favor of a too nice ending.  Someone should have stopped him from writing so far out of character, I just can't honestly see the series ending that way. \\"we group of aliens so willing to eradicate you that we use a useless reason to attack now welcome you into our brotherhood. Cmon gang, lets all hold hands, harmony through diversity.\\"  Its to cute, to nice, and too forced. But having said that this book was worth every penny to buy and every minute to read.
B000YA82F6|1.0|I don't feel completely comfortable being on the same planet with a race of beings that can actually generate this high of an average rating for such an empty waste of time.<br /><br />This is the most BORING thing I've seen in a long, long time. I only chose it for 3 reasons: 1) it had Ellen Page, 2) J.K. Simmons, and 3) had a high IMDb rating of 8.4 at the time of this writing.<br /><br />A story about a teen getting pregnant, and how she deals with it- can't you do something with that premise? It's like the creators were more concerned with showing off their cool, modern dialogue they wrote for the movie, than the actual story itself. I was amazed at how many scenes could go by, and how much TALKING could be done by the characters, without anything interesting ever developing in the movie. I mean you literally have these scenes that go on for minutes, and it's showing all these inconsequential things that don't develop character or introduce the next beat to the story. I remember watching every scene and feeling like there was something that was about to happen, a lot of potential energy, but it goes nowhere. There were moments that were interesting to watch, like between Ellen Page and the lady's husband, which were well acted and genuine, but again, it's like the focus of these scenes are to show just how 'cool' these characters are, and it's at the expense of substance and realism.<br /><br />My 4 cents:<br /><br />--There's nothing worse than a movie that's supposed to be a comedy but not funny at all.<br /><br />--Cool, Ellen Page plays the same character she played in [[ASIN:B000GI3KGC Hard Candy]], even had the red hoody. That's where the comparisons stop between the two movies.<br /><br />--Jennifer Garner's facial reactions...failed. That was stupid and overdone. You got the camera showing her confused reactions and expressions to what Ellen Page was saying or doing, with this feeling that we as the audience are in the \\"know\\" of some joke, and her character is left out and doesn't get it, so we are laughing along with Ellen Page's character, except...there's no JOKE. There's nothing. So basically all you've got is this airheaded looking woman overacting and doing exaggerated contortions to her face, and it's just embarrassing and awkward.<br /><br />--The only pop culture reference that was missing out of this movie was the word \\"Ebay.\\" Other than that they've covered it all.<br /><br />I should've just used the 10 dollars I spent on this worthless movie and just made a paper airplane out of it and tossed it right into the toilet. What a piece of crap.ughing along with Ellen Page's character, except...there's no JOKE. There's nothing.

B0010AN7Y0|5.0|Suffice it to say that this is a film not to be missed.  An extraordinary mix of drama and razor-sharp comedy... not to mention a terrific soundtrack... it is a real crowd-pleaser.  I've watched it many times with many friends and every one of them has enjoyed it as much as I. The acting is top-notch across the board, with two of my favorite actresses, Emma Thompson and Imelda Staunton, in the ensemble.      Comparisons to \\"The Big Chill\\" were commonplace when \\"Peter's Friends\\" came out, but the latter is really superior in every way (not to take away from the former).  This is a truly terrific movie, well-directed and with a wonderful screenplay co-written by Rita Rudner.    I am really excited that the US DVD is now going to be available.  If you haven't yet seen this, I can't recommend it highly enough.  If by chance you buy this and are disappointed, I invite you to send me a very strongly worded eMail.  Of course, I'll take it with a grain of salt as I'll just have to assume that you are an idiot!
B000MXPE7O|5.0|I gave this film 5 stars for its courage and willingness to trust the intelligence of the audience to unravel a complex plot and complicated relationships. This is not an easy film for those who don't wish to solve the multiple puzzles we are presented. The film reflects a philosophy that both character analysis and espionage are complex, multi-layered, and often are not what they seem on the surface.     The film uses a crisis situation at the CIA to unfold the history of the CIA as well as the history of the agency's top administrators that parallels the development of the agency and its mission. The Bay of Pigs invasion is a failure and it appears that Fidel Castro and his Soviet handlers were well aware of where the invading force would land on the coast of Cuba. This crisis is revisited repeatedly as we see the development of the CIA and the development of Edmund Wilson, an OSS Officer who becomes a CIA founder.    Matt Damon plays a resolved, cold character, Edmund Wilson, who is dedicated to the protection of his country even though there are multiple consequences for him, his wife, and his son. He receives two odd, manipulated video and audio tapes that begin to reveal who might have tipped off the soviets and Fidel that the Americans were coming. These tapes are all part of a complex effort to neutralize Wilson by the KGB.    The film traces the development of the agency from its OSS roots in World War II. Wilson becomes a spy and is located in London during the war where he is involved with some of the spy and counter-spy activities with the Nazis. His old English Professor at Yale turns out to be a spy who mentors him during the war on intelligence gathering and analysis. However after the war in post-war Berlin he gets to fully experience and develop his craft in a cat and mouse game with the Soviets as they try to find Nazi scientists that both wish to capture and recruit for the emerging cold war.     Yet all these espionage experiences also teach himthat he can not trust anyone as he experiences duplicity from trusted friends and associates. Gradually Wilson becomes more aware of his KGB rival and they play a deadly and complex game to undermine each other's attempts at intelligence gathering. For example, Wilson attempts to get Nazi scientists out of Germany before the Soviets can obtain them. His translator is eventually revealed to be a spy who is helping the Soviets obtain the scientists or at least trade Jewish scientists for Nazi scientists.     The Soviet spy known as Ulysses sends decoy officials to give disinformation to the CIA, he follows Wilson and tries to disrupt his marriage when Wilson has a one-night-stand with an old girlfriend. Eventually the pain and intrigue gets closer and closer to Wilson, trying to find a way to compromise his integrity and put him in a position to give information to the Soviets.     I found the film very interesting and complex, requiring me to pay attention to subtle relationships, images, lines of dialogue, and understated movements. This gives the film a feeling of authenticity. In addition, the KGB and the CIA both played very dirty and this seems very realistic. We see spies killed once they are no longer needed and have too much information to allow to live.    The cast was superb with Matt Damon playing a cool, hardened man who has sacrificed much for his country yet his sacrifice is silent and only he really knows the extent of what he has lost and how little he has personally gained. In fact, the man had not really gained personally at all except that he has been given intellectually devious competition against which he feels he must prevail. He sacrificed his first love to marry the pregnant sister of his Yale friend and co-member of the Skull and Bones club.    Angelina Jolie plays the flirty passionate Senator's daughter who becomes married to a cold man possessed with a mission to protect the USA. She is neglected and resentful. Years of absence from the home distances husband and wife until Edmund can only feel compassion for his wife for all she has endured to support his career and dedication.    William Hurt plays the handsome, smart, first director of the CIA who overplays his hand by becoming a board member of a coffee company that benefits from the CIA assassinating the President of a Latin American nation that was nationalizing the businesses within their borders on a path toward Communism. Edmund Wilson gentle lets him know that the game is up and thus allows him to resign and move on without scandal.    Robert De Nero plays the role of a General who heads OSS and then lays the groundwork for the CIA at the end of WWII. Alec Balwin plays a cool detached FBI agent who is an ally for Wilson and allows him to identify problem personnel within the CIA. Billy Crudup plays his British counterpart and mentor who eventually is revealed to be something other than what he presents. Joe Pesci plays a Mafia don who assists in the Bay of Pigs invasion when Castro takes over 4 of his casinos in Havana.    Eventually the Bay of Pigs crisis is resolved from the intelligence aspect and the culprit who has said too much is revealed. Heavy prices are paid.     Those that serve their country with their minds are often overlooked and under appreciated since they make personal sacrifice that only they know have been made. The sacrifices are not made just by the individual who is in government service, but also by those that love him/her and those that he/she loves. This intelligent film honors all those individuals. It is brave motion picture making.

6304401736|3.0|I never felt myself really irritated by having to sit through a film, until I watched this.<br /><br />Too much \\"action-packed\\". Too \\"over the top\\". I found my thoughts drifting to how much wasted  energy on the part of thew actors. and what a waste of special effects.<br /><br />The \\"hilarious\\" ending where Glenn Close is being made into a cake was so far fetched and so long. I thought this film would never end.<br /><br />It's silly and ridiculous and seems to last an eternity.<br /><br />This is not a movie for children. They will not enjoy cruelty to animals or the horrible main character.
0765318741|5.0|I read the original novel R Matheson wrote in the 1950's out of curiousity with the movie coming out.  The book is absolutely amazing!  Matheson expertly draws you into Richard Neville's desolute and bleak world where Neville is trying to exist where he has lost his family, knows he is the only human left, and nightly hears the vampires (one of whom is his former neighbor and friend) outside his home calling for him to come out.<br /><br />Matheson created a down to earth, every day kind of Joe with Neville.  He isn't surving to be a hero, to \\"save\\" the world, or because he has made it a crusade to stop the vampires.  Neville questions why should he go on?  Faces his loneliness, fear and anger created out of the situation in a very real and relatable way.<br /><br />The turning point of the book is when Neville starts to do more than just keep going and starts to question the vampire disease.  It is at this point that takes it from a standard Stephen King or Bram Stoker horror/sci-fi format to something more.  Neville could be anyone and the \\"vampire\\" disease could be real.<br /><br />I was completely mesmorized with the writing, and finished it in less than 2 days.  I couldn't put it down.  No surprise that when I went to see the movie I was GREATLY disappointed.  I love Will Smith and he does a wonderful job acting in this film with what he was given.  But the story is completely changed in the movie.  The novel had a wonderful, almost humerously ironic twist at the end, whereas the movie went for classic \\"happily ever after\\" ending.  The character went for a relatable, every day kind of guy, to sterotypical hollywood \\"Hero\\".<br /><br />5 stars for the ORIGINAL novel, wait until video for the movie.
B00125WAWS|5.0|It is 1935, and at a small Negro college in Texas, Professor Tolson (Denzel Washington) is coaching the debate team.  Its members include a sweet, pretty girl, a ladies' man, and a 14-year old whiz-kid.  The students blossom under Tolson's leadership, but his extra-curricular activities may be a problem; at night he is secretly unionizing the share croppers, and the sheriff doesn't like it one bit.<br /><br />I never expected a movie about a debate team to be intense, scary, or exhilarating, but \\"The Great Debaters\\" is all that and more.  There are two stories here - one is the debate team and the other is life under segregation; both stories are compelling.  The acting is uniformly outstanding; Forrest Whitaker and Washington support some lesser-known, but extremely talented young stars.  We get to know their characters and care about them as they overcome their various obstacles to become the top Negro college debate team in the country.<br /><br />The injustices of segregation are vividly and heartbreakingly portrayed; it was quite a sobering look at the legalized cruelty of that time and place.  The fact that this is a true story makes it all the more inspiring.  Heartily recommended.

This book is an amazing story and the most intriguing part it that it is based off of real events that happen in Afghanistan. The farther you get into the book the more you want to learn. Be careful when reading because it contains graphic details of some of the stories. Overall, it worth reading and you will learn a lot about Afghan history.
B0002UOK04|5.0|For melodic metal fans that are looking for a new favorite cd, look no further. If you have ever heard of or listen to Ensiferum, well, their main man Jari Maenpaa decided to go off and do his own solo work, and thus Wintersun emerges! Writing the lyrics and music for the guitars and keyboards, with Kai Hahto writing and playing the drums, he definitely made a good choice, though Ensiferum was awesome as well. The best way for me to describe the music style is to say it's a close cross of Children of Bodom's style of music and Yngwie Malmsteen's radical guitar style of music, and it definitely comes together to sound unique. As far as vocals, Jari has an excellent growl and surprisingly just as good clean vocal style. 5 of 5 for the excellent writing and performance. Melo-metal fans, give 'em a try...
B000R7HY0K|3.0|Not that this film needs another review, but I suppose I'll put in my two cents for s%*ts and giggles.  But before I get into anything, I'd just like to point out that this movie solidly confirms what we'd all suspected since Pulp Fiction, and that is that Tarantino most certainly has a foot fetish.  There are so many shots of feet in this film that you almost(almost) think that the project had started out as a foot fetish porn film that Tarantino might have wanted to do on the side.  With all that aside, the general consensus on Death Proof is that it's a colossal bore.  There are quite a few defenders of the film as well, maybe even moreso than those who didn't like it.  Are people tiring of Tarantino's style or did Tarantino's style just not work this time around?  I'm somewhere in the middle.  I didn't think this was the abysmal failure it's made out to be, nor do I think it's a very good Tarantino film.  I also don't think it's all that great an homage to grindhouse cinema.  Grindhouse films of the 70 were cheap, exploitative, sometimes shocking or groundbreaking, fun, trashy entertainment.  Fast food kinda movies.  Now in Death Proof Tarantino basically made a Tarantino film with a few grindhouse dashes here and there(the music from Dario Argento's Bird With The Crystal Plumage plays while Kurt Russell is photographing his next potential victims like the killer in Argento's film did.  The scene is also shot in the same style.  A nice touch).  Fine.  After all, it is his movie.  By now everyone knows the major criticism of this movie is the constant dialogue and little action.  Personally, I have no problem with movies that take their time getting to where they're going.  Many of the best directors do take their time.  Tarantino himself has made this work for him before.  After all, this is the guy who can take an 80 minute premise and stretch it out to absurd lengths, but manage to keep things interesting.  In the case of Death Proof, it's simply the story of  a vehicular serial killer that finally tangles with the wrong carload of potential victims and has the tables turned on him.  I expected alot of dialogue in this film.  Tarantino himself can't keep his mouth shut, so why should his characters?  My problem didn't come from the dialogue, my problem was that I didn't like a single character in this movie.  Tarantino seemed to find the most irritating and grating women on the planet and stuck them all here.  The few males weren't much better in their small roles(one of them being Tarantino's new bosom buddy, Eli Roth).  I certainly don't get off on real life serial killers, but the great thing about the film world is that you can feel guiltless for rooting for the bad guy.  Killers can be cool in the movies.  I was rooting for Kurt Russell all the way in the hopes that he would put an end to these annoying women.  Speaking of Russell, he's clearly the best actor of the bunch and puts on a good performance.  Personally I didn't like his on a dime turn from macho killer to whining wuss.  People also felt this didn't fit as the second feature on a double bill.  Well, I have no problem with that either coz old grindhouse double features would usually include two films quite different from one another.  On the positive side, I really admire what Tarantino and Rodriguez were trying to accomplish with the Grindhouse project.  It's a great idea and a pity it wasn't a success.  I do feel that Death proof has it's moments, and not just the fleeting violent ones either.  With so many reviews already, I can't add much more to the pile.  All I can say is that I'm glad I saw it and I appreciate the effort even if I wasn't totally thrilled with the results.  In the end I can only suggest that if a person really wants the \\"grindhouse\\" experience, just rent a \\"grindhouse\\" movie.  I'd suggest Death Race 2000 if you dig this kinda vehicle carnage.a vehicular serial killer that finally tangles with the wrong carload of potential victims and has the tables turned on him.  I expected alot of dialogue in this film.  Tarantino himself can't keep his mouth shut, so why should his characters?  My problem didn't come from the dialogue, my problem was that I didn't like a single character in this movie.  Tarantino seemed to find the most irritating and grating women on the planet and stuck them all here.  The few males weren't much better in their small roles(one of them being Tarantino's new bosom buddy, Eli Roth).  I certainly don't get off on real life serial killers, but the great thing about the film world is that you can feel guiltless for rooting for the bad guy.  Killers can be cool in the movies.  I was rooting for Kurt Russell all the way in the hopes that he would put an end to these annoying women.  Speaking of Russell, he's clearly the best actor of the bunch and puts on a good performance.  Personally I didn't like his on a dime turn from macho killer to whining wuss.

0765318741|5.0|Richard Matheson wrote this story for a different era. It is through a continuous evolution of the characters thoughts and memories that the reader is kept in suspense. This also affected by the give and take of the main character, Robert Neville, with the creatures. This is portrayed when sleepless nights are met with a days full of upkeep and work to stay alive.<br />The continuing feeling of desperation and continual relapse into denial aid the character on. The psychology of why does one keep living in this state seems to be answered but shot down in just what seems to be crushing conclusions. The ending is what it should be. It's not happy so to say. Sometimes the scariest and most suspenseful conclusions are how things in there own situations really, in all honesty, end. Sometimes life is a tragedy. It's just one more aspect that makes this a classic.
B00125JP1C|2.0|It's an action movie. Paul giomatti kinda sucks as a villain. The plot's kinda stretched. Some of the sequences are overly ridiculous. Watched it at my friend's house. I certainly wouldn't want to spend $4 on it.

0143038419|5.0|I am currently reading this book and loving it (mostly done.) I see that many people complain in their reviews the the author is too self centered. I'm sorry, this is a story about a person trying to find who she is, it's supposed to be self centered.  Early on in the book she says that she becomes who ever her partner needs her to be, she even notes that one person who she doesn't know very well commented that when she was married she looked like her husband and now she looks like her boyfriend. It is about finding herself,something I think a lot of people never do, it is not finding what is wrong with the rest of the world.     I love her style of writting, very much like the long chatty e-mails we get almost weekly from a neice telling about all of the fun things that she has done (and not so fun things) since the last e-mail.  I love it when the author refers to her passport as looking like a 'tattooed circus lady'.  She talks about trying to change her inner dialog and her struggles as she tries to figure out who she is.    I think that it written very well for the genre (normally read SciFi/Fantasy - David Weber or Kate Elliot she not.)
0142004235|5.0|Steinbeck's novel is truly a masterpiece as he weaves the stories of two unique American families and exposes the character's deepest, darkest thoughts, particularly those of Cathy and Cal. Each character is carefully constructed and the personalities are told in great detail. The story begins when Steinbeck describes the serene land in the Salinas Valley. I felt mesmerized by the beauty of his language, for he describes things extensively- from appearance to scent. I could imagine the wild flowers in spring and the tiny Victorian houses right before me. From the complexity of the characters to the meticulousness of the setting, this novel is simply beautiful.   Even the structure is unique and it is evident that Steinbeck took a lot of time to perfect the order in which his story would be told. In Part 1 of the novel, Steinbeck alternates between the Trask family and the Hamilton family each chapter. The families are on different parts of the country and have no relationship whatsoever. It is not until part 2, where the two families merge in Salinas, California. I found this method very clever because I was able to differentiate the families in their respective environments. It was interesting to read the characters' pasts because it would certainly affect their futures. For example, the fact that Adam Trask's father lied to him as a child accounts for Adam's determination to be a good father for his own children; Cathy's poor childhood and the lack of parental love account for her horrible actions towards her children. As the story progresses, I learned that Adam's tough character is a result of serving in the army. Away from his family, Adam had to be independent and strong- both physically and emotionally.   In an attempt to start a new life, Adam bought a piece of farmland from Samuel Hamilton. However, the story immediately turns dark and somber as Cathy, Adam's new wife, abandons her twin boys. Cathy is a dark character and she is the epitome of evil. She isa selfish woman who blames her wrongdoings on other people. Every word Cathy said made me despise her, for this woman neglected her children to run a brothel. Cathy's dialogue in conversations with other characters made me develop only disgust for her. Steinbeck was careful in his writing because after depicting the evil Cathy, he would switch to men of wisdom: Lee and Samuel Hamilton. These characters offered relief from the tense drama occurring by offering peace. Lee and Samuel, firm believers in God, spoke straight from the Bible to convey a sense of goodness. Unlike Cathy, these characters care for the twin boys and are proof that there is still good in the world. Cathy's ruthless nature is passed on to her son Cal, as he struggles to form his own identity. Cal feels trapped between good and evil, until the wise character Lee offers him profound advice. He learns that he is his own person and is not doomed to be evil like his mother. Cal is a human being (whereas his mother is a \\"monster\\") and thus is subject to make mistakes. I developed so many emotions from reading this, such as joy, relief, sadness, pity, and utter disgust. Even though I found some parts to be predictable, I felt that the entire novel was filled with suspense. There was not a single moment that I wanted to stop reading. This novel is so intriguing because it explores the dark side of the human mind, including such concepts such as revenge, sin, and evil.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|There is not much I can say about this that has not already been said. I bought \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" based entirely on its Amazon reviews, finding myself unable to ignore the fact that, of almost 250 ratings, over 200 of them were 5-star. And I'm glad I did. My wife and I watched the series over the course of a week and enjoyed each of the episodes. Similar to a series like \\"Band of Brothers,\\" each of the episodes was led by a different director and this leads to a lot of variety in the style of the episodes. Some are almost documentaries while some are almost movies. Some are told from the perspectives of the astronauts while others are told from the viewpoints of the men on the ground or the wives of the astronauts. This keeps the series from growing stale, even while it could have become repetitive.<br /><br />\\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" was a great introduction to the space race and I enjoyed every minute of it. It's well worth adding to your collection.
0978607651|4.0|Kudos to Todd Oldham and Charley on this amazing feat - I couldn't love this book much more (I've already purchased four for my family), yet there is one reason why I didn't rate it five stars: the printing.  Everything is amazing, but the matte finish and somewhat reduced-quality sharpness of the images slights this book in my opinion.  I understand that a higher-quality print would only make this book more expensive, but I'd be willing to pay for it.  Hopefully they will release such an edition in the future.  But honestly, in the mean time, this book is worth the $125+ cost.      Great highlights: the organization of Charley's work, the interview in the beginning, and the indexing of his work in the back.  If you didn't know this genius or his work, please take the time to get to know him.

B00005NKKZ|5.0|This masterful album can only be called succulent. And that's just to start with. The adjectives need to wax ever stronger in order adequately to describe the movement from one classic piece to the next in this eleven-track celebration of some of the 1970s finest music.<br /><br />Like Seinfeld for the ears, Simon and Garfunkel's music generates many of the lyrics and observations that are engraved upon the brains of us who grew up in that era and which spring almost unconsciously to the lips when circumstances beckon.<br /><br />One is struck by how different each song is from the other. With its intelligent consolation ('When evening fall so hard ...'), 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' is one of the great songs of the second half of the twentieth century. Then comes 'El Condor Pasa', the tune that single-handedly introduced the Andean pipe into the North American musical conscience. Its tempo--somewhere between plodding and jaunty--is a universe removed from the gentle grief of 'Bridge'.<br /><br />Both are of a still different species than the unforgettable 'Celia', which provokes the ever-enlightening heuristic question, 'What were these guys *smokin'*?'<br /><br />'So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright' defies classification, for it may be the only sung eulogy to an architect. It manages to provide one of the all-time most flexible mantras of meaninglessness: 'Architects may come and architects may go, an everchanging point of view'. I find it particularly useful on very long trips.<br /><br />All of which brings us to the album's central treasure, the unsung 'The Boxer'. I still remember the moment, thirty years ago, when I heard it for the first time, sung badly by my fellow  bruised and hungry travelers on an Outward Bound expedition in Wisconsin. A part of me makes me think we should each listen to this song on the first of every January and July, merely on the premonition that it would do *something* good for us each time. It is inexplicable to me why this piece did not find itself a central component of our shared and popular culture in the way it appeared destined to do.<br /><br />Speaking of unsung, 'The Only Living Boy in New York' is life-as-seen-gently-from-below in the manner that would make a career for Paul Simon the songwriter. 'Tom, get your plane-ride on time ...' is an inauspicious opener, that much is clear. But Simon is a past master at telling the little guy's story compellingly and with an authenticity that is not harmed by occasional flashes of wit ('My father was a prominent frogman ...' on the previous track). 'Only Living Boy' is an ode sing-able on every very tired night after accomplishing something worthwhile. It could never have been performed in just this way after the Simon and Garfunkel split, for Garfunkel's very smooth tenor hanging almost mystically above the proceedings on this song is an indispensable part of its magic.<br /><br />Magic may be the operative word with which to sum up the impact of  BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER. Still, the concept has its weaknesses. Magic is about smoke, mirrors, and abracadabras, impressive as all that can be. Simon and Garfunkel were about talent and a penetrating musical genious. Together only briefly, they comprised the most talented, smooth-writing duo on the face of the planet.<br /><br />No one seems to know quite what happened after that.<br /><br />No matter. BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER is still with us. That's enough for now.shared and popular culture in the way it appeared destined to do.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|If you loved all of the previous Pixar releases, add this one to the list. Entertaining, fabulous graphics, great story. The whole family enjoyed this one.
B000NQPZCO|4.0|Goodfellas was the first Mafia movie that actually got it right. Donnie Brasco is the second. Personally I think they wasted film and time showing his personal problems with his wife and children, but I can see where showing his mental anguish at being away from his family, and in creating relationships with mobsters might have weighed heavily on him. This is a good movie.
B00005JPXY|4.0|WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD    Anyone who says that there is no Hell should visit the place I grew up, southern Georgia, in the month of August.  Aside from the oppressive heat,  some things I remember vividly are the fire ant mounds that would infest our property.  One of my chores as a teenager was to break them up and pour poison into them.    I occasionally wondered how the tiny creatures felt as they watched a giant invader, huge beyond their comprehension, destroying their carefully built tunnels and raining death down on them.    Not that they didn't fight back; they launched waves of their best warriors against me.  But their poisonous bites were to me nothing more than irritating stings, and I was all the more gleeful in my annihilation of them because of the minor pain they caused me.    I now know how the little devils felt.    Cloverfield is a film about a young, hip group of Manhattanites whose world is demolished by a monster that lumbers beside skyscrapers, almost matching many of them in height.  We learn little about this beast, other than it's very big, very tough, and very, very pissed.  The military tosses tons of conventional firepower against it, but it just keeps coming.  In fact, in one scene that must have been a nod to Godzilla, we see the creature's foot step on a tank, crushing it like a tin can.    Making the situation worse are a horde of smaller critters, about the size of large dogs, that have invaded the city as well.  Watch out, don't let them bite!  As one character found out, the results can be explosive.    I won't give any major plot details, but be warned: things don't end happy  for our friends, who are recording all of this on their trusty camcorder.  Also, the question of whether the monster is ultimately slain or not remains open, as do queries about its origin and nature.  Like so many of life's tragedies (car crashes, cancer, etc.) the beast comes without reason, without mercy, and without escape.      I think this is one reason for the movie's popularity: it taps into the fears we all have that terrible events will unravel the fragile security of our lives and rob us of all we hold precious and sacred.    The utter lack of resolution is the reason I dinged the film one star.  This movie cries out for a sequel, or at least some explanations from its creators.  In the absence of certainty speculation abounds, however, and I offer some below for interested parties:    During the movie Hud mentions the possibility that the monster came from an ocean trench, and I think this a strong possibility.  It did, after all, rise from the sea.      Also, its extremely tough hide and near-invulnerability to bombs and bullets could be due to its having to withstand the tremendous pressures it would deal with on the ocean's bottom.    It obviously breathes air, indicating it probably uses some gill/lung double system.  It also suggests that the military would have been better off forgetting the tanks, bombs, etc. and just nerve-gassing it.     The mini-monsters that plague the city were, in my opinion, the giant's equivalent of lice, hair mites, etc.  Just as we have tiny bugs that hitch a ride with us in our follicles, lashes, skin, etc., so does it.  My good wife suggested the possibility that they were the critter's offspring, dropped across the city so they could grow up to be just like mom.  Now that's a scary thought.    End of speculation.  But I do have one more thing to say.  I had no trouble watching this movie, and I hate roller coasters.  The remarks about its jerky quality were, to me, vastly overblown.  It does come across as something shot by a terrified amateur film maker who is fleeing for his life, but, hey, that's exactly what it's supposed to be, so what's the problem?    Highly recommended for horror, monster and SF fans - or anyone who likes a good scare.
B000TGJ80I|3.0|Not bad, not great, but not bad. If you ever read the World of Darkness series from White Wolf Press it will be easier for you to get into the story and grim backdrop. It was a good story and pretty good cast. But I feel they could have gone in another direction using the original story idea. They just went with the same old, boring, 'girl falls for guy' theme.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|Earlier reviewers have hit the nail on the head with this movie so there is not point in re-stating things. This is a wonderful movie, timeless classic. Any serious movie buff should have this one in their collection.
B000FGGE7C|1.0|Milla Jovovitch is very attractive, but she needs help with the acting. There were no great stars in this. Just a tired old story of the hard hearted operative who has a change of heart in order to save an innocent child. You get the feeling the writers phoned it in.

B00005JPXY|5.0|So of course everyone is aware of this movie due to the mysterious advertisments that surrounded it months before the name was even revealed... So the question began, \\"Can it ever live up to the hype?\\"  so two nights ago (the day after it was released) I went and found out that, yes, it absolutely could.  Now I won't say anything negative to those who hated it or thought it was merely 'so-so' because no movie will ever be loved by every single human being, but I will say why I loved the hell out of it.      1) I love how it was set up to be a story about people living through a monter invasion and not the actual monster itself.  No, you never get told what the monster is, no you never find out where it came from, no you don't see much of the monster throughout the movie.  BUT! You never find out what it is and where it came from because the characters never do, and you don't see much of it in the movie because the characters don't see much of it (due to running for their lives) but don't worry, cause nobody will leave the movie and wonder \\"What exactly did the monster look like?\\"      2) I love how they took a totally crappy, lame plot (basically a love story about one guy loving a girl but never telling her who then decides to go into a deserted city with a HUGE creature on the lose to rescue her) and set it in these wonderfly suspensful situations that actually make it acceptable. Sit through the ten minutes of story setup and noisy partying and BOOM! (literally) the action kicks off with a bang. After that it's a truely suspenseful tale of a group of kids running from an unknown creature big enough to use Miss Libery's head like a football.  And also, it's not just the massive beast they have to fear, cause it didn't come alone.    3) I love the scene where they decide to travel through the subway tunnels, through the pitch dark with nothing but a whimpy camera light. I actually think this whole scene is what made me love the movie so much. The way the writers wrote the dialouge and the actors acted, you can just so clearly feel them go from scared to terrified even without the presence of the monster. There's also a very humorous conversation between the camerman and his love interest about Superman and Garfield.    4)I love that this movie gets away with being just slightly over an hour long, maybe 75 mins. I hate movies that can't pull enough story together to atleast fill a 2 hour movie.  Cloverfield is the one, and possibly only, exception. I can't of anything that could've been added on for more time, honestly. It's a short, exciting, run for you life film and it's perfect that way.    So I guess I'll wrap it up by saying Give the movie a chance, and if it's possible go see it on the big screen cause I think it's gonna lose some of it's 'magic' on a regular television. It's short, it gives zero answers to all the important questions, it has no underlying story or overall message, what the camera shows does leave alot to the imagination, but it is entertaining enough to pull it all off. I really think it deserves these five stars...
B000PTYP5C|5.0|When it comes right down to it, ALMOST all of Dream Theater's albums are great in some way or another, although I must say I have not yet heard a note of _Octavarium_ for some reason. Underlying all of their higher-order changes across the different years and recordings is a pretty decisive commitment to super-tight progressive metal, a genre that would have significantly different meaning but for DT's influence. So with that in mind, I am not going to say \\"well this release was so and so and this release was amazing and...\\" or anything like that. Unless you are uptight, you probably like all DT's albums if you like DT. And so _Systematic Chaos_ is interesting because it is so...Dream Theater, which is like saying it is so prog-metal, which is what we all think about when we think of DT. This is outstanding, the kind of fiery AND technically difficult prog-metal that shows their spirits have nary been depleted by age, and they can really nail prog-metal craftsmanship in a way that no other band can. In the making-of documentary Portnoy talks about how he wanted to make an album that was just \\"really cool\\" which in a way sounds like a modest goal. But as weak and trivial as that sounds, this album is really cool and that's sort of what their catalogue all about anyway -- polished, well-produced music with superlative technical chops, songwriting ability, and emotional grip. This disc also marks DT's first use of fantasy/adventure/monster lyrics in a long time, which is because it makes for good prog lyrics.<br /><br />\\"In the Presence of Enemies\\", with Psalm 23 references and based on a Korean graphic novel, is epic progressive metal in the echelon of \\"Metropolis pt.2\\" and \\"A Change of Seasons\\". Although its two parts open and close the album, in my view it is best listened to with the tracklisting reprogrammed to place them together, and that is perfection. The instrumental prelude is an overture for various themes, like the sick 9/8 prog-chug and a very memorable, very soaring melodic lead by Petrucci. The second part \\"Resurrection\\" brings LaBrie in, leading with brilliant vocal lines, and a voice that seems to get better with age. There is an intense surge towards a cliff-hanger ending, with blazing scales and Labrie singing of \\"redemption...redemption for humanity.\\" Part II goes forward with the quiet-to-soaring \\"Heretic\\", the exhilarating speed metal (with proggy refinement) of \\"Slaughter of the Damned\\", the climax of emotional intensity and technical prowess on \\"The Reckoning\\", and the masterful resolution of \\"Salvation\\", which is Labrie's finest moment in years.<br /><br />While the major epic is in the \\"classic prog-metal\\" category, the other tracks are more eclectic and give the album amazing balance. First there is the dark vampire song \\"Forsaken\\", with haunting piano theme framing a great, heavy power ballad of sorts. \\"Constant Motion\\" is seven minutes of the best pure prog-metal kickazzery they've got. \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" is about a mummy risen from his tomb (or something like that!), where a cement-heavy odd-metered riff is raked through myriad rhythmic permutations each time it is brought to bear, with an interlude that is a swirling vortex of fugue-like metal, ragtime, and metallic jazz, and opaque walls of coiling riffs like \\"The Dance of Eternity\\". \\"Repentence\\" has a somewhat Tool-like initial riff, but the main verses and arrangement are an intricate ostinati and Rudess' piano very prominent. The second part has an interlude of vocal samples from guests (Mikael Akerfeldt, Jon Anderson, David Ellefson, Daniel Gildenlow, Steve Hogarth, Chris Jericho, Neal Morse, Joe Satriani, Corey Taylor, Steve Vai, and Steven Wilson) speaking of something for which they are sorry. Then a sea of rising and falling \\"ahh\\"s with crescendoing with full-band and classical piano carries the song to its end. \\"Prophets of War\\" has almost a dance-like beat at first, laser synths beaming around, and a shouted chorus of rebellion accompanied a muscular prog-riff to match. \\"Ministry of Lost Souls\\" is a sixteen-minute mega-ballad that uses every second it has to build beautifully.<br /><br />Dream Theater is still arguably the top master in its field and _Systematic Chaos_ helps their reputation considerably. I'm sure there are a lot of dream theater fans who hate it but those fans needs to be way less uptight or just get a life because they probably think Shadow Gallery has a few good albums.<br /><br />Final note: the special edition is very much worth the extra few dollars both for the great making-of documentary DVD and the highly attractive slipcase.ular prog-riff to match. \\"Ministry of Lost Souls\\" is a sixteen-minute mega-ballad that uses every second it has to build beautifully.

6304698682|4.0|I'm tempted to give this paralell-universe \\"Shane\\" five stars if only for hired-gun Stockburn's infamous deputies. Six silent men in pale dusters, who throughout never utter a peep, never talk among themselves, never smile, never scowl, never even blink -- it is absolutly classic American Western filmmaking. You laughed at WB Cartoons' spoofs of such melodramatic Wild West moments if you're old enough to remember those.    So it's campy, but in a great way. In Westerns, Clint Eastwood is a true player, though I think he must have had his toungue in cheek a lot. I love the metaphysical hints in the plot, the flirting with biblical identity, his version of upholding the honor and \\"code\\" of the West as a man-of-the-cloth/gunslinger, both of whom bear the Eastwood Curse of always being attractive to women (!) -- it's great stuff!  He pushed the envelope in this brazen variation of Shane and although it was made in 1985, I'd say it was really more of a '70s movie in some regards, but that's part of its appeal. Eastwood is a good filmmaker and a tiny bit mischevious.    It has gratuitously violent gunplay in some scenes, and the manner of the implied sexual attractions is nearly as gratuitous. That drops it a star in my book, as it makes it an awkward film to watch with kids or older folks from a more modest and dignified era. That said, part of the film's appeal for me is that those lustful tuggings were very believable and actually must have been part of the equation in many real-life pioneer situations. There was a time I could have been in Megan's very shoes; teen-age girls could learn something from this movie!    I'm a lover of Westerns, and this one is certainly in my top ten. An enjoyable move that gets better with time and perspective.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|While I would never make the claim that \\"Friends\\" was something that held my attention, my sister would. She loves this series and stated that this was the only item she wanted for the holidays. She has been watching it regularly since she received her gift.
B000VL9XE2|5.0|Sure to be on many lists as the avant-garde go-to posterboys of the year, The Dillinger Escape Plan once again manage to raise the ante and  boldy go where (nearly) no one has gone before. Complex, experimental, and sarcastic, \\"Ire Works\\" is a hard album to love or hate. Veering wildly from the now stereotypical \\"mathcore\\" blueprint of outrageous heaviness and complexity to Da Da-esque absurdity and funky, hook-laden pop, the average listener to much of what passes for popular music these days should probably be forgiven for percieving this album as some sort of weird joke...and therein lies the genius.<br /><br />For all the abrasive, pummeling intensity of the one-two punch album opener of \\"Fix Your Face\\" and \\"Lurch\\", one is suddenly confronted with it's polar opposite, the Rick James-meets-J-pop-sugary-sweet-catchiness of \\"Black Bubblegum\\", and the rest of this bizarre release begins to conform to this pattern, constantly catching you off guard and revealing yet another humorously skewed post-metal in-joke. Imagine, if you will, an aberrant auditory conglomeration of King Crimson, Meshuggah, Mr Bungle, Tangerine Dream, Return To Forever and the Flaming Lips, and you might be in the ballpark. It is quite an interesting, fun and oddly addictive experience for the musically adventurous. Cool stuff.
B0012QTT6M|5.0|I don't follow a lot of tv shows as my life is busy enough as it is.  That being said, I was intrigued enough by what I read in the sunday paper that I stayed up past my bedtime to catch the premier episode.  I am also a  fan of Brian Cranston from his earlier work on Malcolm in the Middle.  I enjoyed the show immensely, and am glad I stayed up for it. Having recently turned 50 myself (as Cranston does in the first episode), the show touched on a number of issues I can relate to.  His transformation from hard working, underpaid father to crystal meth artist will be interesting to watch, as will how he deals with his own moral dilemnas.    \\"I'm awake\\" he responds, when asked by his new drug partner why he was doing this (making meth).  I guess that I will be awake as well, every sunday night to watch how this every day man continues to deal with his epiphany, his awakening.  His mortality....
B00005MCX2|5.0|I am not about to gush how much this album was a perfect moment in space rock history.  But it is a perfect match to the most recent Hawkwind album.  YES and HELLO!  Hawkwind is back.  Haven't heard of it?  I will say it again! Hawkwind is BACK... as a group called Space Ritual on an album called \\"Otherworld\\".  Anyone who loves Hawkwind should take a look and a listen![[ASIN:B000VWYEX6 Otherworld]]

B000N6TYLW|5.0|Another great season of one of my favorite shows of all time. The characters are great and the writing is what you've come to expect from this show. My only negative is that the season appears to be \\"rushed\\", leaving several story lines not too well developed, particularly the newer characters. Despite that, I highly recommend it to die hard GG fans and newbies alike. A definite must for your library!
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|Brilliant movie and a true classic of all time!  This movie goes on top of my list of most watched.<br /><br />This will definitely be a good buy on blu ray.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift.  It came on time and well-protected in its packaging.  I have not viewed the series on the DVD's, but watch the show regularly.
0143038419|5.0|I love this book so much I have read it twice, shared it with my friends, and used it in my adult Sunday morning class.  Gilbert is very real to me, has many of the foibles we all share, has been in the pits, and climbed out, never forgetting how she got to where she is now.  And she is a thankful human being.  It is with my own deep thankfulness that she is also a wonderful writer.  I will probably never meet her, but I have been helped along my own path by this book.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|If you live on this planet, then you should see this mini-series. We forget that not all of the world looks like our hometown, or even like our continent. Beautiful images and thought provoking information that will stay with you long after viewing. Holds up to multiple repeat viewings. Can't imagine anyone of any age or education or background who would not be entertained and engrossed. Top notch! Well done!
0765316889|4.0|The first Mystborn book started slow, but by the end I thought \\"okay, now we're getting somewhere\\".  Well of Ascension starts fast and just gets better as it goes.  I couldn't put it down.  Took me 72 hours to read it.  Just when I thought I'd read it all in SF, Robertson takes me by surprise with his innovative concepts, plot twists, fully fleshed and flawed characters.  He has the potential to become one of the best of SF writers, in league with Jordan, George RR Martin, Heinlein and, yes, even Tolkien.  I can't wait for the next book.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I've been a Doctor Who fan for 20 years and LOVE the new series, but I was a bit skeptical about Torchwood - Until I watched it!    WOW - Men in Black on ACID!!     John Barrowman is fantastic!  Not to mention gorgeous!!!    The rest of the cast are new to me but I am growing to like them.    Okay, a few of the scripts aren't always fantastic, but the cast works great together.
B000UR366S|5.0|I won't say much at all here except that people who find this album depressing or suggest it is Ms. Mitchell's age that is responsible for fading artistry simply don't get it. This is classic Mitchell, doing what this woman has done her entire life... making provocactive statements with grade A music.
B000KC86F4|3.0|Best of the X-men films and I have almost every X-Men comic ever printed. Now onto this blu-ray transfer. Ive only had a blu-ray player a short time and have the ten free movies it came with. This is the only one of the ten that only uses the single layer 25g space. This was most certainly rushed to blue-ray to cash in on X-mas shoppers. The sound is exactly the same as the collectors edition DVD!! The picture is a little better. This I would not buy if you already have the regular dvd because the way this player (Sony S-300) upscales you barely notice. Shame on Fox for this one, they did a good job on Fantastic Four/ Surfer blu-ray though.
B000WBZ5M0|4.0|If you enjoyed Ocean's 11, then you will appreciate Ocean's 13. It is written in the same spirit as Ocean's 11, with humor, sarcasm, and lots of good natured hijinx. It has unexpected twists and turns and is much easier to follow than Ocean's 12. It is a fun, entertaining movie.
0385338082|5.0|i like to read chick lit sometimes, and sophie (the author of the shopaholic series) is one of the best for this genre. an interesting, funny, fast read about a woman who talked too much and could have gotten herself into trouble, but instead gets herself into real life.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|The conversion kit is very simple to change. The only drawback I noticed was you lose a lot of the focusing capability.The extra brightness makes up for that most of the time.
0618526412|5.0|This is an extraordinary work in the way it is the only novel written that truly catches the deaf experience and feelings. That Carson McCullers was herself disabled may be the reason for such insightful empathy in John Singer, the deaf mute whom a host of characters use to ease their own feelings of emptiness and lonliness. That 'Mr Singer' has feelings and human problems they are oblivious to.<br /> This is a masterful novel. I had 'got into' McCullers work by reading her 'Ballad of the Sad Cafe' short story collection and have yet to be anything other than stunned by her wonderful writing. This is a five star novel with bags to spare.
B000YMBBH0|4.0|I've loved the series even when there was just one movie!  Smart, fast action.  Gotta love the driving scenes.  This movies makes you feel like you know all there is to know about spies!
0060855924|4.0|This kind of book is what happens when a guy like Douglas Adams tries to write a book like the Lord of the Rings.<br />I have a 30y old nephew who reads Tolkien and plays Warhammer and is a physicist specializing in lazer technology. When we were making conversation, as happens at family gatherings, I mentioned that I think the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a marvel of a, well, quartet, and he said, I absolutely must read Pratchett.<br />Ok, I got myself the first volume of the Discworld series, of 20 or so. I read it on a long distance flight. It is hilarious. I laughed a lot. Do I plan to read the next 19? Absolutely no way. I can't stand this much fun. A whole book being funny is a heavy burden.<br />Pratchett has an endless stream of hilarious ideas. The description of the 'geography' and sociology and mythology of Discworld is worth reading. Where I give up in the end is in the plot. I can not digest that much fun.
0439813786|5.0|Wow, neat book.  A real handful at 544 pages, but can be read by an adult in under an hour - thanks to the dozens and dozens of captivating pencil illustrations that tell most of the story.  This is a blend of liberally embellished \\"historical\\" fiction and fantasy.  The reader is treated to a cruel, but simultaneously sweet, world of Paris in the 1930's - and the world is effectively delievered in the text, the drawings, and then in the imagination that the book successfully induces.  The drama is enough to pull the reader into each succeeding chapter, but not enough (I don't think) to make child readers squirm too much.  The author delivers a satisfying resolution for all the loose ends in a single page near the end, and clearly all of our favorite characters will live happily ever after.  What a unique book - I loved it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What else is there to say that hasn't been said about \\"Planet Earth\\"? It is by far the best television series ever. Worth every penny and minute you spend. An absolute must see.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is an autobiographical story about James M. Barrie and<br />how he came to write the play and novel \\"Peter Pan\\".<br />It is also about death and orphans: the English, as Oliver Twist by Dickens points out, had trouble dealing with orphans.<br />Barrie had a warm open heart and found a fantasy world for children<br />that appears to be timeless and universal.<br />There is always a place in the heart of children for pirates, Indians and fairies.<br />There is a real contrast in the emotional approach to death taken here and that in another recent movie:[[ASIN:B000YAF4MA The Bucket List]]<br />I think that both have good acting by great actors,<br />but one seems to be about  the \\"me first\\" approach to life<br />and this one is about living with death for both the living<br />ands the survivors. I think that both are \\"sentimental\\",<br />but this approach seems better.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|The first two episodes scared the hell out of me, but it really sucked me in...every episode had its own creepy atmosphere and Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles never disappoint as the Winchester brothers.  Plus, you see a lot new monsters/legends that are really complex and not just one dimensional.  Highly recommended for people who like the paranormal, get scared, and for girls who love hot guys! ^_^
B000I5X81K|5.0|I'll admit I was a bit disappointed when I first listened to this CD.  I loved his first CD.  It took some time for me to grow to love the Closer CD.  Awake has also taken some time.  I recommend that you keep an open mind and listen to Awake a few times before you make a decision whether you really like it or not.  After some time, I found myself singing these songs during the day:  Mai, You are Loved, February Song, In Her Eyes(which is my favorite song),Now or Never, Weeping, and Machine.  These songs are all awesome! I wasn't impressed at first but now think this is a fabulous album and  am glad I purchased it.  I think if Josh only sang \\"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\\" I would absolutely love it.  His voice is so rich and pure.  He is still very young and has every right to experiment with his music to see exactly what best defines him as an artist. A true Josh Groban fan will listen to all of his music and give the guy the benefit of the doubt when unsure of what to make of his choice in music or style.  I found this  CD to be refreshingly different, unique and beautiful.  Listening to music is sometimes like eating a new food, you must taste it at least 10 times before you can really decide whether you like it or not. Give it a listen.  The music will grow on you!
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|I went on the nuclear blast website to watch the new Nightwish video, and the video for \\"Never Enough\\" came on, and I fell in love with this band. This album, in my opinion, is the epitomy of symphonic metal! With Simone's perfect voice, balancing Mark Jansen's growls, and mesmerizing choir/orchestra/lyrics really shows the band's potential. It's so hard to pick a favorite track, since they branch out the intensity on each one, but I would say my favorite is \\"Chasing the Dragon.\\"  I recommend this for anyone who loves Nightwish, Kamelot, Symphony X and After Forever.  This album is something you don't want to miss out on!
B000FVRABG|2.0|This is a very disappointing set.  The images are a little blurry and have not been cleaned up for transfer to DVD.  The synchronization of picture and sound is off in many places in an annoyingly transparent way.  Not all the symphonies are in the concert hall, but rather located in the odd studio that looks very dated in the late 60's and early 70's.    Soundwise, these are fine, but nothing spectacular.  I have high hopes for DVD as a medium for classical music- and some that I have bought {see my review of Perlman/Barenboim on EMI} have met or exceeded what I have hoped for.  For myself, and from now on, I am not going to buy old recordings made into DVD's unless the reviews indicate that it is worth it.  These most certainly are not.  A little patience, I am sure, and a new recording will be made.  After all, this should be fairly easy to do:  Record live concerts.
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|This is a great CD for a long car ride, jogging around the lake, or just chilling out.
0743289412|5.0|I had a hard time  at first staying with this story I put it down 3 times (not a good sign)I like books that grab me from the first few pages at least an most S.K. novels do,not so this story but I had it so stuck with it and I can say I am glad I did!!By page 200 he had me and I didn`t stop reading until I was done not his very best but I `m not sorry I bought it
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|What a funny, and fun movie this is. Cary Grant had the ability to go from dashing and confident (it takes a thief) to bumbling and clueless(bringing up baby and monkey business) and to do so effortlessly. The pairing of Grant and the gorgeous Katherine Hepburn in this film was inspired. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to see what real movie stars were about, and to anyone who loves a good zany comedy with loads of star power. I can't say enough good things about \\"Bringing Up Baby\\". Buy it, rent it, borrow it, or find it on on TV, but WATCH IT!
0061142026|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book, not my usual order of operations. Loved the movie and the book was perfect. Some story lines were updated for a theatrical delight in order to tell a smoother story in the timeframe, but the book on its own is a stand alone winner. Cuddle up and read it under the blankets with a flashlight and you are sure to enjoy the adventures of Tristran over the Wall!
6305428042|5.0|There are so many outstandingly hilarious moments in this film, it's hard to pick a favorite. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy are so perfect together, that every time I watch this film I imagine the blast they must have had making it.<br /><br />Great script, great laughs, great cast -- what more do you need?
B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites!  Although I do not like the bluecollar comedy tour, Mater is a hilarious character!!  The movie itself is fast-paced enough for kids, but the story is grown up enough for adults. And the animation is awesome!  I especially like the link to the demise of Route 66 within this wonderful, funny, cute little movie!
B00005O5CM|5.0|Legally Blonde is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's not groundbreaking, it has no pretensions of greatness -- but it's absolutely tops for wonderful laughs and a cute chick-lit kind of story.<br /><br />Legally Blonde is more endearing every time I watch it.
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|I bought this for watching on new years day after seeing it in several critic's top 10s for 2007.  it was very different, definite independent movie-feel and had a lazy romantic story to it.  i liked it alot and think i will like it more after watching it again.  very unconventional, a great story.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|There has never been an album release more intensely anticipated, by this Radiohead fan alongside a multitude of others, than \\"In Rainbows.\\" Quickly heading a wide variety of 2007 \\"Best Of\\" lists, it is fair to say that this release has certainly garnered its share of attention. The vast amount of recognition that \\"In Rainbows\\" has received is due partially to the unusual nature of its release (which is more than thoroughly explained in previous reviews, therefore in no need of further dissection), but does the musical content warrant this album's wide awareness? As with any Radiohead album, the public opinion seems split in half. Critics have been hasty to choose a side and hold firm, which I believe has been a mistake. \\"In Rainbows\\" is an album that may take time to appreciate.<br /><br />The foremost new element in \\"In Rainbows\\" is a more instantly accessible feel. The songs are catchy, tranquilizing, and not quite as dark as on former Radiohead releases. This, of course, has given critics who somehow believe approachability and simplicity to always be coexisting elements in music, an instant excuse to label \\"In Rainbows\\" as a \\"dumbed-down\\" version of Radiohead. Further listens, however, will unavoidably prove that \\"In Rainbows\\" is far from a cold slice of manufactured radio-pop. Radiohead still operates beyond the bounds of normal musical standards, coupling emotion with intellect. The imaginative, brooding darkness that  haunted previous Raiohead releases is now gorgeously melded with lighter, warmer sections, providing a striking contrast that tends to better hold the listeners attention and captivate the imagination. String arrangements are provided by the Millennia Ensemble, spawning a delightful, shimmering glow throughout \\"In Rainbows.\\"<br /><br />There is, however, a more mysterious element beneath the calming, swelling waters of this album that is harder to pinpoint. Something lurks beneath the radiant surface that may become apparent after multiple listens. I realized this the day I bought the official \\"In Rainbows\\" CD. As I lay on the couch reading along to Yorke's  exceptionally poignant performance, \\"In Rainbows\\" immediately drew me in like it had not previously done within the months of listening to the downloaded version. Even the song \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" which I had formerly felt was too \\"rocky\\" in contrast with the rest of the album, took on a startling new emotional characteristic. The experience was nothing short of an epiphany that altered the way I hear this album altogether.<br /><br />I had discovered a sense of intimacy between myself and the music that other Radiohead albums had not quite provided. Previous Radiohead albums, despite all their wonderful charms and virtues, had remained somewhat alienated from the listener. There would always be a song, a section, or shift that seemed somewhat obscure. Though this adds a wonderful experimental feel to earlier Radiohead albums, it unavoidably separated the listener from the music. Through over ten years of musical experience, Radiohead have finally been able balance perfectly elements of free expression and accessible splendor. \\"In Rainbows\\" openly blossoms for all to appreciate while still remaining vastly creative and unique. There is still spontaneity sparsely scattered throughout \\"In Rainbows,\\" yet it does not conflict in overall density, tone color, nor rhythm, but rather, radiantly compliments what surrounds it.<br /><br />\\"In Rainbows\\" not only casts a long shadow over its peer 2007 releases and all former Radiohead releases, but over the band's future as well. I believe that Radiohead has finally reached the creative apex that everyone thought had already passed with either \\"Ok Computer\\" or \\"Kid A.\\" Though mine and the reader's experience with this album may be completely in conflict, I urge the disappointed fans to listen again. Listen carefully, and maybe the true beauty \\"In Rainbows\\" will become apparent. It may take time, but it will surely betime repaid in musical bliss.
B000FS9FCQ|1.0|Somehow, Christians = Nazis AND terrorists; sadomasochist gay men and lesbian starlets = Shoah Jews; the gay guy \\"loves the beautiful poetry of the Quran\\" (ever read it? homosexuals get killed in it; Hadith says so, too); Anglican bishops = child molesters; Muslims = PERFECT PEOPLE. C'mon, folks: Guy Fawkes was an orthodox (NOT HETERODOX) CATHOLIC; the \\"Remember, remember the 5th of November\\" was an ANTI-Fawkes, anti-Catholic, pro-Parliament, pro-government nursery rhyme (read the rest of it); the government insignia is a blatant bash of the Papal Cross made into a fascist symbol (if you did this w/ any other symbol of any other faith or denomination, you'd get crucified: no pun intended). Having any reference to the Shoah -- especially the mass grave scene -- in a film w/ a Matrix-style subtransit knifefight is the poorest of poor taste. I could go on forever.  The whole ideological backdrop of this film is just illogical and self-contradictory.<br /><br />\\"Artists use lies to tell the truth?\\" In this case, lies are just lies and the truth is obfuscated by agendas and general bullcrap (and it's not even artistic). Ideas are NOT bulletproof: V is shot to hell.
0375842209|5.0|I am always searching for a book that gives you that magical feeling that you never want to end. This is one of those books.  It immediately goes to the top of the list of books that I recommend to friends and family.  The lyrical qualities of the writing are just beautiful, the story..heartbreaking, and the characters...unforgettable. Please read this book. You'll think about it for weeks after finishing it.
B000GGSMF8|5.0|I'm a big 80s music fan.  And Nouvelle Vague does exactly what any cover band should do, IMHO - a unique interpretation of the original, rather than a cloned copy.    Some songs take a moment to recognize.  Others, like Billy Idol's \\"Dancing with Myself\\" make you go \\"I know that song and this is sooooo cool!\\".    Lounge music has never been done better.
0525950079|4.0|As a recent Follett fan, I'm still reeling from both \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World\\" and can't wait for the next installment (???). I have to say that at first I didn't think it was possible \\"World\\" could be as good as \\"Pillars\\", but I'm happy to say that although there were a lot of similarities between the two books, \\"World\\" was a pretty darn good read. Like \\"Pillars\\", there were similiar characters: Merthin/Jack, Carius/Aliena, Godwyn/Waleran Bigod, and Ralph/William of Hamleigh. This was very comforting and helped to make the two books flow together.
B0011NVCO8|5.0|Hard work.  Creativity.  Guts.  Cutting out the middleman.  Honesty in operation.  Maintaining brand image.  This is what makes American business great.  Why should the smack trade be any different?  One enterprising American decides to take the best of the American business model, and do for heroin what Best Buy did for electronics.  We follow the arc of Frank Lucas' (Denzel Washington) dazzling career from small-time hood to capo de tutti capi (di colore), and of his nemesis Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), who eventually brings him down.  Yes, this is a \\"the rise and fall of\\" film like Carlito's Way, but it's probably the best of the recent offerings in the genre.  Would it be too much to compare it to \\"Little Caesar\\"?  I don't think so.<br /><br />All in all, a great guy movie.  Good violence, good action.  There is some female nudity, which is always appreciated by my prurient and adolescent mind.  Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot of it, and it wasn't exploitative or overtly sexual.  But you take what you can get.<br /><br />The standout scene for me is the confrontation between Lucas and Roberts in the time-honored \\"let's make a deal\\" scene.  It's really a pleasure to watch two outstanding actors at the top of their game working with great dialogue and direction.
B000K15VSA|5.0|GREAT ITEM. As expected a great product. It includes a beautiful unicorn and picture. A classic like Blade Runner long deserved a special edition like this one.
0446364495|5.0|A true page-turner!  Sad too... how things work out.  But I suppose such is life.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Elizabeth is back and she is... well... 55... You wouldn't tell from the movie, would you? Bearing in mind that average life expectancy was below 30 in her times, she was positively ancient...<br />Well, you shouldn't be able to tell her age and generally too much knowledge of history will spoil the fun. When the movie started I decided to follow Coleridge's advice to \\"suspend my disbelief\\" and enjoyed it OK.<br />You don't get a lesson in history here (a very general but shouldn't you have known before about the Armada?) you get a picturesque vision of history and as such it works. Some twists made me smile. I found it quite amusing that all Roman Catholics look ugly and their behaviour is rather irrational. A comment to the ending - Elisabeth left England in debts (although not bankrupt as Philip did) and the quoted \\"age of prosperity\\" led directly to the Civil War half a century later.<br />Show it to your children - if it makes them interested in history, it's for the best. If they can remember only the date 1588 after the movie it's a sufficient reason to spend an evening together.
1400063515|5.0|This book presents some interesting ideas, and is written at an above average reading level.  I found it thought provoking and plan to do some more research about how to apply the ideas presented in the book.
B0011NVC98|1.0|Rather distant from the original (if you don't have the time to browse in the three thousand lines of the epic I will just say that there is no sex there - natural or unnatural alike - and most characters are not related including the fantastic ones) and offering sadly little in exchange, this film is a complete waste of time of everybody involved and prospective audience.<br />The first impression is that you are watching an early attempt at Shrek (just take a closer look at secondary characters!) which went completely wrong and was shelved for some years. The second impression is that with so many good and some acceptable actors you don't have to photo-shop them into caricatures. The third impression is that scenes of fight during which the cameraman concentrates quite exclusively on not showing the main hero's private parts can't be any good. The forth impression is that you shouldn't make movies of books you have never read and about countries you have never visited. The fifth impression is that the movie was actually made for 3D cinemas so watching it at home doesn't make much sense (the blurred faces are ridiculous) and you have just wasted good money. That is if you managed to keep on watching it long enough to have any fifth impressions.<br />Don't. Don't waste your money and don't buy it.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|Basically another version of Event Horizon that doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />How to put out a fire aboard ship? Let's see ... use up precious oxygen, or vent out the room to the vacuum of space ... hmmm ... what to do? what to do? ... and many more puzzling and silly decisions by rocket scientists. Or astronauts, anyway. Let's not even consider the material that shields ship and bomb from the sun, or why it's so stingily deployed, or why the computer isn't programmed to adjust it automatically. Or why one of the characters has to stay aboard a ship to die. Or why there's no crew redundancy. Or computer redundancy. Or ... I could go on. If these don't bother you, well, there's not much else in space sci-fi right now, so ... well, it includes the obligatory religious nut, so ... no, wait, that's not a reason to watch it, just how stereotyped the characters are. Believe me, I'm used to having my beliefs trashed at the movies, so it's not a big deal. (\\"Tolerance\\" and \\"sensitivity\\" has its limits, I suppose.) But it's not as interesting as the premise of Event Horizon.<br /><br />At first it seems there's some promise of creepiness, but it doesn't go anywhere really mind-bending.
B000K15VSA|4.0|packaging is a little smaller than expected but great display piece. Quality of movies are great , they look as if they were filmed recently and having 5.1 sound for this movie makes a big difference.this is a must buy for die hard fans of the movie but for everyone else buy the 4 disc set.
B000M06SU4|5.0|I just received this album as a birthday gift. It is by far my favorite record right now. If you are a Beatles fan, and are ready for some new takes on old songs, this album is for you! George Martin has done it again.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for me several years ago because I love these movies! I don't remember any \\"flaws\\" in the discs because its been a long time since I watched them. A little bit of Aliens goes a long, long way and I watched them all in a row. If you're an Aliens fan or even a Geiger fan (the conceptual designer for the aliens), I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. The price is better than what it was when I got mine!
B000HZCZZ6|5.0|This movie is, in a manner similar to IV, the perfect Star Trek movie - all that is so good about it.  We see Data further explore humanity, and the good guys come to the rescue.  There is humor, pathos, integrity.  I cannot say enough about it.  The only thing missing is the future.  This story could be told in any time.

B000MGUZM0|2.0|Having read at least ten different glowing reviews for this album, I expected to find a stunning tour-de-force that would change the way I would listen to rock music. What a blunder. Disappointed as I was with another well-reviewed CD from 2007 (\\"The Reminder\\" by Feist), I thought all the five star reviews on Amazon were a colossal joke. What a pity to have my misgivings confirmed. As a fan of good music (whether its pop or rock), this album came as a total disappointment. Its not bad, but its just not very inspired or likeable.<br /><br />To all the listeners and fans of this band that tout its lyrics as being other-worldly, I can only conclude that they weren't very well-read to begin with. The songwriting here reeks of pretentiousness. Even some of the lyrics by Lifehouse or My Chemical Romance are deeper than some of the gems here. Problems begin right from Track One, and the David Lynchian desperation of the band to be hailed as the next epic thing really got on my nerves. Here is a sample from \\"Black Mirror\\":<br /><br />\\"Mirror, mirror on the wall<br />Show me where them bombs will fall<br />Mirror, mirror on the wall<br />Show me where them bombs will fall<br /><br />Black Mirror!<br />Black Mirror!\\"<br /><br />On \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\\", the music is a lot better, but then the band goes and spoils it with what I can only call a sad attempt at French poetry. This has plagued many a rock band in the past, when they wanted to branch out with their more esoteric sensibilities, but here it didn't do anything to elevate the band in my eyes:<br /><br />\\"Left my name with the border guards<br />A name that I don't need<br />Ce sera un long voyage<br />Sur les vagues de l'oubli\\"<br /><br />Also, even though one might be tempted to call this a `concept album', the concept at best is vague and ambiguous. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but each song has undertones of allusions to a failed relationship. In certain songs, the reference is rather obvious, but an entire sense of `this is not very good music' permeates the entire recording. Seriously. Think of a typical indie-rock record with some swooning instrumentation added on for good effect, and add an extra layer of Coldplay-lite sound effects, and you have the sound of Arcade Fire. Still, since the majority of reviews concentrated on the lyrics, I kept listening and reading as I went along, and boy was I disappointed. On \\"Ocean of Noise\\", a pretty song, the sub-par lyrics seem like it had been torn out of Courtney Love's diary when she attended Catholic School (I don't mean this in a good way):<br /><br />\\"In an ocean of noise<br />I first heard your voice<br />Ringing like a bell<br />As if I had a choice, oh well!\\"<br /><br />On \\"Antichrist Television Blues\\", a song that I can only call a misguided attempt at a `message', the lyrics are quite innovative and alluring upon first glance. But listen to it with the music, and its obvious they went for a `Bohemian Rhapsody'-ish rush for immediate classic appeal here, and the lyrics go from interesting to sappy in a matter of seconds. I did not like the direction this song was going in, nor did I like the overall sentiment of the track. The character who sings it seems to be bipolar, depressed, and in general not a very positive or interesting person in the slightest:<br /><br />\\"Do you know where I was at your age?<br />Any idea where I was at your age?<br />I was working downtown for the minimum wage<br />And I'm not gonna let you just throw it all away!<br />I'm through being cute, I'm through being nice<br />O tell me, Lord, am I the Antichrist?!\\"<br /><br />But towards the end of the album, things pick up musically. Between this and the new Eagles album, I would most certainly choose this, but certainly not because I am `overwhelmed by its' beauty' as one reviewer incorrectly said. Granted, this sort of wishy-washy indie music is easily hailed as `the greatest album ever', but in this case it is definitely not so. The songwriting is amateurish, and in their attempt to connect to all audiences, some songs do not have either a concept or an idea behind it. Such as \\"No Cars Go\\":<br /><br />\\"We know a place where no planes go<br />We know a place where no ships go<br />Hey!<br />No cars go<br />Hey!<br />No cars go<br />Where we know<br />Old folks?<br />Let's go!<br /><br />Don't know where we're going\\"<br /><br />Throughout the album I was reminded of a true rock-poet - Jeff Buckley. The only reason I remembered him is that when his man put his pen to paper, the words struck with both their grammatical purity as well as their inherent ability to lend beautifully to a rock tune in any meter. On \\"Neon Bible\\", the majority of songs seem like a teenage boys' private fantasy and thought-world, which is why I am surprised at the glowing reviews from critics who should obviously see through such sort of vapidity. Again, I must point out, the music is not BAD. Its just `not very good'. The `schoolboy' syndrome, as I call it, is in full swing on \\"My Body is a Cage\\":<br /><br />\\"My body is a cage that keeps me<br />From dancing with the one I love<br />But my mind holds the key<br /><br />I'm living in an age<br />That screams my name at night<br />But when I get to the doorway<br />There's no one in sight\\"<br /><br />Finally, I must add that I am aware this review would probably rub a lot of Arcade Fire fans the wrong way. Seeing this at the No. 1 spot on many critics' lists for the 2007 season was what first got me interested in this album, but despite listening to it over four times, I can honestly say there isn't one `standout' track that merits a repeat listening. I'm one for lyrics and their meaning (unless I'm listening to cheesy pop music where lyrics shouldn't matter anyway). The only indie artist I can think of who is remotely qualified to be called a true genius, is Andrew Bird and his recent \\"Armchair Apocrypha\\". Before you dismiss this review, I would suggest you buy that album, listen to it with the lyrics in front of you, and then come back to \\"Neon Bible\\". Maybe then you'll understand why exactly I'm calling this a mediocre, overrated album.<br /><br />Two Generous Stars..

B000MR9D5E|5.0|this is far and away the best television series ever made.  breath-taking images, captivating narration, and truly informative - I can't imagine a soul on earth who wouldn't enjoy this to the fullest.
B000002KN8|5.0|I love this cd. It is one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums. If you are a Depeche Mode fan, you must own Speak and Spell for your collection. You will not regret it.
B000VT6FAO|5.0|I have noticed some (I use the word some liberally) real criticism towards Dave Gahan's solo work. On Paper Monsters he got nailed for not sounding like Depeche Mode with a rock/blues/pseudo DM sound. Now on Hourglass he again is being abased (to some degree) because the album has an electronic sound that is too close to that of Depeche Mode. I suppose Dave Gahan is in a real quagmire regardless where he goes with his solo efforts.<br /><br />There have also been some claims that Dave Gahan's solo material is very sullen and perhaps macabre. With respect to Hourglass, not Paper Monsters, I might have an answer on why his solo material might be so ominous, dark and melancholy. Since there was so much turmoil in his life with substance abuse, several marriages and suicide attempts. Dave Gahan was technically dead for like 3 minutes from one of these suicide attempts.<br /><br />After all these elements/issues, Dave Gahan returned and recorded three more Depeche Mode albums, two best of compilations with DM, released two solo albums and went on tour four times, once as a solo act, thus far. The interviews that I have read with Dave Gahan on T.V., DM/DG releases, magazine articles or creditable websites show that David Gahan is quite happy and stable in his life.<br /><br />It appears (from what I have read since I haven't spoken with the man himself) he is pleased with the Hourglass album. On his website there are clips of him working on this album, he is having a great time. Dancing, laughing and seems really positive about himself and his sophomore album. Also in an interview given on \\"The Touring the Angel\\" DVD, Mr. Gahan really seems at ease where Depeche Mode is, was and will be going.<br /><br />It should also be taken into consideration that Dave Gahan is getting older and that can cause some issues. That was another jumping point for him making this album. Also just because all his turmoil with regards to substance abuse happened about 10-12 years ago doesn't mean that it still doesn't bother him. Sobriety is a life long process, so it is very believable and plausible that many of his \\"old demons\\" still vex him. Therefore, if he makes a moody or gloomy record with regards to lyrics and melodies that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Why, because it is better to express those dark feelings by making an album, than going out and using drugs, getting arrested and killing yourself/others. The entire Hourglass record seems like it was a very cathartic experience for him.<br /><br />I have also seen some criticism towards the lyric in the song \\"Miracles\\", claiming the lyric is blasphemous and Dave Gahan has forgotten Jesus. For the record, the lyric is \\"I don't believe in Jesus but I am praying anyway\\". Perhaps the purpose of this lyric is dualism in itself. The duplicity in this statement screams the uncertainness towards nebulosity in life and higher power, not heresy. It is better to be honest and question things like religion than just automatically conforming and not questioning Christianity. After all Jesus will forgive you no matter what, right? Ask for forgiveness and one will receive it. So if that is the understanding, I don't think Jesus hates David Gahan. It isn't like Dave Gahan walks around with an upside down cross painted on his forehead. I think the real problem with Christianity isn't the religion or Jesus, but some of the people who practice it. They do more speaking for Jesus, than listening to him.<br /><br />As for the Hourglass album, it is much more electronic when compared to Paper Monsters, which isn't a bad thing. Hourglass seems to have a bit more depth in it than Paper Monsters. When I say depth, not to be confused with lack of quality, depth in the terms that most of the songs are Hourglass are a bit more epic than on Paper Monsters. For instance Dirty Sticky Floors, featured on Paper Monsters, is rather jovial in sound despite the fact the song is about Dave Gahan's drug addiction. Now the songs on Hourglass have deep lyrics, but here the music style is much more dramatic and grandiose then its predecessor.<br /><br />As for the songs they range from ballads \\"Saw Something\\" (electronic sounding), \\"Miracles\\" (also electronic sounding); dance/industrial \\"Kingdom\\" (electronic sounding), \\"Deeper & Deeper\\" (electronic sounding); there are at least two songs on Hourglass that have a Paper Monsters feel to them, \\"21 Days\\" and \\"Down\\". These descriptions are just a sample of what this album has to offer. Overall, this album has a good mix of slow and fast. A great album to be played in the evening or as another reviewer noted, during the autumn season.<br /><br />My reaction to Hourglass is a positive one. The music is timeless and astonishing. I also feel comfortable to say that if Depeche Mode does call it quits (which I hope doesn't happen any time soon) Dave Gahan has definitely proved that he is able to stand on his own two feet.sic style is much more dramatic and grandiose then its predecessor.

But Bruce Willis is looking like a tired old cop, getting successively beat up escaping near death in the non-stop plots to kill him.

B000YPUF9W|2.0|When they set such a high standard in Part 2, you would expect the producers to come up with something better for Part 3. But no, instead we get a brown-sand and brown-tone saturated film with absolutely no direction, except to let us glimpse one final shot at the end that tells us that there WILL be a Part Four.<br /><br />As an avid watcher of the first two parts, it seemed to me that things were finally coming together for the whole franchise. Milla Jovovich, normally a great actress, seemed to be having trouble getting into the skin of her character but there were moments in Part Two where she seemed more at ease being the superhero she was supposed to. However in Part Three, the 'Old West' spin on things reduces the film to a caricature of itself, and there were points where I could not believe they would commit such hilarious segments to screen. There is one exceptionally poorly choreographed scene here that is an absolute rip off of the '50s cowboy flicks, with Milla playing 'gangsta'. Even on paper, this looks ludicrous, but when you watch her fighting and mouthing these inane one-liners, you can't help but wonder where it all went wrong.<br /><br />Prime problem is the casting. Ali Larter (the psychotic blonde from \\"Heroes\\") has no business being in this film. Her role could have been played from anyone as clueless as Lindsay Lohan to Paris Hilton. That's how vaccuous the character is. And then there is Ashanti. Does anyone even remember Ashanti anymore? How on earth did she land a movie role? Thankfully, she is killed halfway through the film, in one of the more intentionally gory sequences, and yes, the movie did get a little better after this.<br /><br />Oh yes, and then you have the 'hero' who 'gives up his life' to 'save the world'. Are we not tired yet of this theme? In this particular scenario, he turns out to be a romantic interest for Milla Jovovich, but yes, parting is such sweet sorrow, so he says goodbye to everyone (a humungously long sequence that reminded me of some sordid Bollywood saga) and drives his vehicle into the zombie lair to explode the entire arena. That is not a spoiler, really, just a statement of how dumb this movie gets as it goes along.<br /><br />Sadly, the Milla connection does not work here. And what was up with her face? EVERY SCENE that Milla's face is in is digitally 'touched-up' so that it looks like she stepped out of a L'Oreal Commercial. We are supposed to believe the woman looks this gorgeous all the time, when in fact the character is a filthy desert renegade, with biological problems to add to it. There were closeups of her that even had glitter and you could see how they tried hard to cake her face up with foundation. Everyone else looked really rough though. What was going on?<br /><br />Part Three of the Resident Evil Franchise is easily the WORST part of the series so far. I think Part Four should be better, because honestly they could not have sunk lower. The best part of this film was the opening when Milla is trapped in the facility and tries to break free. The revelation of the clones were interesting, but it all feels like I've seen this before on some vapid TV Show. Currently, I would rate the video game and its' bare-boned storyline higher than what they tried to do here.<br /><br />Very Disappointing.

B000YIGNKE|1.0|I had been looking forward to Masterpiece Theatre's \\"The Complete Jane Austen\\" for several months, and was especially excited they chose to begin with \\"Persuasion\\", which is my favorite Austen novel.  I could not have been more disappointed.  Seriously, the only good thing to say about the film is I only wasted 90 minutes of my life.  The script was atrocious - they cut much of the story out, and the bits they did keep, although the correct conversation(s), were between the wrong people.  There was no chemistry at all between Anne and Wentworth, the characters did not feel developed at all, in short, it was ghastly.  On the other hand, the 1995 BBC version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is its polar opposite - never a false step, superb casting, tightly woven script, magical chemistry between Anne and Wentworth.  If you're looking for a film of \\"Persuasion\\", the 1995 one is the only one worth viewing.
B0007KTAU4|5.0|Whether or not Carla Bruni remains of political interest, chances are you have probably heard her name before. This, her debut album, recorded when she was in her mid-30s, is the French Equivalent of Norah Jones \\"Come Away With Me\\". In fact, that Norah Jones connection will haunt you through this recording, as both in song choice and delivery, Bruni is one of those rare animals that get better with repeated listening.<br /><br />The title song, \\"Quelqu'un m'a dit\\" is easily the best thing here. No opening strums, no grand instrumentation - just a womans' husky voice and a guitar set the mood perfectly. This is the ultimate 'wine' album. Listening to the new Vanessa Paradis record, I was reminded that very few French language singers (perhaps for the exception of Charlotte Gainsbourg, and to an extent, Keren Ann) choose to use one genre of music on their albums and conform to it. Bruni is definitely one for this, as her albums' songs all have a 'sameness' to them. This does not mean that they all sound the same - rather, the tempo and musical genre is the same throughout - and this is a good thing.<br /><br />My personal favorite is the underrated \\"Le Toi Du Moi\\", a beautiful song whose word play reminded me very strongly of Jeanne Moreau's \\"La Tourbillon de la Vie\\". This track is maddeningly addictive and achingly beautiful, and if you do decide to get this album, I can guarantee that you will be playing this song for years to come.<br /><br />The tempo only really changes towards the end of the album on one track - \\"L'Excessive\\", where they go for a more jazzy, bluesy feel combined with a beat that is definitely more sprightly than anything else here. The inspired closer \\"The Last Minute\\" is exactly a minute long - and works great in this context.<br /><br />Perhaps knowing more about Carla Bruni might affect your purchase decision. Like Milla Jovovich, this is a former supermodel (Guess, Oscar De La Renta, Christian Dior) who was amongst the Top 10 highest paid supermodels in the world, in the 1990s. She has two albums out at the time of writing. This one, and her 2007 release entitled \\"No Promises\\" (an interesting but ultimately flawed collection of old-English poems set to blues-jazz). I would suggest getting this one first and discovering a new and exciting world artist.<br /><br />Many viewers on this page reach here due to their recent discovering of Miss Bruni through her involvement with French President Nic Sarkozy. Its great that this album is at least getting some attention all the years after its' release, because its a fantastic slice of French chanson, and a stellar five star album in every sense of the term. This, along with \\"Divinidylle\\" by Vanessa Paradis, should be your essential French language music purchases for this year.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.1990s.

B000YMBBH0|5.0|The Bourne series is better than ever in HD.  On large HDTVs the difference between its SDTV counterpart is extremely noticeable.  You can even look for yourself because the third movie is HDDVD with normal DVD on the other side.  That's really my only problem with the movies, I hate having those dual sided discs.  Mostly because I am paying more for two formats, one of which I don't want.  Additionally then they can skip the effort of making any art on the disc.  Although, this it the first time I have gotten a dual sided disc that actually made it perfectly clear which side was which on the labeling.  So if you're a fan of any of the Bourne movies, have a good HDTV, and HDDVD player this is a must have trilogy.

B000003FD9|5.0|As a cellist (at least during childhood) and son of a cellist, I heard a lot of wonderful music from the masters in my home, including early Janos Starker. But these renditions of Bach's profound compositions for solo cello are unsurpassed, not only for their virtuosity (and after all, Casals, Ma, etc., are wonderful artists) but for their emotional subtlety and depth. I play these CDs almost weekly and never tire of this music.
B00000I2VF|5.0|Ten years later, its good to see that this album is finally garnering the critical acclaim and the cult status that was due to it ten years ago. While the masses will forever remember \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", this album remains the definitive Alanis album, for various reasons.<br /><br />First, its her longest album. On subsequent releases, such as \\"Under Rug Swept\\", we were left wondering why she had halved the length of her albums entirely. This one, on the other hand has so many good tracks and is a 'long player' in the best sense of that term. Lead Single \\"Thank U\\" is best remembered for the controversial video (at the time), but in fact it is a welcome shift of pace for Alanis, as her music became more alternative and melodious, as compared to \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" which was a more straightforward pop-rock album.<br /><br />However, the standouts here are simply stellar. My personal favorite has to be \\"So Pure\\" - an Alanis track that deserves to be called one of her Top 3 tunes, by far. This album also remains the only one in her catalog where every song is catchy - the verses are memorable, the choruses even more so. There is a wonderful balance between the ballads and the more rock-oriented songs, and the lyricism was at its' peak here, as Alanis put aside the schoolgirl sentiments of JLP and plunged head-on into the messy emotional turmoil that pervades ones' space once a relationship ends. No holds barred, but this also leads to some very, very interesting songs - such as \\"The Couch\\", and the cult favorite \\"Unsent\\" - a song on which Alanis literally reads out love letters to various boys, in order of their importance in her life. Unique.<br /><br />The second-best track here, after \\"So Pure\\" is the infectious \\"UR\\". This is a song that deserves to be heard more, and now it has been relegated to Alanis' list of tracks that no one knows about. Seek this album out just for this track and you'll be thanking me for years to come. Similar in structure to \\"UR\\" is the grungier pop-rock track \\"Would Not Come\\". The message here is ambiguous, but this is my third favorite track on this record. I first bought this album back in the day when I didn't have a CD Player, so it had to be on cassette. These days, of course, I have it on my Ipod, and one is ever so grateful for that.<br /><br />If you aren't a fan of Alanis' more 'hard' sound, then this album also contains various tracks that could be classified as 'ballads', if we must. The best of this is \\"Heart of the House\\" and its tuneful refrain of \\"All Hail the Goddess\\". \\"That I would be Good\\" is another slower track, and its great that the slow tracks come after three or four more hard-hitting songs, as the tempo is eased at the right moment. The song transitions here are really very well thought-out.<br /><br />Alanis herself would never make an album this inspired. To call this 'epic' is an understatement. It remains the artists' most clear representation of her own state of mind, and her lyrics here were honest, forthright, and not at all muddled or confused.

Get this with high expectations, and you'll reap rich rewards.<br /><br />A Five Star Masterpiece. An Essential Recording.Would Not Come\\". The message here is ambiguous, but this is my third favorite track on this record. I first bought this album back in the day when I didn't have a CD Player, so it had to be on cassette. These days, of course, I have it on my Ipod, and one is ever so grateful for that.    If you aren't a fan of Alanis' more 'hard' sound, then this album also contains various tracks that could be classified as 'ballads', if we must.

0060763892|5.0|I \\"discovered\\" Rollins after reading his fourth book and was happy to see he had a body of work already!  I love when this happens, I quickly got my hands on the other books and read them.  I love that we got to \\"be with\\" the same people we had come to know and love in previous books, The Sigma Force, they always give us a fast-paced jaunt around the world seeking out the answers to problems to save the world.  Generally I can't put them down once I start and the best thing about the books is that they have sparked an interest in my daughter to read.  She has always been a reluctant reader and read this in 2 days.  Rollins writes in a way that puts you right into the action, you can almost smell, hear and feel it all.  I hope he never stops writing. Read any of his books, you will not be disappointed.
B000Y1ZXU2|2.0|I must have gotten the wrong idea about what I was buying after reading the product review. I wasn't expecting a single CGI music video to Vicarious, and then a video tour of some art museum in New York. I would not have paid ten dollars for this had I previously known this.
B0009HAHD4|5.0|Not much needs to be said about the eyecap - it serves its purpose and is identical to the original one (which I lost).
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|After a disappointing film that people call the worst movie of all time, the Batman franchise sat dormant for awhile. Then it was to be remade with a fresh new apporach done by Christopher Nolan. The selling point for the movie before I even saw it was Christian Bale. Bale is my favorite actor of all time and he could act to a paperbag and it would be good. This movie is what Batman should be. A Dark, complex story. No little in jokes or bad dialogue, it was stricly teens to adult.  I like the Scarecrow villian in this movie. You'd think for a big comeback they'd use a familiar name for a villian but Cillian Murphy does an amazing job as Scarecrow. The speical effects in this movie are good, the story is top notch, and the acting really sells the picture. The best superhero movie of all time. I loved the tease ending and cant wait for the second movie.    I didnt have a problem with the second dvd. It looks cool but I do admit it's annoying to navigate thru the comic.
B0011QC9U6|5.0|I know this isn't released yet, but I enjoyed the movie and this type of movie always looks great on hd dvd. Great movies like this on both formats is why dual format players will be the norm in order to have mass market acceptance.    I love what they can do with CGI and it will only get better in the future. No more will we have to deal with technical limitations that confuse the artists attempts to tell a story.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Thanks for the quick delivery.  We received it on the 24th...just in time for Christmas.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  It is simply a bomb and a job well done because it is funny and exciting from start to finish.  There are no questioning regarding the story.  For the acting, they are good and the rats are stealing the whole show of it.  For the direction, it is simply funny.  For my favorite part, it will be the visuals and the music.  They are simply fun fun fun all the way.  Overall, a funny movie all the way.
0439882826|5.0|Thanks for the quick delivery...we received it on the 24th.  Great condition...like brand new.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Amazingly, you don't have to be gay to appreciate the movie. None of the actors, nor the diector are gay. As An Lee revealed in a interview, he just wanted to protray love in its purest form, without intention, calculation, procreation, or recreation. Don't we all wish, deep in our heart, that we can at least find a true love, even just for a brief movement? The movie makes us think what are important in our short lives. That is why this movie is a success, no matter what the box office indicates. highly recommende!
0440238609|4.0|I just like this series.  The books are far more interesting than the movie.
B000002JEV|3.0|It is a good example of the first few years of Led Zeppeling-however, there is a lot of duplication of songs (three versions of \\"Communication Breakdown\\" for example)and the first CD plods a bit.  That being said, the second CD is an excellent BBC concert from 1971 and, if you enjoy Led Zeppelin, that is why you should purchase this CD>
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am a Jane Austen Fan, but I am also a Colin Firth fan and a Keira Knightly fan.  I have yet to see Colin Firth's version of Pride and Prejudice, and am sure I will love it.  However, there is something about this movie that captures my full attention each time I put it on.  Every movement, facial expression, the complete immersion into the countryside and the period are rapturous for me.  Donald Southerland as I have never seen him before makes a wonderful father.  All of the girls are so much in love with each other and their family, yet each of them looks to the future with such hope in their own respective ways; although Lizzie's straightforwardness and honesty putting the appropriate people in their proper places at the proper times makes one wonder if she will end up the way her mother blatantly claims her best friend will, \\"a spinster in the making\\".  Each character seemed born to play their respective parts! It's just a coaster ride of emotions and engnnrossing film work, costumes (the ribbons) and dialogue that sweeps me up and I hate to see the ending draw nigh each time I watch.  I hope you get the enjoyment from it that I did, and cherish it for years to come.
B00008OWZC|4.0|The greatest band of the 70's at their peak.  If you enjoy Led Zeppelin, this must be part of yor CD collection.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Since we're talking about my favorite band of ALL time, I'm going to be a little bias. The content is excellent! The sound quality is EXCELLENT! Steve Augeri is a great singer (though Mr. Perry is THE BEST male vocalist of ALL TIME!). I highly recommend this concert DVD to Journey fans.
B00104W8T6|5.0|I went and saw the movie last week, and a couple days later I got the soundtrack.  having had some more opportunities to listento the music, I love it even more now than I did while I was watching the movie.  It's the quirkiest, most random lineup ever, and I love it.  The opening track, \\"All I want is You,\\" and \\"Anyone Else But You\\" are my favorites.  And now I'm looking up Kimya Dawson and some of the other artists to buy their CDs in addition to this one.
0061122416|5.0|I am in love with this author!  (Well his writing anyway!)  This was one of the best books I have ever read.  I was in Egypt at the time (funny since the book has some events set in Egypt) and I absolutely loved it.  I kept going back to the English bookseller and getting more of his books.  Most of them were just as good as the first, all were worth reading.  I left my books in Egypt assuming that I could get them here, but only a couple are available here.  (The ones I bought were imported from the UK)  Any of his books are a definate MUST READ!
B00003CXRM|1.0|I am a Coen bros fan who own all their available DVDs, I love Bluegrass and country musics and even played it for 10 years.  Thus when I heard of this movie at the time I couldn't have been more excited: among my favorite directors and music, that's going to be great! WRONG! Dead wrong!<br /><br />This movie is everything the Coen movies are not.<br /><br />Instead of the brothers' usual dark and witty corkiness, we are treated with jokes so juvenile it rivals such classic as \\"Dumb and Dumber\\".<br /><br />Instead of their habitual pinpoint accurate and fascinating depiction of a particular area, culture, social class, or population segment, we are immersed in some of the worst clich&eacute;s about the South I have ever seen in recent times(Southerners are dirty, racist, retarded, and \\"cultishly\\" religious. Are we still really at that level of stupid bias).<br /><br />Instead of a solid yet with unexpeted twist and turns scenario, we get a storyline that meanders around nothing and goes literally nowhere (and spare me the parallels with The Odyssey, which merely consist in having a guy with an eye-patch and some deadly girls charming the protagonists).<br /><br />And what the heck were these guys thinking when they cast Clooney, with one of the worst bogus Southern accent that Hollywood ever had the balls to insult us with!?!<br /><br />The two positives about this movie to me was the stunning cinematography and art direction, and the gut wrenching music.<br /><br />The movie recently came up on late TV and I figured I gave it another chance... I am sorry to say that this remain my biggest cinematographic disappointment.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Have been waiting for this for way too long. Its very much been worth the wait. To have all versions of this film to study is most excellent.     Entire package is well worth the cost.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Fisher Price did a great job with the Rainforest line.  The mobile is just one of many products that my husband and I bought for our second daughter.  She loves it and I would recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it.
141694740X|5.0|Okay this is a great book!  I couldn't put it down.  Greg knows men!  His advice is true and I believe is about 99% accurate.  He has a great sense of humor and really tells it like it is.  I would recommend for any woman that is having men/dating issues.  It's a real eye-opener!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I thought the first performance was Outstanding. Still do. However, David Downes and the Celtic Woman Group have truly out-done themselves...WOW. Keep it coming folks. How about a Saint Patrick Day performance...Bob Diaz
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|Entertaining action movie if you are into this type of action movies.  I liked it and have watched it 3 times.  If you like Mark Wahlberg, you will love the movie.  OK storlyine.
0066620996|5.0|This is my favorite management book to date.  Jim Collins is brilliant.  His writing style and information packed research prodcued a masterpiece.
B00003CXAT|5.0|For its time, this movie was and still is brilliant.  Entertaining story, many heart stopping action moments and very good graphics.  Those animals are out to get you.....
0316010669|4.0|I love Malcolm Gladwell.  He takes a unique approach to analyzing cultural phenomena as it relates to the world or buisness and management.  You can learn from this book.
B0001CNRBG|4.0|This has been a favorite movie of mine for many years and I finally decided to add it to my collection.  The movie is funny, heartwarming, thought provoking.  The dialogue between the actors is believable and you can put yourself in the situations at hand.  Now that I actually own it, I know I will view it over and over again.
0316776963|5.0|This guy is unbelievably funny.  I have read some of these shorts 5 or 6 times and they keep getting funnier.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Yet another great effort from Ghost In the Shell. There are so many good reviews already that I will make this short. The animation is some of the best I've seen and the story is good, although I had to watch it twice to understand it. The worst part of this is that there is no English track and the subtitle makes you feel retarded. Geez...explosions, cars starting, tires squealing, footsteps, etc. sound the same in every language, don't they?  Honestly, if you don't mind reading the subtitles this is a great movie. If you can read the subtitles you might want to thank a teacher. If you like anime this is a gem.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This is all that it was meant to be and more.  Beautifully presented and packaged.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|\\"Sunshine\\" represents the third collaboration between director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland.  I've never watched \\"The Beach\\" in its entirety (what I've seen is not encouraging), but their work on \\"28 Days Later\\" alone is sufficient to generate interest in any future work they may produce. \\"28 Days Later\\" was one of those rare genre films that worked brilliantly on a purely dramatic level; it was both a great horror movie and a great drama filled with likable, compelling characters.  So, I was understandably excited for \\"Sunshine\\", and it did not disappoint.  It can't manage the overall excellence of \\"28 Days Later\\", but this is still a beautifully made, thoroughly compelling film with a stronger human element than most of its contemporaries.<br /><br />\\"Sunshine\\" has a typically simple premise: In the year 2057 the sun is, for some unspecified reason, dying, and the earth has sent two missions to heal it in some equally vague fashion via setting off a stellar bomb.  The first mission, Icarus I, never returned nor did it succeed, thus necessitating the launch of Icarus II, which we will follow through the film.<br /><br /> Some have complained about the vagueness of the setup, but I couldn't disagree more.  There's basically no such thing as a hard science fiction film, so I'd rather that they not waste our time with too much pseudo-scientific blather, but rather introduce us to the premise and allow the viewer to either take it or leave it.  As to those who complain that the science isn't real, I got some news for ya: the science is almost never real.  It's frankly baffling that anyone would the science to be accurate, considering the track record of sci-fi films.  Of course, I don't actually believe that those who complain about the impossibilities really dislike \\"Sunshine\\" because of this.  Most people just lack the ability to articulate why they found a film boring or stupid, so they just latch onto some supposed impossibilities or plot holes, oblivious that the exact same complaints can be leveled at virtually any film.<br /><br />Anyway, the major trouble in the film arises when, quickly approaching the sun, Icarus II picks up a distress signal from Icarus I, causing debate amongst the crew: some believe they should continue on the mission as planned, others feel that the risk of changing course will be offset by the potential gains that come may come form investigating, particularly in the form of a second bomb.  They ultimately decide, though not unanimously, to change course.  On their way a number of human errors create a desperate situation on Icarus II wherein they may no longer be able to deliver the payload, much less return to earth.  Moreover, they discover quite a mystery on the seemingly undamaged Icarus I, which eventually gives rise to the surprisingly horror-oriented finale.<br /><br />While \\"Sunshine\\", again, can't match the sort of humanity found in \\"28 Days Later\\", it is still more psychologically deep and character-driven than most genre films. (Though it can't help but give some of the characters, specifically Trey, Corazon and Harvey, the short shrift.)  The film is, practically, half about the physical dangers that come with the mission, and half about the sort of mental difficulties and conflicts which arise between the crew members.  Cillian Murphy is the lead, here playing Capa, a physicist familiar with the stellar bomb and in charge of operating it, should the computer fail.  Unsurprisingly, Murphy plays Capa as something of a cold rationalist, and this makes him a bit less personable than usual, though his natural likeability still shines through to some degree. The other dominant personalities include Dr. Searle (Cliff Curtis), the psych officer who seems a bit of kilter himself, Mace (Chris Evans), the combative, hotheaded engineer who clashes with Capa and foxy chick Cassie (Rose Byrne), the sensitive pilot (I'm pretty sure foxy chick is her primary role on the ship, however) who is the film's apparent love interest, though an explicit subplot is mercifully absent.  Many have accused the characters of being basically clich&eacute;d, and while I can't really disagree with this claim, I think the solid performances bring them fully to life.  Chris Evans, in particular, is surprisingly compelling and even likable as the jackhole Mace, and Rose Byrne makes her typically grating character type (the whiny girl who wants everyone to get along) far more sympathetic than usual.<br /><br />Sunshine is a medium-budget film (arguably relatively low-budget for a major release sci-fi film) but it is nevertheless remarkably beautiful and uses the FX budget to maximum effect.  Though the effects are ever present, they aren't flashy, nor do they usually draw much attention to themselves.  They are simply a core part of the universe of the film.  This makes \\"Sunshine\\" more of a genuine sci-fi film than most, even though the science is often bunk: \\"Sunshine\\" tries, at least on an emotional level, to give a sense of the vastness of the universe, of what extended space travel would be like and of what sort of problems would come along with it.  Most sci-fi films have the futuristic elements as background and nothing more.  \\"Sunshine\\" may not be truly realistic, but science fiction ideas are still at the heart of the film.<br /><br />That said, \\"Sunshine\\" takes a surprising turn towards horror in the final act.  I'm a horror aficionado, so this doesn't bother me, but I can imagine why others would dislike it and find it jarring.  Put most bluntly, however, though the horror twist comes out of left field, the climax works well on its own terms: the villain, whom I won't discuss at length, is creepy and cool and it's all quite tense, even if it's ultimately not as solid as the opening 80 minutes or so.<br /><br />Anyway, it looks like \\"Sunshine\\", as with the aforementioned \\"28 Days Later\\", is receiving a fairly mixed response from the public.  This is unsurprising, since it is pretty slow-paced and contemplative for a contemporary sci-fi film, which, combined with the bizarre conclusion, will doubtless alienate many viewers.  But what can I say, I liked it, and I, in fact, particularly enjoy the strange mix.  All in all this is some very good stuff, and one of the best '07 releases.<br /><br />Grade: A-est, though an explicit subplot is mercifully absent.

B000VI70WM|4.0|Reviewing music methods should not always be the same for different bands or different albums by the same band.  Instead of the popular microscopic, analytical and in-depth examination,  one should simply resort to asking one's self how they feel afterwards.  Be careful not to be influenced by pre-conceived notions.  Is it that common to expect a similar style or level of aptitude of previous works.  How comparative should our reasoning be?  The point I am trying to make is to just listen.  I did and I will tell you that Simon Le Bon's vocals are still very appealing and good to hear.  Nick Rhoades' keyboards still drive the music with a roaring distinction and brilliance.  John Taylor's driving bass thumps its way into your speakers with a wicked funk and Roger Taylor bangs the drum with extreme precision.  I wasn't really a fan early on although The Wedding Album was a personal favorite.  Simply put, the tunes are catchy and appealing.  I find this a personal toe-tapper at times often I want to break out into robot dance.  It may take two listens before it speaks to you but it will.  Buy this cd.

1400063515|5.0|This book is more profound than it first seems from the title. Stocks aside, it provides a good observation and conclusions about how the world and our psychology work, exposing the artificial importance and reverence we assign to some types of knowledge and people. Every thinking person should find delight in reading it.
B000MV8AE0|2.0|Great unappreciated artists of the world, drop your drawers! It works every time, judging from the cornucopia of gaga reviews given to this awful movie. (1) I found the distortion and speculation in this film insulting. (2) Mr. Harris's portrayal of Beethoven was embarrassing to say the least. (3) The musical examples performed on camera in the drama itself (as opposed to in the background soundtrack) often had never been played in that context historically. And one of the pieces heard in the drama only existed in manuscript during Beethoven's lifetime. One ought to honor great artists, not smother them in the mundane!
B000V6BE6C|5.0|What a fresh different sound that I haven't heard before. After listening to this disk for the last couple of months this disk never falls out of my 6 disc CD player. Some hardcore fans of Avenged may not enjoy this album as it does go down a different path then there previous albums but i will be standing in line looking for the next album.
B000YPUF9W|3.0|1st one was great, 2nd one was ok.  This one was eh.<br /><br />The story is good, but very short, it doesn't really go anywhere, and there is not enough fighting with the bad guy at the end.  Overall, it was pretty mediocre, but I still liked it enough to keep it.<br /><br />Update... probably will sell it as I doubt I will watch it again... I haven't not opened again since I got it.
B000000LZV|5.0|Ditto Mr Solidays previous reveiw!I have owned this double ALBUM since it hit the racks.Got it when I saw a video for This Aint No Picnic on MTV.Mustve listened to it and it didnt hit me.Its alot to digest!Well about 6 montha ago I copied it to mini-disc,then to cd and now its on my I-Tunes!Amazing,Im trying to get my 12yr old into it and he likes it.I listen to this in headphones start to finish when Im sorting mail in the morning.Cant get it outta my player!! Mike Watt rules!Jazz-rock-punk and country;all with a good sense of humor and anger!
B00007KQA3|5.0|This is a great movie! Read the book first if you can! I picked it up at Best Buy about 3 years ago for $10 and I'm glad I did with the way the prices are today. I can sell it for $60-$120 used. It's not only a great movie, but apparently an investment!
B000F8O35U|5.0|I gave this to my wife for Christmas. She is a big Little Mermaid fan. She stated the colors were better than in the original. I liked the extra features and the deleted scenes that shed more light on Ursula's background. Good family movie.
B000EYK4GW|1.0|I purchased this for 2 children based off of reviews only to get cringe-filled reports from my girlfriends. As soon as my friends sat down to watch the movie with their children they knew that I hadn't actually watched Dumbo before. Fortunately, the children love the movie and don't understand/appreciate the racist overtures contained within.     Nonetheless, I will be replacing the Dumbo movie with the Aristocats and I will never, ever give a child a classic Disney movie without viewing it first again.
B000YA9R3C|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is Daniel Plainview, a simple oil man.  He started off very rough, alone dealing with the discomfort and pain of digging holes in order to obtain the lubricating riches of Texas tea.  As his business began to grew, he received a tip that would have him drilling for oil in a desolate village where he has to associate, nay, negotiate with devoted Christians like a claimed prophet named Eli Sunday (Paul Dino) in order to accomplish his mission.  He treated this business like a family business, as seen with his son H.W. Plainview, but he never felt so isolated.  Like business, his own greed has grown, becoming mean and distrusting others, even his own kin; turns out he's not really a simple man.  Spanning over 20 years in the early 1900s, it's a progress of Daniel being a wealthy oil businessman but so has his cold self-being, and what can be said of the aftermath is this...\\" There Will Be Blood.\\"<br /><br />There are a lot of positive things to say about his role (Oscar-worthy; marvelous; captivating), but it's easy to say Day-Lewis is the right man for this character.  Day-Lewis is known for being a picky actor, but he usually makes the right choice on film roles, and he certainly made a great one here, for his role entices on brutal charisma.  Daniel Plainview was selfish, deceitful & malevolent and Day-Lewis brought these characteristics to the film with such depth that it's not easy to hate the character.  He also has this intimidating aura that even when he doesn't lift a finger, his presence can be threatening.<br /><br />\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is simply great, no way around it.  Director P.T. Anderson crafted a visceral delight unlike his early multi-character films, emphasizing on only one person to carry the weight for about 2 1/2 hours.  It's a long film, but the main character constantly brings something new to the table, whether it's negotiating for his business or being baptized for buying land; it doesn't feel like the film drags.  Other than Day-Lewis, the rest of the cast are pretty good.  Not sure about Paul Dino as the preacher, but I think he pulled it off, as is the kid who played H.W. Plainview who grew up with his share of unfortunates.  The film looks as beautiful as it is ugly; I like the locations and the sight of the workers in those large oil drilling devices incorporates the danger and grittiness this film shows.<br /><br />Much praise has to be said about the movie's eerie score.  When I saw the movie's trailer, it was the score that made me want to see this film, and Jonny Greenwood made great use of stringed instruments to make the movie sound periodic and menacing.  From the beginning of the film, the music heightens itself to a point of shock; I knew from then I was in for a messy film, and the music accurately fits the film's tone.  I think the score is more terrifying than the movie itself.<br /><br />What surprised me the most about this movie is its rating, because despite being R-rated for violence and being an otherwise brutal film, there is hardly any graphic violence. Most of the violent parts appear accidental, and one scene regarding a use of a handgun isn't as bad as you see in a PG-13 action film.  In fact, the only graphic scene worthy of this movie's rating is the last scene of the film, and personally, it made a symbolic point of this movie's themes.  In a field of enterprise and religion, there's never room for both of them and the sins of trade can never be lost to faith.  And that whoever came up with the movie title has a sense of humor.he rest of the cast are pretty good.

When I saw the movie's trailer, it was the score that made me want to see this film, and Jonny Greenwood made great use of stringed instruments to make the movie sound periodic and menacing.  From the beginning of the film, the music heightens itself to a point of shock; I knew from then I was in for a messy film, and the music accurately fits the film's tone.  I think the score is more terrifying than the movie itself.    What surprised me the most about this movie is its rating, because despite being R-rated for violence and being an otherwise brutal film, there is hardly any graphic violence. Most of the violent parts appear accidental, and one scene regarding a use of a handgun isn't as bad as you see in a PG-13 action film.  In fact, the only graphic scene worthy of this movie's rating is the last scene of the film, and personally, it made a symbolic point of this movie's themes.  In a field of enterprise and religion, there's never room for both of them and the sins of trade can never be lost to faith.  And that whoever came up with the movie title has a sense of humor.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|Had some cute parts, but not near as cute or entertaining - for either adults or kids as The Incredibles or Cars.  Also, I don't like the fact that Lingini is the illegetimate son of the chef.  Why do they have to put stuff like that in a kids cartoon?  I was very disappointed in Disney and Pixar for putting in content like that.  There is no need for it.
B000025XKM|5.0|Thanks to the magic of the internet, I was able to listen to Pink Moon many times (legally!), and it's the most stripped down album I've ever heard. A sound system won't do anything to enhance the music. There is no hidden melodies, and what you hear on the surface is all you get. It doesn't get more stripped down than this. Only one song features a piano, which is the title track. Everything else just consists of Nick Drake, his acoustic guitar, and his thoughts. Really doesn't sound very interesting, I know.<br /><br />Yet this is the exact essence of one of the meanings of music, putting your thoughts and emotions into music. Nick Drake never felt more stark and empty, so he recorded this. Everything shows that in Pink Moon. Yet while it is empty, there is a beautiful emotion behind it. The right place for this to be listened to is in nature. Nowhere else will Pink Moon will click. Heck, just try blending this album with the ambience of a forest. Focus on the music and what he's saying with the beauty of nature itself. Totally amazing. I get the same feeling listening to this as the same feeling when I sit on a porch in the forest, with nothing but nature, getting this emotion you just can't feel. Why listen to the music that makes me feel this kind of emotion in the place it conjures? Sounds great to me.<br /><br />The music, of course, will always stand on it's own, no matter where you are. When listening to this, you will forget people and be with yourself. Drake's guitar playing is pretty catchy too. He can make a good melody with his guitar, and it does seem to fit the lyrics well. It's a great thing he makes good guitar lines with plenty of melody, because it's the only thing.  It is truly some beauty in this, and the melodies are never boring, just beautiful.  Thanks to that, along with his excellent voice, he creates something that will hook you from beginning to end.<br /><br />For people who want some music as pure as possible, buy this album. Nuff said.<br /><br />9/10
B000025XKM|2.0|Granted, Nick Drake was an originator, but like the rest of his stuff, these songs are insipid, with that breathy voice of his, simplistic and boring. Pseudo-emotional.  No verve or daring.
B000Y7U98W|1.0|I've read some of the other reviews of this movie, both good and bad, that appear here. My motivation in posting my own review is to warn people off of this movie. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't even think about it. I was stunned at how bad it is...really shocked that money was even invested in it. I can only say one \\"good\\" thing about it: if you want to see just how unimportant screen writers are in Hollywood today (the writer's strike is still going on as I write this review), then perhaps you'd benefit from seeing this film as an example of how little the script matters to producers. The script of this file is so bad that all else that might have been considered redeeming about it (scary, thrilling, awe-inspiring) is lost in comparison to that poor script.    For those who might doubt it, I must say that I actually watched the entire movie. I groaned and sighed and snorted out loud on several occasions, but I did watch it. I should add that I am a fan of almost any old or new Sci-Fi movie. I really enjoy the genre. In fact, I often think as I see newer movies how much better the same (or similar) idea was done in the past, particularly the 1950s. I say that because there are very few truly new ideas in the offerings of any genre of motion picture entertainment today. In other words, most things have been done before, so if they are done again now, it should be because something new needs to be said or illuminated or a new audience reached. I'm sorry to say that \\"Sunshine\\" has nothing new to say and how it \\"said what it did say\\" was just terrible in my opinion. [FROM HERE ON THERE ARE SPOILERS.]    Examples of \\"terrible\\"? Oh, how about these few:    1) The science behind the \\"fading sun\\" is never explained but in today's world, such a premise MUST be explained. There must be a tie-in to a current or even an old issue (such as ecology or global warming, etc.) in order for the story to work for today's tech-savvy viewer. I mention this issue first because I canpoint to the 2005 movie entitled \\"Day After Tomorrow\\" as a recent film that, in spite of its weak script, actually had something to say that was very relevant to today's world. In my humble opinion, all Sci-Fi writing must (yes, I just said \\"must\\") relate somehow to our world today, otherwise its value and relevance are put in question. The fact that the \\"fading sun\\" issue of this film is never tied into anything else that is remotely related to issues facing the real world today should have put the writers of this script to shame.     2) The actors, while they were at least competent in terms of acting skills, were faced with a script that required them to talk and act as though they were half their apparent age. I hate this about any movie made today (of course, I am over 45, so take that into consideration). I mention the issue of the characters' ages because of the illogic of the script was breathtaking in this regard. The script puts the fate of humanity in the hands of emotionally incomplete \\"teenagers\\" who bicker and fight and do stupid things (and are allowed by the computer that runs the ship to do those stupid things). I guess a case could be made for the idea that the scriptwriters were proposing is that the trouble with the world today is that teenagers (like the ones who would presumably buy tickets to this dumb movie) are in charge of things. But, that's not true. Teenagers are not in charge of the world (yet). My point is, why waste so much time and money to make a film that says something that is so obviously untrue without backing it up in the script somehow? For example, if the script had explained that all the smart, mature, \\"hero-types\\" in the world had already frozen to death leaving just the sadly inadequate team in this movie to save the world somehow then perhaps one could buy the logic of that script.    3) Everything that happens from the moment the existence of the original Icarus is discovered is both illogical and just screams \\"Wait! Don't go over to that ship! It will end your true mission!\\" I suppose the fact that the one hero-type character (the guy who actually does freeze to death as he tries to revive the super-cooled mainframe for some vague reason which, sadly, never does justice to his sacrifice) does literally \\"put the blood of\\" the dead shipmates onto the hands of the man who diverted the ship was, in a small way, redeeming of the script.     4) Both the female characters are written in such a way that the actors should have refused to play them. The apparently older character (Asian) lived in a disconnected world of her own making (her greenhouse) and so seemed to served no purpose to the plot except to be available to be horribly killed by the mad, skinless captain (who illogically looked like he should be dead already) just as she found the small seedling growing in the burnt-out greenhouse. The younger (and White) female character served, I suppose, as both the \\"emotional heart\\" of the film in how she related to some of the male characters and the stereotypically stupid female who can do nothing right except be ready to be held as a hostage by the mad (man) captain. Oh, and did I mention the illogic of the mad captain surviving? How did he \\"slip by\\" the crew? How? How? How? Well, I turned on the subtitles and read this: \\"Don't ask questions of the script, they won't be explainable, just accept them.\\" (Just kidding.)    5) The Asian male (the one who \\"forgets\\" to make a minor calculation that would have prevented the damage to the ship which then leads to the death of the captain) was the only character who got to do what I suspect all the actors all wanted to do (i.e., kill themselves for taking the roles). I mean, seriously, wouldn't the onboard computer with the female voice (and was that a subliminal message by the scriptwriters about the roles of females in a teenager-man's world?) have WARNED him or PREVENTED him from taking action that would have damaged the ship? If the screenwriters are so lame as to hinge the entire rest of the plot on such an illogical premise then they should NOT have had the same \\"female\\" computer take autonomous action at another point in the film when it acts to protect the ship. Hey, scriptwriters, you can't have it both ways. Either the computer double checks everything all the time or it doesn't. And what kind of a ship or mission designer (or the entire world for that matter) would send a last-chance ship flying off towards the Sun without thinking of some safeguards that would prevent a single crewman's lapse of memory from derailing the whole mission? (Did I mention the script was illogical? Oh, yeah, I did. Sorry.)    6) OK, I'll be less verbose now. I'll just mention the fact that the script \\"borrows\\" elements from so many other sources that it seemed, at times, to be a patchwork quilt with nothing holding it together but the unexplained \\"crisis\\" with the fading Sun. Repeatedly as I was watching the film, I thought to myself, \\"well, what other Sci-Fi film haven't they borrowed from?\\" It was as if the scriptwriters knew that the scripts for \\"Event Horizon\\" and \\"2001\\" didn't provide quite enough raw material for an entire story.    7) The dramatic climax (when the flawed \\"scientist/hero\\" somehow triggers the bomb that ends up restoring the Sun) was anything but dramatic and far from realistic. Oh, and it was illogical. (By now it's probably clear that \\"Illogical\\" is about the worse thing I could say in criticism about a Sci-Fi story.) I mean, how could this guy be physically standing there holding up his hand to the \\"new sun\\" he had created inside of the \\"bomb\\"? And why did the \\"bomb\\" even continue to exist (or, more to the point, how did it allow human life to exist) once it left the shelter of the ship's shield and drop towards the Sun? It seemed like the climate inside the bomb (where the skinless, bad captain who had talked to God for seven years had gone so that he could hold the \\"helpless\\" female hostage) seemed to be nice and balmy, not tens of thousands of degrees which would fry any living thing instantly. Hmmm, maybe the script writers should have hired a science consultant to help them. Or, better yet, a ghostwriter.    8) I just realized that this review of mine is longer than the actual film. But, because the film seemed much longer than it was because it was so painfully written, perhaps you (dear reader of this review) will forgive me for my long-windedness. I will mention that I thought it was a nice touch that the guy who seemed to be fascinated with being burned up by the sun was able to arranged things such that he could get his wish merely by sacrificing himself by staying behind in the old ship.    So, obviously, I think that no one should waste any time (or money) on this film. I suggest watching any of the following (on Blu-Ray, if possible) instead:    2001: A Space Odyssey (the remastered Blu-Ray is amazing)    Event Horizon (yes, I actually liked this film and its script)    The Day After Tomorrow (good effects, somewhat illogical, but watch for what it \\"says\\" about our world and our political leaders of the last 7 years)    Silent Running (not the best in terms of logic but solid entertainment with moral dilemmas and commentary worthy of any sci-fi master)    Soylent Green (ditto this one in terms of entertainment and social commentary value and it has Charleton Heston in it!)    When Worlds Collide (one of the best stories ever filmed--really the granddaddy of all that came later--in spite of its lack of real science, but considering the time it was made, it had lots to say about humanity)    I could go on and on. But, for the one or two readers who have gotten this far, I'll leave you with a big \\"Thank You!\\" for reading through this long-winded review of mine.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|A fan of the show because of two things: 1. THE WRITING, and 2. The fashion, my husband purchased this collection for me. A thoughtful gift; however, until I opened it, I was not happy he spent the money--particularly because we already own the individual seasons on DVD. Once I looked through the DVD package, the per season cataloging and synopsis of each episode made it worth every penny. The bonus of a fun book with a focus on fashion photos and character study was the cherry on top. A must have for fans.
B00015YVDG|5.0|I have been trying to get this on DVD. I have it on VHS, but the tape was starting to dry out. I have always enjoyed Mel Gibson in all his movies. When I first viewed this movie several years ago, the twist in the plot was unexpected. Good writers and directing.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|[[ASIN:B000V6BE6M The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (The Complete Recordings)]]  just received this final set of the trilogy. excellent listening, and has my favourite song 'the houses of healing' included. It is a great addition to the other two extended cd's, but I am biased -  I love the Lord of the Rings book, films and music and Howard Shore is an inspired composer and conductor.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|While I don't think any version of Persuasion can compare to the 1995 version, I really liked this one.  Liked, not loved. I didn't really appreciate all the moving camera work--it made my eyes hurt.  And it did seem almost like a Cliff's Notes version of Persuasion, rather than a fully fleshed out story.  Nonetheless, I think this was a good adaptation of the book for the short amount of time it took up--only 90 minutes. I do think that maybe part of the reason people so dislike this version is because PBS cut out about 10 minutes of the movie (10 important minutes, I might add) that would've added SO MUCH to the story line. I was really surprised when I saw some scenes between Harville and Wentworth that were not in the original airing on PBS.  How could they cut these scenes that were, for the most part, vital to the story?  Anyway, I won't spoil it if you haven't seen them before but I do think those \\"missing scenes\\" add much more to the story and make it more a movie than a long TV show.  The story does move fast, but I always love having a new version of a Jane Austen novel.  Unless, of course, it's really awful; which I don't think this version is, and that's why I give it four stars.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|I did own Robocop previously on Laserdisc and on DVD. Both were the quite expensive Criterion Collections.  The aspect Ratio was 1.66:1. Now I purchased this 20th Anniversary Edition. Immediately I noticed that it was 1.85:1. I though that this might be a pressed Ratio, but after checking it out I learned that this movie really is 1.85:1. That was the first plus of this release. After opening I noticed that it contained the theatrical release and the extended version. I of course watched the extended version which contains a few very nice gory shots. You do notice when these scenes were included because the color changes a little bit but that's about it. As a whole the quality is very good. The sound is also great. I have a quite expensive sound system and the Movie really made use of it. I just scanned through the extras but they all seem to be very interesting.   To come to a conclusion: This Disc is definetly worth buying. For three reasons: 1.) It's simply a great movie that one needs to own. 2.) It is the definitive cut of the movie 3.) The Disc is pretty inexpensive  Just a warning: Stay away from the Criterion Collection. As I said in the beginning, the criterion cut is in the wrong aspect ratio.
B000K15VSA|5.0|The image is stunning.  The movie is mostly the same, but with a couple of needed corrections -- the best being they corrected the scene where Joanna Cassidy gets shot (the first retirement).  In the original it was painfully obvious when they cut to the stunt woman, bad wig, wrong face easy to see because it was slow motion.  In the Final Cut they have gone back and digitally replaced the stunt woman's head with Madam Cassidy's.  Quite cool.  Plus the horrible voice over is still gone.  However, for those of you that liked it (groan) the original '82 release is included.  That plus all of the Special Featuers make this a worthwhile purchase.    I would guess, anyway.    Mine was a gift.
0312330537|5.0|What a great read!  It's nearly a thousand pages of absolute delight.  I only like books that have something to teach me.  Every page is as golden as the cover.  This is, quite possibly, the best thing I've read since Poisonwood Bible. It's so insightful, it's hard to believe that the writer was a crook!  Or maybe he was a sociopath.  I wonder if I still know right from wrong.
B000002GBD|4.0|Well I was talking to my friend Stephen T. McCarthy in one of his reviews. Somehow this album/CD (doesn't anyone appreciate vinyl anymore) became a topic of conversation. Then to make matters even more bizarre the anthem of this album (it predates CD's and for that reason I refuse to use modern terminology)\\"Now Your Messin With A SOB\\" (the songs actually called Hair Of The Dog, but I like my title better) graced my radio while driving to the evil empire of super-markets with my wife. My wife's final analysis, \\"This song goes on forever, and the changes don't justify it's almost five minutes.\\" Although I have a special place in my heart for the song (Ah, memories of my dear uncle shooting up while listening Nazareth, the Rolling Stones and others) it did out stay it's welcome.<br /><br />  The song most will remember this album for (I refuse to call it a CD.. Where has the market for vinyl gone. Oh yes, they put typing courses on them now) was \\"Love Hurts.\\" Not a bad little ballad for those who love and adore such things. However, this is NAZARETH!!! I mean these guys are supposed to be a hard rock band right? They were around at the same time of Black Sabbath's glory days right? OK, Black Sabbath had \\"Changes\\" so given that I personally feel \\"Love Hurts\\" is a better song (actually I do like the song) I suppose I should abandon this current diatribe. The rest of this album (I refuse to say CD dang it, just refuse) is fairly dated material. I really can't think of any other song that has influenced musicians three decades later. That said, this is a decent hard rock album (I refuse to say CD) from the 70's. Ah, my two year old self will always have memories of my uncle jacking needles into his arm while my mother was off belly dancing doing everything she could to put a roof over my head (actually she was supporting his teenage little hind quarters as well since he didn't have a job, and couldn't live with my over abuse and drunk grandfather). Bet ya didn't think I would remember that did ya uncle? ya well you also didn't realize you were messin with a little \\"SOB.\\"ember that did ya uncle? ya well you also didn't realize you were messin with a little \\"SOB.\\"
B0002X314C|2.0|Perhaps it's just the hype that has surrounded Mr. Legend for the last few years or so, but after listening to \\"Get Lifted\\" I wonder what the fuss is about.  Sure he has soft vocals and appears talented on the piano, but I think every 'fan' has heard better.<br /><br />He is no \\"Luther (Vandross).\\"  Not that he should or wants to be compared to that great voice, but those songs stand the test of time and are iconic in this genre of music.  Legend is entertaining and light, but not groundbreaking.  Perhaps we have gotten so used to hip-hop tainted songs about violence or even the sappy, doo-wop love songs from R&B boy bands that populated 1990s airwaves, making John Legend somewhat of a breath of fresh air.  Maybe so, but I expected more.<br /><br />That is not to say that he is not talented.  His live performance DVD is spectacular, and some of the tracks from his follow up cd are amazing, particularly \\"Show Me,\\" which is haunting and beautiful with some of the most thoughtful yet simple lyrics that truly great songs are made.<br /><br />A few elements of \\"Get Lifted\\" are cute.  The voicemail message from his parents is a nice touch, although it is juxtaposed against the explicit lyrics of one of the tracks that indicates even this fresh new voice can't seem to stay away from testosterone laiden rap lyrics about sex.<br /><br />The cd is worth having since there are so few original male vocal R&B artists making thoughtful, relaxing and contemporary music.  I recommend buying the DVD instead.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|After having only inferior copies for so long, until Giorgio Moroder's reconstruction (of which I have a DVD copy), this version is superior, although I enjoyed the Moroder version above ANY restoration thus far. It enjoys a special place among my silent collection, alongside \\"Wings\\" and \\"Sunrise\\" as well as \\"Battleship Potemkin\\" and the Garbo silent \\"Flesh and the Devil\\".<br /><br />The film has been reviewed by so many here, that a blow-by-blow is unnecessary, in my opinion. Suffice to say that any restoration will inevitably improve upon the technology used in 1926. Purists will be pleased with the score, being fit for a film of this type, and the \\"cuts\\" made by American studios have been mostly restored. The uneven timing (caused by hand cranking of the camera) has been corrected, and the picture, itself is of a higher quality than the early VHS prints.<br /><br />At this point, I would like to say that the Moroder version is still the standard for this film. Yes, it is shorter, as Moroder could not find every cut that was lost, and inserted stills to \\"flesh out\\" the missing segments. He also colorized it, and the score is unusual for a silent film, being made up of modern rock music. Strangely, IT WORKS, and very effectively, I might add! If only a DVD version of the Moroder reconstruction were available (my copy is good, but the sound is a little \\"soft\\").<br /><br />Still, \\"Metropolis\\" is one of the better films Lang produced, and among the silents, a must have for any silent collection!
B000PKG7I4|3.0|This is a cd for those who have never heard of Amy Winehouse, have listened to \\"Back to Black,\\" loved it, and wanted to hear more.  That is me.  I enjoyed this cd to hear more of the signature style and originality of Amy.  Although not as polished and detailed as \\"Black,\\" this cd shows you how she got there.<br /><br />It is original, irreverent, but not as soulful as Black.  I enjoyed every track, particularly the lyrics to \\"F-Me Pumps.\\"  Each track sounds as if she was live, in a small venue, singing to familiar fans and friends.  It is stripped down, heavy on lyrics, without most of detail that the Dap Kings and Mark Ronson brought to Black.<br /><br />That is, until you get to Track 8, \\"In My Bed.\\" That track blew me away with its deep, dark electronic beat and the sharp vocals.  WOW!  It doesn't necessarily fit the rest of the cd (although the track Amy Amy Amy is another good edition) but it shows that this women has a range of styles, is original and somewhat unique rhythm and knows exactly what music she wants to put forward.<br /><br />If you are a Winehouse fan, get this cd.  If you want to almost hear the almost whimsical prequel to heartbroken and defiant Back to Black, get this cd.  If you want to be blown away by an almost sinister and wicked track found in \\"In My Bed\\" get this cd.
B000UR366S|5.0|Joni Mitchell is clearly the most outstanding female musician of our time; her new material continues to strike awe in me and should produce the same in everyone who has an opportunity to 'participate' in her creative, innovative style.   There is truly no one who comes close to matching her genius.  Shine is hauntingly bold.   She refuses to bow to the power and injustice of the music industry today.   We are privileged to have her and, hopefully, she'll continue to shine into her seventies.   Thank you, Joni.
B000X418UE|5.0|This is a great transfer of a 11 year old movie.PQ and SQ is awesome.All of the features from the Criterion DVD were used in this release.Thanks to Disney for taking the time to do a great transfer of a great movie.
B0007OY2P8|4.0|The saddest part about this story, and even this video version, is that most modern people don't get the references.  It's not a true gothic but only satire, although surrounded by a truly good coming-of-age story of lost innocence, more comparable to (the truly good) 'Ten Things I Hate About You' than to anything purporting to be any edgier.<br /><br />Jane Austen begins her deliberately sardonic 1797 novel with a full paragraph of what Catherine Morland is NOT, to insinuate is that Cathy is merely ordinary, not as intelligent as Lizzie, sappier than Marianne, a clueless precursor to the later Emma.  Wide-eyed Katherine Schlesinger depicts poor little Cathy as an eager ingenue, easily amazed and impressed by what any seasoned urbanite would find trivial and suspect.  In her facial expressions alone she gives us a bona-fide picture of a young girl's discovery that what she thought was duplicitous and what she thought was genuine are in reality the reverse.<br /><br />Peter Firth plays the modestly mysterious Henry Tilney with a sly, benign teasing.  He reveres Cathy's innocence even as he is irresistibly drawn to her for it.  Cassie Stuart (typically known in other films for taking off her top) plays the ridiculous Isabella Thorpe like an exaggerated Britney Spears, neither pretty nor seductive enough to be taken seriously, but still she tries.  Robert Hardy plays the willfully ignorant General Tilney as aloof, brusque, and secretive, a proud man with much less to hide than he thinks he has.  Jonathan Coy is sarcastic and oppressive as the egotistical John Thorpe, the very date we all want our daughters NOT to see.  Above all Googie Withers is delightfully bombastic, a kind of more urbane and even less clued-in Mrs Jennings from 'Sense and Sensibility', someone too naïve and yet too controlling to be a successful fairy godmother.<br /><br />Some of the best lines in the movie are unfortunately not in the book, including Henry's comparisons of readers to fish and Cathy's unwittingly witty reply about woman's power of refusal.  Likewise the closing scene includes more dialogue than in the novel, but for most viewers who go right to the book for more of the same, Austen film adaptations prove a little less than accurate.<br /><br />It is true the 1980s music is often a distraction; it is more telling of the time of filmmaking than of the time of setting and especially transparent as a faint effort at making Jane's parody into a viable late-20th-C gothic.  But the exquisite Bath settings were not to be rivalled till 1995's 'Persuasion'-- the 'gig' scene and the umbrellas scene could only have been done on location.  And the odd scene filmed in the actual Roman baths had actually been done before, in the appropriately bawdy 1977 'Joseph Andrews', and here, as in that one, the ingenue's quiet awe and amazement perfectly represents the viewer's unfamiliarity with the place was well.<br /><br />For British castle fans the use of the 13th-C moated Bodiam for Northanger is disappointing, because we all know it is an uninhabitable ruin now, but it is a spooky fortress from which one cannot easily escape, and the dramatically sinister picture of 18th-C armed guards lurking above the medieval portcullis validates the anachronistic reality.<br /><br />The 2007 rendition of this story makes several unnecessary substitutions, most vitally by referring to Matthew Lewis' suspense novel 'The Monk' rather than Ann Radcliffe's 1794 'The Mysteries of Udolpho'.  Mrs Radcliffe was a favorite author of many 1790s teenagers, Jane Austen among them; though with 'Northanger Abbey' the cynical student deliberately poked fun at her hugely-popular mentor's style of gothic romance.  It is significant that Jane chose 'Udolpho', as it is the quintessential gothic romance full of forced marriage contracts, shrouded inheritances, evil Papists, amoral country banditti and a half-ruined castle.  'Udolpho' is especially paid homage via a dream sequence in 'Northanger' the movie, the climactic rescue of the threatened heroine in a filmy evening gown as she is whisked away on horseback into the night by a dashing young brigand.  It's all the stuff little Cathy Morland dreams of.  For JA the full effect of 'Northanger' was nothing without 'Udolpho', a book she assumed everyone had read first (witness the authentic 1790s scene in this version of the two girls reading it to each other in bed).  But it is unfortunately not as safe a premise 200 years on, and so modern people may tend to find the references confusing and the comparison's context irrelevant.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and see the 1986 one before the 2007... or instead of it.<br /><br />...atened heroine in a filmy evening gown as she is whisked away on horseback into the night by a dashing young brigand.

B00018D3RI|5.0|I got these as a gift. I watched this show growing up, but had not seen it since. It is just as entertaining today as it was then. It is fun watching the episodes and seeing a lot of actors who became stars later. It was one of the great 'buddy cop' shows, and still better than most of the cop shows on TV now. I would recommend this DVD set to any fan of the original show or to anyone for that matter.

0375847227|4.0|Pullman's dark materials are as good as the raves on the cover. The books are both dark and compelling. He manages to tell an excellent story with believable characters. His british origin shows clearly, both from the heroes and from the darker british ending. In contrast to what an american author would have done. The specific package i.e. the omnibus, while good value for money, is less then perfect. There are no headlines on the pages to remind you which chapter or book your on. Other then page numbers at the bottom the only text is the story itself. This editing issue could be overlooked especially with the added bonus of the \\"Slides\\" at the end of each book. The slides are Pullman's own comments on the story or maybe an extra picture he felt added to the book but didn't appear in the story itself.    A good buy either way.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|We truly love this movie!  Will Smith and his son did a fantastic job of portraying the real-life challenges that a single father faced.  This is a wonderful story about perserverence, hope, and courage.  Really, though, it is a story about what a real father should be; how a real man takes hold of his responsibilities, his fatherhood.  (Be sure to watch the bonus features.) Oh, and you might want to grab some tissue.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|I have to recommend this one not only for a excellent performance but the addition of the \\"Live Aid\\" performance. The Montreal concert itself was top notch that only Queen could pull off. The Live Aid performance was one of two stand out performances (the other was The Who) that I am glad finally came out complete on video. The only thing missing are \\"Rarities\\" live by Queen doing \\"Imagine\\" and other covers only on bootlegs. Do yourself a favor & get this one. Any Queen fan will be pleased ;-)<br />Search out our site \\"Judemac Forever\\" on google,yahoo or msn.
B0002IQAMW|5.0|The Allman Brothers Band are one of the most consistent acts in history, but it must be said they were at their best when slide guitar legend Duane Allman played with them. That group put out a myriad of great albums, both in the studio (s/t; Idlewild South) and live (At Fillmore East/the Fillmore Concerts; Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival). This was the last album before Duane's tragic death, and it's also the best they ever made, both studio and live. After all, this is a bit of both.<br />The live tunes come from the same Fillmore shows that produced At Fillmore East and the Fillmore Concerts - in fact, you can find the live tunes on the Fillmore Concerts, so you know they're gonna be good. It starts off with the half-hour \\"Mountain Jam\\", which starts off as the melody of Donovan's \\"First There Is a Mountain\\". It ends up that way, too, but between the two bookends is when things really get good. They take the song into every imaginable direction - jazzy organ, bass and drum solos, even a quote from \\"Let the Circle Be Unbroken\\". But of course the best part, as always, is Duane Allman's slide guitar. It's placed after the bass solo, and it's him at his finest. The other two songs are scaled back considerably, but still very good. Their version of \\"One Way Out\\" has got to be one of the best covers ever recorded, due to Duane and Dickey's bar trading during the guitar solos, which are fantastic in their own right. And while I don't like this \\"Trouble No More\\" as much as I like the studio version, that's only because it's missing the acoustic rhythm guitar. Point is, it's a fantastic cover either way.<br />And hey, I haven't even gotten to the studio work yet. That segment features the three big-time hits from this album, one with Duane and two without. The leadoff track, \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\", is the first. I always thought this song was inspired by Duane's death, since a lot of it deals with mortality. Regardless of what it is or isn't about, it's a fine song. The highlight is Dickey's slide; Gregg also contributes fine piano and vocals. Good times all around. \\"Melissa\\" (or \\"Sweet Melissa\\", or whatever) is a forlorn, touching elegy to Duane with just a hit of country, and it's arguably the best song here. On the other hand, \\"Blue Sky\\" is a feel-good song with top-notch guitar weaving from Duane and Dickey. It's a breezy country-rocker, sung by Dickey, which began a long (okay, two-album) string of having a big radio hit sung by Betts - the other is, of course, \\"Ramblin' Man\\". Dickey also contributes an epic instrumental, \\"Les Brers in A Minor\\", which begins with a slow, moody guitar introduction before moving into a boogie with a faint touch of Santana. The third and final instrumental on this album is \\"Little Martha\\", a graceful, gorgeous, brief acoustic duet between Duane and Dickey. It's also the only song Duane ever wrote for the group. With all that competition, the funky \\"Stand Back\\" can't keep pace, but it's good enough, with a memorable bass solo.<br />Right here. The Allman Brothers at their best. I've heard it so much I've practically memorized it. It's simply a must-have.e song. The highlight is Dickey's slide; Gregg also contributes fine piano and vocals.

0767817478|3.0|An interesting thing happens throughout this movie.  The beginning is wonderful.  It sets the tone early with the mystery and at the same time, the massive scale of what is yet to come.  The cast is forgettable from the start, but all things considering, their acting and roles could be worse.  When the action begins and Godzilla is unleashed on NYC, it never lets up till the very end of the film.  That is a good thing in one manner of speaking, for people who crave non-stop action accompanyied by outstanding effects.  But I couldn't help but notice while the action increased, the script, story, and characters all got lazy, and even cheesy and corny.  Finally, there's no help there to save this movie, so it ends up being popcon entertainment.<br /><br />The creators did a god job of creating settings that make Godzilla feel like an actual monster.  He definetly looks and feels more massive than the older Godzilla movies.  The creators also wanted to set this Godzilla apart from the classic in terms of looks.  The result was good for the most part, but the head design didn't work too well for me.  It was too long and flat.  The special effects both from the creature and the surrounding environment (fighter jets, crashes, explosions etc.) were well done, though hinting at a bit of out-dated when watched today, about 10 years later.<br /><br />A big chunk of this movie takes place in Madison Square Garden.  Just when you think the film might be over (which you know its not anyways cause this is only at 80 minutes into it), its like a new film begins - Jurassic Park: Raptor Takeover.  Dozens, maybe hundred of eggs fill the interior of the arena, and as luck would have it, all hatch at the same time while our characters are inside.  This begins the never-ending segments of running from these babies who look and almost act like Raptors.  The scenes are fun, scary and suspenseful...but it just goes and on and on til eventually enough is enough.  When the problem s finally solved, the film is still far from over.  Like I said, action that never lets up.<br /><br />Non-stop mindless entertainment is what this is about.  Though they try to create a unique Godzilla film to set apart from the rest, it works only to a slight degree.  The story, script, and cast add very little too (though Jean Reno was the highlight to see, unfortunately he still didn't fit this film cause the lack of script didn't bring him to his potential.)<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 2.5<br />Story - 3<br />Overall - 3.5is still far from over.

0385720920|1.0|I found the writing style irritating, and the characters dull and boring. The story seemed to drag on and on without actually going anywhere. It might have been decent, but the big plot twist turns out not to make any sense. Not for everyone.
B000002549|1.0|Barbra believes (as do her fans) that she is omnipotent, able to turn her unique voice to any kind of music. Classical songform defeats Barbra because she does not have enough technique to sing with quiet control throughout her range.<br /><br />For instance her attempt at 'Apres Un Reve' by Faure is marred by a 'what the heck' chesty bellow, followed by a typically impassioned Barbra-ism on 'Elas!', both of which ruin the bridge passage. She reaches for that top note as if she was Ethel Merman. French with a Brooklyn accent has always been a difficult trick to master.<br /><br />Barbra only just manages to hold her pitch and breath control in check in the Wolf lied. She must have thought that because the song was so short and seemingly had little scope for drama, it would be an easy piece of filler. As a lover of Lieder, someone who had Classical training and took a particular liking to singing this song, I'm afraid Barbra's attempt will always bring tears to my eyes for the wrong reasons. The one song in English (composed specifically for Babs) is an embrarrasing trifle which does not deserve to sit with any of the poorly executed but genuinely beautiful pieces that preceed it.<br /><br />Of course because I've had the nerve to criticise Barbra, my opinion will probably be read with horror by everyone else, or it might not even make it on to the page. Criticism is actually more valuable than praise - and every singer and their admirers should accept that. I've always taken it on the chin (and I don't have a fanbase in my flat!), and I wish Barbra would - just occasionally...
0553381687|5.0|I'd been hearing great things about this book for a long time, but put off reading it because I didn't think fantasy was my thing. Now I'm hooked! Despite its length, I didn't find it to be slow at all. I couldn't put it down, and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|Anyone who has viewed the 5-star masterpiece of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds in their portrayal of this love story will surely know how truncated this depiction was. Poorly done, poorly directed, poorly acted. Devoid of any true depth of feeling. What a sad portrayal of Captain Wentworth in particular.
B000002HK4|5.0|Can't say much more that hasn't been said already.<br /><br />This album is worth it just for the title track alone, as it's all I listen to. The other cover songs are okay, but Change of Seasons (all 26 minutes of it) really shows off the band's talents. And though many versions of this song have been released (live variations), this version is still my favorite!<br /><br />This is where we get our first taste of Derek Sharidian thumping his fingers on the keys, and a great job he did too!
B000000WF0|3.0|\\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\" and \\"Lucky Man\\" drew me to this album, and I think it is a good album.  However, while the CD starts out really strong, it wanes towards the end.  The first 6 or so cuts from the CD are very vocally driven and traditionally \\"modern rock band sounding,\\" however, the last few tracks are more instrumentally driven, with unique guitar effects, almost with a modern psychedelic vibe.  Not really my thing, but if you like a combination of the two, then this CD is definitely for you. Maybe I will grow to like the latter tracks and appreciate them more.  I definitely think that it is worth the buy for the first half of the CD.  There are some really good tracks there.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Got to be the best album they've done. That's the thing about Tool: with every album they've released, they somehow manage to outdo themselves every [...] time!<br /><br />I agree that it takes a few listens in order to appreciate each song, but there are always a couple that grab you by the yambag right away and won't let go. I've got a habit of listening to the album over and over again. By the end of a dozen listens, the entire album becomes my fave.<br /><br />'Rosetta Stoned' (alien abduction) and 'Vicarious' (media influence) stand out as highlights for me on this album. Maynard has managed to outdo himself lyrically with each album, pushing the music over the edge with such passionate meaning. And this one is no exception.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|I think that this is a wonderful cd.  It shows you how very socially relevant Bob Dylan was in his day, with songs that can still have relevance today.  God on Our Side, is my personal favorite song, shining light on the fact that every war, every massacre, if done by the right people, can be said to have God on their side.  Overall the whole album is very good, something I would definitly recommend.
B000002HPT|5.0|Gotta say that this album still kicks a-- after all these years! Dream Theater's latest album after the \\"departure\\" of keyboardist Kevin Moore (not including their [[ASIN:B000002HK4 Change of Seasons]] classic), this album was more \\"mainstream\\" than any other. Not too many people enjoyed this one, and it's understandable too. But for me, this is one of the last albums that I can listen to the whole way through without skipping tracks to get past the boring stuff ([[ASIN:B000021XS0 Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory]], being the exception).<br /><br />Not sure why they got rid of Derek Sharidian after this album (though I know Portnoy snagged Rudess from his [[ASIN:B0000067YK Liquid Tension Experiment]] project to replace Derek), because Derek was a great replacement for Moore. His talents stand out in every track, especially New Millennium, Burning My Soul, Lines In The Sand, Hell's Kitchen, Just Let Me Breathe, and Trial of Tears.<br /><br />All those of which, including Peruvian Skies, are the best songs on the album (but Just Let Me Breathe isn't that great, except for the keyboard solo). Everything else is \\"radio friendly,\\" and really not that good. But as I said earlier, I can at least listen to the softer ones. Really though, my faves are Lines In The Sand and Trial of Tears, both long songs with such kick-a--progression that I never get sick of listening to. To get this album just for these two songs alone is worth it!<br /><br />Petrucci and Portnoy really show of their best stuff here, with fluid solos and complex rhythms. James strains his voice and gives probably his best performance (much better than some of the junk he comes up with now). And the bassist is the bassist; who really pays attention to them except for other bass players (though John M. does have some flashy moments on this album)?<br /><br />Overall a great DT album and one I frequently go back to over the years. Great to see them still having great moments, pulling prog-rock up from the undergrounds and out into the masses.e masses.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Ratatouille is an amazingly endearing film, it's such a shame that the peculiar plot is difficult to market to your normal, kid-friendly Pixar audience.  Perhaps this is why it is among my favorite Pixar films: it caters to a more sophisticated viewer.  You can tell by just watching the movie as it will make you want to do three things:  cook, eat fine foods, and go to Paris.  There's also a decent amount of wine drinking going on, which is a bit unusual for a \\"kids movie\\".  But if you can get over the film's more illogical elements, then you will find yourself with one of the years best films.<br /><br />The DVD is equally full of charm, although compared to previous releases, is a little light on the extras.  I was hoping for a bonus disc chock full of stuff, but was disappointed to find that there was none.  That isn't to say that there are no extras, as there is a decent helping of items; just lacking compared to past DVDs.  Probably because this was a relative box office disappointment for Pixar.<br /><br />If ever there is a Special Edition release of this film, I'll be there on day one to pick up my copy.  In the meantime, I will hold myself over with this.
B000002H6C|5.0|Sad to say that Metallica didn't go out with a bang, as it should have when the bus rolled over Cliff Burton. They were able to produce 1 more good album before committing career suicide by switching styles.<br /><br />So this is Metallica's greatest album ever. They really knew what they were doing on this one, and cranked out song after killer-f#@%ing song, with a mixture of thrash, metal, progression, and even some rock.<br /><br />+Hammet blows us all away with his solos, really putting our ears over the top!<br />+Hetfields lyrics just flat out suck!<br />+Ulrich kills everyone with his rhythms!<br /><br />If you have this album already you know what I mean. If you don't, what the hell is wrong with you??
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Van Helsing (Widescreen Edition) is a horror/action movie with a thin plot but still it is very enjoyable. The special effects are quite good and what is not to like when the fabulous Kate Beckinsale is in it. Hugh Jackman does an alright job with the part that is giving to him as Van Helsing on speed. Do not expect a smart or thought worthy plot. See it for what is, a great popcorn movie that is filled with action, great special effects and many beautiful women and then it gets 3/5 since it never promised anything else to begin with.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Bruce proves once again, old guys can still rock and roll. Yea, it's over the top, as usual, but come on, it's entertainment. And for a sequel, it still ratchets up the excitement level plenty. Bought it for my kid in college for christmas, and mom and I stole it off him on break. We all loved it. And that F-35 ought to drum up some recruits for the Marines, even cooler than the Harrier. Buy it, rent it, re-up, Bruce did.....Ooh Rah!

B000A6T1JU|4.0|The Warriors (Walter Hill, 1979)<br /><br />When I was a kid growing up in the seventies, there were three movies that defined all that was cool. Phantasm was (and still is) the essence of horror. Death Race 2000 was the epitome of the action comedy. And The Warriors was a textbook on how to make a darker action film. I watched it a few nights ago for the first time in twenty years or thereabouts, and while as an adult it's easier to see some of the shortcomings Walter Hill would develop as he gained experience, there's still no denying that The Warriors is, in fact, all that and a bag of chips.<br /><br />This is not the New York City you know. The gangs to be found in Walter Hill's epic chase flick would probably be stomped into the ground in five seconds flat. All of them are far too fashion-conscious to actually survive on the streets. But in the context of the film, they look cool, and that's what counts. Once you have seen the Furies in action, you will never forget them-- Yankee uniforms, baseball bats, and very strangely painted faces. The Warriors themselves, reflecting upon seventies fashion from the safe distance of the next century, are almost inviting themselves to be beaten to a pulp; leather vests with no shirts? Oh, please. But somehow, it still works.<br /><br />The plot: Cyrus (Roger Hill), the leader of the Riffs, the city's largest gang, calls a meeting at which nine representatives from each of the city's gangs will show up. The Warriors, from Coney Island, are one of those gangs. During the meeting, during which Cyrus preaches banding together and taking the city for their own, he is shot and killed by Luther (Dreamscape's David Patrick Kelly), one of the Rogues, who in the confusion is able to lay the blame at the feet of Cleon (Dorsey Wright), the Warriors' lead delegate. With the shooting, the all-city gang truce is off, leaving the eight remaining Warriors to make it all the way back across the five boroughs to their home turf. They have to cross the territory of seemingly every other gang in the city to do so, and to make matters worse, the Riffs are also looking for them. Just to add to the fun, there's tension in the ranks between Swan, the Warriors' warleader (Michael Beck), and an upstart, Ajax (James Remar), who believes he should be next in line to lead the gang to glorious times.<br /><br />Yeah, it's pretty cheesy. But Hill pretties it up a good deal, and to be fair, when he's on his game, he's a great action film director. And Hill was certainly on his game here. Even the lulls in the action are fraught with tension, though one wonders on occasion whether they should be. Still, for all that, it's a very fun movie, and it does what it's supposed to do-- entertain the viewer for ninety minutes and change. How much more do you really need from an action film? ****seemingly every other gang in the city to do so, and to make matters worse, the Riffs are also looking for them.

B00005JPXY|4.0|Cloverfield (Matt Reeves, 2008)<br /><br />The main reason that Cloverfield is so immensely satisfying, besides being the first January-horror-film release in recent memory that's actually good, is that it does exactly what it sets out to do-- entertain. Sure, there may be better movies out now (or, if you don't live in \\"limited areas\\", will be better movies out in the near future), but Cloverfield isn't trying to be a No Country for Old Men or There Will Be Blood-- it wants to be a fifties monster movie fifty years on, and it does so in great, glorious detail. It's a movie that's short (eighty-four minutes), sweet, and, after an overly long piece of setup, to the point. It wants to make you laugh, it wants to make you jump, and in a few scenes it wants to make you cringe, and it accomplishes all of these things without any deep, reflective moments or other stuff that so often seems out of place in a horror film. (Think about, since the comparisons are coming thick and fast, Heather's monologue on the rock five or ten minutes into The Blair Witch Project. None of that sort of malarkey here.) In some ways, there's a better comparison to be made to, say, \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" than to The Blair Witch Project here.<br /><br />The secondary reason that Cloverfield is so immensely satisfying is that TV director Matt Reeves got around the need to figure out how to make the small screen-big screen transition by taking a relatively original idea-- having the entire film told from the perspective of a video camera (and yes, it is the entire film, going The Blair Witch Project three or four better)-- and filtering his story through it. When your whole movie comes through the lens of a handheld video camera, you can pretty much blow off all the differences between small-screen and big-screen directing. This is normally the place in the review where I'd start complaining about the technical details. You're not going to get any of that here; the handheld-video-camera angle throws them all away. I will file something like a reverse complaint, however; the sound mix in this movie, which is one of the reasons you must go see it on the big screen, is way too good for a handheld production. Reeves may have nabbed his video ideas from The Blair Witch Project, but the sound mix is straight outta Doom3, and it's awesome. The other big point in the handheld-video-camera approach's favor is that there is no third-person-omniscient here, so all we know is what the characters know. I've heard at least two reviewers complaining about this. I don't understand why, because usually we're all complaining about the exact opposite. We only know what they know, and that's the reason this film is so effective; while, yeah, there is one big-reveal scene towards the end, I'm willing to forgive it given that the big-reveal scene in most monster movies since the special effects budget started outstripping the promotional budget in Hollywood monster movies is \\"the last half of the movie\\". We actually see very little of the nemeses in this movie, and that's one of the big, big points in its favor, for reasons I'll get into a much greater detail below. Besides, the structure forces Reeves to focus on the idea that a monster movie should be about the humans, rather than the monsters. It's a beautiful sight to see.<br /><br />The tertiary reason-- reasons, I should say-- Cloverfield is so immensely satisfying is that despite my assertion at the beginning of this review that the film's entire goal is to entertain, there's so very, very much more going on under the surface here. The trick is that you don't need to consciously grasp any of this stuff to enjoy the flick; you can just look at it as a monster movie and it will still be fun. The rest is just gravy. In this case, the first thing to address is the obvious comparison everyone's making (and interpreting differently)-- what's the movie saying about the Most Overrated Event in Human History(TM)? I'm going to offer a perspective I haven't seen yet, and one I hope is more welcome than the others-- that the ability of a filmmaker to destroy New York City in a movie, and the ability of movie fans to enjoy watching New York City be destroyed, is a sign that we're all starting to get over the obsession and get on with our lives. After all, monsters have been destroying cities in movies for decades, and movie fans have been loving it. The second one that really struck me was that Reeves took a relatively unknown stable of (mostly) TV character actors and made them into serious star material; the characters' actions and reactions here never feel fake or forced. The third is that there's a confusion factor here that there shouldn't be, given that we're supposedly seeing objective evidence captured on a video camera. Some will use (and, no doubt, some have used) this to trash the movie; I see it as something entirely different. As I said before, we know only what the characters do; there are very few points, however, where the characters aren't questioning the evidence of their own senses. Why shouldn't the viewer, as well? A lot of the things that don't quite add up are stuff you wouldn't really think about much consciously (like, how big is the main bad guy, anyway?), and they're anchored by a relatively solid grounding-- the geography of midtown Manhattan, which is concrete and unassailable. Now, I'm not entirely sure, since I'm not Matt Reeves or scriptwriter Drew Goddard, but I think this was intentional, and it's great.<br /><br />In short, the first major film event of 2008 turns out to be a monster movie.

B000K4WPCC|1.0|The Covenant (Renny Harlin, 2006)<br /><br />Sometimes, when you put two negative forces together, you get a positive. So there was hope that when director Renny Harlin, who hasn't made a good movie in... well, okay, ever, and writer J. S. Cardone, who's not awful when he's directing (Wicked Little Things was his), but is awful when he's writing (The Forsaken and Alien Hunter both bear his mark), the collision would result in something blindingly brilliant, the kind of movie that proved both actually had serious chops, though it would probably be a fluke. Unfortunately, and somewhat predictably, it was not to be.<br /><br />The Covenant is the deeply confusing, badly-paced, incredibly silly story of five modern-day kids who are descended from the five founding families of Ipswich, Massachusetts, where the Salem Witch Trials supposedly began. Four of the families survived the witch trials, and the scions of each clan are about to turn eighteen (and \\"ascend\\" into their full power). The de facto leader of the bunch is Caleb (Sky High's Steven Strait), who's on the verge of turning eighteen. Pogue (Snakes on a Plane's Taylor Kitsch) is his best friend. Opposite these two are Reid (Toby Hemingway, recently of Feast of Love) and his best friend Tyler (Chace Crawford of Gossip Girl fame). While their bonds run deep, Caleb and Reid are constantly at odds; Reid likes to use his power (for, yes, they're all witches) despite the fact that overuse of the power turns one into a withered husk, while Caleb counsels moderation. As they begin their senior year at an exclusive private high school, two disruptive forces enter the playing field: Sarah (Venom's Laura Ramsey), to whom Caleb immediately gravitates, and Chase (Red Doors' Sebastian Stan), whom Pogue suspects of moving in on Pogue's girl Kate (Cloverfield's Jessica Lucas), who also happens to be Sarah's roommate. To top it all off, there are a bunch of minor subplots running around in the first half of the film. Given all this, and me just touching the tip of the iceberg, is it any wonder the thirty-second TV spots made absolutely no sense?<br /><br />Watching the entire ninety-minute film doesn't make things much better. A little more time is taken to explain things, but not much. It doesn't help that it's obvious the film is setting up a straw man as the villain (for the real villain must be revealed later on, ha-HA!). This is forgivable, and handled well, of course, it can be an excellent plot device. The problem is it's not handled well at all; after the big reveal halfway through the film, the straw man simply disappears into thin air, never to be seen again. This is the case with a number of those minor subplots I mentioned when attempting to recount the labyrinthine first half of the script, as well; it seems the second half is the movie everyone here wanted to make, but they didn't have anything to set it up, so they grafted on another, more complex (and more interesting) script that no one would produce. Done right and extended correctly, the first half of this movie would have made an interesting thriller. Done right and extended correctly, the second half of this movie would have been a mightily enjoyable, brainless action flick (though the zooming-ball-of-water special effects should really have been thought through a little better). Squashed together, neither works. It doesn't help that most of the actors here are at best barely competent (it's ironic that Jessica Lucas, by far the most experienced actor here who gets more than a minute of screen time, is the most minor of the seven main characters). One wonders if others were approached beforehand, took one look at the script, and fled screaming in terror. *touching the tip of the iceberg, is it any wonder the thirty-second TV spots made absolutely no sense?

B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I am a personal long time fan of the series and had only had them all on vhs. the tapes were getting old and the sound was getting distorted, so I figured it was time to get them all on dvd. I never thought I could them for so cheap and all in the same case. Greatest dvd buy I probably ever have found so far.
B0000797IO|4.0|The Good Girl (Miguel Arteta, 2002)<br /><br />You know those movies where you laugh, but every time you do you feel guilty for doing so? Yeah, that's The Good Girl. Arteta (Chuck and Buck) starts this off as if it's going to be a light, breezy (if mean-spirited) comedy, but things just keep getting more and more tragic. The brilliance of the film is that the more tragic they get, the funnier the script becomes. There are quite a few ways in which this film puts me in mind of Very Bad Things, and I mean that in the best of ways.<br /><br />The story: Justine Last (Jennifer Aniston) is stuck. She's in a dead-end job, her husband (John C. Reilly) is a house painter with a serious dope habit and a bonehead for a best friend (Tim Blake Nelson), her own best friend (Deborah Rush) is about as deep as a pothole. Is this all there is to life? Enter Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal), a new cashier at her place of business, who feels the trials and tribulations of late adolescence just as Justine feels the trials and tribulations of adulthood, and the two of them strike up a friendship. Complications, as they say, ensue. And as it is in the movies, once complications ensue, everything that can go wrong does at the earliest possible opportunity.<br /><br />This could have played out as a Lifetime Original Movie melodrama, but Arteta keeps his eyes on the prize-- making the viewer laugh, and making the viewer feel guilty about laughing. Aniston and Gyllenhaal both play their roles perfectly straight while everyone else around them plays for laughs, which only adds to the uncomfortable hilarity.<br /><br />The more I think about it, the more impressed I am with this movie. Good stuff. ****
0767817478|3.0|Regardless of what you might have heard, 1998's Godzilla is a pretty decent remake of the original.<br /><br />I had seen the movie in its' original release and remembered having a negative opinion, but couldn't remember the details. I recently found the DVD on the cheap and decided to give it a second chance.<br /><br />Watching the giant iguana Godzilla tear through rainy New York was a lot of fun. The CGI didn't bother me and Godzilla's new look wasn't bad. (Not as good as the Japanese one though!) I started to wonder why this movie didn't do better and if maybe I was too critical. Then about 90 minutes in, Dean and Roland lose track of the story (they are listed as contributors to the screen play, so I feel it's fair to blame them).<br /><br />The movie suddenly stops focusing on Godzilla and switches to Madison Square Garden where a bunch of mini-Zillas hatch and chase the cast around. This drags on for a half an hour. Hank Azaria's part in the movie suddenly becomes too big and you realize that Steven Spielberg has directed a MUCH better version of this same set-up in [[ASIN:B00003CXAT Jurassic Park]]. This movie starts to become waterlogged.<br /><br />Once the main characters escape and Godzilla starts running around again, the movie picks up, but at that point my fiance and I were already yawning.<br /><br />If you like the idea of big monsters stomping cities, I'd still recommend this one.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|This is an unfortunate day where \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" takes on a new level of sadness with the death of Heath Ledger.  While Ledger's performance is superb, I believe he merely scratched the surface of his talent here.    I wish Heath Ledger could have gone on to make more movies where he could explore the emotional depths as he did in this film.  It is sad for us we'll never know.    I don't have many modern favorite films, actually most of the films coming out today are such brain-fodder, in my opinion, I don't feel they're worth the time to sit through them.  However; \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is one of my favorite films.  I saw it twice in the theatre and bought the DVD the first day it came out.  Even when I'm channel surfing on TV and I see \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" listed on the on-screen cable guide, I usually end up going to that channel and then watch the rest of the movie from whereever I happen to come in on.    Rest Peacefully, Heath, and Thank You.
B000FVRACK|5.0|This is one, very special DVD on virtually every level.  It should go without saying that the performance of Rubinstein is superb, and considering he was 89 when this film was made makes it even more extraordinary.  His performance, however, is even further enhanced by the great camera and sound work.  The camera does a fine job of giving the viewer a pleasing and interesting mix of views of the orchestra, Rubinstein's body movements and facial expressions, and most importantly, his hands.  In short, this is a must DVD for anyone who is a fan of Artur Rubinstein.      In addition to the great performance, the interview with Rubinstein is very interesting and revealing.  In spite of his great talent, artistry, celebrity and fame, yet he seemed a quite humble and unassuming person.          You can't go wrong with this DVD!!!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Great price, fast shipping. Has all the No. 1 Hits on this CD. Highly recommend this great album to anyone who loves the Beatles.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Honestly, this movie is the funniest movie I have seen in AGES. I'm glad to see some movies have still got it.
B000002VCU|5.0|I have considered this by far the best album they recorded.  Not to say their others were bad, but this one has a certain quality of it's own.  I have always connected with this album more so than the others.  It doesn't have alot of the eighties hype in it.  This album is more serious whereas the others are more playful.  If you listen to the samples you will see what I mean.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVORITE JULIE ANDREWS MOVIES. SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE, A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR, AND A WONDERFUL DISPOSITION. THE ENTIRE CAST IS TERRIFIC!! I BELIEVE THIS WELL BE A CLASSIC FOREVER!!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you didn't see this film on the big screen, you missed a great event. Being a Beatles fan since I first saw them appear on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, few things are as great as the real thing. But, this rendition of their incredible music surrounded with the mood of the late 1960s goes beyond your imagination. The performances are refreshing (they don't try to sound like the Beatles) and are on a high level. Some of the songs even take on a meaning you could have never thought was possible. The visuals combine 60s psychedelic with the innocence that once was. Everyone I went to see this film with loved it. Some even felt it was the greatest musical they ever saw. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. I can't wait to own it and watch it whenever I need an emotional Beatles boost.
B0000793Z9|5.0|Dazzled by the iridescence of 'Glittering Prize', this startled reviewer could easily be duped into thinking that the rest of 'New Gold Dream' would come hurtling apologetically in on its shirt-tails.<br />It is SUCH a good song, all glammed up and sinewy, with a killer ethereal chorus, Jim Kerr's deep echoey vocal sending a chill down even the most resistant spine.<br />But one swallow doesn't make a summer, and it's a big ask of anyone to come up with a whole album which can stand eye-to-eye with its wistful, beautiful offspring.<br />Fortunately, 'NGD' does.<br /><br />It's superb.<br />Nine exceptional songs, cosseted in a thick, viscous, production that allows them complete freedom to move into your consciousness and lurk there, long after you've finished listening.<br /><br />On the first few hearings it sounds like our sad ole friend 'Stad-Rock' is rearing it's artless and pointless head again, but patience is giver of lasting reward; perseverance reveals all kinds of depth and nuance in the music, certainly above and beyond the highly polished veneer.<br /><br />'Prize' itself is tucked away in a corner, but this of course only goes to heighten it's glory. The non-trumpeting of this neo-classic, in a way, sums up the recklessly brilliant core of 'NGD'<br /><br />It sounds so effortless, you get the feeling they just knocked it together in a few hours - that the ideas came thick and fast one rainy Scottish afternoon (there is no other kind). The deep, fluid melodies broke through, bathed in some kind of artistic Borealis half-light, as the Simples lounged around a trendy caf&eacute;, smoking ciggies and quaffing expensive lager.<br /><br />It even has, right at it's heart (shock! horror!), that contradiction in terms, that elusive rock leper - the (gasp!) interesting instrumental! Honest! Right in the middle!<br /><br />As if the shock of that wasn't enough, the following title track cranks the excellence quota up to another level again. It's one of a series of songs here, blessed with some kind of innate grace, a tight, whirling elan. They expand, draw you in rather than drag you.<br /><br />The more you listen to 'NGD`, the more you realise the little grain of good taste you thought it was, has become a mountain of good sense, and you'll know in your heart of hearts, it's what you (we!?) NEED.<br /><br />Good songs, intelligently presented, is always a winning proposition, and coming after TWO previous storming albums, 'Reel to Real  Cacophany' and 'Sons and Fascination' this is a peak of peaks in SM's ascendancy. Unfortunately the next album 'Sparkle in the Rain' was the beginning of the sad (but utterly unavoidable) decline.<br /><br />Enjoy this one, a stunning album by a group at the absolute apex of its powers.

B000TSIK14|5.0|the best album by scorpions since \\"Love Drive \\"and \\"love at first sting \\"  this album is very well balanced, strong ballads like \\" your last song & love is war \\" and head banging tunes like \\"321\\" and \\"games of life \\" by the way, this one reminds me \\" rock you like a hurricane \\"  can´t leave out the best ballad of the CD \\" Love will keep us alive \\" extremely melodic song with a perfect acustic guitar performance.    Every penny you pay for it is worthwhile, no doubt, five stars for this CD.
0810994739|5.0|\\"Rodrick Rules\\" follows the blueprint of its predecessor, while delivering more humor and insight into the characters. The story follows Greg Heffley through summer vacation and into another school year. Greg's brother, the titular Rodrick, is just barely hanging on in high school and would rather be rocking out with his band Loded Diper. All the while Greg's mom and dad try their earnest best to encourage their sons down the straight and sensible path.    Probably the first thing everyone wants to know is if \\"Rodrick Rules\\" is as funny as the original. This is a hard thing to judge. All I know is, I was laughing out loud on multiple occasions. When Greg's mom introduces a new rewards plan to get her sons to help out around the house, I was bleary-eyed (I'm cracking a smile even as I write this). When Greg explains what happened to Rodrick's sophomore class picture, I was rolling. I would say more, but I don't want to give anything away. This is a story that people want to read and love.    Can I speak for just a moment about the popularity of these books? Now is a good time to humor me and pretend you don't already know. I help out with four elementary school book fairs per year, and \\"Wimpy Kid\\" has been selling like elephant ears at all of `em. If you're from other parts of the country where they don't have elephant ears, just know that they are delicious and are purchased frequently.    \\"Rodrick Rules\\" will not disappoint fans of \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\". In fact, it will probably bring a lot more readers on board. They'll be curious about why you're laughing so much.
B000BT97AO|4.0|Mirrormask plunges the viewer into a uniquely surreal world where the unexpected flies from the screen moment after moment. The strange images and photography tricks may wear on some viewers, but overall, this is a fascinating and new fantasy world the film-makers have created. My daughter and her friends (teenagers in 14-15 age range) especially seem to enjoy it, so this film may make for a good gift for that age range.

B000O78GNM|5.0|Hey, I just want to say to a majority of you all that I feel VERY sorry for you, especially those who live in America who are confused and have SO many Deluxe editions listed!  In my country (NZ), we originally had the 11 track CD, but early 2007 THE Deluxe Edition came out - fortunately they released only ONE official Deluxe Edition here.  IMO, after looking at ALL the B'Day's listed here, I've come to conclude that THIS is the BEST B'Day of the whole lot.  If you cut and paste this following number barcode/EAN number 0886970912525 and enter it into the search (I work in a book store - ISBN and EAN codes are VERY important in differentiating editions with same title!), you will will be able to see the best B'Day Deluxe of the lot... which is basically the version that I have listed my review for.  In my country it was very inexpensive and readily available in abundance - I got mine for NZ$22.99 (the regular price - which should be something like US$16).  This version is a 2-disc set: the 19-track CD WITH the 12-track DVD edition.  The DVD is ALL REGION so ALL DVD players should play this and is NTSC encoded so Americans should have a ball with this!  Though be-lated in posting this, I thought that it would be good to educate those who still don't know.  DON'T contend with just a 11 track album or one that has '2 bonus tracks' or the one with Spanish songs on bonus disc (unless that's what you're into)... the list just goes on!!!!  Oh if only I had all the money in the world I would relieve you all of your B'Day problems and buy you all copies of 0886970912525 to diffuse the confusion!  If it's cheap enough BUY THIS particular edition, but it MUST be this 0886970912525 edition set with the 19-track CD and the 12-track DVD!!!  I just love it so much!  Just look at the CD and DVD track listing for this 0886970912525 and you will know WHY it is THE version with the most-est of the whole B'Day lot! If you don't already have B'Day but want to get it, THIS version is THEBEST of the B'Day's!  If you're buying second hand BEWARE - stress to the seller that it's the 19-track CD & 12-track DVD set you want and nothing less!  If it's too expensive overseas, move to New Zealand!  We don't have poisonous snakes here so that's extra incentive!
B000AADYYO|5.0|Okay, after reading some of these reviews I decided to add my own two cents.  Allow me to be the bad guy for a moment as I defend the reviewers who have claimed to love this album despite the 'barking' or extreme vocals.  Let me state that I have no problem with said vocal style, and have grown to appreciate it as much as singing, but I do not need it to enjoy music.  I can listen to Emperor's Anthems just as easily as Radiohead's OK Computer    It was not that long ago that I would have said the same thing, probably no less than five years time.  Ten years ago, being a teen with typical angst, I held bands such as Korn and Nirvana very dear to my heart, and while I still appreciate the early work of Korn and Nirvana, I grew out of that phase of my life long ago, but I digress.    It was not until my family experienced a particularly tragic event which I will not presently discuss that I began to turn from more mainstream 'metal' to the darker realms which I now frequent.  I suppose each person has thier own individual reasons for why they listen to one form of music or another, but suffice it say that said event was enough to open my ears to a sound which I had previously ignored and/or rejected.  This was not even a conscious decision but a realization I have recently made as I re-examined my mindset and the factors which contributed to that mindset.  Again, I digress.    As I began to desire heavier and darker sounds, this bands' name began dropping left and right in discussions until it became a proverbial avalanche, which prompted me to purchase this album nearly on year ago.  After taking time to digest it and finding with much joy that it was excellent beyond all words, I began working backwards through their catalogue up to Orchid, which was their last album I purchased (aside from Still Life which proved to be difficult to find anywhere but online).  Each album surprised and challenged my preconceptions of what this band was from the previous, and each holds a very special place in my music collection.    And that is my point.  I understand why longtime fans would be upset about a band becoming more 'commercial' or signing to a label like Roadrunner, which is about as far from what Opeth has always been as you can get, but if it has brought more fans to the band and has made more people curious enough to check the band's back catalogue and not only give them their due attention but grow to enjoy them just as much as this, what is the harm?  I say that knowing my stance may be the exception and not the rule as many will honestly believe that this is the only album the band has released, but that is not the band's fault, rather it is the stupidity and narrow-mindedness of the listener.    Besides, what if this is really where the band wanted to go?  They would never have worked with Steve Wilson had they not wanted to do so, and they would not have signed with Roadrunner unless there is a good reason, and if you read the Biography section of Opeth's page, Akerfeldt states very plainly that it bothered him to hear fans say that they had trouble finding the albums.  As an artist, you obviously desire to sell your product, not necessarily to make money but to deliver a message or to connect with your listeners, to know the work you created has meant something to their lives.  Unfortunately, due to the way the media and corporate retailers work in this country, the only way to make that connection is to sign with a label that, while you may not like their current roster much, will do a much better job distributing your album.  One more fact, before I digress again: It is not like Roadrunner has always been a nu-metal haven.    As I alluded to earlier, each of Opeth's albums have meant a great deal to me.  Orchid continues to be my least favorite, and I'm sure some will eat me alive for saying so, but I feel they did not hit their stride until Morningrise.  But then again, what do I know?    Since this is a review, I supposeI ought to talk about the album a bit, huh?  Well, it took me some time, but after about 3-5 listens it began growing on me like very few albums ever had before.  It offers a superb mix of 'death' style vocals with gentle clean singing, furious rifs and some of the best solos you are likely to hear in metal mixed with light acoustic passages that break up the heavier sections at all the right times such that they feel organic to the song itself, as if they were meant to exist in that spot.  I found Still Life (which was the last album I purchased) to be quite similar, heavy but nowhere near MAYH or Deliverance, with some of the best singing in today's metal scene.    Finally, allow me to speak to one more subject: the heaviness of this album or the purported lack thereof.  Trust me, people who really dislike any kind of screaming/yelling/growling in vocals are not going to like this as much as those who find it appealing.  I play this and all other Opeth albums at work, and I cannot even begin to tell you how many dirty looks and off-color comments I get about the vocals, everything from calling it 'devil music' to awful music, disgusting, etc. etc. etc.  My point is that if you really do not like that style, Opeth, no matter what label they sign with and no matter how proggy they get, will not change their minds just because they throw in some acoustic guitars and clean singing here and there.  Once the more extreme vocals kick in they are turned off completely and there is no rescuing them.    In closing, if you like intelligent, complex, brutal but yet beautiful metal then check out this AND ALL OTHER OPETH ALBUMS.
0767020308|5.0|I love Jane Austen. I've rarely seen an interpretation of her work that I didn't especially like.  (Sadly the recent feature film \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with Keira Knightley most certainly tops that list.)    As for \\"Emma\\"...while the feature film with Gwyneth Paltrow was gorgeous and as a whole well done, Beckinsale's version simply rings truer.  Also a gorgeous and well done production it's a more faithful rendering of Austen's book.  If you have to choose, this A&E offering is really your best bet.

B000002GQE|4.0|This may still be, of all their albums, the best in terms of sheer melodic line and lush orchestration, plus timeless subjects not the dated subjects of subsequent albums.  This is a very nice album by the famous group.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I got it for ~$30. Since I found this series quite and entertaining sci-fi story, it worth the money (though it is not the best sci-fi ever).
0440238609|5.0|After seeing the movie, I ordered the books from Amazon will all due speed. I was not disappointed. The books, of course, expand and deepen the movie, which I loved. The supposed antireligious bias is fair, but the books are anti-intolerance and anti-groupthink more than being simply anti religion. Wonderful, interesting characters, a world I could get into (I'm not a big fantasy fan), and a plot that moves right along.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Excitement from start to finish. The audio and video were exceptional. These guys can still provide the harmony and musical ability we've come to expect. This is a great investment and a must have for all Eagles fans.
B0007IN318|5.0|\\"Pompeii\\" is a first hand account of the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 AD by the engineer in charge of the aqueduct serving the resort towns on the bay of Naples.  Anyone interested in adventure or history will be caught up in the drama as people try to deal with an event new to them all.
0143038419|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. The author is an engaging storyteller, and her ability to be authentically flawed and find the humor in herself and in others made for a wonderful journey. I felt like I was losing a friend when it ended. I agree with others here who are a little mystified at the negativity of some reviews -- perhaps those are from envious people who never put it all on the line in their younger days to travel and see what life will bring. The book is spiritual in the Zen sense of \\"Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment...\\" Awesome read.
B000002GQG|3.0|This album by the Moodies is a bit dated what with its references to Timothy Leary and so on.  Very current at the time but not now.  A different world today, unfortunately.  However, that said, the usual Moody Blues attention to engineering sound, good melodic lines, and so on.
0525950079|3.0|...before i finished the book!  Let me start by saying Follett is one of my favorite authors.  I loved Pillars of the Earth, A Place Called Freedom, but especially all the older WWII espionage novels.  But I digress.  This book was just okay.  It read more like a soap opera than his usual books.  There were some parts that were really good, but for the most part, I found it a bit long winded.  It was also kind of predictable.  Right when something is about to work out for the best, something bad happens!  Can you believe it!  Oh well, it is still worth reading, just don't get your hopes up.<br /><br />Peace.
6305736650|5.0|This is truly one of the best films ever made! I had always meant to see this one, finally go around to it, rented it and loved it!! I have now bought it and have to say that this really is a classic, and it can stand with, and against, movies of today.
0790729628|5.0|(the review below was originally written on Yahoo! movies on Apr 17th, 2005)    I came to know about this movie from the track 'Love theme' (by Vangelis) that I randomly heard on an internet radio station not too long ago. It was a really great composition and made me interested in the movie. I read some reviews on imdb and almost all of them were very positive. So when I got hold of the Director's Cut DVD yesterday and started watching, my expectations were pretty high. In most of my past experiences in such cases, I hadn't been totally satisfied at the end. But surprisingly, that wasn't the case with this movie. It's amazing.. surely one of the best movies ever made. It's a sci-fi, but obviously not one of those movies that don't go beyond laser gun firing and strange looking creatures. It has a very touching human side to it, something which most movies of this genre lack. It is most definitely a cult movie and a milestone in the art of movie making.    I'm particularly impressed by the direction. Ridley Scott did such an excellent job of portraying a future LA. Nothing seems far-fetched, rather I can't help but wonder about how immaculate his vision was even about twenty five years ago. The movie is dark, bleak and atmospheric. All the main characters are depicted beautifully. Their inner conflicts, vulnerability, pride, fear, love, hatred - seems like a canvas painted with human emotions. Not often do we find such depth in character development, especially in sci-fi's. It's not just a movie, it's more like a poetry in motion. Who can forget that quote of Roy before he dies: \\"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.\\" And the music by Vangelis is exquisite.    This is most probably my favorite movie of all time. Definitely a masterpiece, in all sense of the term. A movie much ahead of itstime..
B000YA82F6|5.0|I'll buy DVDs of this movie as donations to Planned Parenthood chapters. I loved this movie. Juno and her significant others deal with a problem that is far too common among adolescents today. Juno's parents are models for their supportive roles. The movie should be required viewing for every adolescent girl and boy and for every parent of an adolescent. The film is relatively short - around 90 minutes long - and should stimulate spirited discussion among adolescents and their parents.

B00006D295|5.0|For me to rate this movie anyone and everyone who reads this needs to keep in mind that I hate, HATE, musicals (I would rather have my teeth drilled with an old rusty spoon, than watch movies like Greese, Oklahoma or A Sound of Music!), but this movie was so funny and so downright WEIRD! It is so odd and funny, so goofy and weird, and if you like Susan Sarandon like I do, seeing her in her undies is great, and seeing Tim Curry (who is a great actor!!) dressed as a weird, vampire alien monster murderer woman--ish thing is so darn funny, watching this movie for that alone is worth it!!! I would compare this to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas with Johnny Depp and it is worth seeing at least once just for the humor and weirdness!
B00005QW5X|4.0|Wow.  I would have delighted in seeing John Cameron Mitchell's off Broadway rendition of this unique story of a glam rock star with a less than normal origin.  All of the songs are \\"sing-along\\" worthy and delivered in the classic glam rock style.  This is a sad story of a gay young man, victim of a botched sex change operation, desperately searching for someone to love him for who he is, rather than who he aspires to be.  It's not particularly a happy ending, although perhaps an ending where Hedwig finally comes to terms with his / her lot in life.  It is unique, refreshing, fascinating, and as bizarre as the story line is, has all of the pathos that make Hedwig an endearing character.
B00005O3VD|5.0|When Barbra Streisand reprised her role as Fanny Brice in the movie version of Funny Girl, her stardom was cemented.  Not only was it a huge hit, but it was loved by audiences, has gone on to be one of her most adored performances, and made her an Academy Award winning actress.  Through it all, she deserved every bit of it.    The movie tells a loosely-told story of famous vaudeville star Fanny Brice, and how she struggled for fame and finding the man she loves in the first half, and the second half goes more dramatic, telling how her true love, Nicky Arnstein, threatens to drag her down with him as he digs deeper and deeper into gambling debt and corrupt behavior.  The story, if you really pay attention to it, is not terribly deep or original, and in the middle switches from a rags-to-riches/beating the odds in show business story to a more dramatic star-crossed lovers story.  But even so , with likeable characters like Fanny, Nicky, Mr. Ziegfeld, and so on, you cannot help but feel involved in their ordeals.    The performances here are all top notch.  Omar Sharif brings a perfect amount of charm and shadiness to Nicky, and Walter Pidgeon is delightfully smug and caring as Florenz Ziegfeld.  But the performance to watch, without a doubt, is Barbra Streisand as Fanny.  She not only balances her comic and dramatic abilities beautifully, but makes us really like Fanny as a friend.  She is confident, naive, happy-go-lucky, and vulnerable all at once.  She deserved the Oscar more than anyone else that night, and she got it.    Last, but not least, the songs are just magnificent.  Almost exclusively sung by Barbra, she is perfectly at home singing all of them, and succeeds in most.  She's fun in \\"I'm The Greatest Star,\\" radiantly sexy in \\"I'd Rather Be Blue Over You,\\" tearjerking in \\"People,\\" and, of course, her bravura performance of \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" (the scene with the tugboat will give you shivers the same way Julie Andrews' scene on the hill does in Sound of Music).  Some songs are good, and some songs are great, but no song is mediocre.    I could go on and on, but I want those who haven't discovered the movie yet to find out on their own.  Barbra's fans will worship it, fans of musicals will love it, and even those who don't care for either musicals or Barbra Streisand will smile at least a few times.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't waste another second.

It's the best and most genuine musical I have ever seen.  You won't regret seeing it unless you're a total dork.
B00006AVRK|5.0|When I don't know much about a show, I base my purchase on the reviews of purchasers.  We love British comedies, and we decided to give Jeeves and Wooster a whirl, based on the high opinion of just about everyone who has watched the show.  What a treat.  From the first show, it is a riot.  Excellent scripting (which I guess we owe to the original author of the stories, Mr. Wodehouse), great casting, and just superb performances...one after the other.  If you appreciate that \\"pithy\\", snobby humor that the British seem to have an exclusive license for, this show is for you.  Goofy aristocrat (Wooster) hires, and is guided and sheltered through life by his valet (Jeeves); through one personal disaster after the other.  This one is worth every cent of the price.  Excellent sound and picture quality.  Nothing to complain about in any aspect.  We loved it - you will too !

B00000G3AZ|5.0|Rich dialogue and an outstanding cast in this fun movie that has a sweet conclusion.  Paltrow does outstanding work.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I'd like to think I'm more objective than many people about this movie.  Gay-oriented material doesn't offend me, yet I laughed at all the jokes made about this movie when it came out (NO PUN INTENDED!).  I bought it after the '05 Oscar noms were announced, but didn't open it for two years.  The right mood never seemed to hit me:  \\"what to watch...Comedy?  Horror?  Action?  Kissing Cowboys?\\"  I finally watched it after I heard about Heath Ledger's tragic, accidental overdose.    It's a good movie, a little slow in parts, but with some deeply moving scenes.  Unless they are seeing something I missed, reviewers who whine about naked men romping all over the place are simply lying for their own reasons.  As I recall, the only nudity in sexual situations is that of female characters; Ledger's character's buttocks (and I guess, therefore, Ledger's) are in the background of one scene--he's bathing, with Gyllenhaal's character (deliberately?) NOT looking.  The guys actually do a bit of romping (I should look that word up) in one scene and in another, jump nude into a lake, but are shown from too far a distance to either delight or disgust anyone.  I assume.    Unlike some of my friends, I don't agree that \\"Brokeback\\" is all that \\"romantic.\\"  Although some scenes make clear that Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are happier and more relaxed with each other than they are anywhere else, more often they're fighting, usually over Ennis' refusal to commit to a full-time relationship.  Another reviewer smartly referenced \\"Same Time, Next Year\\" though in a (way) more negative way.       I also have trouble seeing how anyone could consider \\"romantic\\" the first time Ennis and Jack...are intimate.  I didn't notice any signs of attraction between them before they suddenly had at it.  They didn't seem very happy about it all, which began abruptly (not necessarily a bad thing), but they seemed almost hostile, with no talk and a little confusion (mostly on Ennis' part).  Oh, andmuch grunting.  The scene, by the way, involved no nudity.  OK, so I looked away a little.  There was at most a little of the top of Gyllenhaal's buttocks.  From some of these other reviews, you'd think these guys spent two hours swinging from chandeliers.      I also felt the wives' points of view were underrepresented.  It's not clear Anne Hathaway's Lureen ever figured it all out, though her sad transformation from feisty to frosty suggests she did.  Michelle Williams' Alma found out early, though she didn't confront Ennis until much later.  I found that believable because I've known couples to ignore even the biggest pink (or white, they could be white) elephants to avoid the bigger trauma of breaking up.    The scene that convinced me this movie was a keeper and not a disappointment involved Jack's first visit with Ennis since THAT summer.  About four years had passed and both had married.  Ennis compulsively flicks his lighter, pathetically waiting by the window.  Alma prepares to tolerate a dull night of ranching stories over dinner somewhere.  Jack finally shows, Ennis runs out to him and kisses him like Jack was rescuing him from a burning building.  (Not that everyone would thank a fireman that way, of course.)  Alma sees, and Williams' shock/disbelief in those moments earned her the Oscar nom right there.  Ennis makes a lame excuse to run out with Jack. Alma, still holding her purse to got out, is heartbreakingly left in her kitchen to try and make sense of what the hell she just saw.  The scene established that that it was Ledger's character (relatively more \\"straight-acting\\"), not Gyllenhaal's (more \\"sensitive\\"), that was more desperate for the relationship.  At the same time, we feel Alma's emotional abaondoment (though she stayed with underachieving, increasingly-detached Ennis for years afterwards).    It's not post-tragedy hyperbole to say that Ledger's is the best of an excellent group of performances.  At first, he's the stereotypical \\"Marlboro Man\\", but the facade keeps cracking, first with Gyllenhaal, then in the big fight with Williams, and finally when alone.  Of course, Ledger didn't even sound like the Marlboro Man in \\"real life\\" (i.e., Australian accent).      I wish more (anyone?) had written about whether Lureen's description of events in her phone call with Ennis, or what seemed to be Ennis' vision during that call, was what \\"really\\" happened.  My cousin insists Lureen was hiding the truth to save face.  I don't think this should have been left to conjecture, because if Ennis' vision was correct, his decision to avoid committing to Jack becomes at least partially vindicated.     It's wrong to trash this movie over its gay content.  I wonder if that superficial reaction prodded some of the movie's fans to consider \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" an Oscar-caliber epic when I'm not sure that's the case.  I think it's excellent, am fairly certain it deserved to be nominated (but not to win*), and admire (exceptions noted above) the way it deals with a traumatic situation that happens much more often than is acknowledged (think of the Hollywood hunks that were married to gorgeous ladies but \\"came out\\" later in life).  I'm just not sure this is an all-time classic.  But definitely a must-see for Heath Ledger fans and for the acting all around.    *After the Oscars, I did a long review of why \\"Crash\\" DID deserve to win.  Amazon readers were unimpressed by a current vote of 11 to 4.  Well, at least 15 people read that one...now to review \\"Capote\\", \\"Good Night and Good Luck\\", and \\"Munich\\" so I can get slammed three more times...
B000YIGNKE|1.0|I think the title explains pretty well my beef with this adaptation.  Anne is a young lady of quiet moral strength (although admitedly not a great walker, hence Wentworth's assistance into the Crofts' carriage).  This adaptation portrays Anne as this weepy, wispy pathetic creature, not the good, kind, loving and patient Anne I know and love from Austen's book.  Not to mention the inconsistencies - Anne can fly about the house at Kellynch in the hustle and bustle of having move but can't endure a country walk and completely out of character run around Bath after the Captain.  The last ten-fifteen minutes were acutely painful.      My personal rule number one when doing a Jane Austen adaptation is do not, I repeat DO NOT mess with the declaration of love.  As long as that part is correct I can forgive many changes from the book, but don't change the declaration.  Unfortunately the writers of this version did not adhere to my Austen adaptation maxim and consequently marred Austen's lovely ending horrifically and for that this adaptation earns only one star.  I love the scene in the book where Anne talks with Capt. Harville at the window and Wentworth pours out his heart in a letter and leaves it for her to read.  It would have changed the timing very little of this adaptation had they done the ending properly and would have earned it a much higher rating from me.  If you're an Austen purest (want the movie to adhere strictly to the book) I suggest the 1971 version from the BBC (it originally aired as a miniseries so you may find it listed as such).  It is long but satisfyingly accurate especially with the declaration.  For a shorter but still good adaptation try the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds.  It condenses the book a good deal, but still maintains the essentials and doesn't mess with the declaration except for adding a kiss that they wouldn't have done in Austen's time (a forgivable addition in my book).

192076920X|5.0|I am an Indian currently live away from India. I have read this book half way and I'm in love with my country. The book captures the wonderful values of the Indian culture which I took forgranted all my life. It's very interesting to read about a foreigner's experience in India. It's ironical I've never felt more love and patriotism for my country than I did when I starting reading this book written by a non Indian.     The books not only talks well about the Indian values and culture but also exposes the readers to all kinds of life in Bombay. The mafia, slum life, people market(heart wrenching form of child labor), standing babas(principles completely repugnanct to reason), bhakshis(bribe) - such dark aspects of life to which common people in India woudn't be exposed to. Every Indian knows what a slum is, but not many know how exactly people live there.     The book is set at a fast pace with intriguing facts and experiences and the author's own analyzation of his past life, his buried emotions and his transformation... it's hard to stop reading it!
B000274THQ|4.0|Although marketed as an all-out comedy, Goodbye, Lenin! is in many ways more of a feelgood tragicomedy about the nature of lies rather than a laugh-a-minute sidesplitter. Certainly the premise has all the makings of farce as East German Daniel Bruhle has to go to increasingly desperate lengths to keep the news that communism and the Berlin Wall have both fallen from his Party activist mother when she emerges from a coma for fear the shock will cause a fatal heart attack. Since the pace of change to Western values and fashions has been so rapid that means finding their apartment's long discarded drab furniture, seeking out now discontinued East German brands of pickles and coffee and even faking DDR news reports with his fellow satellite TV installer as he tries to recreate the old East Germany within the borders of his mother's bedroom (not so easy with Coca Cola setting up shop just across the road), in the process gradually creating the more reasonable DDR he wished had existed. The laughs are there but less frequent than you'd expect, and often underlined with the sadness of a country suddenly forced to confront years of deprivation and betrayal: his sister's revelation of the first words their long-absent father spoke to her is initially funny but genuinely tragic on reflection, and the film manages to pull off both reactions without over-milking them. Nor does it sugar-coat the ending, opting for something rather more affecting than a simple Happy Ever After. Chalk up another quiet winner for the 21st Century German film industry Renaissance.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This is the best season of them all,alot of people say that the first few episodes kinda suck but they were just as good as the rest. i got mine at walmart and it came with a extra disk. And people keep sayin that the disks don't       have numbers on them but they do and it comes with the booklet thing. So.......... i don't really know where you guys are geting yours but it should have that stuff. Over all season three is really really good and i can't wait for season four to come on!

0321525655|5.0|I have had a weathered copy of Khalil Gibran's The Prophet for over 20 years.  I don't even know where I got it, but it has followed me through many moves and survived multiple garage sales.  I read it often.<br /><br />Presentation Zen is that kind of book.  Everything about it feels good.  It looks beautiful.  It is clearly written and engaging.  Just the other day I was asked to give a talk, and I picked it up and turned to the section on preparation.  It told me exactly what I needed to do and changed my mood from worried about what I was going to present to excited about sharing a simple, strong and meaningful message with my audience.<br /><br />Consulting in Silicon Valley for many years, I saw some pretty awful PowerPoint slides. I even started a collection which I deemed \\"The Gallery of Horror\\" because they were so glaringly hideous that they were comical.<br /><br />Sure, some were bad because of the color choice, or terrible charts, or 30 8-point bullets on one slide.  But the one thing they all shared that made them so punishing is that they had zero regard for the audience.  If the person who created them had spent one second thinking \\"I wonder what my audience is truly interested in hearing about today?\\" and not \\"How am I going to jam all of my ideas onto this one slide?\\", they never would have seen the light of the projector.<br /><br />Thank God Garr spent his time and energy on this book.  Just maybe it will gather enough weight and credibility as it climbs the bestseller charts to push back the tidal wave of pressure to spew information rather than gently converse.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is the new \\"Abbey Road\\" --you have to see the cover--just an amazing synthesis of the Beatles and the U.S., the classic Beatles and the modern.     [[ASIN:B000ZRMCRM Greetings From Lafayette Park]]    I have discovered it, and as a long-time Beatles fan, I can't stop listening.     The songs! Like Abbey Road or The White Album, each song stands on its own.  Listen to \\"Dirty Life\\", with the Lennonesque wisdom, wry wit, insight and understanding; \\"The Cost\\", a ballad that sweeps me into a \\"Long and Winding Road\\" that is rich, powerful, evocative--gorgeous piano and a beautifully mastered string ensemble that reaches into the mind and heart to the last trails of the echo and strings--Beatles, yet something also altogether new;  \\"I'd Rather Close My Eyes\\" a soaring and definitive statement of that searing moment when we turn from love--when Lipman hits the final note, a soaring, incredibly powerful and amazing long high C,--it is one of those moments, like \\"Let it Be\\", in which music, lyrics, melody and emotion meld with unforgettable resonance.     \\"Dirty Little Secret\\" with its solo guitar, haunting lyrics, and its \\"secrets\\", captures the beauty and poignancy of \\"Yesterday\\", while adding the Lennon's cleared eyed truth ala \\"Norwegian Wood\\". Listen to the Revolver-like classical string section of \\"She Didn't Know What She Saw\\" counterposed with the sublime \\"Motorcycle Interstitial\\"; the full-out orchestral creativity of \\"A Physical Thing\\"--the track adds carillion, wedding bells, stereo-sweeping subway chimes-and barking dogs!-- set against a beautifully orchestrated full string section, which rises, like \\"A Day in the Life: or \\"All You Need is Love\\", to an incredible orchestral crescendo of every orchestral sound--just incredible--new, classical, integrated, brilliant.    The lyrics are rich with complexity and deep, multiple meanings.  Listen to the wry wisdom of \\"Dirty Life\\", this knowing, ironic perspective on life--and the changes we see in ourselves and others--combining Dylanesque insight and McCartney lyricism, the lyrics then transcending into the wit, insight and wordplay/worldplay in it its Lennonesque bridge; \\"Beholden\\", a strikingly unique song, complete with wind and far off radio signals, as a story is told of the sweeping course of chaos, and escape; \\"More and More Like A Civil War\\"--in its strong, sharp, wise and clear eyed commentary on today's wars on the battlefield and amongst ourselves, a modern \\"Revolution\\"--and the remarkable, ethereal \\"The Joke\\", which portrays the eternal position of vulnerable lovers, with a stunning shift to a universal perspective that is both wry yet tender in its understanding of the human plight--the beauty of McCartney in its musical richness, and true Lennon in its honest, clear-sighted yet truly compassionate and understanding view of love.      This album creates a world like nothing I have heard since Abbey--each time I listen I find something new. The cover is truly apt: it indeed is a \\"crossing\\"--a bridge--from that album to a new world. Truly an original. This is the most original, thrilling, passionate and intelligent album that I have heard this year.

B000002LRX|5.0|Ever????  Yes ever at least in my generation.  Angel dust plays like a pop/punk/rap/funk/metal musical for dimented dissaffected (former)youth like myself.  It never caught on and was way ahead of it's time.  Mike Pattons vocal influence can still be felt and heard sprinkled all over the pop landscape:Papa Roach, Incubus, Korn, to name a few.<br />  The reason they eluded any more pop success was simple.  Maybe too much fusion!!!!  The general public sadly wants to know what kind of band or artist they're listening to and after they hear one song they expect you to sound exactly like that one song.  I would play \\"angel dust\\" at work and people would be befuddled to find out three songs later that we were listening to the same album.<br />  Needless to say this a very diverse album.  Sometimes the songs themselves have several different genre's in them.  Even as challenging as the album is it still manages to balance a dimented pop sensibility to a lot of the songs.  That sensibility was an achilles heel to a lot of hardcore mr.bungle fans but I thought it elevated FNM above the \\"look how weird we can get\\" antics of mr.bungle.  Even really weird music has to have \\"hooks\\" in it as in the evidence of the the Godfather's(Frank Zappa)work.<br />  If you like being challenged musically and already like other musical misfits(Zappa,Fishbone,Primus) than this might be right up your alley. Otherwise stay the hell a way!!!!!!!

When I got the whole Season of Firefly for Christmas, I was excited. Since watching Episode ONE, I couldn't stop watching. I saw the whole series in 3 days while trying to expand the experience. I Fell in love with the Characters and I LOVE the music and the Theme Song blew me away. I LOVE THAT SONG, it's one of the best theme song I ever heard. It's too bad that it was short, I wanted more and more. I'm happy they made the Movie, as it does Rock and it makes more sense after watching the series. Don't see the movie first, watch the series first and then the movie. I LOVE this show, One of my favorite show ever.    It's about a group of Law Breakers stealing and doing anything for money and Hopping through the Galaxy finding anything to make money. They would do odd dangerous jobs trying to stay alive. This show doesn't hold back, and it sometimes has brutal honesty that is refreshing. For a good price, get it, it will be a great bumpy ride for you.

While you're at it - make sure you watch the movie \\"Walk The Line\\" too! Johnny & June were involved in the making of that film before they passed on.
B000YENUI6|4.0|With quality acting performances all around, EASTERN PROMISES delivers a taut story about the Russian mafia. Viggo Mortensen plays the chauffer/bodyguard to the alcoholic son of a Russian mob chief, the elder wishing to keep certain deeds secret. A diary pops up with incriminating facts and the plot cranks up like the motorbike that female interest Naomi Watts rides around town, trying to find a home for the baby of an abused underage girl. But, for me, the plot is secondary to the interesting peek into another world, a world of hard Russian criminals, speaking half Russian and half accented English, some having escaped from the KGB in their homeland, and wearing tattoos like dark graphic novels about their past trials and affliations. There is a brutal fight scene that is flinchingly violent but, for the most part, the violence is implied in a glance or a word. Certain to be a classic of crime noir.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|A very good movie presentation of a Jane Austen book.  Typical British casting with good character depictions.  Lovely scenery.  Very good representations of clothing styles and social class distinctions of the era - upper class snobbery and conniving, a put-upon underdog or rather \\"undergirl\\" has the viewer urging her to stand up for herself.  Almost a \\"Cinderella\\" story line, and does have a  great ending.  Lovely way to spend an enjoyable indoor wintery afternoon.
0061122416|5.0|Excellent transaction; the book is one of my all time favorites that I gifted it to my sales team this past Xmas.  It's such a clever story that everyone can relate either their professional or personal goals to the shepherd boy's quest.
0307346617|5.0|This book is a masterpiece of zombie literature. For fans of Romero films (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead), this book is a must-have for your collection.
0394873742|5.0|I give this book about twice a year to little children learning to talk!  I hear from their parents that it immediately becomes one of the favorites - and I find adults enjoy creative use of the book as well (eg:telling stories about the pictures, promoting imagination and self directed play)  It's a sure winner, and Amazon price absolutely the best!
0307387151|5.0|I don't make it a rule to throw around the word, classic, especially when refering to a book that not been out even a decade, but there it is: this book is a classic.  It's not just that the writing is amazing, it's how McEwan weaves the story, the way the story falls back on itself.  It's more or less written in three acts and a sort of epilogue.  The last part of the book was my favorite, the writing was the wittiest in book.  The story is of course one of Atonement, it's Atonement for an egregious lie, that destroys several lives.  I liked how McEwan takes his time setting up a scene, how he describes everything in illustrious detail, his prose are erudite and beautifully spun together.  Spoiler alert:  One thing that bothered me was that Briony never really Atones for her horrible act, even in the end, her story will have Robbie and Cecilia together like some fairy tale, instead of the tragic way it all ended, she never even apologizes to Robbie for ruining his life and again, Briony lets herself off the hook for their deaths, her book will end with them living happily everafter and she apologizing and recanting her lie, which she NEVER does.  Robbie would not be in the North of France if not for Briony, and Cecilia certainly would not have been a nurse and she would not have been in the tube station when the bomb hit.  All, I could think of when the elderly Briony goes to her 77th birthday party was, what on earth would these people think of you if they knew what you had done?  She has become this famous author, and she has lived with this lie her whole life, even after Robbie and Cecilia had died in 1940, she could have set the record straight she could have still tried to clear his name, if not for Robbie, for his poor Mother, but Briony did nothing, she was a coward, though I laughed at her thoughts at the last of the book and she had made a wonderful life for herself, all I could think of as the book ended was, Briony you're a coward to the end, how on earth can you sleep, I dont know how you have ever slept knowing your actions lead to the death of you sister and her innocent Robbie, it's obscene, but that Briony always living a fairy tale....Great Book.
0307387151|4.0|Atonement does not feel, at first, like a book by McEwan. The opening is almost perversely ungripping. Instead of the expected sharpness of focus, the first 70 or so pages are a lengthy summary of shifting impressions. One longs for a cinematic clarity and concentration of dialogue and action, but such interludes dissolve before our - and the participants' - eyes. Unlike Martin Amis, say, or Salman Rushdie, McEwan is an invisible rather than a flamboyant stylist. Even so, the pallid qualifiers and disposable adverbs (a \\"gently rocking\\" sheet of water, the \\"coyly drooping\\" head of a nettle) come as a surprise. The language used to distil the scene - a gathering of the Tallis family at their country house on a sweltering day in 1935 - serves also as a wash that partially obscures it. Various characters come and go but the novel, at this point, seems populated mainly by its literary influences. Chief among these is Virginia Woolf. The technique is not stream of consciousness so much as \\"a slow drift of association\\", \\"the hovering stillness of nothing much seeming to happen\\". The book later contains a critique of its own early pages - or at least of the draft from which they derive - in the guise of a letter from Cyril Connolly, editor of Horizon , who advises that \\"such writing can become precious when there is no sense of forward movement\\". The requisite propulsion is provided by the unexpected intrusion, as it were, of two other novelists from the interwar years.
B00005JPTI|5.0|I am Legend, the DVD, is not really an adaption of the novel. This movie could easily have been called '28 months later' as it has more in common with that series than with the Richard Matheson novel. It is more inspired by the novel than a true movie adaption of it. As long as you aren't expecting it to be completely true to the novel and watch it with an open mind you will find a very enjoyable movie.<br /><br />The special effects aren't over done and the pace is good. It is a testiment to the skill of Will Smith that he can keep the movie captivating and believable with almost no interaction from other actors.
B000001GQP|3.0|Well, this performance was approved by the composer(Yeah!!!Congrats!!!)<br />Does this makes it a definitive performance? Of course not, then again, how many versions aren't there of the Bruckner symphonies? and we like them all and then again Orff is not Bruckner. Orff is know for only this work.<br />The sound world in this recording is different from say a recording by<br />Mutti, or Detoit. DG should have picked a different performance for this<br />most excellent collection of \\"The Originals\\"
0143038419|2.0|Like many other reviewers, I couldn't make it past page 50 or so. I really wanted to like this book - everyone I know who read it, loved it.  I had to wait months to get it from the library (so glad I didn't spend a dime on it!). However, when I finally sat down to read it, I couldn't believe how immature Ms. Gilbert came across. She babbles on and on about her \\"problems\\". Give me a break. Look around lady, people have far greater problems than you and they don't have the $$ to travel the world to \\"find themselves\\".     The premise of this book had potential, but that was overshadowed by Ms. Gilbert's self absorbed personality.    I found this book to be soooo lame.

B0002IQEHI|4.0|I am not a huge Hitchcock fan.  I love some of his films; others, not so much.  I give this one high marks for excitement, entertainment, and humour.  My favorite thing in the film, is Cary Grant, who is at his most splendid, elegant, funny best.  Just watching this man for two hours is sheer pleasure.      The rest of the cast is good.  James Mason gives his usual expert performance as the bad guy who is just charming enough to have won the beautiful blond, for a while.  I usually love Eva Marie Saint but I think that she was not well cast here.  Hitchcok adores his pale blonds but she shines better as a sincere, vulnerable sweetie and doesn't quite pull off the sophisticated double agent role.  I found her attempts at being seductive on the train forced and unattractive. When she shows her true feelings towards the end, she warms up and her real beauty shows.  She looks good, though and there are some great costumes, which apparently Hitchcock picked out for her personally on a shopping trip to Bergdorf's.    The woman cast as Grant's mother was only a year older than he was, which seems to be another big mistake.  She is good (reminds me of Stockard Channing) but not at all convincing as his mom.  Also, Grant is just too gorgeous to be going to the theatre with his mother!    The most amusing feature of the film, is Mount Rushmore!  Just the idea of having people scrambling for their lives over the faces of our venerable presidents stikes me as very funny--pure Hitchcock.    All in all, it's great entertainment.  It's not going to enlighten you or give you great cause to think or stick with you for hours after you see it, but while you're watching it, you'll be glued to the screen.
0061091480|4.0|I recommend this book for everyone who needs to improve his daily quality of life. It's very helpfull.
B00011D1RC|5.0|It's hard to believe that a film made in the early days of talking pictures could be so totally enjoyable for today's audience!  The secret, besides a clever script, dazzling sets and costumes, of course is the cast!  Wow!  Some people complain that the acting is too mannered, especially in the cases of John Barrymore and Greta Garbo but I heartily disagree.  Garbo plays a grand diva of the old school--she thinks big, acts big, lives big.  Mumbling of the type of modern acting brought on by The Actors' Studio is not appropriate here.  This is more akin to Grand Opera---big passions, big gestures.  The scenes with Barrymore and Garbo are priceless--two great, beautiful people---look at those perfect profiles!  The chemistry between them was apparent.  How fortunate we are to have this recorded on film for us.    I did not know who played the spunky little stenographer and was amazed to discover it was Joan Crawford.  She was very good here and showed a sweet, innocent quality that she lost somewhere along the way, unfortunately.  The rest of the cast, as everyone else has mentioned, is ...stellar!      Visually this is just such a treat.  The costumes are wonderful..I loved Garbo's (politically incorrect) full length fur coats.      Usually I have to make mental \\"allowances\\" for these old films to compensate for stilted acting and unsophisticated scripts, but this was totally not needed for Grand Hotel.  Totally classy, totally enjoyable!
B000UR366S|5.0|This CD is absolutely gorgous, I work at Starbuck's and this CD played constanlty after it's release and it'd always put in a better mode to make coffee. I'm glad to see that Joni is still making beautiful music.<br /><br />Also, if you like Joni, you'll love another female artist named Julia Fordham and she like Joni, has an absolutely intoxicating jazzy voice and fantastic lounge piano melodies. Julia Fordham has a new album out called China Blue and it's available on the site called NovaTunes.com. I actually just lisened to the entire album on there and it's amazing. If you love Joni, go listen to Julia Forham's China Blue. It'll blow you away.
6305622914|5.0|I didn't bother to see this film when it came out in the theaters.  I heard it was good but male strippers weren't exactly my cup o' tea.  However when I found it on the shelf at the public library recently I borrowed it and was really delighted!      Yes, it's about a group of unemployed Yorkshire steel workers who stage a strip show to make some needed cash.  We already know that.  What was so surprising to me was the very smart, sensitive, and totally hilarious way the film was made.  The actors are really good and quickly draw us into their individual dilemmas.  The film is heartwarming without being sappy.  As another reviewer wrote, \\"Thank God Hollywood didn't make this movie!\\"  It could have been a cheezy disaster but this is handled so deftly that it deserves all the great response it has received.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't love this movie!    I do recommend turning on the English subtitles for American audiences. The local slang is very amusing but you need to read it to understand it.
0688145078|3.0|I purchased this book to help prepare my 22 mos old for the birth of his baby sister.  He likes it ok and he will sit through it, but he isn't overly thrilled about it.  Neither am I, honestly.  It is a very basic book and is written so a very young child could understand, but it also isn't very interesting.  Also, it isn't really AP friendly.  It shows the baby sibling being fed a bottle and being pushed in a stroller.  Otherwise, it is written from a positive perspective, which I like.  It doesn't talk about negative feelings, it emphasizes positive aspects of having a sibling.  I just wish it were a little less dry.
0385333846|5.0|As a young man fighting in World War II, Kurt Vonnegut was captured by the Germans and taken as a prisoner to Dresden, where he witnessed the bombing of the city by the Allied Air Forces. He only survived because he and his fellow-prisoners were being held deep in the cellars of an abattoir known in German as \\"Schlachthof Fuenf\\", or \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\". Hence the title of the novel, which tells the story of a young American soldier named Billy Pilgrim, who is captured by the Germans and taken as a prisoner to Dresden, where he witnesses the bombing of the city, only surviving because he and his fellow-prisoners are being held deep in the cellars of an abattoir.     Although the book is partly autobiographical, it is by no means a realistic depiction of the horrors of war. It is highly experimental in style, with a strong element of science-fiction. Billy is described as being \\"unstuck in time\\", which means that he is an inadvertent time-traveller, who can suddenly find himself whisked from one point in his life to another without warning. (Billy's surname is probably meant to have a symbolic meaning- he is on an uncertain, random pilgrimage through life).     Vonnegut's writing is similarly unstuck in time. There is no smooth linear narrative progressing logically from one event to the next; the narration rather hops, seemingly randomly, from one part of Billy's life to another. We learn (but not necessarily in that order) about his marriage after the war to a girl named Valencia, about how he becomes a successful optometrist in upstate New York, about how he survives a plane crash and about his wife's death shortly afterwards, and about his own murder in the 1970s. (The book itself was actually published in 1969). Most bizarrely, we learn how he is kidnapped by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who take him back to their world to keep him in a zoo and mate him with a porn star named Montana Wildhack.      Experimental novels often have the reputation of beingwilfully obscure and difficult to read. \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is neither. Vonnegut's prose is wonderfully lucid, and although his narrative may lack strict chronological logic, the sequence of events has a logic of its own. For example the bombing, which is in chronological terms one of the earlier events in the novel, is placed near the end, because it is the most powerful event in emotional terms and therefore makes a suitable climax.      Because of the central role played in it by the bombing of Dresden, \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" has often been described as an anti-war novel. Yet in the opening chapter Vonnegut relates a (possibly invented) conversation with a friend who asks him why he doesn't write an anti-glacier book instead of an anti-war book, implying that wars are as easy to stop as glaciers and that anti-war books are therefore futile. This attitude fits in with the Tralfamadorian philosophy of life, something frequently referred to in the book. Unlike humans, who can see only one point in time at once, the Tralfamadorians can see the whole of their lives, past present and future. This means that they know about future events before they actually occur and therefore believe that there is no point in trying to alter or avoid them. After his return to Earth, Billy becomes hugely popular and successful by preaching this philosophy to his fellow Earthlings.     At times it seems as if Vonnegut himself is preaching a similar philosophy. This attitude is emphasised by his frequent use of the phrase \\"so it goes\\", used here to mean something like \\"that's the way things are\\" or \\"that's life\\", every time someone dies or something unfortunate occurs. It did, however, seem to me entirely possible that Vonnegut may not have intended his apparent advocacy of passive fatalism to have been taken at face value. This may simply have been an ironic way of putting an anti-war message across. This is not an anti-war book in the sense that it makes an intellectual case for pacifism, nor does it address the strong  counter-argument that the Nazi regime was so aggressive and brutal that the war against it was morally justified. Vonnegut rather attempts through the use of irony to reveal the absurdity of war, just as Joseph Heller does in that other great American satirical anti-war novel, \\"Catch-22\\". Billy and his fellow-prisoners only survive the bombing because they are protected by a slaughterhouse, a building normally associated with killing. After the destruction, one of those prisoners is executed by the Nazis for the risibly minor crime of stealing a teapot from the ruins. The last words in the book are given to a bird: \\"Poo-tee-weet\\". Perhaps that is the only meaningful comment possible.

Interesting ideas for vegetables  such as roasting cauliflower, although we did not blanch first it was very good, even the next day.

B000I5X81A|1.0|After years of honoring each other's work, most notably Clapton covering Cale's \\"After Midnight\\" and \\"Cocaine,\\" the two blues guitar greats team up to create a fresh album together. The result is true to both legends' blues roots, but unfortunately lacks any energy or punch to make any of the songs interesting. I don't know if it's because they're getting on in years or they forgot how to kick it up a notch, but somehow I believe that their ride to Escondido is in an old Cadillac traveling at 20mph in the fast lane with their blinker on.

B00005MNP7|3.0|New Wave legends dig into the vault for a unique release. The collectors edition of 1979's Eat the Beat is proclaimed the World's first video album. This concept is quite revolutionary, if it was still 1979. Today it seems kind of silly. However, when you think about it, this video album pre-dates MTV. The majority of the material included on the DVD ranges from concept videos to live performances. It's an interesting look at the music scene to say the least (it's also a great way to catch Debbie Harry in her prime).<br /><br />As for the music, if your only family with Blondie's radio hits, you're probably going to be a bit lost. The CD doesn't really contain any major hits, but does show the band taking some musical chances. Some of the music works, some of it doesn't. Either way, the DVD portion makes checking out this collection worth it.
0375847227|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and at many points in time it just kept me turning the pages. My wife started the book while I was in the middle of it and we often fought over it. :) Pullman didn't go for the traditional fictional fare, and instead crafted new elements to dazzle and entertain - and to make you think.<br /><br />The book wasn't perfect (the Amber Spyglass was a weak link), and after I finished it I had a few little questions about things that had happened, but I'm not sure if the book didn't resolve them well or I just missed something - which is entirely possible in a book like this.<br /><br />It was absolutely worth my time to read it.
B000VKW7AK|4.0|The Good<br />Back in 2004 Capitol Records and Megadeth's Dave Mustaine teamed up to remaster and remix the group's back catalog. Each studio album under Capitol was re-released with bonus tracks, b-sides, and demo material. The final piece of that project is the 4CD/1 DVD release Warchest. The most notable additions to this package are the long sought after tracks from Megadeth's out-of-print EP release Hidden Treasures (with some minor exceptions), two killer live performances (one audio, one video), and some additional unreleased material.<br /><br />Disc 1: Megadeth's debut album Killing is My Business was not re-released by Capitol, due in part to the fact it was originally released on Combat Records and later on Sanctuary. However, for this collection, Capitol was able to get a hold of two of the Sanctuary tracks (from other albums too), \\"Killing is My Business...\\" and \\"Skull Beneath the Skin\\" The rest of the disc plays out as a best of for Peace Sells...but Who's Buying, So Far, So Good...So What, and Rust in Peace. The unreleased material contains an alternate mix of \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due,\\" and demos of \\"Tornado of Souls\\" and \\"Five Magics.\\" The remix is almost of the same caliber of the final product, and the demos give you and idea where the tracks started. Megadeth's covers of the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy in the UK\\" and \\"Problems\\" are combined into one track as a studio session take.<br /><br />Disc 2: This disc combines the best of Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia, plus quite a few more sought after gems. \\"Go To Hell,\\" \\"Angry Again,\\" \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Diadems\\" from Hidden Treasures are here, and so is \\"Breakpoint.\\" However the later is a session take. Four of the tracks from Countdown are live performances from 1992. The live version of \\"Skin O' My Teeth\\" is simply awesome. A cover track \\"Strange Ways\\" is also included, but for the life of me I can't figure out where it came from (all I have is promo copies - no booklet). Look for the infamous B-side \\"New World Order\\" as well.<br /><br />Disc 3: Trust and Risk hits are featured here, plus Capitol scores some more material from Megadeth's time with Sanctuary with tracks from The World Needs a Hero and The System Has Failed. Rare and unreleased material includes a live Woodstock '99 performance of \\"A Secret Place,\\" B-side releases of \\"One Thing,\\" \\"Duke Nukem,\\" and \\"Coming Home,\\" and Megadeth's contribution to a Black Sabbath tribute album, \\"Never Say Die.\\"<br /><br />Disc 4 & 5: The fourth CD is a classic liver performance from 1990, right around the release of Rust in Peace, which showcases the band at the pinnacle of their career. The DVD is a live performance from two years later that revolves around the release of their biggest selling album Countdown to Extinction. Both performances are a perfect example of Megadeth's signature thrash metal style.<br /><br />The Bad<br />There was no reason to include to two brief interview bits with Mustaine. They shed absolutely nothing new in the world of Megadeth. Also, this is said to be the last of all the Capitol years Megadeth material.

B000F0V0LI|5.0|Considered by many to be the greatest western of all time, and even a contender for the greatest FILM of all time, I'm hesitant to rate this any lower than 5 Stars.  However, there are some negative aspects of this film that need to be addressed.<br /><br />What Works:<br /><br />John Wayne's monumental performance as the racist, obsessive loner Ethan Edwards. Unable to make any connections with friends or family, Ethan devotes all his energy to finding his kidnapped niece. As time passes he slightly alters his mission to \\"Search and Destroy\\" because he figures she's been sleeping with the Commanches.<br /><br />The beautiful scenery of John Ford's favorite location- Monument Valley. Absolutely breathtaking.<br /><br />What Doesn't Work:<br /><br />Some of the supporting cast (Ford's normally dependable stock company) comes off as rather annoying. Ken Curtis being the biggest offender with his comic accent.<br /><br />The scene which involves Martin's temporary Indian bride whom both Ethan and Martin cruelly mistreat. When Martin kicks her down the hill for a laugh will probably not fly with modern audiences. [Like me]<br /><br />Another scene that I can't stand is the comic wedding fight between Martin and Charlie (Ken Curtis) On the one hand; I like Ford's use of dances to symbolize community and family. Having the two wandering men come home from the wilderness to the festive celebration is a nice contrast, but the emphasis on Ken Curtis and the ensuing fight is unfortunate for a film of this caliber. Infact that whole love triangle proved to be a major distraction.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />The Searchers is certainly a masterpiece, but there are uneven bits of comic relief that drag the film down. When i watch this film I always skip these scenes with the remote, which makes for a far more satisfying experience.<br /><br />Also I highly recommend the Ultimate Collector's Edition. Or for a few dollars more, just buy the John Ford/John Wayne boxset which includes the Searchers, Stagecoach, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and more.e.
B000SM7QUC|1.0|The Good<br />Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx wrote a book about his life and struggles with drugs entitled The Heroine Diaries. In a unique marking tie in, he formed a new band to create a soundtrack for it. The album mixes passages from the book read by Nikki, with music no-doubt inspired by the story. Our story begins in 1986 at Christmas time. \\"X-Mas in Hell\\" twists a holiday classic with a section read from the book. The dark track \\"Van Nuys\\" would have you believe that whole town/city is drug addicts.<br /><br />\\"Life is Beautiful\\" is the lead single from the album and has a great hard rock crunch and emotional chorus to it. \\"Pray for Me\\" is most likely about Sixx's failed marriage with Donna D'Errico (or Brandi Brandt). He laments on how she tried to help him, but he only hated her for it. \\"Dead Man's Ballet\\" delves into Sixx's near-death experience as he regrets leaving loved ones behind but spits venom at his father. The track runs the gamut on emotions and tempos.<br /><br />The Bad<br />The album is probably better understood after reading the book. Trying to profit from stupid, irresponsible, and dangerous life choices is just wrong.<br /><br />The Verdict<br />While The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack is hands-down Nikki Sixx's best non-Motley Crue music project, I simply cannot endorse anyone that glamorizes a lifestyle of drug abuse. Sixx can hide behind the claim he wants to help people so they don't make mistakes like he did, but in reality, people will feel that they too can survive a lifetime of drug abuse and may even come out a millionaire or celebrity because of it. Sixx should not be rewarded or idolized for his past behavior. There are thousands if not millions in the gutter or even dead because of heroine abuse. I have no sympathy.
B000YA9R3C|5.0|This movie is the next step on the evolutionary chain of films as an art form. Filled with dark irony, cryptic messages, compelling imagery, and one of the greatest acting performances of all time. This movie is so unconventional, bizarre, and yet perfect in every way. It digs deep into the human ambition to not only succeed, but to see others fail. Daniel Plainview is all of us.
B000VWYNOG|4.0|40 years of hits crammed onto one CD. That's mighty impressive. I have never claimed to be the biggest Van Morrison follower, but even I can recognize numerous tracks on this one. \\"Gloria,\\" Brown Eyed Girl,\\" \\"Wild Night,\\" \\"Jackie Wilson Said,\\" \\"Have I Told You Lately?,\\" and \\"Days Like This\\" are only a few of the 21 career spanning favorites. There are many Van Morrison hits packages out there, but this one boasts recent favorites as well. Overall it's not too shabby for the casual Morrison listener, but I would have to imagine, with a career so vast, that longtime fans consider more than 21 songs to be the greatest.
B0001Z37HM|1.0|This was a really bad movie.  First, Ernie Reyes Jr. when he was a little kid in a Schwarzenegger movie.  It's painful.  Brigitte Nielsen can't act and she's not even THAT good looking.  Sub-par plot (An evil queen wants a jewel)  And even the fight scenes were drug out.  Nielsen is so frail that everyone is pulling their punches, sword blows, etc.  So, it really slows down the action.  Maybe if she didn't have a bigger sword than Arnold she could fight a little better.<br /><br />And the evil queen?  She was in the first Conan movie!  I thought she was WAY hotter than Red Sonja!<br /><br />If you want to know why they didn't make a Conan 3, watch this movie.  Bad all around.

The newly packaged album features a bonus disc of b-side and unreleased material, plus an in-depth booklet with lyrics and liner notes by The Edge. The Joshua Tree not only sent U2 spiraling into the stratosphere, it spawned numerous hits that even the casual fans are sure to recognize; \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\\" \\"With or Without You,\\" and \\"Bullet the Blue Sky.\\" And of course, there are also the slower, deeper album tracks that the true fans enjoy.<br /><br />The main selling point of the release is the bonus disc of b-sides and unreleased studio sessions. If I'm being completely honest, most songs are unreleased and b-sides for a reason. However, there are a few hidden gems. \\"Spanish Eyes\\" has a nice melody and groove to it. Bono is seductive in his delivery. \\"Silver & Gold\\" has a funky drum beat that matches nicely with the sweet guitar tone. There's also a stripped down version of this track. A rough mix of \\"The Sweetest Thing\\" is sure to raise and eyebrow and will make you appreciate the final version that was released later. The session material ranges from promising song fragments to indulgent art pieces to just plain strange. The thick album booklet is very well-done.<br /><br />The Bad<br />I would classify the bonus disc as \\"for collectors only.\\"<br /><br />The Verdict<br />The Joshua Tree truly does stand the test of time. A landmark album from one of the biggest bands in music today.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have watched this series 3 times and plan on watching it again.  According to my Uncle John who was in the 82nd Airborne it is the best most realistic depiction of WWII in a movie/series.
B000E9910W|5.0|You have to hand it to the folks at Rhino Records. They ALWAYS deliver the goods when it comes to greatest hits albums. With The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers you get 33 tracks from the legendary R & B influenced California rockers. The hits just go on and on with tracks \\"Listen to the Music,\\" \\"China Groove,\\" \\"Takin' It to the Streets,\\" \\"It Keeps You Runnin',\\" \\"What a Fool Believes,\\" and \\"Minute by Minute.\\" The list goes on and on. There's no doubt these tracks are already burned into you brain from commercials, radio stations, weddings, office parties, and even elevators. Whether laying down guitar heavy hooks or pounding away on the keys with some bluesy soulful music, The Doobie Brothers always kept it interesting, no matter who was behind the microphone.\\"
B000W4KT64|1.0|Fortunately we downloaded this movie to Tivo so we could fast forward to the annoyingly predictable ending.  The singing and dancing were fun for about 10 minutes, but this is a truly shallow effort that gets so repetitive you can't bear to watch it anymore.  Yuck!!
B000P2A24W|2.0|The Good<br />Riding high on the success of one country crossover hit \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home,\\" Bon Jovi take a stab at a full album of country inspired songs. With that being said, you really can't call this a country album at all, more like Bon Jovi unplugged or Bon Jovi-light. As usual, the songwriting is great. Bon Jovi has always had a knack for that, and as they've matured, so has their lyrics. If Bon Jovi can't touch you with a ballad (like \\"Make a Memory\\" and \\"Seat Next to You\\"), then you must be dead. Unless you're a die-hard Bon Jovi fan, I doubt you will find anything that tickles your fancy. Even if you are a Bon Jovi fan, you'll still have your reservations.<br /><br />The Bad<br />The albums biggest problem is its lack of energy. It's as if Jon has accepted he's gotten older and decided to slow everything down. \\"Summertime\\" and \\"Whole Lot of Leavin'\\" have some energy, but they are far from anthems. I don't know how they could even promote this as a country album either. Because they use more acoustics, slide guitar, and a banjo? The closest thing to country is \\"We Got It Going On\\" featuring Big and Rich, and that's more like modern country.<br /><br />The Verdict<br />Instead of calling it \\"Bon Jovi's country album,\\" perhaps they should have called it \\"Bon Jovi's adult contemporary album.\\" All you're really getting is all of the energy sucked out of the Bon Jovi you knew and loved in the 80s. Yeah, you get a few good songs, but overall you get let down. Some roads are better left un-traveled. This Lost Highway is one of them.
B000TM1CKQ|4.0|I was initially skeptical about purchasing the second season of How I Met Your Mother, simply because the first season just wasn't funny enough. Dont get me wrong, I enjoy the show but its just didn't have as many laughs as I would have liked. But season 2 changes that. Apart from a slow start, the season has one hit episode after another. Whether it be Robin's teenage pop-princess nightmare or Marshals effort to get back into the dating game. Oh and you get to see Barney in a play too! What more could you ask for. The bottomline: season 2 of How I Met Your Mother is creative, innovative and most important of all, its funny as hell.
B000UG4LYU|3.0|Released for the first time on CD, Buddha of Suburbia is a collection of music that Bowie composed for a famed British play around 1993. The title track is perhaps the most catchy and most memorable. Bowie experiments with effects heavy vocals on \\"Sex and the Church\\". Other vocal tracks range from mellow to emotional. There are a few instrumental tracks that take away from the concept of an album, but in the context of listening to it as a play, it all makes sense. You'd probably have a better appreciation for it if you saw the play, but either way, it's pure David Bowie from beginning to end.
0780626966|5.0|This movie collection rocks!!! It has all the movies plus a bonus disk!  For $45, this is a great deal!
B000P2A256|4.0|The Good<br />Adam Levine gets his groove on with \\"If I Never See Your Face Again,\\" and it just keeps going and going. \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" is the most memorable and catchy song on the radio right now. There's something wrong with you if you're not cranking this one, and moving your body to the funky rhythms. Levine is the king of smooth on the mic here. It's back to more of a guitar sound on \\"Little of Your Time,\\" but the keyboards and programmed effects still tend to dominate. \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\" tends to mimic \\"She Will Be Loved\\" from the band's last album, but it still has a feeling of its own lyrically. \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" employs enduring vocal melodies and acoustic guitars to draw you in. \\"Better Than We Break\\" is a soulful, piano-based ballad that is delivered with plenty of heart and emotion.<br /><br />The Bad<br />Well...it sure ain't \\"This Love\\" all over again.<br /><br />The Verdict<br />Not exactly the sound I think about when I think of Maroon 5, but I can't say it really turned me off either. Adding keyboards and programmed beats really did add texture to Maroon 5's sound, breaking them out of the modern rock genre and launching them into the power-pop realm. I don't think I'll ever get \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" out of my head, but I do have to wonder if fans will accept this new, funkier, and danceable sound.
B00005YXZH|5.0|...Whatever that means. This is the band music has been waiting for since Bonham died. And you know what, I'm glad! *    If you're new to Wilco don't start here unless you have an open ear and an open heart. and willing to listen at least threee times thru...but then you may never want to leave.      * I say this not because of this album but due to recent transactions and transcurrences
B000TSIK14|5.0|The Good<br />The Scorpions make no bones about it on the opening number \\"Hour 1;\\" this is not a happy concept album. Meaty riffs, pounding drums, and a scathing commentary on our world's governments ring loud and clear. Thunderous riffs in the vein of \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\" lead the charge on \\"The Game of Life.\\" The song switches gears with a melodic verse and catchy chorus section. \\"The Future Never Dies\\" proves once again that the 80s rockers still know how to craft an emotionally charged power ballad.<br /><br />Driving riffs and a hook-laden chorus command \\"Loving Me to Death.\\" \\"321\\" will no doubt become the Scorpions modern day rock anthem. \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" is another touching ballad with great acoustic melodies. \\"Your Last Song\\" is one of those songs that keep you guessing as to whether the main characters are breaking up or getting back together. \\"Humanity\\" is clearly laying the ground work for Hour 2. It's a mixed rocker/ballad with the message of humanity lost. Or is it?<br /><br />The Bad<br />I hate trying to figure out \\"concept\\" albums.<br /><br />The Verdict<br />If you've followed the Scorpions over the years, you've know doubt noticed they've experimented with their sound from time to time. Early recordings sound nothing like their 80s hey-day, and don't even get me started on their 90s alternative experiments. The group's last release, Unbreakable, was a step in the right direction in capturing the sound that made them famous.<br /><br />Humanity: Hour 1 finds the Scorpions returning full-boar to formula that made them arena rock superstars. Classic riffs and soloing, memorable vocal hooks, and catchy melodies rock this album from beginning to end. As for the story...despite our nations and relationships falling apart, our love for one another will prevail in the end. I think?
B000K15VSA|5.0|The only real reason to buy this box set is if you are a diehard fan and want it purely for the novelty of having it.  It contains the same 5 disc set that you can get without the carrying case and as far as the movie content goes nothing differs.  It comes with a nifty holographic animation of Deckard, a miniature oragami unicorn and a spinner (the flying car) toy. It comes with some interesting production art but other than that, there really isn't much to get excited about.  I gave it 5 stars because of the movie content and because when I bought the ultimate collector's edition I got it for about twenty-five dollars off, so for a price of about forty or fifty dollars, anymore and I wouldn't bother, just get the dvds.  I imagine that the blu-ray version is much better.
B000P0J024|5.0|The Beatles' George Harrison, Electric Light Orchestra's Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty. Sounds like one hell of a super group, doesn't it? Well, it was! Back in 1988 this five some hooked-up to write and perform the kinds of music they do best. Alone, the five each had their own unique sound. Together, they brought all those sounds together to take themselves to a higher plane. It also helped that they were the closet of friends.<br /><br />Although they only released two studio albums, the meat-and-potatoes of those albums can be found here (okay, it's both albums with bonus tracks). \\"Handle with Care\\" and \\"End of the Line\\" were perhaps their most memorable, but each track falls in line with the Americana sound that the Wilburys were known for. Two previously unreleased tracks are included on each disc. Where most bonus tracks are filler and junk, the ones included here are quite good. Be sure to look for the 3 disc Deluxe Edition that includes a live DVD performance
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|The video and audio quality on this bluray are both outstanding. Even if you are not a Shakira fan its still a great show to watch. Sounds good in 5.1 but sooooo much better playing in PCM 5.1. If you like live concerts then this is a must!
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|Let's face it, the first Alter Bridge album was pretty much a clone of Creed. With most of the band being members of that group, it wasn't hard to see that would be the result. However, a few years have past and the group returns with their sophomore effort Blackbird. The first few riffs of the opening track \\"Ties That Bind\\" let you know that this group is putting Creed behind them.<br /><br />The riffs are darker, the music is heavier, yet the positive messages stay the same. It took me till the middle of the album to really get into it. \\"Before Tomorrow Comes,\\" \\"Rise Today,\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" really define the album. Myles Kennedy's vocals are gritty, powerful, and soulful, while guitarist Mark Tremonti is simply on fire.
B000OCBPLC|5.0|I've been a long time Prince fan and 'Controversy' is one of my favorite Prince albums. It reveals a deeply inspired Prince, on the verge of becoming of the biggest names in the music industry. The awesome title track, the cover, everything about it is Prince at his best.

B000E41MS6|5.0|AS a long time Doctor Who fan, this series has just blown me away. Every one should check it out, not just SCI-FI fans.
B000UO338W|4.0|The Good<br />\\"Let's Go\\" leads the charge with galloping riffage and equally as powerful vocals. Heavy guitars and a furious Al Jourgensen stomp a mud hole of anger into \\"Watch Yourself.\\" Jourgensen unleashed more fury and hatred on the politically charged track \\"The Dick Song.\\" Meaty riffs and chugga-chugga riffs back up snarling vocals on \\"The Last Sucker.\\" \\"No Glory\\" fires off at you and furious heavy metal break-neck speed. A cover of The Doors \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" seems a little out of place with the rest of the music, but does fit it lyrically with the albums overall theme. It's certainly more interesting than the original. Ministry closes out with the multi-tempoed epic \\"End of Days.\\"<br /><br />The Bad<br />This has been labeled the last Ministry album.<br /><br />The Verdict<br />There's no denying that Ministry is making a strong statement against our current government and political actions as a nation under George Bush. With The Last Sucker Jourgensen makes his opinions clear with anger, fury, and thunderous guitars. I have listened to Ministry in the past, and I wasn't really impressed. However, The Last Sucker opened my eyes and touched my metal soul. Powerful, strong, and to the point.
B000077VR3|4.0|Came fairly quickly but since I was giving it as a gift I had to change the  DVD case out since the one it arrived in was ripped. DVD was in great shape, nonetheless.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is a good cd, but it is nothing like what I expected.  There's no doubt that Ms Aguilera is all grown up.  Powerhouse vocals throughout.  The tunes range from loungy cool, to powerful anthem, to all out pop.  If you're expecting another pop cd that's all about dancing and boys, this is not it.  But, if you're interested in strong vocals having something to say, this is a good cd to have.
B0000640VN|5.0|I love this movie.  I love this movie so much that my teenage son knew that it was the perfect gift for Christmas.  I do think that it needs to be purchase in the DVD format so that you have the director's cut available to watch.  I love the different slant that you get to the plot of the movie with the longer version.  It is a fun story with laughter and a little bit of serious thrown in.
B000UD0ESA|4.0|Visually, it was Scott-perfect but I missed a few of the removed narrative inserts; I always felt it gave it a bit of the old \\"film noir\\" Dashell Hammett feel, even though it was superfluous.
0446577391|4.0|I was really excited for this novel to come out.  After reading the other two camel club books i was hooked on the series.  This book picked up with the same pace that last book left off.  It turned out to be a great read with an exciting and dramatic finish.  I love how Baldacci ties multiple plots together in his writing and this books ties up so many loose ends and answers so many questions.<br /><br />If you are looking to learn more about the mysterious Oliver Stone, or should i say John Carr, and you want to find out how it all goes down with Jerry Bagger, the Casino Boss, then this is definitly the book to read.  Look forward to having just about all your questions answered in a very fast paced read.<br /><br />Kudos again Mr. Baldacci for another great novel.  I truely hope the Camel Club continues to live on for years to come.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|Don't think to much if you are space generation person. Bravo, Excellant, beautifull journey to the moon...............
B000VDDDY6|4.0|Ok, wow! the picture truly is awesome and if you are a fan with an HD DVD (not Blu Ray, I only mention this because until it is released in that format I hear some people got caught out thinking that they could play it on BR) player its a must. I even have the previous regular set, and I admit I thought the price too high and bit only with the Amazon discount and my wife asking what I wanted at the Holidays.    I agree with all those who cited poor packaging and there is no real episode description or index, I find myself using the regular DVD set one.      But many have written in more depth and with more authority than I could. The main reason for posting is like others I did not understand why the sound on Kirk's intros was so muted and the sound in general was low. I did a Google search and someone had already posted an answer on amazon, but only as a reply to a review. Basically you need to adjust the audio settings on your player. They suggested making sure you are set to PCM, but I found I had to be a little more detailed. I had already tried adjusting before with no luck, but I suspect trial and error may be the case. I hope this helps anyone with similar audio issues as that really was the only negative that counted towards detracting for enjoying playing and watching this set. Now the sound and for me at least even Kirk's intro is fine and the picture is awesome.
B000YAA6AU|5.0|I will be the first person to admit that this movie is not for everyone. If your taste in movies runs toward \\"The Bourne Redundancy\\" or \\"No Country for Vile Men,\\" this movie might not be for you. On the other hand, if you are a chick who loves her chick flicks, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one. Grab a friend, grab a hanky, and go see this movie!    Hillary Swank does a fabulous job portraying the emotional rollercoaster that our heroine goes through. In fact, there is not a weak link in the bunch. Harry Connick, Jr., Kathy Bates, Gerard Butler, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Lisa Kudrow--they are all at the top of their game and an absolute pleasure to watch.     And one final plug for the soundtrack. It's full of wonderful and unexpected treasures that were unearthed specifically for this film. Stop by the record shop on the way home from the theater and pick one up. It makes a perfect movie souvenir!
0142403881|2.0|I first read 'Charlie & The Chocolate Factory' many years ago; probably about grade three. I enjoyed it, but years later the only thing I remembered was the golden ticket,the kid who stuck her gum behind her ear and the glass elevator. I remember thinking as a kid, that a glass elevator that went every which way, would be soooo coooool.     Having read it again 30 years later, I am not quite as impressed (well duh it's a kids book!). I found it a little on the cruel side and a little too moralizing, as Dahl takes literary vengeance on all the things that kids do that bug him, like watching t.v. or chewing gum. I guess I just found the moralizing a little too heavy handed. But your kid will probably love it and if it teaches him not to stick gum behind his ear, I guess that's good too.
006112429X|1.0|If there was an option for zero stars, that's what I would have given this book.  The author has a superior attitude which is evident throughout the book and makes it difficut to read(and stomach).  There is no character development for any of the four main characters.     It is possible that two reasonable people could have a child that is a \\"bad seed\\". But that the parents could be so far apart in dealing with the child and communicating with each other is not realistic. It also gets old very quickly.    There are way too many refences to school killings and they become trivialized.    The book might be shoved into the catagory of disfunctional families but it misses that target too because it is so superficial.
B00005OM4K|2.0|I love this band and was looking forward to a long winter evening of CCR. I put in one of the studio recorded cds and.... was a bit disapointed. Uniformly the voice and guitar was blary and the bass and drums so thin that they were almost absent. Perhaps it needed a remastering. Sorry guys, but I think you could do a better job than this on this classic music.
0385340540|3.0|Overall comments:Hard to care about the character because he is not well developed,wonder why he was relocated to Italy when he could have been moved to Canada or else where for a lot less expense to the govt.; ending ambiguous, felt Grisham ended it that way for a movie sequel and not for the reader. I expected a better book.
0060558121|5.0|One of the finest novels I have ever read. Really covers the Campbell stuff, the Hero's Journey, the Wounded Hero, the path of a shaman, all using completely fresh metaphors without any of the typical \\"spiritual\\" language context. Really honors the pagan gods and gives a way of thinking about gods that also ties into culture, paradigm shifts, and the essence of what it is to be an American. My god what a great book.<br /><br />Of course the idea that gods are given life by human worship is nothing new, it's an old science fiction trope but Gaiman's novel is the most well-crafted exploration of the concept that I have seen thus far. And of course, it's not about the gods. It's about post-modern American culture and the culture wars that boil beneath the surface.
B00007KWHG|4.0|[[ASIN:B00007KWHG Very Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons]]    I was 16 when I heard Four Seasons for the first time. Behind the Iron Curtain it was then something like a miracle, to hear fresh, pure and beautiful pop music.     Recently I found this CD on Amazon store. Remembering feelings I had forty years ago I tried to listen to samples, and I was caught again.     When the CD arrived, I put it into the player, being afraid a little of how I will like it now, as an old man, quite different from that boy in early sixties.     It was amazing. The feelings I had forty years ago were exactly replicated now. Same joy, same pride of being able to listen to such a piece of music.    I wonder how younger generation would accept this kind of music. Anyway, I can recommend it. It is worth your attention.
B000063DHK|5.0|This double cd (not the 1 cd release, that edited off side 4 [in the lp days]) of some of Iron Maiden's best songs, covering from the early pre Dickinson days to Powerslave. It has a nice intro (Churchill's speech) then it's all headbanging classic rock. Find the 2 cd one, if you're a Maiden fan. [Same with \\"Bursting Out\\" from Jethro Tull, if you like them, like I do, as the original 1 cd left out three songs.]
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is cleverly written, humorous, and an interesting adventure about a young shy French girl who eventually escapes from the shell of her shyness while being surrounded by the interesting characters in her daily life. If you are human and have a funny-bone, you should enjoy it! It's a must see movie for anyone that appreciates the humorous side of the human condition.
B000002U88|5.0|A fine album from Bob and the boys, which I bought for Makin Thunderbirds, a fine bit of rock and roll and the rest of the album is fine too. Another item for Seger fans.
B000WQ9UA8|2.0|Regardless of what she does in her personal life (or any entertainer for that matter), I'm still mostly just interested in the music.    Thankfully I did not pay full price for this cd and am only out 6 bucks.  After listening to it, I have considered giving it away to a friend but I almost don't want someone else to have to listen to this trash!  I like her previous music, think she is a decent performer but this cd is atrocious.  Gimme More is catchy and Pieces of Me - not terrible - but now I see why these are the only two singles picked for radio play.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|I purchased this Gizmo for my granddaughter who recently had watched the movie. She loves it!!!  She carrys it around and talks to it...  This is a great purchase! It moves and sounds just like the one on the movie!!
0810993139|5.0|I have purchased two copies of the first edition and already prepurchased the second edition and will get the third one when it is available.  If you can see inside a childs mind, this book would reflect the inner workings!  It is precious and precise and funny.  Children, boys and girls alike will enjoy the book.  I recommend it to children and adults.
1582701709|1.0|The whole information in the book is no more than the definition of 'The law of attraction' (which u can find easily by spending 2 minutes on the net), repeated over and over...and over again.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE GIRLS, I GAVE IT TO 3 OF MY GIRLFRIENDS FOR CHRISTMAS, THEY ALL LOVED IT
1401907741|5.0|I love this book for the inspiring messages.  It is a wonderful way to start the day.  Just open a page and read and it will put you in a positive frame of mind.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Another awesome album from Bruce, with the added bonus of having the E-Street Band back. Greatest songwriter of our generation.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I have only just got this album.  WOW! This is a great listen but something just jumped out when I heard \\"YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY\\".  Go get Brian Wilson and get his additional backing vocals on here Bruce!!!  WHAT A TRACK that could be! The \\"boss\\" and the \\"cosmic 'oo'\\" on the same track! The opening music is Beach Boys/Beatles circa 1967 and then whoomph. This is the sort of music (lyrics excluded) that crank you up a few notches.  A cracker, and the rest of the album is damm good as well...and I've only listened to it twice.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|This is the best prenatal workout dvd I've seen. Erin O'Brien is down to earth, which helps. She keeps the pace fast, so you're getting more of a workout in less time. I would highly recommend this video to anyone wanting to stay fit during their pregnancy!
1400064287|5.0|There are so many reviews of this book, this one may be superfluous, but here is my five-star rating anyway. This is one of those rare books with utterly useful and solid ideas that you can apply immediately in your everyday life, especially if you teach or do any kind of communications work. If you reflect a bit, you probably already know yourself what kinds of ideas stick with you and which you can hear or read umpteen times and retain only the vaguest impression of. This book systematizes this knowledge, illustrating it with vivid examples, so you have it all in one place when you need it. In short, to get your message across so it sticks, tell simple, credible, concrete stories with unexpected, emotional content, and you should be in business! But read the book to get the whole story.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|what a season! if you got hooked and made Gilmore Girls your guilty pleasure, you need to see the season!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This was a Christmas gift and I didn't realize at the time that there are 2 different Planet Earth narrators. I noticed all packaging didn't have the same exact graphics but thought it was just the number of disks.
B00005MP58|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  With all the violence, sex and inappropriate language that is so prevalent in most movies today, I found this movie very refreshing.  The movie was long, but to the viewer's advantage.  It was easier to follow what was happening and why; and the viewer can can get a better grasp on the personalities of the characters.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|Overall, this was a disappointing and disjointed rendition of a novel at least as romantic as Pride and Prejudice, and far more packed with intense longing and poetic imagery.     I admit...Anne and Wentworth were attractive...though Anne never really \\"bloomed\\" into her full potential as I was hoping to see.     While some viewers have a hard time separating the actress that played Lady Russell from some of her previous roles and thus find her performance difficult to appreciate, I thought Lady Russell was well-represented and underused. She was finally given a bit more of a self-righteous and  judgmental edge that I think fits in very well with Austen's summation of her character. In fact, Lady Russell's spot-on portrayal is the pivot point for one of the few scenes in which Captain Wentworth's feelings for Anne actually seem real.     Anne is the most internalized and isolated of the Austen heroines, and  the strongest point of this new PBS adaptation was in the way it  demonstrated that fact of her life. That said, the film didn't do nearly as much (or really anything at all) to help the viewer understand the attractive points of Anne's personality.     It might have helped to SEE Anne discussing books with Captain Benwick then the speech that most strongly sells the Anne-Wentworth relationship could have been used to more effect closer to the end of the film...as it is instead of an impassioned declaration of mutual affection, we see a race around Bath. Including the invalid, Mrs.  Smith!    The race, and some of the odd camera work (there were a lot of very  close, tight shots on people's faces) could have been intended to help  us experience Anne's own feeling of disorientation, but I found it  more distracting and frustrating than helpful. Less motion, and a few nice shots of the romantic Lyme countryside might have have been a better representation of the stagnation Anne feels her life has undergone without Wentworth.    I suspect those familiar with the novel will find this representation less thrilling than reading it again, while those viewers new to the world of Austen would be missing all of the qualities that draw true fans. All of us would be better served to look elsewhere for an enjoyable movie.
B000YAA6AU|2.0|Grief can be a painfully long process, but does that mean a movie needs to capture that experience in real time? Actually a year elapses in this marathon 126-minute film, but director Richard LaGravenese's episodic treatment is so sluggish that the end didn't come soon enough for me. This is the first of several problems with this 2007 romantic dramedy co-written by LaGravenese and Steven Rogers and actually not the biggest. That dubious distinction belongs to star Hilary Swank as Holly Kennedy, a high-strung Manhattan real estate agent closing in on thirty and married nearly a decade to Gerry, a hunky, free-wheeling Irish musician. Physically angular with a performance pitched between severely pinched and gawkily awkward, Swank lacks the innate malleability to carry off the role. It's the type that Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock can do in their sleep, but obviously the torch has to be passed. Despite moments of genuine likeability and vulnerability, Swank lets it drop.<br /><br />The movie opens with a lengthy and extremely contrived marital squabble between Holly and Gerry and then wastes no time in flashing forward months later to Gerry's wake at the Irish bar that Holly's mother runs. Throughout the rest of the movie, Holly grieves by having frequent flashbacks to the happier days with Gerry, that is, when she is not fantasizing about Gerry still being alive. The plot turns on the conceit that he wrote a series of letters before his death that he intends to be delivered to Holly at key moments during her first year without him, and Holly's responses to the letters make up what constitutes the impetus of the storyline. There are some poorly developed turns, but there are some good moments primarily courtesy of an unusually stellar supporting cast starting with Kathy Bates as Holly's straight-shooting mother whose own husband left her in a less tragic manner; Gina Gershon as Sharon, one of Holly's best friends; and Lisa Kudrow as her other friend, the more hedonistic Denise. In fact, Kudrow's crack comedy timing is such a contrast to Swank's tentative, redundant manner that it upsets the balance of the film.<br /><br />The men fare somewhat better. A genuinely charismatic actor, Gerard Butler plays Gerry with such unfettered joy that it really is a wonder why he is attracted to Holly in the first place. Their \\"cute\\" first encounter on an isolated Irish road is painful to watch not because of Gerry's impending doom but because Swank overdoes her impersonation of a naïve college student. As potential paramour Billy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, an American actor who actually does a better Irish accent than Butler (a Scotsman) lends the necessary smoldering presence, but he is painted too ideally to be that compelling. Harry Connick, Jr., on the other hand, plays a genuinely idiosyncratic suitor, Daniel, a somewhat off-kilter bartender who may have Asperger's Syndrome. It's an oddly discomforting ploy, but at least it's different, and Connick shows he still has a good comedy sense. Rural Ireland certainly looks idyllic thanks to Terry Stacey's cinematography, although I have to say the musical soundtrack comes across as too predictably coy to help complement scenes. I recommend skipping this one for more worthwhile treatments on grieving like Anthony Minghella's [[ASIN:B00005R5GK Truly Madly Deeply]] or even Jerry Zucker's [[ASIN:B000LE16VW Ghost]].In fact, Kudrow's crack comedy timing is such a contrast to Swank's tentative, redundant manner that it upsets the balance of the film.

B000Z27HLS|5.0|I ordered this dvd the instant the credits began to roll after it aired on PBS 1-20-08. I really enjoyed the movie(though of course it was a bit too short), and I think almost any fan of Austen would enjoy it as well.     The characters in the movie were very well portrayed. Catherine was  picture perfect to me, as if she had walked right off the page...and Henry was so utterly delightful that I still want to grab him right out of the tv and just hug him until his face turns red. Or...perhaps  a demure kiss on the cheek at least!    While some reviewers found the film a bit racier than expected, I think the racier scenes representing Catherine's daydreams were in keeping with the tone and content of the novels she was actually supposed to be reading...likewise, the allusion to Byron shows a familiarity with the issues of thought, independence, sensuality and immorality which he represented for many people around the time the novel itself would have been written (or slightly before). The mention of Byron by a particular character ties his image to that of another character in the film in a way that I believe to be a very good representation of Austen's intentions in the novel.     My only warning is that people should definitely be wary of watching this as a sort of cliff notes guide to the novel...especially in order to complete any important assignments. (Not that people would do that anyway, of course...it's very wrong...)    As far as the movie was concerned, I can see how the \\"do you think she reads too many novels?\\" comments helped to integrate the wild gothic scenes of Catherine's imagination into the more realistic narrative more fully. In fact, I thought the integration worked pretty well over all... the music, the air of menace around another particular character, and the dark and somewhat hazy lighting of the abbey did a great job of making Catherine's leap of imagination seem plausible (perhaps a smoother transition than in the novel).    I really would have liked to have seen the argument for  reading and imagination in some capacity, and I think the simple  inclusion of Austen's own defense (of novels and novel-writing) as part of Henry's observation that he reads novels(or failing that, perhaps a similar observation by him or his sister prefaced by the question to Catherine\\"what are you reading?\\" and Catherine's response \\"Oh, it is nothing, only a novel\\") would have been simple, effective, and hardly of  consideration in the final editing for time...but I must admit that I  know next to nothing about writing for, directing, filming, or editing  movies...;-)    The omission of such a crucial component of the novel(in this film adaptation)ends up changing the entire message of the novel. The spirited defense of novel writers and readers that Austen states so overtly (and thus so uncharacteristically) is reduced to its corollary--the cautionary tale about letting one's imagination run away with them (and while this corollary starts out quite strongly in the novel, it is quietly reduced by degrees until neither heroine nor reader are completely sure they believe it).     Ultimately however, this film is visually delightful, entertaining and engaging, and questions of the \\"moral\\" of the story (while instructive) are unlikely to detract from any viewer's enjoyment of the adventure of a young lady's first(and only) romance. :-)
0143038419|2.0|I really did not understand what all they hype was about this book.  I found her to be very self-oriented and unrealistic about life.  I just did not care what happened to this woman and could not believe her choices.
0553381407|5.0|Probably 80% of people should read this book.  We often don't realize how much instances of poor parenting affect our adult life.  This book helped me to see, not only the affects of toxic parenting on me, but also I could see the affects of toxic parenting on my own parents by their parents.  This book cannot be read quickly, there is a lot here to ponder about.  Also the second half of the book is extremely good, offering tools for recovery.
B00007LTIA|5.0|There are alot of Negative reviews about this album, so I thought I'd put in my two cents.  I must first say that my review will be more for the 1994 CD release, which I picked up on impulse at a used record store...and what a great impulse it was.    Alot of people advise others to stay away from Tales from Topographic Oceans because they say it is long winded, boring, etc.  I however would reccomend it to fans of prog works such as Thick as a Brick, 2112, or other very long prog works.  This album may not rock as hard as Jethro Tull or Rush, but it's Yes and they have a different sound...and it's awesome.    I have only had this album long enough to listen to it twice, but it is already a favorite, highly reccomended.
0316777722|5.0|The comparison one reviewer makes on the back cover of this book between David Sedaris and Mark Twain is not overblown.  Every page of this book will have you laughing out loud.  David Sedaris has an eye for the humor in the absurd situations he and his kooky family find themselves in.  It's no wonder both he and his sister are famous comedians:  There is enough comedy material in his immediate family alone that it sounds like David could write another twenty books just telling stories about them.
156224003X|5.0|Don't let the fact that this book was written by a musician distract you from buying it if you are not a musician! The principles contained herein are universal and the author has written a book from which anyone can learn if he or she is a seeker. The key here is to be open to new ideas. That is not to say that these are \\"new\\" ideas. The ancients have promulgated the features and benefits of meditation for years. Since, many have written and/or captured on tape, cd, and dvd a variety of approaches to meditation. There is something for everyone it would seem. What made this book unique for me was that it was written by a musician and though the content can be universally applied, it has an intimacy with the musician's struggle. I felt, possibly for the first time ever, that the obstacles I've encountered in my attempts to improve as a drummer, were/are not peculiar to me alone! Indeed, Mr. Werner has written a book about me in the sense that every limitation on my playing appears somewhere on its' pages. My own history is clearly laid out in the first half of the book. Reading it helped me to come to terms with my own mediocrity! Enter the hero (which in this case, is the second half of the book)! It is here where we receive practical, sensible, and easy to follow instructions on how to master ___________ (you fill in the blank). Really, 'Effortless Mastery' is a manual on how to master anything! Since I am a musician, that blank is filled with 'the drums'. I began to apply the instructions Mr. Werner sets out in the book and they had an immediate effect on my playing and my enjoyment of practicing. I am amazed at how simple the application of this book is yet how profound a difference it has made in my rate of improvement on the drums! It doesn't take long to see the difference either. If I could put Kenny Werner's teachings into one simple axiom, it would be: choosing quality over quantity. By paying attention to how we are doing something and how our bodies are responding while we are doing it, we open a whole new world in which opportunities are limitless. But the real expansion in our conciousness takes place when we can detach from the results of our efforts. That is when our efforts become effortless. You simply MUST buy this book and read it, then practice it and your life will change for the absolute better. Of this I am certain! Then you too will be saying, \\"I am a master! I am great!\\" Thank you Kenny Werner, for taking the time to write it and for continuing to spread the word. I have never enjoyed playing music more than I do now. I am a master! I am great!
B000KJTC5A|1.0|We were disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The picture quality was lousy. In some places it was downright blurry.

We were sorry we spent our money on it.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband.  There is lots of extra footage and information on the DVDs.  The reason I purchased this particular series was the unique packaging.  It is beautifully cased and looks fantastic just sitting by the DVD player.

B00005JPXY|3.0|Last night, my gym buddy, feeling rather restless towards the evening, invited me to join him in movie watching.<br /><br />I recall having watched a fascinating teaser trailer of a sci-fi action movie, named 'Cloverfield' on cable television, where the Statute of Liberty had its concrete head blown off.<br /><br />So, we headed down to the Jurong Entertainment Centre together to watch the movie.<br /><br />The movie did not start off even with the movie title or the names of principal actors & actresses from the opening scene.<br />All we could see at the very beginning segment was a quick flash-by placard showing 'Bad Robot', followed by captioned scenes of the Central Park in New York.<br /><br />There were some muddled messages about a video footage & the US Department of Defence.<br /><br />All this while, the movie had continuously very jerky & erratic images, as if we were watching a cheapskate home-made movie from a hand-held camcorder.<br /><br />All I could figure out was this scenario:<br /><br />A young guy, Hud, was apparently assigned to take some live video clips of a sending-off party for his best friend, Rob, who would be going off to Tokyo soon. Some of the party goers were given the opportunity to say something nice about Rob. The setting was Lower Manhattan, New York.<br /><br />His girl friend, Beth, suddenly appeared with another guy. There was a quarrel, & Beth left abruptly. In between, the camcorder went into rewind mode, where we could see fleeting images of Rob having a good time with Beth.<br /><br />Sometimes, we could see Hud focusing the camcorder on a beautiful damsel, who somehow fascinated him during the filming.<br /><br />All these captured as well rewinded images went on for some fifteen or twenty minutes.<br /><br />Actually, I was about to stand up & go down to the management office to give them a piece of my mind, thinking that their guy in the projector room probably screwed up something.<br /><br />Then, came some sort of a thundering earthquake, which apparently rocked the whole building, where the party was held. Naturally, I stayed back in my seat.<br /><br />Frightened, & puzzled, all the party goers went down to the streets. In the next moment, some tall buildings started to crash down. Sad images of the terrorist strike on the World Trade Centre flashed through my mind, as I watched the crumbling of skyscrapers.<br /><br />Strangely, our friend, Hud, continued to capture everything happening around him on his camcorder, while his close friends were desperately struggling to understand what was going on.<br /><br />For some split seconds, the camcorder actually captured fleeting images of something live, but definitely gargantuan, moving about in the background. What the hell was that, I was thinking. I was sure all those guys out there felt the same.<br /><br />The next scene was rather chilling, with the dislodged concrete head of the Statute of Liberty suddenly crashing & rolling on to the streets.<br /><br />Suddenly, amidst the chaos, everybody started to run &/or hide in a nearby supermarket. The streets were ripped apart. Worst still, the Brooklyn Bridge was eventually demolished by 'something out there'.<br /><br />The movie continued with the four or five original party goers on the run from 'something out there'.<br /><br />Hud, seemingly dedicated to his assignment, continued to capture every running &/or escape scene on film. He was adamant, as he felt that 'people gonna want to know . . . & how it all went down'.<br /><br />The next few scenes showed some soldiers appearing on the scene, with tank support, & battling the gargantuan creature lurking in the background of tall buildings.<br /><br />Then, Rob suddenly received a phone call from Beth. She was in trouble & needed his help, but her location was right inside the danger zone. Rob decided to back trek, to commence a frenzied search for her, against the wishes of his friends. For some strange reasons, the friends decided to tag along. They then moved precariously through the darkened subway tunnel, with rats running around, to reach Beth's location.<br /><br />Along the way, they encountered some fast-moving spider-like creatures in the underground.<br /><br />One of the lady friends got bitten quite badly.<br /><br />They finally reached the tall building where Beth was located. They went up to one of the top floors on foot, as the lifts were out of order. Rob eventually found Beth. Together with Hud, who continued to lug around with his camcorder, & another lady friend, they scrambled down the building very quickly to reach a helicopter pick-up point, as arranged earlier with the rescuing soldiers.<br /><br />Luckily, they made it to the two rescuing helicopters. From the hovering helicopters, they could see that the gargantuan creature was being blasted with bombs from military aircrafts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that damned creature was still alive.<br /><br />All I could see subsequently was that one of the helicopters was chewed up by that monster. It then crashed into a grass patch, probably near Central Park. There were many dark images that followed, which I could not make sense of at all. Next, I could see the dark image of Hud's dead body, apparently with a twisted neck.<br /><br />Then, the whole movie just ended there & then, with credit titles starting to come up on screen.<br /><br />We walked out of the movie theatre, more dazed & lost than disappointed.<br /><br />Throughout the ninety minutes of movie time, the Godzilla-like monster was not actually seen in its entirety, only being viewed from different angles, as if the audience was supposed to piece everything together. Along with the monster, there were snippets of those little creepy spider-like monsters running around.<br /><br />The whole movie was quite disorienting. I still could not figure out what was all about. There were too many unanswered questions. There wasn't any proper closure.<br /><br />Acting-wise, all the actors & actresses were practically unknown, as far as my gym buddy & I are concerned.<br /><br />The cinematography, with all the jerky & erratic images from start to finish, was horrendous, to say the least.<br /><br />Come to think of it, there wasn't any music in the background, only ambient sounds such as creeks & thumps.<br /><br />Sometimes, I felt that the dialogue between the characters really drove me bonkers, e.g. \\"Oh, My God, you know Superman, too? Geez, I'm feeling the connection . . . Have you heard of Garfield?\\"<br /><br />Until now, I still couldn't figure out the connection of the movie title, 'Cloverfield' with the theme or story plot of the movie.<br /><br />Surprisingly, this movie was a J J Abrams project, the same brains behind the 'Lost' & 'Alias' TV suspense series.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|As good an action/adventure movie as you'll see.  Hits the ground running and somehow keeps increasing the pace.  The effects, stunts and action keep getting bigger, better, faster.  There is an actual plot, and character development.  Voluntary suspension of disbelief happens despite the jaw-dropping nature of what you see.  I found myself shaking my head in glee and amazement at the same time.  Bruce Willis manages to add another layer or two to McLain while keeping the wisecracks coming, and the supporting cast is very strong, creating characters the viewer cares about.  One suggestion - see it on as big a screen as you can - the sequence with the jet is really something on a big screen.

1416523359|3.0|If you can get through the first fifty-or-so pages of this book, it will be worth your time. I no longer waste my time reading boring or hard-to-read books, but based on the great stories in Stephen King's past work, I thought I'd take a chance. Glad I did - after the first few chapters filled with REALLY annoying baby talk, the story picked up and became a vintage Stephen King otherwordly joyride.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|On initial review, all I could do was compare this film to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, and so I was less than objective. However, this film is NOT that other version and needs to be reviewed and weighted on its own merits. It does follow the storyline rather well, and while some scenes do seem a bit rushed, it is still true to the heart of this moving story.     Upon a 2nd and third viewing, I found the film rather charming, the acting good, the scenery and sets excellent. So, I would recommend this film. I think it is especially good for someone new to Jane Austen, but I feel that even Jane Austen fans will come to appreciate the film if they can but give it a chance.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Wow, what a fantastic series! And to see our planet from such a different view!     First of all, I am not one for watching nature documentaries, (can't stand all that blood and gore when a prey is caught and torn to bits) but I caught a glimpse of this series, when previewed on Oprah, and thought my hubby would like it, and got it for him. All I can say is that I was the one who devoured every minute of it. There was no gut-churning bloody imagery, so it was right up my alley and I was riveted.       Every episode is packed with images so beautiful and breathtaking that it will leave you speechless by the splendor of it all. All I can say, if you're like me, give this a chance and watch it. You won't make a mistake. It will bring tears to your eyes to see what a wonderful and amazing planet we live in.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love the classics, and this version of Jane Eyre is wonderful.     It was an afternoon well-spent, watching this series with my teen daughter. Since there is so many reviews done of JE, I'm not going to give one.   I liked the casting of Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens as Jane and Rochester. They did a great job of portraying the characters and the chemistry between them alone keeps you riveted to your screen.     Yes, I know Toby Stephens is far too handsome for this role but he captures Rochester's abrasive and mercurial temperament superbly. He is a tortured soul. You can sense his vulnerability and loneliness quite keenly at times.   I enjoyed his interaction with Jane, in whom he sensed a kindered spirit. You can feel his passion, simmering just beneath the surface. He wants Jane badly but must keep her at arms length, (because of a dark secret revealed later on) and his frustration in failing to do so is so tangible.       Ruth Wilson was perfect as Jane. Her passion and zest for life just simmers beneath her sombre and reserve exterior. Despite her harsh childhood she grows up sweet and kind.   She's takes one look at Rochester and falls  for him. She sees through his abrasive manner, sees his inner pain and is captured by his wit, humour and vulnerability. She practically glows when she's with him.    Her absolute love for Rochester makes you feel her pain when things fall apart.    This is one series I know I will be watching repeatedly as it's a definite keeper, with its gorgeous outdoor scenery, wonderful costumes and perfect casting.    My only gripe is, I wished they had sub-titled this series. I hated missing even one word of dialogue!

B000NVIGC0|3.0|Wilco seems like a band that is lost.  I was eagerly anticipating this release, especially after the surprisingly good \\"Live In Chicago\\", but it seems to lack the wit and energy of their previous releases.  I am probably one of the few who really liked \\"A Ghost Is Born\\" (it's like a fine wine- it gets better with age!), which had some very energetic and creative tunes (\\"Handshake Drugs\\", \\"Hummingbirds\\"), something that is sorely lacking in \\"Sky Blue Sky\\".  Sadly, SBS actually put me to sleep!  All the songs sound similar; none really stands out.  That being said, I gave it three stars because:  it's Wilco, and even a bad Wilco release is better than most everything else that is out there; the instrumentation is just wonderful, these guys actually know how to play their instruments; there are flashes of new sounds and styles, as the tone was more bluesish and jazzish.  Here's hoping that this is is just an anomaly and not an indication that Wilco has slipped into mediocrity.

B000QFAJ7S|1.0|\\"Thankful\\" was an okay release, but it was the first release of any kind by an Idol.  \\"Breakaway\\" was a wonderful CD.  This CD is just plain awful.  Kelly's advisers were right, that this CD should not have been made.  Me and my three daughters listened to this CD; it was unanimous that it is really really bad.  It is so bad that if I did not have the complete Kelly collection, I probably would not by another Kelly release.  This release is what is called a \\"career killer\\".  I would not recommend this release to anyone.
B00005JKNC|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  Some of my friends don't and I don't have a clue why.  It's a serious role for Jim Carey, something you don't often see.  There are also some other faces you will recognize, like Martin Landau (Space 1999) and the town doctor (one of the Major Franks from Mash).<br /><br />Jim Carey is a Hollywood Writer who is named as having possible Communist ties in the McCarthy witchhunt for communists period in our history.  (If you were named as a possible Communist, you were blackballed until your name was cleared--guilty before proven innocent.  By the way, you cleared yourself by being investigated and naming someone else.)<br /><br />Jim gets disgusted when, after being accused, the plug on his film project is pulled and he takes off for a drive.  He has an accident, loses his memory, and wakes up on the beach in a small town where he is recognized as Martin Landau's son Luke, who went off to war and has been gone for many years.<br /><br />It's a great flick about a town who gave up more than it's share of young men to fight in the war and many never returned.  The whole town celebrates Luke's return as he rekindles his former love relationship with his girl and fond remeberances with the town's people, in the backlight are the McCarthy trials and how they infringe on the rights of the people.<br /><br />Like I said, great story line.  You fall in love with the whole town as it enfolds.

B000ZN8036|5.0|The Best Film of 2007!! And The Best Film I have seen since The Ring Trilogy. It immediately catapulted into my Top Five Films of all time! A Stunning Work of Art! This is what I love about film. Every once in a while you stumble upon a work of art that renews your faith in filmmakers with poetry in their hearts. This is one of those films.<br /><br />A life influenced by Thoreau and Jack London. A non-fiction tale that could have been penned by Maugham or Kerouac about a young man with an Eagle Spirit. His Bohemian quest for wisdom, freedom, and oneness with the creator. And the few souls that were touched by his native heart along the way. Chyroned by journal entries and poetic musings. A search for truth, shamanic recapitulation, and liberation of the psyche. A beautiful soul's delinquent realization of love at the final hour. A warrior facing his own death. It's tragic and mortally liberating consequences.<br /><br />Wide open vistas and panoramic splendor grace the frames of this oil painting, like Adam's first journey thru The Garden. Eric Gautier's incredible cinematography, Sean Penn's masterful direction, and Emile Hirsch's stunning portrayal achieve a beautiful, glorious, poetic, uplifting, and tragic celebration of the heart.<br /><br />Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder adds a solemn air to the proceedings.<br /><br />Self-destruction is a very different act than annihilation of the self. Or the ego. Which is what Chris was all about. He lived more life in 22 years, than most of us live in a lifetime.<br /><br />Thank You Sean,<br /><br />I have a best friend that is with me now, only in spirit. He too, was a Free Spirit. He loved to climb mountains. The taller the better. At the end of his life, he was climbing mountains with an oxygen tank. He died of Cystic Fibrosis in the mid 90's. I wish I had gone hiking with him more often. Now he's gone. A clairvoyant I knew, once called him an Eagle Spirit. Thank You, for also making this film about my friend David Foster. I loved him. He would have loved this film. He was one of the oldest living CF patients in the U.S. He was in his mid-thirties and survived a lung transplant before he passed. Your film touched me in ways you can't possibly imagine. David was a warrior, just like Chris. And I witnessed the same withering of his temple. Thank You, again!<br /><br />I'm sure Chris is painting a beautiful landscape, somewhere in time, as a Warrior God. He is smiling down on his creation as he floats on Eagle Cloud. I just know, David is with him.<br /><br />Bravo, man! I stand in awe! You captured the shamanic recapitulation of Christopher's soul with remarkable clarity and insight. Beautiful work. You have the soul of a warrior poet. Bless. Thank You, for this amazing Work of Art.<br /><br />Life affiming. Yes, Love is the only path with heart.<br /><br />ONE OF THE GREATEST POEMS I'VE EVER SEEN ON FILM. I'm blown away.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|Zombies, laughs, blood and guts, pints, Queen......what more could you want? I love this movie. Don't know if too many women will be into it, my wife watched it and didn't find it as funny as I did.
B00004W221|3.0|\\"Rudy\\" is a film about fighting for your dreams, having confidence in yourself, and never giving up.  While this is a good message, I can't say that this story is the best way to present the message.  We laughed pretty hard at some of the parts, simply because they were so 1) un-real (would never happen) or 2) so expected, therefore just like what you think would happen, and really does.  The main character gets a little annoying sometimes with is mentality that he will make it onto the Notre Dame football team, even though he wasn't a great player.<br />While the message is memorable, \\"Rudy\\" is one of those films that you watch and think, \\"Why did they spend thousands of dollars on THAT?\\".
B000M341QE|2.0|Why was everybody so hyped about this movie? My wife and I borrowed it from a neighbor who raved about it and we were both very disappointed. I was bored during most of the movie. I can't believe people thought it was so great. My Mom bought it and has watched it 5+ times. I could hardly sit through one viewing, wondering when it was going to end. Over-rated!
B000YIGNKE|3.0|While I enjoyed the new version of Persuasion, I was also disappointed in it. First of all, why only 90 minutes -- and by the time they did all the introductions, credits, etc. it was actually much shorter than that.<br />I have to begin by saying that I was really irritated when Anne's soulful speech about the constancy of men and women in love became part of her discussion at the dinner table at Lyme. In the book, Wentworth overhears Anne and Harville talking much later in the story and then writes the letter to her which prompts their reunion. This scene was created by Jane Austen as part of her rewrite of Persuasion specifically to improve the strength of the end of the story. Why would anyone want to second guess her?<br />As for the new version of the reconciliation, I guess since the writer used up the conversation about constancy earlier in the story, he had to invent a different way to explain how Anne and the Captain finally get together. The result is those rather silly and inappropriate scenes in which Anne is running all over Bath. Someone with Anne's upbringing would never have done that!<br />And their first kiss...it was embarassing to see how long it took them to get their lips together. Her lips, which were supposed to be quivering with anticipation I guess, instead looked like a fish out of water gasping for air. I blame some of these bad moments on the director, not the actors.<br />That said, I mostly liked Sally Hawkins as Anne. Sometimes she looked really pretty and sometimes she looked rather plain -- which is how I saw Anne when I read the book. Hawkins also did well portraying Anne's quiet strength and character.<br />Rupert Penry-Jones is gorgeous and did a great job as Wentworth(what a change from his role in the TV show Spooks/MI-5), but he definately did not look as if he had spent even a single day on the deck of a ship. His pale complexion was too perfect.<br />As for the dreadful portrayal of Mary Musgrove -- Where did that insipid laugh that the actress used several times come from?<br />Finally, what to say about the ending that was added! There is no way that Wentworth could have purchased Kellynch Hall -- lease it maybe but not buy it. He was rich but I don't think he could have afforded it even if Mr. Elliot was willing or able to sell (which I don't think he would be considering it was undoubtedly entailed to the younger Mr. Elliot).<br />This was such an opportunity to do something really remarkable and as far as I'm concerned, this movie missed the mark. Masterpiece Theater is usually great so I was surprised.<br />Ok, having said all of these negative things, I have to admit I enjoyed it at some level and it was definately better on second viewing but I'd rather spend my time watching the earlier version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hind -- or better still, reading the book.ess used several times come from?

B00000K19E|5.0|I've watched the Matrix again and again. The premise is extremely thought-provoking ... that we live in a world that isn't really what we believe it to be. There are plenty of spiritual connotations here about rebirth, seeing things for what they really are, etc. While I'm not a big fan of Keanu Reeves (really don't think he's all that great of an actor), his deer-in-the-headlights performance worked well for his character. No matter how many times you watch it, you will still get new insights from this great movie.
B00005JNTX|3.0|In black and white like an old gangster movie the gravel voiced good guys<br />are too tough to die without a second shot of electricity...<br />With all the blood, guts, torture and killing it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. All the girls are just as tough and ready as the guys : it's hard to find one that isn't some kind of slut or whore.<br />There is no shade of gray in these bad guys or monsters. It always seems like the bad guys are rich , powerful and on the edge of winning or pulling off  some unspeakable crime like child torture and killing,<br />but the good guys take the bullets and come back for more.<br />Reminds one of a Dick Tracy serial from the 30's.
B0000542D2|5.0|The Beatles' attempt to follow Elvis' lead by making a movie surpassed any of Pressley's productions in this classic, artsy black-and-white comedy.  The Fab Four, complimentary compared to the Marx Brothers, are filmed \\"in a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room\\" (as Paul's grandfather complains), but anywhere the Beatles show up makes it an extraordinary place.  The witty humor, the unforgettable songs, the impeccable casting of supporting characters, topped off with the ambiance that Beatlemania created...all of these ingredients produced a feast for the eyes and ears that can easily be watched over and over.  It's just a shame that only 5 stars can be given!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I don't know why the last guy gave it 1 star, he is obviously an idiot and knows nothing about DVD vs. HD-DVD.  This set is totally worth it.  It came shipped to me fast and in great shape...Thanks Amazon!!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is an incredible album!  I absolutely love his version of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" which is one of my all time favorite songs.  Also \\"Personal Jesus\\" and \\"Desperado\\" are good listens.  Don't even think twice about buying this album, it's incredible!!
B000056HE9|5.0|Excellent movie.  Classic Cary Grant movie with Cary playing the one who DOESN'T get the woman in the end.  Nice movie.
1400077915|5.0|Somebody around here nominated Munro for a Nobel prize and for the title of strongest writer in the English language. Tempted by so much praise from a trustworthy source, I tested/tasted the Runaway and I second the motion.<br />The title story itself is one of the best long short stories that I can remember. (But I would still like to know what happened to Flora...)<br />The story called 'Silence' is a very troubling horror story out of real life.<br />Munro writes about daily life and 'human' relations and neighborhood problems and life stories, including several versions of plausible horror, with a simplicity and precision that can only be achieved through hard work (or through lucky genius). She is entirely free of mannerisms and of cheap tricks (unlike some contemporary American writers that I am just having a big disagreement about.)<br />Outstanding.
B00003CX9W|2.0|This applies to [[ASIN:B00003CX9W Fantasia (Special 60th Anniversary Edition)]] I have loved Fantasia since seeing it as a kid in the late 1940s, and had hoped for a perhaps cleaner/remastered DVD copy of what I already have (the 1991 VHS 2-tape release, which is very good). Unfortunately, in excising an admittedly racist-appearing segment within the Beethoven &#34;Pastorale&#34;, *this* version uses a glaringly-apparent close zoom into the artwork - which is downright ugly and pretty much ruins the viewing experience. While I'm inclined to agree with taking the scene out, I think it was done much better on the VHS tape (I never noticed the deletion, not recalling the scene all that well from my first exposure).
0060573775|5.0|Outstanding reading by E Hawke.  Billy Pilgrim, presents a timeless player, like Don Quixote.  He's absurd with his surroundings.  Just like you are.  Buy Cat's Cradle as well.
1594481717|4.0|I had the good fortune to hear Daniel Pink speak in the DC area this month.  See him if you can - he is a very entertaining and engaging speaker.  Likewise this book is both entertaining and engaging, though sometimes I felt it was rather superficial.  This is not because Pink does not explain his thesis well, but rather because there is not much detail at the level of the practical: how to actually use right-brained thinking whether at work or at home.    That said, Pink certainly makes a compelling case that the three A's - Abundance, Asia and Automation - have cheapened the value of the traditional left-brain oriented skills of logical thinking and sequential processing associated with the knowledge economy.  What that leaves - the action that cannot be outsourced or automated - is work that is high touch and/or high concept.  Success in the new high touch/high concept economy will require mastery of at least one (better more than one) of six essential aptitudes: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play and Meaning.    Pink pulls the reader along on a Nantucket sleigh ride survey of these six aptitudes.  Various concepts lumber into sight and are spotted and identified, but the book does not linger on any one of them for very long.  For me, the book affirmed some ideas that I already find attractive (the neglected importance of story, work re-cast as play, the overarching importance of meaning and purpose), but I would have appreciated a few more examples of the ideas in practice.    Overall assessment: a stimulating read.  Recommended.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|For this Ultimate Edition was well worth the wait. The transfer and addition to the film was flawless, and it brought me back to a younger time when I originally viewed the film in the theater back in '82. The work on this film was definitely a labor of love for the material and for anyone to say otherwise isn't just possible. The feel for this project was not lost over the years and with the new material, as it just enhanced this film overall. The dark tone, the question of Decker's own humanity, and the overall quest for life was not lost in this translation at all.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Typical John Mayer! Very good selections of musical jazz and blue's songs. Nice acoustic guitar. Smooth and easy to listen to without a lot of crowd noise that accompanies live albums!
B000VJ271A|5.0|First of all the production.  Some may find this stripped down, unit set goes against the roccoco splendour and excess usually associated with productions of Massenet's most famous opera too bare bones, but McVicar is on to something.  In this sort of semi circle, bull ring type atmosphere  everything - and I mean everything - must and does come from the singers.       Some may also prefer the opulent tone of Fleming in the role, or the dark liquidy sexiness of Netrebko, but for my money, Dessay is my ideal as Manon.  Her performance here is nothing short of astonishing - maybe THE Manon of our day who is completely believable in all stages of Manon's development.  Her \\"Adieu, petite table\\" was so organic, so revealing, showing how conflicted this young woman was between true love and the lure of a luxurious lifestyle.  Whereas I don't often feel pity for Manon until the end, Dessay had me right here.  And she wouldn't let go.     Where many sopranos treat the Gavotte as the showpiece of the night, Dessay does something unique that just blew me away, singing the second strophe of the aria almost entirely inward looking - introducing a genuinely introspective quality to it.  It's as though the crowd has melted away and she's singing this entirely for herself, fully understanding the words, then with a sudden recognition of who and where she is, puts back on her game face, which may fool the crowd at the Cour de Reine, but not the viewing audience.  It is an absolute tour de force of vocal acting and the audience appropriately goes mad with the longest ovation of the night.  But something else happened, too, during this scene that grabbed me as few Manons have:  the melodramma between Manon and Count des Grieux, her questions, his answers, came alive in a way that made the scene crackle.  Ramey, given concerns about his \\"wobble\\" was authoritative, if not vocally splendid, and his speaking voice retains a grave, elegant quality that, (at least for me) made the role a success.       Villazon is every bit Dessay's equal on just about every level.  A few oddly shaped phrases of his French, and a harsh note or two crept in at the beginning, but his Des Grieux is so entirely believable, so loveably innocent that one cannot help but feel for him every step of the way.  I felt \\"THIS\\" is who Des Grieux sounds.  His \\"Ah Fuyez\\" was propulsive, musical and gut wrenching.  (At times, not always, his darkened, timbre reminds me of a certain Spanish tenor in his youth.)     When Manon arrives at St. Sulplice, it is with a feverish intensity.  Clearly burning with madness and desire, she casts off her duster looking almost as though she will explode.  When she desparately cries out her prayer, you know this woman is completely overwhelmed by her feelings - she is unraveling - though probably fixed to a plan, has no idea as to how she's going to proceed - that prayer is desperation itself.  Instead of acting out the usual seduction scene Dessay appears to her former lover as though a wounded bird, and Des Grieux fights - a little violently - to restrain himself from caving in, but he cannot keep from touching her and his fate is doomed right here.  Explosive is not too strong a word for the quality these two infuse this scene with and here they are lighting up one of Massenet's greatest, grandest moments.  (At the conclusion of this scene I had to hit \\"pause\\" and have a cigarette.)       The final scene had me in nonstop tears, Dessay presenting a ruined, truly pathetic rag of a girl, and her quiet death (no gasp on \\"Lescaut\\") and Villazon's reaction made me shudder as he kisses her, raises her almost refusing to believe what just happened.  Amazing.     Victor Pablo Perez leads the Liceu forces in a very French sounding performance, catching Massenet's nuances, breathing with his singers so naturally it was refreshing.       This Manon is truly a marvelous example of total music theatre - everything coming together about as perfectly as I couldhave wanted.  Anyone who loves Massenet, really owes it to themself to have this disc in their library.  As Pepe noted, for the price - it's one of the best operatic bargains you'll find.       I'm still all verklempt over this one, gang!       p.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|This Fritz Lang classic amazes one and all with it's freshness and moderness even in this 21st century. The special effects avant garde for it's time still look very convincing in today's age of CGI effects. The basic special effects techniques used in Metropolis are even used today in modern cinema. The orchestral soundrack by the composer sizzles. There is a motif which is played for every character and mood of every imortant character. There is a theme music for the underground workers, one for the M machine, a theme for Joh Federson, for the heroine, one for the vamp etc. The story is about the the poor people who work in an underground city to keep all the machines running with their sweat and blood for wages so that the rich guys staying over the ground can have their systems working properly. It looks like the people underground keep the machines running which are necessary for electricity and other important characteristics of the rich people's world. There are some brilliant camera movies, some amazing collages of shots, great artwork, and some good old illusion tricks for providing some nice special effects. The movie represents the class struggle, and seeks for equality of rights between the poor and the rich. Parts of the movie being missing are replaced by placards which inform us of what has gone between the missing scenes. The movie was restored for this new version and the restoration was done by a film museum in Frankfurt, There is a 45 minute analysis of the movie and also an interview by the restorer of the film who explains the restoration process and what combination of techniques they had to use inorder to get the final restored version in place.    regards, Vikram
B00005B6C9|5.0|I have always been a devoted fan of the BeeGees since way back and got this CD when it first came out and have played so much I had to replace it recently.  This CD if a wonderful gift of their talents as the BeeGees and so very sad that this was their last CD together.  I love \\"Sacred Trust\\" and it reminds me of their song \\"Alone\\" which is one of my absolute favorites besides \\"Nights on Broadway\\".  I truly hope Robin and Barry continue in their music as it would be a shame to not hear these truly talented voices again.  Maurice would want them to continue.  Long live the BeeGees in our hearts.

0061251305|5.0|To all those wondering \\"Why?\\" and \\"How?\\" certain organizations are more productive than their peers, Logan, King and  Fischer-Wright have some concrete answers.  In their landmark book, \\"Tribal Leadership\\", they explore the essence of organizational culture.  What they have uncovered is a dynamic at least 15,000 years in the making, and at the heart of  all human organizations:  the tribe.  We operate in a \\"tribe\\"-a group of  20 to 150 people- in which important decisions are made and productivity is determined.  Larger organizations are \\"tribes of tribes\\".  Five stages describe the evolution of the tribe, from savage and dysfunctional to innovative and powerfully inspirational.  What sets this work apart is its practical advice on both identifying the stage of the tribe and the means to advance to the next stage.  Laced with real-life examples, the book is eminently readable.  There is no doubt it will transform the reader, no matter where their own tribe finds itself. They will understand the difference between leading and commanding.
0446577391|5.0|This is Balcacci's fourth book in the Camel Club series and it is excellent. I suggest reading the three earlier books before reading this.
006091307X|4.0|Thomas Pynchon's books are always interesting and unpredictable. It is worth the effort of the reader to understand the details of the pages, even when they appear to be random. The reward is an increase in mental \\"entropy\\" that allows for increased connections of ideas as the book progresses. The main character, Oedipa is a \\"Maxwell demon\\" who seeks to control this entropy.<br /><br />The Crying of Lot 49 is relatively low in entropy compared to Pynchon's most recent novel, Against the Day. In fact the author was critical of TCL49 indicating that he had forgotten important lessons learned in earlier writing. The plot is a little too transparent, giving the reader limited insightful information. It is a good introduction to the writing of Pynchon for those readers who are not used to doing research about allusions presented in novels.<br /><br />The plot is like a detective story with unusual characters, a secret organization, and the sneaking suspicion that there is something more to California life in the 1960's than meets the convoluted highway surface. Paranoia is rampant with the feeling of living in a revenge play that may be real or only a narcissistic illusion. This short book is a good gateway to Pynchon's more satisfying longer books.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I love this movie!! I watch it with my kids , 21 and 18 , and they laugh when I get excited about the clothes...the bikes....the ponchos !! It is just a big reminder of my childhood. Now the music ...it just makes you want to dance...my kids even added the soundtrack to the ipods. It is one of those movies that make you happy and can be enjoyed over and over.
B00008973Q|5.0|This is an amazing movie. If you're a Kurosawa fan, don't hesitate to buy this. If you're not yet a fan, you may want to start with \\"Seven Samurai\\"--less blood.
