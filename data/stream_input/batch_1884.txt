B004SBULWE|5.0|A must for Android! For future improvement to this app, I would like to see this app kill background tasks also.
0670451495|5.0|I got this for my new little nephew. We have a family tradition of going to Boston and seeing the statue in the Public Gardens of the ducklings.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|How could your go wrong with Rod Stewart and great songs.  It is easy listening at its best.  Buy it and enjoy.
B0041TM5OU|5.0|My son is a young jazz artist who currently attends our local California State University. He's a liberal arts major who plays both electric and stand-up bass, and sings in their choirs. He loves the traditional greats, like Guaraldi, Montgomery, Brubeck and Mingus. This album was a Christmas present, and makes for a wonderful addition to his collection.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|I would recommend purchase.  I enjoyed the movie. Very entertaing. A little different. But kids seemed to like it. I plan to purchase.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a staple for my Kindle Fire. Instant acces to weather on a tablet that comes up in a second. It can't get better than that.<br />This is the best weather app... Quick response... no extraneous crap... Just the weather in a format thats clear and concise. Thanks!
0425263916|5.0|The book is a great love story between two people. It is a lot like fifty shades of grey. It is a great read.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|I've been a reviewer for some time. Now as I take my Kindle fire with me, I have online access as I travel around town and across the country.  Thanks!
B0035FQ1UU|3.0|Watched this the day after the world was supposed to end as a &#34;ha-ha, we're still here&#34; type of thing. A good apocalyptic movie if you ever need a good spooking.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Since I don't have a smartphone, Twitter on my Kindle Fire is my 1st opportunity to actually experience real time tweets. Thanks!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|It's true what they say, you will most likely cry within the first 10 minutes. I know I did. Definitely the cutest and most inspiring Disney movie I have seen in years.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Having a calculator at your fingetips on the Kindle Fire is an important app for lots of shopping, finance, restaurants, and everyday random thought that require advanced cyphering... Thanks!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is a perfect app. I love how simple it is. You can navigate the entire site with such ease.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|With a Kindle Fire you're downtown.. looking for a hot spot... there are 10 WIFI's going around the area... Which one is stongest? Which one is protected and blocked?  This is a time saver... Thanks!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son downloaded this on his Kindle Fire  and he can't get enough. It is a great ap for a great price. FREE&#62;
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|free-ebooks for my Kindle Fire. They charge me for a Kindle app but with this I can read them as free book that are actually free.<br />Also I can convert documents and read pdfs online. Great. Thanks!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I just downloaded this app on my son's Kindle Fire. He really likes it and he uses it for everything.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|They still got it. Fabulous CD's and DVD's. I would highly recommend for any Led Zeppelin fans.  It is a tragedy that they're not touring anymore.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The location of the camera makes it difficult to take a picture and view what your shooting at the same time, would be a lot nicer if the camera worked as it does on cell phones screen on one side and camera object on the other.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is awesome even though it only took me a little amount of time to read it I have all of the other books my daughter and son love these books(: who wouldn't want to read the hilarious book about the love of to boys and trying to find a date for the Valentine dance
B0058W74UY|1.0|This app appeared to help for videos on the web to run, however its not working, the videos will not play
B004WR125O|1.0|Had bought this to get FM channeled in via the receiver. I have at least 10 other devices on the network, but this one refuses to cooperate :).<br /><br />Other reviews indicate that it may work only with certain encryption settings. Not ready to downgrade my network. Either way I am happy with my Roku that streams video too.
B00845PRDS|5.0|So easy to find and purchase Act of Valor, couldn't find it in my price range in other stores so Amazon was my go to supplier of good video material.
0743490304|4.0|Love all of Dan Brown's book so..got this one because I liked everyone of his books I had previously read. I really like it too!
B003O86FMW|4.0|The Second Book is as commanding as the first. Very good read for young and old alike. I can't wait to read the Third Book.
B0013ND30M|4.0|Have been collecting Walt Disney VHS movies since the 1970's and since VHS is now turning into DVD's, couldn't get the VHS I had taped correctly so...decided to buy this for my collection.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|All you have to do is look at the title. This is just a neat, fun little pocket game.  And it's free, what more do you need
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is an old movie that I wanted for my personal satisfaction. I think it is one of the greatest and best, especially at Christmas time of the year. And am afraid that someday, it will not be shown on television.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm just in love with this trilogy so much that I had to read it again, and possibly will again, and again, and again ..
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed Alexander's detailed description of what he felt, saw,and experienced.  I appreciated his explanation of the science behind his new belief.  He did not connect his other demensional travels with any one religion so I was surprised by the title, &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;.  After some google research, I discovered that all the religions I looked at had a heaven.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I read the book and was looking forward to this movie.  But it does disappoint.  The only similarities between the movie and the book are Abe and the title.<br /><br />Abe was a busy man, lawyer, slayer and President.  And he found time to free the slaves.<br /><br />Decent action, but the story is somewhat long and drawn out.
0062127241|5.0|Our son was thrilled to get this for Christmas. He forgot that he mentioned it in passing. He collects rock biographies and this is top of his list.
0316227706|5.0|I have no idea how they got these photos, but this is one amazing book.  That shows dogs in a way that I've never seen before.<br /><br />Seriously, you're voice will go out from saying, &#34;Aww,&#34; so many times.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I ordered this for my 11 year old daughter. It was part of her Christmas list. She absolutely loves it. I'm pretty sure she has played it at least 100 times in the past 3 days!!
B0091Q82L8|5.0|I have been playing bass since 1964.<br />I have intently listened to Live@Leeds since purchasing the vinyl when it was released.<br />No, the bass parts of the first four songs aren't taken from Live@Leeds and placed in Live@Hull.<br />They aren't the same. It doesn't take a professional bassist to hear this though. As interactive as the Who were as a band this substitution would be near impossible anyway.<br />I'm writing because that review almost prevented my listening to and enjoying this release!<br />So if you missed my point, it's just no as in \\"no\\".
B005MYWZKM|5.0|This was on my Christmas list and I absolutely love it!!! It is everything I hoped for. I totally rock out listening to it.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|Fun and easy to learn.  First time with a device that tilts to play, so a bit spastic, but gripping game play for me.  Yes, the graphics are a bit elementary, but we are having a blast with it.  Best part...speed and no tickets!!!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This was a hard to find item my son had on his Christmas list. I found it here on Amazon and he loves it. It has provided hours of entertainment for him and the entire family.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|as you peoples can see that I luv this app because I have five stars. don't forget-be safe on leps world.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is exactly what my daughter wanted for Christmas and she loves this show. This was a great value and a good price. Very fast shipping, thanks!!
B002IKLZZY|4.0|This Hitchcock film -- filled with clever wit after the darker Vertigo of a year earlier -- is still an excellent film. My contemporary university students loved it.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I'm glad this game finally came up as the free app of the day. Pretty expensive otherwise.  Animations are great, and I have not experienced any crashing or loading problems.  Can be difficult at times.
0394806220|5.0|This is one of the better and more lasting Dr. Seuss books. Fortunately it has not changed over the years. Still a child fvorite. Great for early readers.
B0081J9OWC|3.0|This album is a lot like there first.  This isn't a problem, but I like to see some growth between albums.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|Well made and my Grand daughter loved it, don't know much about dolls but made her happy and that is what matters.
B0085LGL5E|4.0|I enjoy The Hives and this album is just as good as their others.  If you are a fan definitely pick it up.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I just set up my new kfhd and decided to finally purchase an ad free version of this game only to find out that when you pause the game there are ads! I do believe this is misleading! As far as the game it's great but why pay when you can get NO ads on the free version by playing it in airplane mode (and stopping the process before exiting airplane mode... wait, can you do that with the kindle fire hd??? Yep... settings > applications > Installed Applications > Angry Birds > Force Stop). When I PAY for an \\"ad-free\\" version I expect NO Ads; otherwise, love the game!<br /><br />Edit: I should note that (when paused) there is an option to turn 'paused ads' off (lower right hand corner, piggy w/a mail bag.) But, each time you load the game the 'paused ads' will reappear. Again, not completely ad free!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this online as a gift for my boyfriend... Buying online was more convenient for me because I wanted it to be a surprise... I ordered it, came on time, packaging was secure and there was no damage to the product... I would order over amazon again...
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book and it is still amazing!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait for the movie!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Simple, and precisely what I wanted. All 8 movies in a bundle without a bunch of extra cases or discs.
B004E547D8|5.0|I loved this movie since the first time I saw it. It is a funny movie and I highly reccommend it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a great version of this game! It's really enjoyable<br /> to play and seems very user friendly so far.
B0088O11NU|5.0|I just received my Kindle for Christmas so I have only had a couple of days to play with this game, but so far it's a lot of fun.
075669812X|5.0|This book was the perfect co-gift for my grandson along with Ninjago for his Nintendo DS.  He looked through every page and loved the little character that came with it.  Love it!  Excellent quality.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Received my Kindle for Christmas so only have had a couple of days to play with it.  So far the different levels have been fun and challenging.  Looking forward to many more days of fun.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|The only problem I have with this book is that there are a number of places that look suspiciously like a sloppy spell checker inserted the wrong word.  That being said it was a very entertaining read and I have no qualms recommending it.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I waited up until recently to finally give this movie a chance. I watched it on tv and thought it was hilarious! I always thought it was just another stupid comedy. But its actually a darn good action and comedy. The action scenes were awsome. And that's coming from a big action movie lover. Its a much better movie than I expected. Even my parents who are in their 50's enjoyed Kick Ass. Its 1 of my husband's favorite movies so I purchased it for him for Xmas and he was very happy!
B00402FGDK|5.0|I bought this for my Granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it, it is the perfect gift for a Gleek!
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|This was ordered as a gift for my friend who shares my love for Depp movies.  It is one of our favorites.  It was very inexpensive through Amazon and arrived very quickly!
B000SEGQNS|4.0|It says nothing new, but most things you don't remember when starting a new project so its good to have this book on your hands to refreshing tme ti time some important concepts.<br /><br />A most have book!
B005HSG3VK|2.0|I like mystery stories.  This Kindle jumps to the end of the story.  To find my way back to the place I was, I learn too many facts to have to figure our &#34;whodunnit&#34;.  This is the second Kindle I have had.  It was sent to me because the first Kindle did exactly the same thing.  I have to think that this is a flaw in all Kindles.
B004OZZ624|5.0|This movie was totally awesome. Very believable as to what someone could do if they were put under the wire and wanted to save their family. Awesome movie, I was truly rooting for them. *****************Spoiler Alert*********************** I wonder if that Detective heard that button when he looked back at the end?
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Absolutely loved it! Even if you haven't read the previous two books of The Heroes of Olympus, or the Percy Jackson series, it won't be hard to understand the situation, but if you have read it, and know about Greek mythology, I reckon it'll add some fun!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Very funny, dont judge the movie by it's cover. Not the type of movie I would rent but after my brother went on and on how funny it was I decided to rent it. I since bought 3 copies for different people for Christmas
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This movie is adorable and I have watched all of the movies and I think I like this one the most. I would love it if there was 1 more movie to complete the series :)

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it!! Can't wait to read another book by Nicholas Sparks! Glad I read it before the movie comes out in February 2013.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Book starts a little slow with a lot of  first person narrative but really picks up steam and the plot twists just keep on coming. Classic Grisham writing style, loved the main character.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|A laugh a minuet. Never watched the orginal show. Watched this on plane trip and laughed the whole trip away.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait contrasted third! Left a great cliff hanger that makes you craving more. Can't wait for the movie now!
B0079R8IYW|4.0|Stand works nicely. For husband's traveling.Place for creit cards very handy. Only thing missing is latch to keep it closed
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Good book!!:) I really liked how it ended had a rough start bit over all it was a really good addition to the series!
B007RI56NY|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised that i loved all the songs. Great for listening to while running & walking the pounds away.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I initially had no idea what sort of story this book contained. The beautifully simple prose captured my attention from the first page. The intricate plot led me to the end like a string of pearls, or maybe I mean that each new revelation filled another deliciously mysterious hole in a way that made my brain sing, up to the last pages which finally lifted my veil. This is an incredible example of young adult fiction at its absolute best.
B0091REZMW|4.0|i love this game but sadly i had to stop playin on fb(to lagy) so im glad to see it here:)
B001V7UXG2|5.0|We have watched Jeeves and Wooster for years and have thoroughly enjoyed the episodes.<br />To now have the complete series is great.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Heard an interview with the author on NPR; the story sounded interesting and the fact that both pilots' stories were included enticed me to order the book (kindle).  Expectations were surpassed as I started reading and discovered an excellent history of Germany leading up to the war including the political factions that were at odds.  I have never before read a book that presented both sides of a conflict with such concern and respect.  Not only did I learn more of the history of the war I came to a better understanding of the \\"warrior\\" ethos embodied by many of those involved.  Add this to \\"Fly Boys\\" (James Bradley), and \\"The Wild Blue\\" (Stephen Ambrose) as books documenting the WWII aviation and the greatest generation.  I realize there are others but these three together make a wonderful trio.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very reliable and trouble free. Never a glitches or problem. Smooth as butter..Options are plentiful and you can make it look the way you want and choose numerous playing styles.
1439170916|5.0|Amazing work regarding history of medicine.  Should be required reading for all physicians but especially for all medical students prior to entering medical school.
0763644765|2.0|I was disappointed on receiving this book because the drawings are too cartoonish for my 2 year old daughter to relate to.  She much prefers My Big Girl Potty which interested her in the potty much more, since she could see herself relating to the little girl in the book interacting with her mommy and daddy, and playing with her stuffed animals.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|This is a fun thing to do, especially if you have no musical abilities...if you are a beginner stick to the easy until you get the hang of it..
B0035G0U2O|5.0|So, when the world ends, it's the politicians and bureaucrats that we're gonna save.<br /><br />Yeah, sounds like a really bad idea for so MANY reasons.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the writers and the artists and the spiritual leaders are left behind to deal with the apocalypse. That was the most depressing element of the movie. What will the world look like if we only save the \\"important people\\" in Washington? Heaven help us. Seriously. If the future world is to be populated with the slimy-dog politicians and their ilk, I think I'll take my chances with eternal life, thank you very much.<br /><br />Sitting in the darkened theater watching 2012, I was reminded of \\"The Bunker\\" at White Sulphur Springs (in West Virginia). Construction on the 110,000-square-foot bunker was started under Eisenhower's watch, when we were worried that the USSR might blow us up into lots of radioactive pieces. Turns out, our beloved elected officials were prepared to push The Red Button that'd end the world as we know it, and then turn-tail and run into their bunker, slam the blast-proof door behind them and emerge 90 days later when the danger had passed. And the most amazing part: The Bunker is outfitted with gee-whiz features that'd lead the unsuspecting public to believe the lawmakers were still comfortably ensconced in Washington, DC. In other words, The Bunker was *designed* to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.<br /><br />Watching \\"2012\\" I thought about The Bunker and realized, this movie is probably right. If and when the world ends, it'll be the politically important that are given seats on the lifeboats. And it's probably right that if there is a cataclysmic event, the Powers That Be will not tell the unwashed masses what's going on, lest they try and steal one of those seats on the lifeboat.<br /><br />That's just depressing on so many levels.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />This movie is definitely impressive on the big screen, and the soundtrack has plenty of bass (which I like). But the script and the writing was a little sappy for my tastes. And as to believability - well - this movie fell short on that score, too. I don't want to spoil the plot, but NO ONE can drive a limousine *that* well. On the plus side, the graphics are truly amazing and scarier than anything I've ever seen before. I had to turn away from the screen to avoid some of the scary-as-hell images. It's a pretty intense flick, and it does a good job of drawing you in.<br /><br />A nice side effect: After watching this movie, I'm a lot less worried about getting those pesky credit cards paid off. Does make you think a little more about enjoying every day, and appreciating the simple beauty in our world.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's an interesting flick with awe-inspiring graphics, and it'll hold your attention - if you can suspend disbelief for a couple hours.h I like).

B005LAIHZY|4.0|Picked this for my granddaughter to offset the Barbie syndrome.  Girls can be athletic and beautiful without being blond or buxom.
B000UCYER8|5.0|I love this book and have recommended it many times as a light, clever source for how to approach punctuation. The title itself is funny ... it is a mis-punctuated phrase about pandas ... any given one of them \\"eats shoots and leaves\\" no comma needed (nor gun!).<br /><br />The number of mis-punctuated, mis-formatted things that cross my desk ... the number is large. I throw out badly spelled, punctuated, formatted resumes. I do detail-oriented work. Punctuation is all. This is a fun read!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was a great book. It was riveting and emotionally moving at the same time. The story was very charming.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Hi so fare this cover for my kindie is working great and it will last a long time.<br />made to last thanks Marware .
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Its a fun game but the controls takes some time getting use to. Other than that the game is okay
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Far be it from me to row against the tide of critics and fans that lavish praise on this highly acclaimed series.  Downton Abbey is Marianas Trench deep in the category of chic flic, and if you're bored some night, check out the hysterical clips of women watching Downton Abbey together.  But I'm a guy who likes sci-fi and action flicks.  And even so, on the evenings when I've been entrapped into watching Downton Abbey, painful as it is to admit, I LIKE it.  And if it can reach across the high boundaries that separate my flm genres from my wife's, my daughter's, and my female co-workers, it DESERVES a five star rating!
B003O86FMW|5.0|LOVED the book. Heading straight to book 3, great book for any age group. Love the underlying allegiance formed among the tributes.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Great app to track remaining charge on your Kindle Fire HD. Shows percent of charge remaining, usage over time as well as time remaining for different activities i.e.,music, video, internet browsing, etc.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This was a fun book with wonderful mysterious overtones, good character development and a very unusual storyline. I really liked it.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|I was really excited about watching this one. I loved the first Total Recall and this having the benefit of the current CGI technology should have been awesome. It did have good special effects, but the story line and action scenes ended up getting really unbelievable and pretty absurd. Colin Farrell did an amazing job, but Kate Beckinsale (a favorite actress of mine from Underworld) was cheesy and annoying. If you can rent it for free then it may be worth your time to watch this movie, but it's not worth paying for at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I live in NYC and everyone has this game. Addictive. So far I got up to 500,000 without crashing. Similar to Temple run but more colorful and kid friendly.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|One of my all time favorite's but am I the only one who watches the black and white version and it freezes or my tv screen blacks out. I have returned it and received a new one and the same thing keeps happening, BUT I'm willing to sacrifice and just keep it regardless. DVD player is working just fine.
B004YXE438|5.0|I love the challenge of the game.  You can choose your level of difficulty, so it is challenging for everyone.
1609613937|5.0|Have been increasingly plant-based for two years, reading The China Study (Campbell), Stopping/Reversing Heart Disease (Esselstyne).  But this book was the motivation I needed to go all the way.  Simple, clear, well-written.  Do-able diet plans.  Rice, potatoes, veggies and fruit...can't beat it for satisfying meals.  I've lost weight, sleep great, gave up all my supplements, feel great.  I won't be going back.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|The first time I saw &#34;The Book of Eli&#34; on television I knew I had to get a copy of it in my hands.  It's post-apocalyptic,<br />and people have reverted  to brutality and inhuman.  One man (Denzel Washington) is the only light in this dark world of<br />madness...and he's on a mission for God.  I'll be using my copy to create &#34;movie night&#34; in my family.  I plan to<br />have my kids and grandkids to get together once a month to have &#34;movie night&#34;; beginning with The Book of Eli..  I<br />strongly urge anyone to watch The Book of Eli if they believe in good vs evil.  And the acting is great.<br />Diane Marek

B007SGM084|4.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like it after the first few chapters.  In fact, I wasn't even sure I was going to finish the first book but I'm glad I read the series because I was surprised at the changes in both characters.  I liked the ending.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love using my Kindle and buying books through Amazon.  Michael Connelly is my favorite Author.  Always ask for Amazon gift cards to buy more items on Amazon
B000001ESJ|5.0|This is a great CD to add to the collection.  Was a gift, so arrived as expected, on time, and in good condition.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I certainly wasn't disappointed in this story. It grabs you from the start and takes you along for the ride. The author ties the trip and the protagonist's motivation together in the end. It's a well-done novel worth the read.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have always enjoyed Albom's writing and this book is definitely included.  How are we on keeping time?  Does it absorb us?  Read this book fast as I had to know the end.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter is thrilled to have this DVD.  She loves Tinkerbell and this is a great addition to her collection!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I can play this for hours.  It is a lot of fun.  I wasn't aware of what the birds could do though until someone showed me.

B005CRQ2DK|4.0|This is a good book because it is really comedic and funny<br />Not to mention its not the only one in the series
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Really love this album, but I can't understand why no one has mentioned how similar this band is to The Olivia Tremor Control. Both great bands, both indebted to White Album Beatles, both with the poppy and credible tunes to match the hype. If you like TI, check out OTC.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|If you like the game you will love this movie.  It has everything from vehicles to the special weapons, like the needler and sword.<br />Great fun!
B0042KZJ5K|3.0|I thought that the additional tracks were disappointing and not worth extra money. I still really like the original tracks from the movie.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have played this game before and I love it.  The further you go, the more difficult it becomes and I love the challenge.  It is addicting
B0053O89JM|5.0|I was very glad to receive the replacement for the damaged one i first received, so quickly. i tried to return it using the printed label i was instructed to print and use, but it came back to me. i do not know how to obtain the correct address to return the damaged one.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|What a wonderful movie! Who couldn't love a feisty, strong-willed redhead!?! Great story, well-paced, and with just enough humor aimed at grown-ups to keep us engaged.  The animation is beautiful, and so clear you could almost reach out and touch it... Don't stop watching before the end of the credits ... there's a little surprise resolution that leaves you laughing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very catchy. Loved the writer's format. Fast read.<br />Very good thriller. Loved to hate both of the main characters.<br />Highly recommend to those who like a good thriller.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book. Although it had a lot of similarities with Fifty Shades of Grey, the story between Eva and Gideon is quite different and more intense. A lot of female readers can relate with Eva, which is a plus.
B00APUYN0I|1.0|I purchased the HD version of this movie and it looked really bad on my tv. I ordered footloose the day before and it was perfect. Pitch perfect was bad.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game.  It is fun being able to build new fish tanks and I also like the match three type of games
0767836324|5.0|this has always been my favorite movie ever since I saw it for the first time at the drive in.
0316228532|4.0|My daughter loved the book, it was a gift. She read through it quickly. She said it was a good read and nice change for Rowling
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This app is amazing. Very scary,but fun. It is hard to find the last page on the T.V in the cabin. That frusterates me. Totally worth the money though. Gave me big jumpscares.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|The game is perfect all around! A perfect outrun clone! I would love to give it 6 stars because of the controls. I wish all racing games had touch steering!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Well this does just what it says. As Apple adapters go it's the cheapest, which is good because of course it's a necessity if you have the MagSafe2 and want to use your old power supply.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved the book!!!! Absolutely amazing!!! It took me less than 8 hours to read this book because I was so interested!
B0015AARJI|1.0|This controller does not work and I do not know what to even do with it.  I charge it, turn it on, but all it does is blink. .
B003L77G6A|5.0|as with my other review, this was purchased for my fiance as he/we are big fans of BBT. This was purchased for some of his christmas gifts, to help work on completing the whole set
B003R0MF5S|5.0|My son is addicted to Chuck and we have now purchased every season.  It is something the entire family can watch together and that is a rare thing.  It is a fun action show, we have watched it over and over and never get tired of it.  Funny and thrilling show.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love all the difrent kind of dragons. I love that you also get the gems but you should really work kn how to get the food for the dragons
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I watched it all in one sitting. Great for my love of TV, bad for trying to be productive. It was worth it.
B00846F1YW|1.0|I cant get pass level 13 app always gets stuck or closes.. I love this app and would give it a 5star  when its fixs i try getting my money back but couldnt
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I love hidden search games and by far this happens to be one of the best I have found and played on my kindle fire he.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This was purchased for my fiance. We love BBT and sheldon!! I bought him seasons 1 and 2 for his birthday. Figured he needed the rest of the seasons as one of his christmas gifts
0547848412|5.0|I absolutely loved this book a beautiful tale I can't describe or pick the words to tell you what this book made me feel, I loved the ending one of the best endings I have ever read please buy this book you will not regret it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer,<br />is awesome. I love how you can change from holiday theme, to regular.<br />the only thing I would like better is if you didn't have to wait 3 hours to get the next daily challenge.
B0060D123K|5.0|A really good rendering of the Dickens story for kids. Caine is excellent. And the Gonzo / Rizzo shtick is really funny and helps with the scary parts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book I enjoyed the movie also as well. Looking forward to reading the next book. Very good author. The
B005LAII12|5.0|If you have a great sense of humor, you will love this movie.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  A definite must see.
B008XG1X18|5.0|You can find anything on here & it has photos which I appreciate.<br />I'm glad I found it. It helps.
B004LWZW24|5.0|Product arrived fast and we had excellent service!! Would recommend to anyone!! all around great service and very very fast
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love spiderman so i love this game. I love the way spiderman has to beat up the bad guys and save others
B008R14YBK|5.0|My daughter loves Mendler and this was exacly what she wanted. It cost a little to much, but worth it in the end
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i love this game and it is fun for any age just be careful about the machine gun jetpack. it is epic trust me :)
B000P0J09M|5.0|Maybe I am just fascinated by Italian Gangster Life, Maybe because it all goes down in the neighborhood in which I now live. I know many of the locations mentioned. If you liked the book try the movie. They are very compatible.
B0007NFL18|3.0|I've been a fan of 50 and G Unit since the 50 Cent is The Future days. I know 50's musical capabilities well. While several people pointed out that 50 is mediocre lyrically, I have to say that if you have ever heard POTD, you know that 50 can come correct at times (although punchline king Lloyd Banks has always been considered the lyrical strong-arm of G Unit). The problem with the Massacre is that it seems rushed, especially if you are familiar with 50's previous work. There is a significant decline in quality here and though some hardcore 50 Stans are on here spamming it with 5 star reviews in hopes that it will raise it's current 2.5 rating, this is one of the instances where the current rating is pretty accurate. I'm a fan but I am not delusional.  Production wise, The Massacre delivers in that department. Beats such as the blaring Gunz Come Out, Position of Power, Ryder Music, My Toy Soldier, Build U Up and So Amazing are infectious and top notch. In fact, some of the beats are so nice that you can almost ignore the lack of lyrical content at times because of how polished the production is. ALMOST. Lyricism is important too. The problem is 50's lyrics and flow just sound lazy on some of the tracks, which in result makes some of the beats seem like they were wasted. Also, 50 sounds like he is rushing instead of letting it come natural like he did on GRODT. For instance, God Gave Me Style is a very introspective track, but would been even better if 50 had stepped up the hook to more than &#34;it ain't my fault, you can't break it down, the way I break it down&#34;. It is still a good song, however there is definitely room for improvement. 50 limits himself lyrically on some of the songs such as Just A Lil Bit, Piggy Bank, Disco Inferno, Get In My Car, etc. Not that these are &#34; bad&#34; songs, just that they could be superior if 50 had put more effort into the rhyme patterns. No one is saying he has to be Rakim or Big L on them, but &#34;my fo fo, in the low low, getting dough yo&#34; is unacceptable, especially when you know 50 could do better.  I give 50 credit for breaching new territories that he usually doesn't (Baltimore Love Thing, God Gave Me Style), recounting his experiences (I'm Supposed To Die Tonight/Many Men Pt II), and stellar beat choices. The one thing he could improved upon to make this album better is improving his overall lyricism and cohesiveness. If the album trimmed down some of the filler tracks (like Gatman & Robbin, This Is 50) it also would improve the overall project. Yet still, the album deserves a solid 3 stars.  Best tracks: I'm Supposed To Die Tonight, Ski Mask Way, Gunz Come Out, Ryder Music, Position of Power, Baltimore Love Thing, Build U Up, So Amazing
B002NNA9N0|1.0|Don't know why anyone would watch this movie. Very depressing. Good acting by the characters but Jack Lemmon's whining wore me out after about 10 minutes. Yuck!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|is it really worth the time to review this movie.  its a classic and if you have not seen it, go ahead and order two copies, one for you and one for your mother.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|This album was great.  My daughter loved it. Shes been trying to get her hands on one since Disney said the album was out.
B0088X7YMS|5.0|Arrived on time. Great movie at a great price. Husband loved it as one of his Xmas gifts. Highly recommend.
0345803485|1.0|OK.. I guess there are some out there who are into this.<br />But for all the hype. This writing is an absolute waste of time.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I finished this book simply because I had nothing better to do. The writing is awful and there is no plot. However, the other two books are much better so this volume gets 3 stars for the fact that there's something else after it.
B003297I1U|5.0|Our almost four grandson was so excited when he opened it Christmas Eve! He has been playing with it non-stop.  Lots of moving parts.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved Hopeless. I had read slammed and point of retreat, but i got to say, this book is my favorite. So many emotions i felt while reading hopeless. I easily got caught up in the story. Had to peel myself away from it to even go bed. Finished it the next day. This book was just WOW! I loved the story between Holder and Sky. The story was fresh and intruguing. I would assume that something was going to happen in the book, only to be surprised when something else entirely would happen. Soo good. You feel like you are right there with Sky and Holder. All that they have been through brings them closer together.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I read this book every year. It never fails to charm and inspire. So many movies have been created by this tale. Yet the original stands out with such clever wit and originality. You can't know how good it really is until you read it. I recommend this book to everyone.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I really enjoyed watching all of Christopher Nolan's remake of the Batman movies and find this final installment is the best of the 3 although the prior one with Heath Ledger as the Joker was just as riveting. Nolan's version was very different then the other Batman movies before it as it had a dark overtone and avoided being campy.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Battleship is Outstanding movie and great graphic's. Kept my attention and had me wanting more. This is one to add to any collection
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Again- this is not fine literature here. However, its a fun read and this was a good end to the series.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My first ever game to download. Wasn't sure how to do anything, but got it going and couldn't put it down. It was fun
B008G59IBI|5.0|I had ordered this early for my grandson and they gave me a date they would ship it and they did just what they said they would do. I got this in plenty of time for Christmas and my grandson loves it. I don't know much about this group, but my grandson assures me that this is &#34;top of the line!&#34;
B00526ZKYS|4.0|Seriously amazing archiving sophiechan9 BBC is the first place of the earth's atmosphere is I think the right to hair
B0068LYEHA|5.0|i love this book. Not only does she take me back to my North London of the 70s, 80s and 90s and to the strange horrors and joys of growing up working class, poor, and female (with a herd of siblings and relatives), she reminds me that social commentary (her reminder that feminism is just the sensible \\"ism\\" for us all to get behind) is for everyone who has a dining room chair to stand on. Thank you, Moran, for sticking my life up there on a stage and for giving me the word \\"foof.\\" My foof and I thank you.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great free calc app. huge on my kindle fire/large font. hasn't crashed on me. recommend for anyone who needs a calculator on their fire.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm with the legions of women who devoured this series. I struggled with Book 1 because it was so over the top and the poor writing. But I was on bed rest at the time and had nothing better to do so I finished it and moved on to this book. Much better! There's an actual story. Lol! Certainly isn't fine literature but its a fun, fun read.
B0018QCXGY|4.0|I remember watching this in the theater and leaving with a headache and a bit of disappointment. The headache was from the shaky camera style of filming and the disappointment was from lack of creature time ( I really could not remember seeing the creature in the theater).<br /><br />I received this as a gift and really enjoyed watching it on my home TV. The picture was wonderful and it did not seem as shaky to me. Also, there was a lot more footage of the creature then I remember. This also has a investigation mode that plays the movie in a corner box with a map of the area it attacks with dots that show the location of the people, military, and monster as the movie plays. There is another box that has info that pops up to read as well that enhances the movie experience.<br /><br />Overall the movie was very enjoyable to watch at home. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys shows of this genre.
0446693804|5.0|This is a great book. Well written and so easy to read, you just can't put it down. It's a high quality book.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The best missile defense game I've seen.  It's one of about 15 games I have for my kindle fire and the one that I play the most consistently.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Two of my sons favorite things Lego's and Avengers, how could you go wrong? This was built and being played with in about 30 minutes.
B000QCTNIW|4.0|I liked the book although I learned a lot I thought that it was short considering that it occupies only 64% of the capacity and the rest are acknowledgements and appendices.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|First on content- I really enjoyed the book and found the information to be MOST helpful. After struggling with my curly hair for years I now know where I was going wrong. All kinds if wrong as it turns out. I am biracial and found the book to be lacking a bit for my hair type and for other women of color. But I got the basics and have been figuring out the rest on my own. If you have curly hair-read this! If your mixed or black and want to go natural- read this! There's no book that does it all but this comes close.<br /><br />I features- I absolutely LOVE the embedded video in the Kindle version of this. Awesome!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|its your standard build and manage but with military stuff good graphics looks and plays great on the fire nice touch with battle mini game
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the morning like 1a.m. and I can't get back to sleep. This does the trick everytime to send me back to dream land.
B001MTENOC|5.0|This book was filled with so many gems of knowledge that I could hardly put it down yet wanted it to last as long as possible.  I was so sad when I finished the book.  I felt that the book validated a lot of knowledge that I have gained myself through meditation.  This place that Michael Newton describes as our permanent home is accessible to us through meditation, not just through death.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is amazing! And addictive! Only bummer is the fact that you have to buy hints when you run out! But otherwise 5 stars! (:
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game and is highly addicting. Quite challenging for all ages. Even my seven year old loves it.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|I purchased this title for the option of using the DVD and then the Blu-Ray when I got a Blu-Ray player.  The DVD worked fine.  The Blu-Ray doesn't work at all.<br />Now I am out of the return period.  Please do not purchase a DVD / Blu-Ray package . .  Ever!!  If you have a Blu-Ray Player you do not need the DVD if you may get a Blu-Ray player in the future the Blu-Ray disk may not play and you have ZERO Recourse.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Bought it for my girls for Christmas! We love singing along! A timeless classic that never goes out of style.
B001GCUO5W|4.0|Pretty good movie which I had never heard of.  Unusual ending.  A little bit morbid for some but I enjoyed it considerably.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it because you can read the Bible in any translation you want.  It's helpful to compare the various translations, and they are all at your fingertips.  You don't have to go from one Bible to another.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is an awesome tool for planning out your dream wedding. I just got engaged at have already pinned a ton of ideas I want included in the celebration.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I got this DVD for my husband for Christmas.  He loved it.  He loves these kind of movies and he watched it that night.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I reread these books and even though I'm in tenth grade I still love them this is an excellent book.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is great as a challenge and for passing the time. It is well worth the .99 and works great on my Kindle Fire HD. I will definitely be keeping it and advise it for people of all ages. My only complaint are if I turn my Kindle with the camera facing up, it turns so it's opposite, and it only does this on this app. Also, you hardly have to touch the tree to be squished and restart. But otherwise, it's a great app and can get addictive (:
034580404X|5.0|Amazing book, leaves you with craving for more. always in suspense an guessing whats next. I am saddend it was only 3 book,
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter and I love this game :) we play it every day. The only thing that I cant stand is every time I get on it says there's an update so I click update and it never updates. I have a Kindal fire so if they can fix that it would be great.
B0016OMFO8|5.0|Those musicians and they music is never going to get old or out of time.<br />Good and solid performance and proven talent.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show.  It is a show about characters and not just blood and Zombies. This is the best show on TV right now.
B007KDFWRG|3.0|Enjoyed Tedeschi's voice and her blues on this and other CDs.  But the Trucks band is not really good.  Some songs went on and on and were not the blues that we expected.
B00973DDN2|3.0|The Killers are always fun with their twists and sort of rock-n-roll/ Indie style. I enjoyed an album several years back and decided to give another a try. Its a fine piece of work and I enjoy it when I'm in the mood. It think that is the bottom line. For this particular album I need to be in the mood.
0698116496|5.0|This is one of my son's favorite books right now (he's 4, almost 5).  My only disappointment was that this particular copy was paperback. I didn't pay attention to the book type when I ordered so I don't know if the information is given. Anyway, its not a big deal, my son could  care less! I just wish it was hardback for more durability. Great book though.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait to start the third one!!!! It was so exciting and I loved all the twists ...I might read them all again
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Good and solid performance of the great and proven talent.  He is a superstar and its shows throughout entire CD.<br />Nothing new.
B005DOKIYG|3.0|It's compact for easy storage although leaves marks on screen from the inside padding. Did like the strap on outside for carrying
1609611543|5.0|After reading and rereading I found the motivation I need to stop eating bread and other processed foods.  This book emphasizes that the bread we are eating today is not the same as the bread our parents and grandparents ate or for that matter the same as what I ate as a child in the 40s.  I would recommend this book to anyone serious about improving their health.
B004MPESSY|3.0|I still prefer the original of the same title, but this one was good as well. I defiantly liked the revenge sequence, but the build up, I found lacking.
1400067820|5.0|Not really a review, but a question concerning an important point: On page 24 (hardcover), I noticed that \\"the magnificent\\" is listed in the robust column while \\"the strong\\" is listed under antifragile. I first thought that I completely missed the point, but in Taleb's notebook [...], it's the other way around. But in the prologue, published months ago on the official website [...], it's also like in the book.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I saw this year and I have already re-ordered it. This is very true to the original 2000 AD comic and maintains much of the darkness that the 90's version did not.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who likes comic book renditions and anyone who likes action movies! Fantastic...
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is a really fun game once you customize your button layout to your comfort. The story is a lot different from most fps storylines. Multiplayer is awesome as well. The gameplay is a lot smoother then N.O.V.A 3 which I have by the way. I'm really surprised their aren't alot of reviews on this game because their are alot of people who play online. Overall it's worth the $7 you pay for. Happy Holidays
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Thought this would be a fun thing for my younger grand daughters...  But it is to hard for them and really is not a game that can not be played without purchasing items ..  You also need to be online to play with others so they can send you help.  This is not a good tablet game...
B00956UPSW|5.0|The Purple EP is a perfect example of Down continuing to bring it everytime. This album did not disappoint!  Cant wait for the next one!
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|Everything I wanted and expected from the book. Further character development, battle, quests and sorrow. While reading the last half the chapters left gaps, it felt like portions were taken out due to length.
1449410243|3.0|This book captures quite a few insights into cat behavior and cat-human interaction that, seemingly, only a cat owner would know firsthand. Much of what is good in this book stems from that fact. It is particularly good where it captures cat behavior and situations involving cat-human interaction.  Cat owners will definitely empathize with this. This is the strong part of the book.<br /><br />If the book concentrated on just these it would have been hilarious through and through. Unfortunately the author does not provide enough such material throughout the book. Quite a bit of the book is, unfortunately, just filler that was plugged in to bring it out to book length. Much of this filler is very uninspired and not very funny at all. Hence the week part of the book.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is definitely the best hungry shark app and well worth the more than 100MB it eats.<br />It differs from the others insofar as there are many goals and you have a clear path to progress which is far better than just eating. There also are many features and surprises you find out while playing - try to eat a swimmer while jumping or enter an underground cavern past the mines and you know what I mean.<br />You can progress very well without paying real money as long as you explore as far as possible - I recommend to spend the first gold on speed because the shark is very sluggish at first, even with maximum control sensitivity.<br />About the only thing I dislike is that it says 3D - okay, the shark and the sea have some depth but you still can only maneuver in 2 dimensions - left/right and up/down.<br />Pssst - the best treasure is deep down ;)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Once you get the hang of Inductive Bible Study you will be thrilled with the result. I have learned more this year than in the last 10. I have now purchased 7, one for myself 6 for gifts for those I love.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We enjoy playing this as a family.  Each takes a turn trying to get just the right angle to advance to the next level first. great on a long trip.
0316019984|5.0|Bought for my grandson who loves the intracacies of high quality detailed pop ups.  The colors are brilli ant and the pop ups please the five to fifty year old.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Best of the 3...I actually cried at the end and being a Jemaine Clement fan I was thoroughly entertained. Bravo!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Slow moving and predictable, not the worst movie but it's watchable. Date movie for sure. Definitely not one to watch again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This works just like it should and is easy to use. I love the options to view hourly, daily, etc. My only suggestion would be for it to work in landscape mode.
B000B5XOXY|5.0|Another great movie of the famous BATMAN.  I have all of the movies now and I can just sit back and enjoy them over and over again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great Game to play when you are bored out of your mind and just want to vent.  Have always liked playing card games and this is just a fun way to clear your mind...
B001O4XWJM|5.0|Ed Harris directed, financed on a shoestring budget, and had help with screenplay from Robt Knott. The lovely Renee Zellweger role as femme fatelle and Jeremy Iron's as wealthy badman along with some other supporting cast make this one of my top ten westerns which is a hard list to get into.  Mortensen and Harris are the hired companions whose trusted relationship with each other is palpable on screen.  Even if your genre favorite is more gangster like that of 'The Sopranos', 'The Godfather'...you won't go wrong with this western-style version but with Mortensen/Harris as your companion heroes thrown into it.  An extra dimension thrown into it too, with the love-struck Harris character trying to balance that with his harden part within himself.  Film distinctly narrated by Viggo Mortensen's character.  From beginning to end, a noir ballad.  I don't think it did that well at the box office as it was though recognized well by film critics.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy this game and the graphics are good and while there are ads you can very quickly skip past them.  The price is right!  Hard to go wrong.
B008F9T76Q|5.0|My 13 year old daughter has developed a love for reading that I am so happy to support.  She borrowed The Maze Runner from a friend and loved it.  She wanted her own coy as well as owning all 3.  The trilogy was more economical than buying them all separate.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|The case is good protection for the kindle fire, very important if you have kids handling it. It's a must have.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Waited along time to view this movie and it really was outstanding.  Can't wait to see if he will make another movie carrying on the trilogy of BATMAN.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I have enjoyed this app just wish they knew how to find my home town and not someplace almost 100 miles away....
1451695195|1.0|I felt it was made up. It was so different than most NDE experiences. I was so disappointed with the book I didn't finish reading it.
1250006341|5.0|Who doesn't love the series.  It is the perfect story.  Royalty, adventure, romance, scandal....what more could you want.  And now the companion book to help you better understand the series.  A must read.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|good item, great price. very basic, but that is what we wanted.would suggest for the price. simple to use, blends in with the kindle.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Everything was very easy! It came early! I couldn't have asked for anything more . Thanks, we will enjoy our movie!
B000B5XOSO|5.0|This was another great movie when the Catwomen joins him in fighting crime.  Again I added this movie to my collection.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|I wish I could say something good about this app but nothing comes to mind.  It would not play the movies I downloaded which is why I got it.  The only good thing is it was free.<br /><br />I am still searching for an app to play the movies I load on my Kindle.  Not the ones from Amazon Instant Videos or Netflix.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Although the ending was predictable, I was not disappointed.  Grisham always delivers fast paced, movie like suspense.  Grisham has a way of making his main characters so relatable that I cannot put his books down until the end.  Finished this one in a day!
1250027624|5.0|Outstanding.  The series is addicting and this book helps one understand the characters much better.  A more in depth approach.
B0033RT7RY|5.0|I saw this in the theatre, many times on DVD and just recently saw this again. I would love this on Blu-ray if they would ever make it. Simply the whole movie worked for me. Patricia Arquette and Gabriel Byrne were great. The story was interesting (Although I guess most negative reviews were based due to the premise of the movie, but I didn't know what the history of the movie going in, so that does not effect me). The sound was incredible in the theatre and on DVD.<br /><br />Sorry if this review seems small. I think the numbers speak for this movie. There are approx 150 5 star reviews for this and 50 1 star reviews. You make the judgement call, but all I can say is that I loved it, as for how much influence that has on you, I don't know. Give it a try, it is free streaming right now for Prime Members.
B00797MB0O|1.0|Don't waste your time on this movie.  The main character is awful and uses everyone else in the movie. Sometimes a character starts out that way and grows, matures, or changes through out the movie.  This selfish character is just as detestable at the end as the beginning.  A very slow and long movie that has no good point or value to it.  The main character is a \\"young adult\\" author but I think a kid could have written a better plot!  It was depressing, slow, and in general a waste of time.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Bought this for my niece, the Harry Potter freak and she loved it!<br />The compact packaging is great. Merry Christmas!
B005DOKL3E|3.0|I bit pricey and would have been better if a space for a styllis was desgin either inside or outside
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I got this as a gift for him for Xmas. He is a big movie buff and works in the film industry. He has added this to his collection and couldn't wait to rematch all these movies. Highly Reccomended!
B0030B0S2Q|1.0|I cannot believe I paid $9.99 to watch this movie on-line--I sure wouldn't want to own it.  While the preview looked as though it would be a good, exciting sci-fi flic, it was not.  It really dragged along and the only action was when they fought each other and their mouths.  I am not really a prude, but I found the &#34;bad&#34; language to be totally unnecessary--it was almost like a young teenage boy wrote it.  PASS IT UP,  PASS IT UP,  DEFINITELY NOT WORTH 10 BUCKS!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is pretty good on my son's Amazon Kindle HD &amp; has played well on SG3 &amp; SG Note as well. My boys (ages 14 &amp; 6) &amp; I enjoy this to waste some time, occasionally.
1250027624|5.0|I got this for my Boss and she thought it was the best! I scored big points! I would like one for myself, now! Hopefully she will share when she's done with it ! It had some awesome pictures and accounts of upcoming happenings in season 3 along with some history of that time period. Very fascinating, a good read and again, amazing pictures. Thanks for the great price!
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I have become a minimalist after reading this book. It's true that having a lot of stuff weighs you down. We just don't need to have so many things. I wish I could just go throw out almost my entire wardrobe and un-necessary house furnishings. I come from a large family and have always been given whatever things my relatives don't want anymore. Some of the stuff is useful but the rest I just don't need and yet I take it because I don't want to be rude. This book has taught me to not organize my clutter; that I don't need to take all those freebies out there; that I shouldn't buy things just because they're on sale, etc. I've been trying to pass on these teachings to my relatives who are all shopaholics. I used to think that their shopping addiction was a blessing because they would give me all their stuff that was barely used and that way, I didn't have to spend my money purchasing things. My mother's one of those hoarder types and it's really difficult getting rid of stuff because I'll throw things away and she'll take it out of the trash. I've tried all the tips that the author gave on how to avoid being gifted. They didn't work on my family unfortunately. Even the tip about not giving them a present to show your point.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|With promotions, etc., this case cost me very little money so I don't have much to complain about.  I like the strap to slip my hand under so that you can relax and not always grip the reader.  The design lets you create a stand, too, which is good.  My sisters have a case that is more substantial, though, that has a magnetic closure (which this case does not).  I tlike theirs better but they paid about 10 times what I did.<br /><br />All in all, a good case.<br /><br />Review amendment:  I see other reviewers of this product paid 40 bucks.  I think I would be unhappy if I paid that much.  I paid less than 5 dollars.
141970642X|5.0|Awesome book. We have the whole series. Daughter loves this book and is is glued to it! Would highly reccommend.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can hardly wait for season 3 to start in January.  This is an excellentt series!  I wish the USA could learn from its popularity.
B0091REZMW|5.0|genius game. I love the challenge it brings. I am a daily player. Great game that keeps you hooked without over doing it.
1455523003|5.0|My name is Raul Valdez Jr, and im using my mothers account. My mother is a devout catholic, and would probably never read a book defacing Mother Teresa. On that note she would probably never read most of the books I have read such as Professor Dawkins, the god delusion, or god Is Not Great by Christopher Hitchens. The only complaint I have about this book is that its to short. Its a very factual book that talks about the truth. People who critize this book ignore large amounts of information like idiotic dolts walking around in there own self imposed fogs. Its a sad world we live in when people hoist someone up on there shoulders, and look past every single thing they do thats wrong even if it hurts the poor and dieing. How can people be so deluded. Maybe its part of what Dawkins called the virus of the mind. One of the books I have read is called the god Virus and goes on about how people can ignore alot of information because they have this. Yet even non catholics can ignore the facts about this women. THey fail to look them up. Such ignorence is almost unforgivable. But then again Im a nice guy. Any other person may call it totally unforgivable. We owe a debt to people like Christopher Hitchens for exposing this shrivled up old prune as she was in life. Its just to bad that she outlived him by many decades. The cult of personalty still persists today with people like Joyce Meyers, Jeol Olsteen, and such personalities. People who have millions of dollars and use it mostly on themselves, yet preach charity and the love of god. They fool people into buying more then they can handle. They think that they are owed something. They fool people into believing in a delusion. You can listen to any one of there sermons and they will tell you to believe in something with out evidence. Such a thing is a stupid thing. If there is a god surely these people would be in his hit list.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|I must say I am quite happy with this purchase.  I bought this CPU along with RAM, Motherboard, and Case for about $170 all combined...opened up an Amazon Credit Card and got just about everything I needed for an HTPC for about $120 ($50 promotional credit for opening the Amazon Visa).<br /><br />I am using this CPU mainly as an HTPC.  I do not have cable service so I do not use it for any encoding and I cannot comment on how it would do for this, but for web browsing, Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, etc, it runs fine.<br /><br />Netflix on a Windows PC is, unfortunately, very processor intensive due to Silverlight and its DRM requirements, which actually keeps this CPU at around 60-70% when watching HD.<br /><br />The computer I'm using this CPU in is running Windows Server 2008 R2 and is also functioning as a domain controller with a few roles (DHCP, DNS, Hyper-V with 2 VMs (Win 7 for remote access and Linux for a fileserver) and has not been having any trouble.  I have not really tried too much with gaming on this APU but I plan on getting a AMD Radeon HD 6570 discrete graphics card to go along with it in the near future.  This is the discrete card which AMD recommends to take advantage of the &#34;Dual Graphics&#34; option for this line of APUs.  There are several models of graphics cards with this chipset available on Amazon between $40 and $70 right now and I feel like this would be a worthwhile upgrade should I ever decide to game with this APU.

B0090W7HEQ|5.0|Often hailed as one of her most approachable works, Orlando tells the story of a young English lord as he grows into adulthood across several centuries only to finally discover that he is a woman!  You will laugh and cry and discover yourself again and again as you transform with Orlando, from man to misfit to woman and mother and finally to artist and revel in the beauty and mystery of time and death and eternity.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|I guess this movie was not for me. I usually enjoy good sci-fi.  This was not GOOD sci-fy. Plot was shallow and confusing.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I'm a huge Veronica Mars fan and having this at home to watch as much as I want has been fantastic.
1451613512|5.0|Oliver Stone is provacative and it is intentional. You may not always like or agree with his interpretation but the historical accuracy is beyond reproach. He is meticulous as a researcher and his works are well documented. Read this important book and be prepared to be provoked. This &#34;History&#34; is revisionist as all history ultimately is. The revisions Stone presents are not flattering and will I hope lead to a better understanding of world opinion of the United States and act as a guide for our future interaction with the world.
B003O86FMW|5.0|...reading, and then you are ineorexibly drawn into the third book, my only caution would be if you are really too busy to read, then just postpone opening this book!
B008NEVPCC|5.0|I got the CD a few days after ordering  and I absolutely love it.  She's very unique and the CD was in perfect condition.  I am very happy with my purchase! =)
B006671NPM|2.0|HORRIBLE TRANSFER!!!!  Only purchase if u wanna be Dizzzy!! For those who own 3-D tV's they know wat im talking about! Pass on this! For me a 5 star is James Camerons Titanic- thats wat im talking about! Thats how u transfer a movie to 3-D period!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this game.  It's challenging but fun, and the &#34;sign painter&#34; items are funny!  If you're looking for something silly, go for it - well worth any asking price.
1451696205|5.0|AMAZING book. Definitely something I recommend reading. If you're looking for a new book to read you should consider this one.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|This was the best movie in the franchise, so far.  I own them all and this one was the best, so far.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I read this in 3 days.. I didnt want to put it down. She is such a amazing writer. Def has the talent for having the reader craving more. I couldnt wait to turn the page. I was feeling so sucked into Ophelia's life. The way she described her kissing Ethan was so intimate. I cant wait to read more of her life unfold in her books. thank you
1475143389|5.0|I recently bought this book after stumbling on it on Amazon. I have always loved working out and like everyone else I read all the magazines and bodybuilding books. I have tried a lot of different workouts only to find that most were for enhanced bodybuildings and not guys who wanted to train naturally. For a person who trains regularly, some of the information is basic, but Mike really lays out the mechanics of working out in a very simple manner. Additionally, if you still have questions or need clarification on anything, Mike makes himself available. You're not just buying a book, you're buying in to a program with a personal instructor at your fingertips. This is really a great book and one that anyone interested in working out should own. I highly recommend it and wish I stumbled on it years ago.
B00447G29S|2.0|Love this movie to death! But the 3-d transfer IS straight Horrible! I have viewed some very nice 3-D transfers and this is CLEARLY not one of them! U will be dizzy from beginning to end- Ya! One of those kind of transfers'
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I only got this so I'd have something other than Where's My Water/Perry? to play, and it's disappointing so far - additional payments for a few more levels, PLUS ads for more games? I should've learned from Angry Birds Space on my phone, and passed on this cash-grab. The physics are off too.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Not as heavy in material as I needed to prop it up.It sometimes collapses when I was TRYING to use it.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I loved the movie and couldn't wait to purchase when it was available. I would like to see a sequel!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the best one by far.. I hope there is another one!!! Can't wait to see if there will be!!!9
B008MEM24S|4.0|Great game... not the best game ever... I still insist you buy it... definitely worth more than 99 cents... just BUY IT
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its so many games that you could never get bored playing. I play this game every where I go.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I loved, loved this movie. Carl Urban was fantastic along with the entire cast. i mean who doesn't love Bruce Willis. Surprisingly funny, a movie I could watch many times
1592537251|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. Well made; well bound.  Good color reproductions. Only objection in this department is that the print is frequently far too small and thin = faint.<br /><br />Interestingly, some of the work shown included is rather ordinary at best, but some of it is simply superb. I guess this is reality. Also, the selection reflects an unfortunate footprint on the globe. Despite the attractiveness of most of the places shown, many, almost most, worthy places are overlooked. Probably this is just an accident of assembling a book on a schedule.<br />The idea of a global network of members sharing via an official Internet site has problems also. Some &#34;members&#34; investigated seem to wallow in the supposed glory of that membership inclusion, sadly much like shallow sorority girls. I suppose this unattractive turn of events was inevitable. However, one can easily just read the book, get turned on by the art alone and not join any group or simply form one's own local group of enthusiasts unconnected with the larger one. I think this is both attractive and inevitable as well.<br /><br />At any rate, this book alone is well worth the price and the reading.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|.watched about 10 min and didnt see anything funny about this.  Maybe if they didnt drop the F bomb ever 30 seconds you might could watch it but again I cant believe I spent my money on this one
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I still don't know how I feel about children fighting to the death, but I enjoyed the writing and the action. Well written, and hard to put down.
B0086700CM|4.0|I liked it. I admit I got a little bored after a while but I always go back to playing it when I get bored. But in my opinion this game should come with a warning saying &quot;highly addictive&quot;!!!<br />;D
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Been playing this on my Linux box for a while now, love having it on my Nexus 7!<br />2D boy has hit a home run!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|EXCELLENT FUN GAME cant beat the price. lots of fun action.  a good game for kids, not too much violence
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have never really been on The Hunger Games bandwagon, but I decided to give it a try while it was free.  I have to say that it is an interesting read that I couldn't put down.  The storyline is brutal and the characters, with all their flaws, are likeable.  I can't say that I will read the next two, but this one is worth the time.
0385535147|4.0|John Grisham at his best. He never fails to amaze me with his twists and turns.  It is always what he doesn't say that pops you at the end.  However, when you think you have it figured out, he slides another surprise in.  Vintage Grisham.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|One of the best book to tv series ever! Can't wait until Feb. when the story picks up where it left off!! 9/10
B004SOR4H6|5.0|easy to use and easy access to your page without having to sign in over and over again. i enjoy it better than using the computer or the phone.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is a fun puzzle like game that is easy for kids. Ai think you will enjoy it. I like that you have to gill all of yye boxes it makes the game more challenging.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Lots of fun and addictive!  You'll always want to beat the best score and move on to the next level.  I love it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book. I really enjoyed it. You can always relate to his books and the best part is that their hilarious.
1878424319|5.0|Great insights to help free yourself from shackles places by others.  The four pledges you make to yourself may seem easier to promise than keep - but stay with the whole book and the closing chapters brings the process into focus  A great book to grab when you are feeling &#34;trapped&#34; or unappreciated.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Can you say... CityVille clone? the workers idea and the minigames are nice, though. Combines a variety of aspects from popular games. A great alternative to having the seperate games alone.
B0091LS07E|5.0|i love alicia and this just gave me more motivation to love her even more. this is abosoultely her best yet
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this book really captures the spirit of the whole trilogy. Starts slow out at first but immediately became my favorite book so far by a long shot!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I recommend this book to my family and friends because  it's a really funny book. The reason why I rated this book three stars is cause I think they should add a bit more details.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Love the game, the ads and Claro taking over my computer was not a wonderful experience, however I should have been paying better attention to what I was doing.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Item arrived on time exactly as it was described.  Will purchase other items if and when needed.  Watch looks great!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't stop till I was finished. Made me smile, cry, love, hope. Will for sure be looking for Colleen Hoover's other books right away.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|i loved this album. you can really tell that she has grown in the sense that she is not letting others make decisions for her, she is doing what she wants and that is encouraging.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Movie is excellent, quality and download speed is excellent. Hoping that Amazon could give discount coupons on future movie purchases.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|One of the very best book I've ever read!  Kept me on the edge of my seat to read more and more ! Very fun and worth the read
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I gave it four stars only because I bought this for a present for my mom and I haven't  gotten to use it.  I compared it to my otterbox and I love my otterbox so anything less than that is questionable but the quality of this case is very good and great fit to the kindle
B007KAJG3K|5.0|I got this as a gift for my son, seems to be a good movie and I got it in time for Christmas. Thanks
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This is such a great movie. I haven't seen this movie in so long I had forgotten how funny it was.
030758836X|5.0|This author really 'jacks' you around with her characters.  You both love and hate the leads at different times in the book.  Could not put it down a truly fun read.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I was crazy to not see this in the Movie house..Fantastic Film,<br />wanted to jump into the scream and help the team out.
B008CWR7MC|5.0|I own 5 of the first six in this series and all are great examples of well-produced and nicely conjured surround sound.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Purchased this Lego set for my daughter who loves vintage vehicles.  She's is still smiling.  Oh did I mention she is a college student ha ha ha!  You're never too old for Legos.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves it! He's creating worlds for all of us! So much better on kindle than the game he used to commandeer my iPhone for
B004GVUPFE|2.0|I didn't really like playing this game. I usually like puzzles, but this just wasn't something that appealed to me.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|dumb movie poor plot not worth the builtup.  Kind of slimey movie, wish I had not wasted my money on.
B006C1DH92|5.0|great for him while we are driving in the car as well as while at home and I need him to sit still for a few minutes! he really enjoys it!
B003QSHIPS|4.0|At first I didn't like it at all, save a few. But I listened to it again with a clear conscience one day and realized how amazing this is - esp. as a concept album. There are still a few songs I cant listen to on here (Glitter Freeze, Some Kind of Nature) but stioll worth the purchase. And the vinyl comes with a lot of art (on the sleeve and inside the jacket) that you are more than likey never going to see without getting the record.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|Good DVDs in a nice box. I am happy with this purchase and recommend it if you are a Friends fan.
1401322786|3.0|I am a big fan of Mitch Albom's books, and he is, without a doubt, an excellent writer, but the Time Keeper was difficult to read.  The story is interesting, but it contains too much symbolism.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Its easy enough that you don't get too frustrated but challenging enough that you want to play more. I can't wait till the next set comes out!
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Not a bad money, better than average acting with a good cast.  Not a clasic movie but still worth your time and money
B004RJMUJO|5.0|this is a fun distraction for my grandson when I need some down time!<br />I would recommended it for all kids
B0008G2IRO|5.0|One of my all time favorites. The DVD contains nothing worth while but a bunch of extras and some music videos. The album and the artwork is what you really want.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm enjoying the daily plan provided by this app.  I like that it reads to me because I can listen when I have be doing something else.  Also enjoy the daily bible verse that it sends.  It has many other features that I really haven't explored yet.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|Loved the movie so much I looked up the sound track so I can listen to it whenever I want too.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Using with a Mackie system and it sounds very professional. Hoping that they will last for some time now. Great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun game. surprisingly good controls; not glitchy on the non-HD Kindle fire.  lots of levels to keep you entertained.  An excellent game at this price point (hah)
1452110581|5.0|This book is hilarious. I read it twice before giving it to my daughter for Christmas. Anybody who loves cats will enjoy this book. Lets you know what cats are really thinking!
B0012N8W0E|5.0|Esp. when you look at it contextually. So much emotion and such strong song writing. Its like the recovery period after the dark depression that reflected &#34;Tonight's the Night&#34;. Must have.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I almost gave up (my friend threw the book away), but I stayed with it.  I can't wait to see how in the world they made a movie out of it!
B009AOFNU4|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my husband, he is delighted with this gaming controller, it works perfectly! .
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|For a fan of Resident Evil, I wasn't disappointed.  Good twist and the ending left me wanting more.  As usual the CGI and action scenes were fantastic!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I love Courtney Milan's books.<br />The first one that I fell in love with was Unveiled. I could not believe why an incredible book like that was sold so cheaply.<br />The prose was beautiful, the dialog so intelligent and stimulating.<br />I read all there was to read of Courtney Milan, but this latest book The Duchess War pretty much consumed me.<br />I felt so much. The feelings were intense.<br />My blood was pumping throughout the book.<br />I laughed. I flushed with the characters.<br />Thank you so much, Ms. Milan, for writing such beautiful stories.<br />Please don't ever stop.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I like doing the puzzles, but when I download this app it gets quarantined because of threats detected. Might want to fix that one...
1936891026|4.0|Really changes the way you look at and approach art. Also its a very easy read. Only a 160 pages with most of them being about a half page long.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Very nice book...got it for my kids and I got hooked. Can't wait to read the all the other books in the series.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I finished this book over a week ago and I'm still thinking about what a great read it was.  It's a quick page turner and it really keeps you guessing throughout the entire story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wonderful read. Great plot. John Grisham is always at the top of my list. I've read all of his books!
1451678193|4.0|Having only read one short story by Bradbury before this book, both his style and the genre (in book form) were new to me. This compilation of stories are all dated in the future, from the 'magical' sci-fi year of 1999 (which in the forties and fifties must have seemed a long long way away) and although individual stories, they read like diary entries.<br /><br />Varied in length, with some just a couple of paragraphs or pages long, the balance works well because the shorter stories are to the point and punctuate the longer ones. Although classed as science fiction, set on (or about travelling to) Mars, the main theme running though all of them is how human's react to situations. Racial tension, loneliness, hope, fear and greed all play a part in these deftly put together stories and whether they're about being isolated on a planet, met by long dead loved ones or children just being children, they each have something to offer and leave you in ponderous mode.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I bought these for my daughter for christmas. she is 2.5 and loves them.They are very similar to colorforms but they stay stored in a book.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Great read!! Can't wait to read the next one in the series. I can almost visualize the characters by their actions.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Such a pleasure to read. Can't believe I waited this long to read it. Flew through this such a pleasure.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I liked the concept of the book but I found that it was slow.  It just kept dragging on and on.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I laughed all through the movie, had to watch it twice. It was a very pleasant surprise!Definately two thumbs up!
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Opened it first and didn't play with anything else til he got it together so he could show it off.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great addition to my boyfriend's blu-ray and avengers collection!  He wanted the blu-ray and I wanted the dvd, we're both happy!
B008WCP2PG|3.0|This was a gift for a friend, I myself didnt care for it, and so it goes. She really wanted this movie,
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|This movie is entertaining and a good reminder that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was every funny. The ending was  great too.<br />I liked the part where uncle Gary showed up.<br />I gave it five stars because this book was creative.<br />Although it's hard to understand what the book was about at the beginning.
B004SHGBDG|1.0|I was excited to try my PickMaster after getting it as a Christmas gift.  I am always misplacing guitar picks so I thought t was a fantastic idea.  It worked perfect and I was amazed at what a great idea it was.  That was until it broke on the first day I used it.  I never used anything thicker than an old credit cad or a gift card.  I cut 10 picks, and on the 11th it broke a rivit and it no longer works.  Do not waste your money, this product is garbage
0545265355|5.0|Great trilogy- highly recommend it!  It's not just a book for kids or for girls, people of all ages will enjoy reading them.  Books 1 and 2 are the best.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|great product!  fast shipping!  I love dvd's and my boyfriend loves blu-rays, so now I can watch this on my laptop and he can watch it on the ps3!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|While I have enjoyed all of Clancy's books, this one just did not seem up to his usual stanards of story telling.  I will hope that his next book will be back on track with his engrossing details and interweaving stories.
1563523302|5.0|Easy to read and interesting facts. If you want to know how to gain wealth, this is the book for you!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wonderful product with some very challenging parts of the game. A very clever idea to give the game out for free as it makes it more attractive to buy. Very enjoyable, especially for long airplane rides.
B005LAII08|5.0|This is an excellent movie and great choice for my granddaughter. She will enjoy this movie for quite some time
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I haven't seen the movie by this name and can't imagine that it held very close to the book; as this book is extremely gory. Even so, it so well written that I was compelled to read the whole thing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A young girl learns that love is more complicated than she could imagine. Love is much more than excitement and romance.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|She loved it and I got in on sale over black friday, win win. I haven't seen the movie so I can't comment on that.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Fairly good action, I was mad that it ended as it did. It almost seems like the director was told &#34; your film is 2 and 1/4 hours long and it has to end&#34;.
B005LAII08|1.0|Disney has gone too far.  I purchased this movie for my daughters for Christmas.  It is a movie showcasing a strong female character, not the ordinary princess portrayal concerned with getting the prince and fashion, who has a strong relationship with her father.<br /><br />We don't have a DVD player, as we watch our movies on our computers.  This would not work on any of my daughters computers, which aren't that old!  The DVD copy would only work on my brand new work laptop, which I can't leave that at home just so my kids can watch Brave!<br /><br />I bought the full Blu-Ray 3D, Blu-Ray, DVD, Bonus, and Digital Copy.  The DVD wouldn't even show up as inserted.  The Digital Copy wouldn't play, and just crashed Windows Media Player every time I tried, on every machine I tried.  The Blu-Ray copies wouldn't play either.<br /><br />Days later we still haven't been able to watch it.  I am sending this back.  Seems like you can't even watch a movie that you do buy these days.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Wikipedia has the answer to just about any inquiry you might have. It is indespensable in my estimation.  A must have for your device.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|It works great and I'm impressed.  I plan to do some travailing but don't want to drag my computer with me, now all I need is my Kindle.
B00932A6G4|3.0|I didn't realize that this a a cartoon version.  Enjoyed the movie but wished it was not the cartoon version.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is a great app. I love the features. I also love the alarm ring selections.  I love the way it wakes me up gently which helps me start the day off with a pleasant attitude :)
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good book keeps you wondering how it will end. It's true you have to find the key to solve the mystery.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am absolutely addicted to this game, I love how you Can choose different point counters, like the las Vegas point conductor.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I feel there was way too much conversation that went no where.  Bain was a cool character and played well, however, the story took way too long to really kind of go no where.  I don't know, I watched it, it was alright, don't feel the need to sit through 2 hours and 45 minutes again.  If you haven't seen it, it is worth it just for the sake of completing the Trilogy.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was excellent and I was glad that it tied all of the pieces of the plot together in the end since the plot was more scattered in this book than the previous two. Although it's not my favorite of the trilogy, I still couldn't put it down.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Don't know if my granddaughter likes it but it is what she asked for so it is up to her if she likes it.
B000ME5B30|4.0|This was another school project to watch for testing, was very thought provoking and made the viewet stop and think about the future of our world.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Mesmerising.  So well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Keeps you guessing as to what the ending will be.
B007HACDLK|2.0|I imagine I had higher expectationsbut found this a book of one dimensional characters in a predictable linear plot. Couldn't wait for this one to be over. Stuck with it as I had nothing else to read in the middle of the night and could put me back to sleep quickly.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's what you'd expect it to be.  A basic Facebook app for a mobile device.  It's nothing special, but it allows you to do everything you'd be able to do with any facebook moble app.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|The only to use this app is to be connected to the internet.  Due to this limitation, I would not be able to use it at church or anywhere that wi-fi was not available.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Great Album! Love singing along with all her great songs. Looking forward to any future albums she will come out with.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Quite entertaining. Allows me to think and let my mind wander without tedious details.<br />I use it often just to relax when the stresses of life weigh me down.
B000F5GNX8|3.0|Bought as a gift; my girlfriend loves this movie. It's a decent action comedy where Robert Downey Jr. plays himself (not literally, but, you know, plays his sarcastic, lucky, cocky, ruggedly handsome, edgy dude like in Iron Man- what he does best) and gets caught up in a plot surrounding a girl, bad guys, guns, money, love and a gay Val Kilmer.<br /><br />Some good action and comedic scenes for this crime-filled love story. 3 out of 5 stars just because I normally don't like this type of film and nothing memorable happened in it despite RDJ & Kilmer's acting (on par).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good book. Very entertaining. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys fiction. Looking forward to reading the next book soon.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds its really addicting, and i love that it has differnt ways to play the game. Love it
B007TNS6JI|2.0|I was enjoying this game, for what it is, until I stopped playing for little over an hour and received notifications.  Upon logging into the game, my highest lvl'd character was gone.  I decided that I was not going to waste my time building a new char and earning all the items and awards that I had already earned.  I deleted this game.
B002N7W3NK|5.0|Having been a fan of Diana's for quite sometime now, it was nice to see the live renditions of the music that I have long associated with her style of music. It ws a feast for both my eyes and my ears.
B0042KA4VO|5.0|I chose this rating because I love the series, every episode is gripping at your seat, recommend this product to anyone that like vampire movies or tv series plus has hot actor and actresses.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a superbly designed game that allows one to play alone or with another. I spent my time entertained by Flow Free while accompanying my wife and daughter shopping for clothes and shoes. Yep, suggest you preposition ads for this game near all the waiting stations in malls and stores across the land.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second installment of the hunger games series did not disappoint. With fast action and unexpected twists, it keeps the reader constantly in suspense. Katniss is a bit annoyingly dramatic, however.
B008K8VDPU|2.0|just not thought it would be different. Thought it woiuld be more entertaning,  would not really have a friend get it
160094048X|5.0|Every recipe in this book turns out perfect!  I know I can count on it for spectacular cookies each and every time I bake!
038572179X|2.0|There are so many books in the world to read, but they all take time, and our lives are so short! I finished Part One of the book and it was like wading through a mucky swamp. Look, the author is a fantastic wordsmith, can really use the language, but as a story of characters one could care about, I found it wanting. I give it two stars because of the  marvelous prose he uses, but only two stars because he seems to be intrigued by his own narrative so much that he never knows when to end it. I like a novel with a balance of narrative and reflection, action and dialogue, but this was flooded with narrative, page after relentless page of it, and so much of it in Part One that obsessed over the petty little dramas and tragedies of an over-sensitive girl from a comfortable background who has a runaway imagination.<br /><br />When the author told us of the \\"crime\\" Briony was going to commit, I was temporarily hooked. What could it be? Did she kill someone? Maybe herself (please!)? Was something finally going to happen in this girlish-diary melodrama? Alas, her crime was accusing Robbie of committing a rape. She insisted she saw him, but she only saw someone, and because of her fevered imagination, she decided it must be the \\"maniac\\" whom she thought was incorrigible.<br /><br />I may push myself to finish it, but I don't know. There are so many interesting stories out there, and non-fiction books galore. Why waste any more time with it when I've read the ending in the many reviews here. Nothing that the author can do, at this point, would lead me to give it a 4 or 5-star review.
B00999DFP0|5.0|Amazing gift she loved it. Already watching it from the beginning! Definitely recommend for anyone who loves to watch, must have
006097625X|4.0|This is a wonderful companion to Making Comics by the same author, Scott McCloud. Love the history of comics that's included in this work or art.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A+ book. It was the best of the three in the series. Much more story line involved. In this book.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like the game i just thought that it would have more options of differnt ways to play the game
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|So this in the theater and could not wait to watch it again for the second time. I enjoyed it more the second time around because I understood everything better. Great movie!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This is is a book you will not want to finish with your children near. Find a closet, get comfortable, and finish it alone. Aside from the story itself, the writing was brilliant, a very, very, good read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I truly waited a good long while before reading this book out of fear of vulgarity , but I was humbly surprised and eager to finish the series.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|They really need to update this app ASAP. Only shows first 10 most recent statuses of your friends. I just use the web browser for Facebook instead of this horrible app.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|Adults and children alike will love this movie. It brought back the Muppets to be enjoyed by a whole new generation.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really like this game its really addicting and very fusterating but i would have my friends play it diffently
B004C3DLJS|5.0|I rented this for my three year old grandson. He loves all of the Toy story moives as he watches it holding his &#34;Woody&#34; and &#34;Buzz Lightyear&#34; toys. Adorable show.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was a great read could not wait to get to the next chapter. Was disappointed with the third book because it only review his life.
B000J103PC|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! I recommend it to everyone. Great packaging. Anne Hathaway is great in this movie.
B009POCG5Y|4.0|As usual, Clint is crazy good in this movie.  Justin Timberlake plays a lighter role but still is good.  The actress that plays the role of Clint's daughter is excellent as well.  Father daughter relationship movie. It is good!
B008VBYN80|3.0|It is a good game concept but It's another one of those games that you can't evolve in unless you get your friends involved. I wish they would start making more non social games.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|exellent condition  and awesome movie... very funny i loved watching it and continue to watch and it still makes me laugh
B0049J3QNG|5.0|Any kid and Adult alike would love this show. So cute and Fun. My 3 year old grandson will watch it over and over again!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I had seen quotes and reviews of this book everywhere and I finally had the chance to read it, and let me tell you I finished this book in one day and there was no disappointment on my end. I refuse to diminish this book to a mediocre review that raves on and on about how wonderful the book was and the journey it takes you on. I just hope that if you ever have the time that you choose to read this book because I loved every sentence and every moment and I'm positive that anyone else would too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Brings everything together with the intrigue and deception we have come to expect from the series. Film will never do it justice though.
B008IGAJJK|5.0|Great movie with one of the best football scenes EVER. Do not expect the TV show...the movie is much better.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game and it is really cute. It is challenging and fun, and I cant think of anything that the creators could improve at all! It is perfect and it is one of my favorite games.
1419705849|5.0|Exactly what my daughter wanted.  She has all the others in the series and this was a perfect addition to her collection.
0307887960|5.0|I bought this book in August (2012) after my Aunt had lost 50lbs. Halfway through the book I thought \\"I can do that!\\" Once I started it was easy. The first 3 days are the hardest, just like Dukan says they will be, then it's easy.<br /><br />It is now just after Christmas of 2012 and I have lost 72lbs! I have noticed a lot of improvement in my life. I don't huff and puff going up stairs, I can keep up with my family walking through the mall, and everyone is commenting on how good I'm looking. My life has changed so much in the last 5 months. This diet is easy to follow. Protein keeps you full and no sugar keeps the cravings away.<br /><br />I get up every morning and step on the scale and am so happy that my aunt told me about this book! I have recommended it to everyone I know!
B00355L2TU|5.0|This is a great workout.  It's short enough to be convenient, but long enough to give you a good workout. I like that cardio and strength are combined in the same workout.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|This should be a must see for all married couples.  It really makes you think twice about some of the things you take for granted and it does it in a humorous, non-judgemental way.  My husband and I really enjoyed watching it together.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is sometimes hard for me to get involved in a book and read to the end. This one I could not stop. I got sick on Xmas and stayed and read through the day after and finished it. OMG! Lots of twists.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|This movie was an absolute waste of time and space. I almost fell asleep several times because it was so boring and predictable. It is time for something else because they are just putting out crap and calling it Resident Evil. I wasn't expecting an Oscar award winning movie in this series, but at least give me something to work with. I want a storyline, action, imagination in a movie like this, but instead I got drab, boring, predictable emptiness.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|This new Bourne movie had the usual high energy and action but a lot of action scenes were so far out there to even be thought of as reality.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|This has proven wonderful for travel, when I don't want any extra weight. When not on the road, it corrals my cable,
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Season 1 will not disappoint. It sticks closely to the book and has terrific acting. A must buy in my opinion.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|enjoyed playing. could have used a map of where I had been and what I had finished but excellent fun. I would and will play it again
B0079R8KO0|2.0|This does not match the item description  very well.  It will not stay in one position, can not be rotated and stand.  Case made my kindle sweat!  For the same price there is a much better Marware case [...]
0307352145|5.0|I got this for my rather introverted son. He dove into it, read for awhile, looked up and said &#34;Ha! It's fine that I don't mind eating alone in restaurants and like going to movies alone.&#34;
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Any star track fan will love this movie.  The characters are believe able, you can see how they started their Star Trek careers.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Could not put it down once I started reading.  Can't wait for the next Harry Bosch novel.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Liam McIntyre had some big shoes to fill with the unfortunate passing of Andy Whitfield. I am pleased to say that he played a convincing role and I can't wait for season 3!
B00867GK26|4.0|I preordered this movie and it came on time. This movie is great and will become a classic for its time.
0307408833|5.0|I have made, probably, every recipe in this cookbook.  They are easy to make and everyone loves them.  Most don't even realize they are eating GF :)  I have her second book too which is also easy and amazing.  I haven't mastered the cupcake icing recipe yet but everything else turns out just like she says.  I recommend this book to anyone who bakes GF.
B000002N25|5.0|A solid album from a man whose career has been built around crafting working class songs that take you inside the life of people and characters from varying times and places.  Done with Bonaparte is a sonic gem.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is one of the few movies (maybe the only movie) where the movie is better than the book. The book is a depressing, hopeless bummer. This movie is beautiful, charming, and entertaining. The fish doing the &#34;Mission Impossible&#34; theme is a classic that will live forever.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|TDKR is a good movie, but I enjoyed TDK more.  Having the villian's faced covered was a gamble.  I'm not sure whether it paid off.  Ledger was iconic in TDK.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book. Read it in a couple of days. Exciting from beginning to end. Can't wait to start on the final book.
140053271X|2.0|Bought this for my daughter.  She is having difficulty with the pass word, and is finding that its functionality is very limited.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|What idiot puts spell check in the password field????  Seriously, fix it you idiots.  You have to be smarter than the software ok?
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. It's fun and challenging, but it can sometimes be frustrating. It is also lets you customize what you feed Om Nom(that little green monster). There is an option of candy, a donut, or a cupcake. There is lots of fun levels so you'll never get bored. They also have superpowers for Om Nom. It is really fun and a great buy.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|If you are a Harry Potter fan, and who isn't, you have to have this movie to complete the set. This was offered at an excellent price, and, as always with Amazon, the transaction was seamless.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Have only played for a short while but pretty good once you figure it out,I would add more to the review but the game made me do it in order to save game...at least that's what it said.
B006G2124E|4.0|I knew my husband would never watch this movie so I decided to just download it to my computer so I could watch in peace.  Not quite what I expected, but it was enjoyable.
B004T4KQJS|1.0|I can't download the book. Please help. I have downloaded kindle books before but there is some problem here. Thank you
B004LWZW88|4.0|Have nothing bad to say... Arrived in a decent time and was exactly what i expected :) my nephew lives the movie so he couldn't have been any more happier about receiving it!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|All I can say is, Wow, Wow! It[s everything they predicted it would be.  Very sad that this is the last of the trilogy.  The acting was fantastic,  the villain was one of the best.  The plot was very exciting and suspenseful
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Excellent product at an excellent price. I was delighted to see this at the price I got it (under $10). The transaction was seamless, as is typical for Amazon orders.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This series is so good. Seeing it on Blu Ray just enhances the experience. These men were truly part of the greatest generation.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|glad I got this. Love the effects Just think where he would have been if he allowed himself to be bitten
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|People often say that we have lost Christ, we have lost Mary. Living in the 21st century, I am, perhaps, more concerned that we have lost Chaplin`s Tramp.<br /><br />Easter is not Mel Gibson's blood-soaked sadism posed as religious dogma. Rather, it's Fred Astaire and Judy Garland strolling down an Easter Parade. Christmas is not Cecil B. DeMille pious kitsch. Christmas is personified by the Little Tramp trying to find existential depth in an increasingly plasticized, dumbed-down modern Western world. Indeed, there may be a bit of poetic irony in Charles Chaplin's exiting this mortal coil on Christmas day itself, in 1977.<br /><br />Chaplin was not a religious man. Yet, his Tramp is the most religious and iconic figure in all of cinema. Chaplin seemed to be partly aware of this. The late film historian Leslie Halliwell reported that when Cecil B. DeMille was casting for The King of Kings (1927), Chaplin approached DeMille, offering to play the role of Christ: \\"I am Jewish, I am an atheist, and I am a comedian. I would be prefect for the part because I could play it totally objective.\\" DeMille had Chaplin thrown out of his office. Although Chaplin was probably right in that assessment, we can be grateful that DeMille rejected the casting. King of Kings may be one of the worst examples of  1920′s Hollywood. Of course, Chaplin exaggerated his beliefs in the interest of self-promotion. He was not Jewish and his atheism is debatable. The clown was, predominantly, anti-clerical.<br /><br />With the first talkie, The Jazz Singer (1927), silent cinema was history. Someone forgot to tell Chaplin. He was still making silent films nearly a decade later. Many commentators have noted Modern Times (1936) is anything but modern. This film was a last, in many respects, for Chaplin: his last silent film and the final indisputable appearance of the Tramp. (There is a debate over whether Chaplin's Barber from 1940′s The Great Dictator was really the Tramp, or not).<br /><br />Modern Times, originally titled \\"The Masses,\\" is not completely silent. The Factory task master talks through a Orwellian screen.The Billows feeding machine speaks through a \\"pre-recorded device.\\" Chaplin sings a gibberish song near the finale.  However, these do not add up to a \\"talkie.\\" Rather, it adds up to a silent with clever, carefully chosen, cartoonish sound effects.<br /><br />As a social commentary, Modern Times is derivative, borrowing from Fritz Lang, among others. As a romantic comedy, it's also derivative, recycling numerous gags and plot elements from Chaplin's Mutual shorts. It has, rightly, been pointed out that Modern Times is like a feature-length compendium of those shorts. However, the screen presences of Chaplin and Paulette Goddard are imbued with such authentic personalities that it somehow seems fresh.<br /><br />In Run to the Mountain, the Trappist monk Thomas Merton wrote of Modern Times:<br /><br />\\"I saw Modern Times, everybody in the theater was laughing. I don't remember when lately I have been in a theater where everybody laughed together so spontaneously as over this three or four years old Chaplin picture. It feels that anything that ever had any happiness about civilization-all the happy things that civilization has produced like Chaplin movies, are all gone and done with. Nothing left but the wars. The West Wall. The Maginot line. The bombers: bombers are our only shining things. Christ have mercy on us. God save you, Mary full of grace.\\"<br /><br />Chaplin's Tramp, as a screen persona, has emotional resonance in his reflections and labors, inspired by his intimate intertwining and quintessential recognition with the Gamin (Goddard). His Tramp is the socially devalued of the Beatitudes. A misfit in respectable society, he embodies that blistering critique of status-quo avarice, lucidly penned in the Letter of James. The Factory Worker and Gamin are the faces of Them: \\"Let Them die in the streets before giving Them health care.\\"<br /><br />The title credits face-off with a monstrous, eschatological clock: Futurism's icon beckoning the 6 a.m. call for America's workforce. A title reads: \\"Modern Times. A story of industry, of individual enterprise--humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness.\\" Pursuit does not equate attainment, as lambs herded through a chute remind us with brass knuckle subtlety. Charlie's Oedipal fragility, juxtaposed against perpetually bleak industry, sets the absurdist tone. Only an artisan of Chaplin's caliber could credibly render such meek conceit. Fortunately, Chaplin (along with Montgomery Clift) was probably the greatest actor of American cinema, which is why he wholly convinces, securing audience empathy.<br /><br />The Factory President reads Tarzan funny papers, clips his nails, plays with jigsaw puzzles, bellows, and swivels his chair to catch sight of the Little Fellow trying to sneak off for a \\"smokin' in the boy's room\\" break. Robbed of his much-needed cigarette, tightening nuts, tightening nuts, tightening nuts, victim of a mechanical salesman feeding him nuts, feeding him, feeding him nuts: Charlie loses it! Wrenching his hands, he attempts to take his pain to the nipple, much to the outright horror of two unwilling ladies. The Tramp is, indeed, a lost icon in the padded cell.<br /><br />Enter the Fellow's fellow traveler, the Gamin, adorned in hip-hugging, clingy rags. Orphaned and on the run, she seeks to claim the promise of the New World. Banana in hand, knife clenched in her teeth like a cocky Captain Blood, she stands, with legs apart, barefoot and defiant, as an overtly sexual woman: a refreshing change of pace (and rarity) for a Chaplin leading lady (which were normally of the child bride variety). The Gamin's \\"Jean Valjean\\" moment of shame and glory arrives, tucked in a loaf of stolen bread.<br /><br />Now this Eve will meet her Adam, her soul mate, the Tramp. He will belatedly see the waif as a gift of wisdom. Through a series of strung-together short film vignettes, they will embark on a seemingly ill-fated pursuit of the paradisiacal hour.<br /><br />Modern Times is deceptively simplistic. Such simplicity is personified in the suburban comic strip-like vignette of \\"let's play house.\\" The façade is as \\"stuck\\" as Charlie in the clogs of machinery (filmmakers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne shrewdly compared the latter famous sequence to Chaplin's image being run through a film projector.)<br /><br />For the most part, the Tramp is a degree more detached here than he was in previous features, which serves him well. The film does have a mawkish \\"buckle up-never say die\\" moment of the type that Chaplin will take to maudlin extremes in Limelight (1952). However, this is washed aside by a sublime finale of Gamin and Tramp locked arm-in arm. Having met his equal, the Tramp has evolved. Whether the two reach the sunset horizon together or not is of little concern. They are frozen only where we require them to be.<br /><br />This Criterion Collection edition of the film is, naturally, exemplary. A detailed booklet (featuring essays by Saul Austerlitz and Lisa Stein), an audio commentary by Chaplin biographer David Robinson, three short films, deleted scenes, and an interview with David Raskin (the arranger of Chaplin's picturesque composition \\"Smile\\") are among the wealth of extras.<br /><br />* my review originally appeared at 366 weird movies.br />The title credits face-off with a monstrous, eschatological clock: Futurism's icon beckoning the 6 a.m. call for America's workforce.

Such simplicity is personified in the suburban comic strip-like vignette of \\"let's play house.\\" The façade is as \\"stuck\\" as Charlie in the clogs of machinery (filmmakers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne shrewdly compared the latter famous sequence to Chaplin's image being run through a film projector.)<br /><br />For the most part, the Tramp is a degree more detached here than he was in previous features, which serves him well. The film does have a mawkish \\"buckle up-never say die\\" moment of the type that Chaplin will take to maudlin extremes in Limelight (1952). However, this is washed aside by a sublime finale of Gamin and Tramp locked arm-in arm. Having met his equal, the Tramp has evolved. Whether the two reach the sunset horizon together or not is of little concern. They are frozen only where we require them to be.<br /><br />This Criterion Collection edition of the film is, naturally, exemplary. A detailed booklet (featuring essays by Saul Austerlitz and Lisa Stein), an audio commentary by Chaplin biographer David Robinson, three short films, deleted scenes, and an interview with David Raskin (the arranger of Chaplin's picturesque composition \\"Smile\\") are among the wealth of extras.<br /><br />* my review originally appeared at 366 weird movies.

B003UESJHO|5.0|I have loved all of David O. Russell's works. Here he gives a compelling look at life in Lowell, MA.<br />The writing, directing and acting here is spot on. I felt, at times, that I was actually walking around in Lowell.<br />Not much when it comes to special features here, but for the Cyber Monday price of $1.99, I don't mind.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like this ap, comes in handy. Nice and easy to use without saving and filing. Just open, notate and there you have it.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Very good movie.  Just make sure you have time to watch it.  We saw it 2 times through Amazon Prime to get more of the details.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|cannot wait for the next one to come out. Love the fight between Thor and The Hulk. Scarlett JoHansson's outfit, what else needs to be said.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|From the very start of this book Nicholas Sparks pulls you into the life of a damsel in distress, taking her destiny in her own hands. This is a must read for any fan of Nicholas Sparks, once you start reading &#34;Safe Haven&#34; you will not be able to put this book down. I have it on my Kindle & even read while preparing Christmas dinner!!
0345803493|5.0|If you enjoyed part one, Fifty Shade of Grey, then you have to read this part two of the series.
B005CGI3ZG|4.0|Dawson's Creek has always been one of my favorite series. It's melodramatic, but quite moving at the same time.<br />I appreciated it being so cheap. That's the reason I bought it. I am disappointed that, yet again, Columbia has cheaped out on their packaging of a series. Two cheap plastic spindles with the discs just stacked. But if that's what it takes for the series to be so cheap, then I can deal with it.
1869509269|4.0|I bought this for my grandson for Christmas.  He really enjoyed seeing and reading about where the movie was filmed.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Quick read, too the point, and an easy study format makes this book an excellent tool! I plan to read the tips and points often.
B005FUJNNU|3.0|Honestly its hard to give a review for this item because it won't play on any of my Sony 3D blu ray players at all.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the ease of this bible. I have downloaded this on my grand kids of the tablets and cell phone. I like the idea of be able to go to different versions of the bible to get a better understanding of a scripture.
0345803507|5.0|If you read part two Fifty Shades Darker then you will have to read this one which is part three...I don't need to say anymore!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Allows me to open Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. In addition, it allows me to create new documents.  Works great on my Samsung Galaxy SII.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Keeps your attention from the  beginning to the  end.  And,  action packed.  A real fun flick for Sci Fi  fans.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Gets you in the Christmas Holiday Spirit
B003HARV3Y|5.0|Good entertainment Well done likes outweigh the dislikes by a long shot. A good family night movie that my kids enjoyed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like that the plot thickens so there's little more to this book. Can't wait to see how they adapt the movies.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Perfect clock for my needs. Easy to set the time and the sounds, nice to see clearly the temperature without using another app. A wee bit distracting the red color of the adds. Overall nice.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|It was a underrated movie good special effects worth the time to see if anyone wanted to see what Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote. but it should be seen in 3-D.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Bought it for my gf and she really likes the series a lot. Full of magic and drama and fairy tales. Very unique and original series though. Worth at least a look. There's a chance you get hooked.
0316227706|5.0|THIS BOOK IS GREAT, I  AM A CAT LOVER, WITH 2 DOGS, 3 GUINEA PIGS, AND 1 FISH, BUT THIS BOOK IS AMAZING, THE POTOGRAPHER IS GREAT, AND YOU CANNOT LOOK AT THIS BOOK WITHOUT SMILING, BUY THE BOOK AND ENJOY
B005C6HGSG|5.0|At first I just thought that it would be a boring how-to manual. But as I read farther, I began to like it better. Not because it was a book on Bobby Singer and some monsters, but because it was about Bobby Singer and his experiences. It was in depth about him and his journey and how he felt.<br />I got to see the real Bobby Singer. I loved it because I got to finally understand why he was so hard on the boys in the tv series. So, you asked how I felt. There is your answer.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Got the black version and like it a lot. Looks like a book when closed. The stand works great, easy to use, very secure and allows for the Kindle to be plugged in while in the stand position. The only thing is that with certain games (limitations of the games I assume) you can't use the stand, because it forces the Kindle to be turned the other way. But, that is OK as there aren't very many games that you would be using in the stand anyway.<br />I like it and would buy again!
B002W2U3H4|5.0|Our Family watches this movie every Christmas Eve and have since it came out. This is one of our all time favorites.
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|100% recommended -- this film from the director of The French Connection and The Exorcist among others is based off a 1993 stage play, which I think makes it great material for a movie because the story is bound only by the essential parts that carry it forward. This movie revolves around its characters. It's not epic Transformers. It's all about these scuzzy trailer trash people as they scurry around trying to get some money through murder. The look of the film is colorful and well saturated, not washed out by any means. It looks beefy. Very cinematic, nothing in scenes that shouldn't be there. This movie is up there with the best of Tarantino in terms of dialogue, cinematography, and explosiveness. The acting is awesome. Great kudos to Juno Temple's innocent Dottie, Thomas Haden Church's mum's the word and &#34;Yes, sir&#34; dimwitted and humble Ansel, and Gina Gershon's cheating Sharla. Emile Hirsch in particular plays so well a lame, idiotic opportunist thug, and because it goes without saying that Matthew McConaughey creates a thoroughly scary pedophilic contract killer.
0525953728|4.0|Overall a fast-paced read, though the beginning is loaded with acronyms (DEVGRU) and details about the organizational structure that aren't always easy to follow nor necessarily captivating reading.  Throughout are the nuggets about why the author wanted to become a Seal, the mistakes he made along the way, and how he and others survived and excelled to become Seals.  He gets into the mentality / personality of the team and how it contrasts with the media's depiction. The sections on how they went about executing their rescues / assaults are mostly riveting, especially how they went about training for and pulling off the mission to get OBL.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|the colors, the game, the sound are all amazing! I love it, and I'm happy with my purchase. fun game.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I upgraded and now I can't get in tell me its just a joke before I upgrade it was doing great needs to b fixed not a great app anymore
B004LWZWGK|5.0|(Note: This review contains excerpts from my IMDB review and new thoughts on the Blu-Ray release)<br /><br />Directed and Co-Written by Nolan (With his brother Johnathan and fellow screenwriter David S. Goyer), \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is as good a follow-up to the previous film as possible.<br /><br />Eight years after the previous film, Bruce Wayne, troubled by the death of Rachel and forced to retire the Batman persona, has become a sort of self-isolated hermit living in his rebuilt mansion. However, a chance encounter with a skillful and gorgeous burglar named Selina Kyle, as well as the emergence of a violent and diabolical new villain called \\"Bane\\", force him out of retirement, as he resumes the role of the caped crusader.  At the same time, an idealistic and good-hearted cop named John Blake works with Comissioner Gordon to piece together what is happening.<br /><br />After many twists and turns, the stage is set for the final battle for Gotham's soul. And it is an incredible, memorable and fitting conclusion.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect.  The first half-hour or so is a wee-bit sloppy at times, and things don't quite \\"gel together\\" and make sense until later in the movie.  This is also a simpler story than the prior film and a bit more formula-driven, which might put-off some fans.<br /><br />But everything else was magnificent.  The acting is uniformly fantastic, the action is the best in the series, the story and character development is very solid, and all-in-all, it's a great conclusion to the series.<br /><br />So, for me, the film is about a 4.5 out of 5.  Not quite as perfect as the last film, but darned good.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is decent for the most part, but didn't impress me as much as the previous film.  I'm not even going to address the whole digital-copy mess that so many other people have already complained about.<br /><br />The picture quality is fantastic.  The film automatically changes aspect-ratios to accomdate for scenes shot inIMAX (some scenes shot on 35mm have \\"black bars\\", whereas other scenes on the taller and wider IMAX format fill up the entire screen without black bars), which is a bit distracting at first, but allows us to get a good replica of the IMAX image.  The film looks great on Blu-Ray, and in particular, the IMAX scenes are gorgeous and have exquisite detail that DVD just won't give you.  (Sorry DVD crowd, but I've given up on that format, Blu-Ray's the way to go)  The sound quality is great, although the 5.1 audio mix sounded funny coming out of my TV's speakers.  (Dialog was occasionally over-powered by music and sound in a way that I didn't experience in theaters)  But it might have just been my TV.<br /><br />The special features are decent, but didn't impress me as much as the last film's Blu-Ray release.  There's about an hour (maybe an hour and a half) of Behind-the-Scenes featurettes, which are interesting and informative.  But for whatever reason, even though the last two movies had an option to play them along with the movie (in a way that the movie would transition into the featurettes, before resuming after), this one puts them on a seperate disc.  It felt inconsistant.<br /><br />There is also a very cool hour-long documentary on the history of the Batmobile that is the highlight of this release.<br /><br />But other than that, there's only really a trailer/promotional art gallery, and it felt kind of anti climactic.<br /><br />But all-in-all, it's a solid set of features, and I'd give the Blu-Ray a solid 4.5 out of 5.<br /><br />So, all-in-all, this is deffinitely a Blu-ray set to buy!  I'd highly recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We looked forward to every episode. Had zombie themed dinners (think whole cauliflower which looks like a brain with cheese sauce colored with beets, need I say more?) We love the quality of acting and the special effects and the make-up artistry.  I just wish they hadn't bifurcated the season.  But that might be an AMC thing??????
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Enjoyed this read very much and looking forward to the book in this set<br />which I hope is very soon.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|There is an air pocket that is behind the screen protector that makes texting difficult. Not all of them have this. We have one in black that fits very well. Perhaps ours was just defective. I rated my 1st one 5 starts. Wish I could have for this one.<br />Ah- sometimes you just get a bad one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book is good, but slow to get hooked into.  I like to be grabbed by a book right away, but this is much slower moving.  Overall, I read it because of all of the hype surrounding it, but so far I am not too excited about finishing it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Its been nearly 3 weeks since AB and AB RIO updated. NO UPDATE, we pay so much for these games and amazon takes their sweet ass time.Why cant we get these updates when the play store and ios get them upon release?????? app will get 5 stars when I get an update
B000PXUA5W|1.0|Waste of money...quality was terrible...so cheap...would never buy anything like it again...and my 5 year old was completely disapointed...would not even stay on his wrist
B003ZW0N2K|5.0|There is something wondrous about OMD at their best.  Not just catchy, these tunes get into your very bloodstream.  What I like best about this (and Grace Jones' incredible return from hibernation) is that it evokes their best work from decades ago, in an updated, but not TOO updated sound.  They get an extra half star (to reach five) for this restraint.  Viva nostalgia.
B001NLKT60|3.0|Started off quite slow but it picked up halfway through.  If you liked the first one you won't be disappointed.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a great romantic comedy. A joy to watch. If you are looking for a good feel move, here you go!
B0094GW6YE|2.0|It may have been stupid of me, but I did not realize this was not ALL THE ORIGINAL KISS BAND MEMBERS!!<br />I am not a Kiss fan myself, I bought this as a gift, and was VERY disappointed to learn this was not an original kiss album!!
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Good read for any foodie. Irreverent and fun.  My first kindle book gets an arts boy!  Anthony Bourdain is always interesting.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the movie and the book really follows along the same lines. It was interesting I couldn't put it down I read all 3 books in 4 days. I can't wait for the next movie to come out. If you liked the movie you will love the book it gives you a better understanding of what is going on and why.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|My husband and 3 kids (ages 13, 11 and 9) saw this and loved it.  I can't wait to see it again.  It's clever, sweet and funny which is just what you'd expect from these film makers and the story is not what you might expect from a pirate-themed movie.  Hugh Grant and David Tennant have great voices for animation.  The animation is detailed and so satisfying especially given that my kids have high expectations in these days of Pixar dominance.
B004OZZ624|4.0|A little slow in the beginning, but definitely ramps up halfway through.  This first half of the movie tied you into the characters of the family.<br />It provided an emotional attachment in order to put you on the edge of your seat in the second half of the movie
0385507755|5.0|best book ever. used but in excellent condition. i would reccomend this book to anyone i know who can read.ha,ha.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|If you love fart/butt jokes, this might appeal to you.  Otherwise don't bother.  Other than a very funny party scene about 60% through the movie, the humor is too random and flat.  I was actually bored of the whole thing with about 20 minutes of story left.  The ending is formulaic and lame.
B009KHCRVO|4.0|Great movie, waited forever for it to come out and loved every minute of it! Definitely check it out! very funny
B007MU85D0|4.0|I had heard &#34;Little Talks&#34; and liked it, and wanted to hear some more of the same.  That's what I got.  No real surprises, just a solid album of one sound.
B009X01C64|5.0|Just purchased and love the versatility of this case, the quality and protection for my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|So addicting! If you love Bejeweled type games, YOU'LL LOVE THIS GAME! The graphics are beautiful, and engaging. You clear pieces of artifacts on each board and when you clear all of the pieces to  form the complete item, a you move on. a You earn bonus helps such as bombs to clear specific spots on the board,  time adding bonuses,etc. that make game play even more fun. I am a huge fan of these type of games (3 in a row,board clearing,etc.) This is a top choice for players that are looking for a new and fun change of pace. Great job!
B005FISBTO|5.0|I have all of the series up to now and cant wait for season seven to come out. It is a very good deal too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So much fun and sooo many great ideas from recipes crafts etc once you try it you get addicted I can't stop
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend. He loved it. It does exactly what he wanted it to do, which was play movies from his ipad to his tv.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Have had this just @ 3 weeks and think I will soon wear out several tracks! Susan is brilliant. Her rendition of &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34;  will never be matched.
B000005H7D|5.0|This is truly an excellent collection of Jazz music. This Cd is approximately 1 hour long and has 7 soundtracks. These soundtracks are mastered in 20-bit Super Bit Mapping by Ron McMaster. The Musicians are John Coltrane, tenor saxophone; Lee Morgan, trumpet; Curtis Fuller, trombone; Kenny Drew, piano; Paul Chambers, bass; and Philly Joe Jones, drums. The 7 soundtracks are Blue Train, Moment's Notice, Locomotion, I'm Old Fashioned, Lazy Bird, and alternate takes of both Blue Train and Lazy Bird.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love her books, always full of poignant emotions, breathless excitement of the 'firsts'.  Keep them coming.  Story line kept me up the whole night to finish reading before I could sleep.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love this series and would reccommend it to everyone. It has a good twist on the look at a serial killer.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is simply addictive, plus its free.  I have stayed up too late many nights trying to beat this game.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Nice movie to watch during the holidays, it is funny and highlights the father daughter relationship maintaining the light hearted fun feeling.
B009D7CP2M|5.0|It was hard to get into at first. It was deeply written, not a quick read. Unfortunatly I finished the book 3 days before the sandy hook elementary school shooting which made it even worse for me since it just became so real. I thought it was very well written.
B0086700CM|4.0|Very good game. It is so very addictive. I can't stop playing. I was confused on how to control side to side movement but figured it out.
1250027624|5.0|I am a writer and will definitely use this for research.  It is an amazing book.  Together with the first makes the start of a great collection!
B000V86OKG|5.0|I love this series and would reccommend it to everyone. It has a good twist on the look at a serial killer.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This book is full of intense drama that I couldn't take my eyes off of. Full of twists and surprises that kept me hooked  until I finished. Greatly written and if you're a teenager looking for a twisted romantic story house of night is for you !(:
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I love this series.  The first book started off a little slow and I almost stopped reading it.  I am glad I kept reading.  The second book was my favorite.  I could not put these books down, and everything I have read since hasn't been up to par.
0385344228|5.0|Anticipated most of what transpired .  The story was very relevant and the conflicts that parents face raising their children was aptly described!<br />I love a book that grabs you from the first page! The Barber family will stay with me for a while!
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Great movie. Very good way to end the whole series. It ties alot of things from prior movies. Very enjoyable.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is by far the most incredible thing I have ever read. I read it in a day and will definitely read it over again. It's touching on so many levels and will help anybody that is going through a hard time.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I have loved this series since the pilot was released. I have every season and cant wait for the next one to be released.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|Sent it back. Didn't work for me, bought an Etecity and that one workes great. Gets 5 bars The Alfa got 1.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great book.  I'm nearly reviewer 3000 so I don't need to go on about it. Many have done that.  My question at the end is why they sent Bernard out and watched Juliette burn?  She arrived before he left the silo, so why turn on the argon gas flames?  That scene was perplexing.  Not enough to ruin the book, but it stopped me with questions.  Lukas was there watching. They could have easily killed her or Bernard could have, should have ripped that protective blanket away from her and used it for himself.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Im having a bit of a problem, trying to figure out. how to store the books I have already read,<br /><br />how does the wi-fi work? seems I have to charge this one more often then my kindle Key board?<br /><br />Thank you
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Best Romance I have seen in years. Love it! Rented it and wish I would have purchased it. great actors and I was impressed by Steve Carrell's serious performance. great job to all.
0425263908|5.0|Liked it very much, and have re-read a couple of different parts several times.  Would recommend them  highly.  Bring on the next one.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|I really like Nicolas Cage and this was one of my favorite movies. I got a good deal on it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was surprised to enjoy this story.  A classic it is not, but is entertaining and unconventional.  A fun read overall.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Very violent with lots of blood and guts!  Story line drags from time to time killing zombies....I will continue to watch it.
B005FISC52|5.0|So sad this is the final season! Love Love Love!!  A series you can never get enough of and can watch over and over again!
B006O6F932|5.0|this was a wonderful gift yall had it for cheaper than anyoine else. my daughter has really enjoyed it alot
0425263916|5.0|I liked the book very much.  Though I must say I like the &#34;50 Shades&#34; better these are still good books, and I can't wait for the next one.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I wanted to read Casual Vacancy because I'm such a huge fan of Harry Potter. I've got to say I thought it was one of the most boring books I've read or  listened to in this case.  It had entirely too many characters in the book. Honestly, the entire town was in the book.  It was hard to keep the characters apart, especially since the author kept flipping back and forth with them. I was very disappointed.  She should have stuck with Harry Potter. I got it as a free audio book on Audible with a trial membership.  I would  have been ripped if I had actually paid for it.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|My daughter loved this movie very much. It inspires her in her karate. thanks for a great movie.** **  **
B001706I5I|5.0|How the Grinch stole Christmas is a holiday favorite of mine. My children have out grown it but it helps me to laugh and enjoy this time of year. The theme of being different yet inherently the same is important. Hopefully people who watch will take that away from the movie.
1451695195|5.0|There is proof is heaven in everyday life is you ask me. One time I sat on top of my clothes dryer and it felt very good. I don't know if I would say \\"heaven.\\" But certainly, if heaven felt like that Kenmore I would definitely want to go to heaven for a long visit.<br /><br />Sometimes, it's late at night and my mom is asleep and I'll be watching some 1970s sitcoms starring Reginald ValJohnson or John Ritter and I yearn for a simpler time. Like before my divorce and bankruptcy. I do still love my ex-wife, but she's off now with that guy who owns a bunch of Blimpie's franchises and what irks me is I can't even eat Blimpie's no more because every time I take a bite into one of their sandwiches all I taste is my cheating wife.<br /><br />Now, the funny thing is her new husband is a pretty genial person, but he shakes hands super hard -- you know the type -- but he gave me a stack of \\"buy one sandwich, get one free\\" coupons which was nice of him.<br /><br />Anyway, good book and heaven isn't too far away, if you hear what I am saying.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|my daughter has been wanting this cd for a very long time, and i was very glad to receive it so soon
B00969PR18|3.0|Works okay on Kindle Fire 6.3.1.  Not up to Google standards yet. A lot of points of interest are missing so not sure how worthwhile it is to use the offline feature.<br /><br />Make some improvements and I will rate more stars
141659521X|4.0|Read this in one day on a beach in Florida.  If you are a Vince Flynn fan it will not disappoint.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|great collection of films, I had never seen the Next Karate Kid with the girl my daughter was really excited.
B003H9MSPG|3.0|my 7 year old put this down as his #1 santa gift..... I got it, but here are my downsides:<br />- it is BIG - really too long for a 7 year old even though the age listed is 6 plus<br />- it doesn't seem like a good nerf battle gun.  It will be hard to run around the neighborhood with.<br />My advice, unless you child is older, get the rampage or another nerf for nerf battles...
030758836X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from the first page to the last. I enjoyed it so much I was compelled to look up a photo of Ms. Flynn and I do have to say it was like being struck by Cupid's bow if it had somehow been fired out of a cannon.<br /><br />Listen, I don't know if she's married or has a long-time relationship with a same-gender partner and it doesn't matter to me what her lifestyle choices are. I just want her to be happy. I know fame can be difficult and I tasted a little bit of celebrity myself when my college band opened for a little group you may have heard of called, \\"The Hooters\\" back in 1987. If you don't remember them they had a song called \\"And We Danced\\" that was a little bit of celtic fusion combined with pure pop dynamism. I played cor anglais and sang backup. But if you ask me my voice was far superior to Randy's. He just couldn't hit the high notes I could.<br /><br />Anyway I digress.<br /><br />I hope Ms. Flynn will read this review and realize that we are probably soul mates and that every minute we spend apart from each other is time wasted. But, Gillian, know that I cannot make the first move, it has to come from you. Look in you heart and I think you will see me there wearing a fez and a \\"The Hooters\\" concert t-shirt and cargo shorts.<br /><br />Great book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good and sad at the same time.  Great read, you feel for both characters. Cant wait for the next book
B0063IH60K|5.0|My favorite diversion.  This app is easy to use and quick to install.  I highly recommended it for kindle users.
B002LC8HF0|2.0|I really enjoyed the partnership between Tensoon and Vin in the second book. In this book, Sanderson gives you the reappearence of Tensoon's  character, his lengthy imprisonment and subsequent quest to find Vin but he never actually does find her. He just kills himself along with all the other Kandra.<br /><br />Spook is an out of place and unlikable character and he is left in charge at the end. There really isn't a lot before now that tells you he is qualified for the position. If anything, history has shown he is easily manipulated by nefarious forces. He seems to have a chip on his shoulder about never being important like the rest of the crew. To say that the note he sent with Goradel \\"saved them all\\" is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />They kill off Vin and Elend. Why? They never even have an opportunity to see the world as it should be. To invest so much story into the main characters and then kill them off, seems kind of flat. I do agree with other reviewers that the relationship between Vin and Elend was not well developed.<br /><br />Overall disappointing.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got it a day or two after it came out. It was a deal not to miss out on.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found the writer improved on the let down of the second book by the time she reached this one. Still not as exciting as the first one but a farely decent ending to the triology.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|There is a connection between Taylor and I that goes beyond humanity.<br /><br />Sometimes, when I listen to her music I will pour myself a large tumbler full of buttermilk, sit in my chair and then close my eyes and drift away. When I close my eyes, it's Taylor and I together and we're dancing slowly and there's a feeling between us that is just to big to describe with words.<br /><br />Then she grabs my face and says, \\"did you know you are the most wonderful person in the world?\\" And I say, \\"I'm #2 Taylor. You're number one!\\" And she says, \\"Ok, let's not quarrel. As long as you don't smell like #2 I'll go along with it.\\" LOL<br /><br />We both giggle and then we have a tickle fight and she ends up on top of me lightly slapping me.  It's then that I realize that my life is perfect.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I was not able to get it to work on my Kindle Fire HD.  I wanted it to be able to play a game on AARP.com.  I never got it to work.  Wish I could have gotten the Adobe Flash ready to work instead.  However, neither of them will work with the Kindle.  So - I guess I won't be able to play my game.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|it is ok fits good can see it from a distance and nice and soft in side and out thanks
0307592731|5.0|I ordered this book after seeing the author interviewed by Oprah on TV.  It did not disappoint.  I enjoy reading about people who overcome great obstacles triumphantly.  As usual, Amazon came through with their excellent timely customer service.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Out of the many books I've read, this has become one of my favorites. It's a book that makes you happy. Very touching and a book that teaches you. A love story that's completely unpredictable yet realistic. The Silver Linings Playbook is beautiful.
B003O86FMW|3.0|After reading the first book in the trilogy I was really excited to read the second one. But it was significantly disappointing compared to the suspense and thrill that the first book had. Nevertheless I think its worth a read especially if you wish to complete the triology
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|kids seem to really enjoy it. keeps them pretty busy when im running errands with out all the crayons and coloring books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|always needing more fingers on my hands.math was never my favorite,so this app is a big plus when I do my banking,easy to use
B0000024YL|5.0|I had an old cassette and needed to update to a CD.. Love this particular album as it has all the oldies I grew up with
B0086700CM|5.0|As a Completionist who enjoys challenges, but wants them to be attainable, this game is tops. There's something oddly satisfying about collections those coins and all the different boosts and missions make it very rewarding. At the same time, it is just collecting coins. So there's no stress and every time you pick it up, you can pick up where you left off. Very good and relaxing for lunch breaks and winding down in bed at night.<br /><br />In short, it's a lot of fun!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best book ever since the last book diary of a wimpy kid cabin fever I love this series
075669812X|5.0|I purchased this for my son as a Christmas gift and he loves it!  The price was much cheaper than the store price.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very good contemporary romance with unique twist..<br />Creative idea and good plot development.<br />Enjoyed the characters.<br />Good enough to read again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was moving and touching and so well, engaging. I couldn't have asked for anything more, it's pure genius
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was addicted from book one I couldn't put them down I read all three books in about 3 days!! Cannot wait to read more from E L James!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I seen this show as it aired. And that is why I had to have it! If you like this kind of stuff it is a must have! Fast shipping!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I think the history background was very detailed and accurate.  The author connected Sarah's progress with Julia's. The ending was somewhat predictable but left open for your own interpretation.<br /><br />Well worth reading. You are certain to learn about some very dark days in France's history, something they continue to dismiss and ignore.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|Writer-director Richard Kelly's trippy, mind-bending feature debut stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a troubled Midwestern teenager plagued by incessant sleepwalking, family drama and visions of a menacing 6-foot-tall, doomsday-prophesying rabbit. Drew Barrymore, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze and Noah Wyle also star in this dark and intriguing psychological fantasy that swiftly earned a cult following.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince's books are the best. I'm not a big reader and will put a book away if I can't get into it. With this book, like all his books I have a hard time putting it down it is so good.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I started reading this at the start of the year, but never got to finish it because it was a library paperback. Read the rest of it now. Loved it! :D
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Fell in love within the first couple chapters so hard to put down. I read it so fast and had to buy the second right away!
B009VB97EY|3.0|It was different. Good story line to it. A little to much cussing for me. Channing did an excekkent job of dancing in it . On the whole it was not to bad of a movie
B005DOL0R0|3.0|I didn't realize that you would have to take the kindle out of the sleeve to use it.  i would have preferred it to be like a book where you would just open it to use it.  My original kindle cover is like that.
0375703764|3.0|The reviews I saw said this was a great book and it was also listed as a recommendation from Amazon. Well I bought it and while I appreciated the duality of the stories, I thought it was too long and both stories had spells of being uninteresting. I was happy to have finished it and donated the book to someone else.
B002SJKWZ4|4.0|This was a gift for a friend that has been a magican for 20 plus years. I thought he would just enjoy using it for watching TV. He has actually incorporated it into one of his acts. It was an awesome gift that put a gleam in his eyes! The only bad thing about the whole gift was the size of the instructions--font could be just a little bigger for us older folks! Lol. That was the ONLY complaint for this product that we could come up with!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely loved it!!! It was one the best I have ever read in my entire life. It was absolutely beautiful.:D
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The color is perfect. The kindle fits snug inside the case. The only downside, if there is one, would be that my 9 year old has to try a few times to get it to stand.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Such an interesting concept to write the story of Father Time and how he came to be. Very challenging thoughts on our current obsession with time. A great read! One of the most recent publications to catch my attention so much that I finished it in a week.
0425252868|5.0|I like to read books about individuals in wartime.  I picked this one up expecting to get the standard story about bombing runs and scrapes with fighters.  This book is so much more.  It stands apart from most books on the subject by telling the intimate story of one man whose character rises above a war in which he feels obligated to participate.  This book will move everyone who reads it, and deserves to be called a classic.
0307473708|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book as the rest seemed to have gotten worse. It's semi-consistent with season one and worth a read.
B004KA9UX4|5.0|I have a lot of piano background, but. no jazz knowledge.  This book put me on a delightfful immersion journey, and I emerged with an abilitty to make the jazz transition, and gained a much broader appreciation and deeper knowledge of jazz history along the way.  Expect to study and practice hard to get benefit from thousand book.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Like most of Nicholas sparks it has a slow beginning. But at the  end the book is totally worth your time and money.i couldn't put the book down. Even though I hate the ending the book itself is totally worth it.
0375403477|5.0|Have always been a Tom Clancy fan.  I enjoyed reading this book, but made it enjoyable to listen to with the animated voicing.  Receives a 5 star from me.  Great writer, great story, and great reading by David Dukes.
B007TK77QE|2.0|The writing is tideous and does not catch your interest! I downloaded it on my Kindle and was very disappointed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was very interesting. I had not read a review prior to reading. There are many twists in the plot which made for a very captivating read. I would definitely recommend to a friend who likes crime and drama. It's a little reminiscent of a combination between The Lovely Bones and American Psycho.
0385333846|5.0|I remembered reading this as a kid and thought it would be a great addition to my library at home.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|Great Song selection and the tempos of the songs just keep your attention all the way thru the whol album. Refreshing way to present the music. Vocals aren't covered up by the music. The guy on the board on this record knew what he was doing. What a great Mix.! I swear I thought i heard a mouse run accross the floor one time!! Just kidding! I am so tired of all the Jumping around and 9 guitars all fighting for a spot and drummers trying to see how many heads they can bust. Just get a cup of coffee or a glass of wine and set back and listen to  some goog music for a change. Here it is!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was so amazing to read, read it. You won't regret it! :) I need to see the movie now.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've read since fifty shades. It kept me on my toes and it had me so drawn in. It would be awesome if there was a second book following  this one, kind of like their marriage story!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|With season two of American Horror Story in full swing, season one was the perfect gift for any fan.  The story is great and a nice addition to a home collection.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|This was one of many cds I purchased this fall. I wanted some new &#34;old&#34; music. I was not disappointed. I want to buy more. Great purchase.
0316017930|4.0|I am late to the Gladwell game and I thought this book had some interesting points and observations to make.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Extremely buggy on Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Does not load properly. Does not load pictures properly. Very slow. Removed and using web based.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This book was terribly annoying BECAUSE it was borrowing a dir dir 333<br /><br />Luv yo for  CI CI<br /> Holler back at mey
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|this is a bad game<br />I do not like it at all it is one of the most dreadfully game I ever tried
B009KHBDUU|3.0|The movie started out strong but fizzled out mid-way.  There was a few good laughs but overall the movie disappointed.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|This was one of many cds I purchased this fall. I wanted some new &#34;old&#34; music. I was not disappointed. I want to buy more. Great purchase.
B0026FCNK2|5.0|This is a good science fiction film. It might be one of Bruce Willis' best performance he has ever given. All the acting is great. Brad Pitt also delivers an interesting performance. I recommend seeing this with Kalifornia and Unbreakable.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved how this book made me feel. How I connected to the characters. Though it had a few typos, probably the kindle 's formatting, I plan to read it again and again
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book a lot! I finished it in 12 hours! Maybe more but something like that. I think you should read it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very heart touching I love it. I love how two people who barely knew each other teamed up to stay alive. Even though Peeta gets hurt bc katniss doesn't love him back .
B0029XFNA8|1.0|I love this movie but i never would have boughten a black and white blu ray. I feel the package represents a color version of the holiday package.  The entire movie is b&w
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|This is one of the best cds I've ever purchased. I bought the cd after reading an interview with Susan. I didn't go on any of the free sites to give it a listen first.  So glad I bought it.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I loved this movie and couldn't wait for it to come out.  I've watched it several times and still love it!  Great cast - Johnny Depp, Jonny Lee Miller, Helena Bonham Carter, and one of my all time favs is Jackie Earle Haley - he is hilarious in this film! I watched the Dark Shadows series when I was a kid and this comedic take on it is just fabulous!
B00005M2CP|3.0|I thought that the movie collection would be in better shape. The box looked very old but the movies played well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is an awesome tale. Can't wait to read the next one! If you're a speed reader it's a pretty quick read.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|The next  one better be Good because this one has a frustrating ending for anyone who love  happy endings but I like how they added a twist
0061124958|5.0|This is a classic that I loved as a child. I bought it for my 2nd grader for Christmas. She is enjoying reading it, especially since she has seen the movie.
B00005NKKV|5.0|This was one of many cds I purchased this fall. I wanted some new &#34;old&#34; music. I was not disappointed. I want to buy more. Great purchase.
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|This dvd is defective.  The second half of the movie has a ton of frozen moments which was very distracting.  Didn't enjoy watching the movie at all.  PLEASE REPLACE, and let me know what to do with this one.  If you send me a paid return envelope and I will be happy to send it back.  Please advise what to do.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Much more understanding of Charlie's thoughts in the book than in the movie. Although they are both very good, the book is my favorite:)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was what I was expecting it to be .... amazing!  I really enjoyed reading this book so much!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Didn't think I would enjoy it. With all the talk everyone says. But a great read. Going to book two
B0049P1VHS|5.0|We were snowed in for a few days following Christmas. Perfect for watching ALL of season one and two. I have a house full of happy boys!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This collection has every song that I love by the Bee Gees included. I listen to it once a week. Just can't get enough of the Bee Gees.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I played another version of this game that was so touchy I was constantly making moves I didn't want to make. This is a good game if you need to waste a little time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is shocking yet amazing!<br />It goes to show you that life isn't always going to be perfect,but your strong and can accomplish anything, you just have to believe in yourself.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome for 10 and up<br /><br />Love the book love it a lot it's so cool and awesome awesome awesome too cool
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is SO much fun. I've experienced  0 issues and my kids are just as addicted as I am. Glad I got it!!!!!!!
B005XLN97M|5.0|I have a stepdaughter 9y/o, and a 3 y/o daughter.  With the difference in age, it's hard to find things they can actually play with and get along.  They both love this house and each one prefers to play with each other!  My stepdaughter initially wanted the 3 story barbie dream house which was one hundred bucks more expensive and for one more story on the house, I could not justify the price!  They receive this present on Christmas Eve via UPS and couldn't wait for me to put together the house for them.  I seem to be the one delegated to put together all the projects of the household so, I'm somewhat a handywoman....you know that saying, jack of all trades, master of none.  The house came with a picture of instructions (no words), and it was super simple for me to put together.  I think it only took about 15-20minutes to put together total.  I sure wish I had one of these houses when I was a kid.  My girls love playing with the barbies walking up the steps.  It comes with a bed that folds out so two barbies, (or barbie and Ken if you must), can sleep together.  It also comes with some accessories for the kitchen.  I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is on a limited budget and wants to see their kids enjoy hours of fun playing barbies!
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I can't wait to see him live some day. I have so enjoyed this cd. Not sure how I became aware of Gary, but I'm so glad I did. He does many types of music very well. Wishing him a long great career.
B007SGM084|4.0|The book was ok, slow at first, but it got better<br />The end seemed rushed<br />I have read much better books
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Keeping<br />  me busy it's a lot of fun except trying to Wright this review it's messing with my kindle fire keyboard
B007HACDLK|4.0|flynn is back to the basics and this what we expect and like .  straying too far from the formula loses us!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I'm a loyal Vince Flynn fan...read all his stuff as soon as possible.  This book is excellent and fun.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it tends to be more on the espionage side rather than the action side.  Still, there is plenty of both to satisfy everyone.  It leaves me looking forward to my next Flynn read.
B00000634J|5.0|This was one of many cds I purchased this fall. I wanted some new &#34;old&#34; music. I was not disappointed. I want to buy more. Great purchase.
B005HSGB6W|4.0|Good story,but the confusing language and words got in the way of enjoying the reading. Future editions should have a glossary so we understand what's happening.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This was very helpful to me. It was so helpful I could tell my friends to buy a kindle and download this book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|like nothing i had read and wasnt expecting this.  the first book is excellent but the next two could have been combined into a single book. became a little reptitive and drawn out.
1452110581|5.0|I gave this gift to a friend who has cats, the poems were dead on! A great gift for a cat lover
B0054YH8DY|5.0|This was one of many cds I purchased this fall. I wanted some new &#34;old&#34; music. I was not disappointed. I want to buy more. Great purchase.
B000089770|3.0|As a previous reviewer said, I was just channel surfing when I happened upon the Movie \\"Smoke\\" the first time.  As you learn more about the everyday characters and their lives, we find out how unceremoniously how bravely they live their lives, you are reminded to treat every single person with respect and compassion.  They receive no medals, get no parades, but they do the best they can with what they have to work with.  Excellent, funny, yet with surprising depth of thought, each line carefully crafted for the best effect.  I am buying it so I won't ever lose it, as I plan on putting this movie in quite often.  Reliving these uncommon common heroes tales, I regain a new hope for humanity and human kindness.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|A very disjointed story line that went between spaghetti western to black funk film to a righteous moral tale, violence in the wrong places, Di Capricorn is great but the rest are wasted. save your money, not great,
0446572993|5.0|As usual, Baldacci exceeded my expectations with this novel.  He strings you along with descriptive and exciting story line,  then explains what you missed along the way,  when you reach the conclusion.  Never a dull moment in this book!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|We rented this movie over the weekend from Amazon and watched it 3 times in a row...even the boys loved it... it was so funny!
0312370849|5.0|Heartbreaking, resilient, I liked the story and the historical facts surrounding it.  It is however a little too predictable towards the end, and coincidences do occur, but a little bit far fetched.  Though, that does NOT take away from the historical value of the book making it a must read for the people who already have a library to glean from throughout this horrific period of the history of our humanity.  There are a lot of books that relate true stories about the brave people who actually existed during those times, and they tell of the resiliency of human kind, and also reveal the cruelty and wasteful characters who enacted and made possible those events.  In any case, it was a good history reminder.  And a page turner for me.  The condition of the book was less than advertised, &#34;new&#34; was what I bought, but &#34;dirty&#34; and &#34;grimy&#34; is what I got.  The person who sold the two books to me was not very caring in how they advertised it.  This does not take away from the content.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I usually only play free games but this one was too addictive so I decided to try it out and was not disappointed.
B00136NUG6|5.0|This CD brought back many good memories with visions of happy times grooving with family and friends who have drifted to faraway places, here on earth and there in the hereafter.  I loved the mellow harmonies and the bass/falsetto dichotomy that was the signature sound of EWF.  The disco rhythm of their dance music was perfect.  And, their slow, provocative romance music set the tone for young love.<br /><br />I can see a renaissance of EWF beyond nostalgia.  It beats machine/electronic music any day.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It packed with everything I love! Action, adventure and a little romance. I recommend that everyone should read this book.
B008476HBM|5.0|The greatest love story of all times! I can't help but love everything by Jane Austen! Wonderful characters, wonderful read, the movie does it no justice
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The acting is great.  It is funny and sometime sad.  It is true to the history of its time.  I am waiting (Preordered) series 3.
1609611543|5.0|OK so I am in the medical field so this makes sense to me. I am not gluten intolerant. However, since cutting it out as much as possible I feel soooo much better. No more bloat after eating and tight fitting pants. I lost that stubborn 5lbs. No exercise. I am a fit person but have fallen off the wagon since an injury. Since the Holidays I have eaten wheat as its the season and I am not a fanatic. WOW I feel like crap BLOATED again and gained back a pound or two. As soon as I stopped and got back on the wheat free diet Bloat is gone and weight is dropping again. WOO HOO!!!<br />Overall a very interesting read. Look at it as an experiment. Try it and see how you feel. I think you will be amazed.
0156027321|3.0|It was ambiguous in many areas, but I feel the author wrote it that way to provoke discussion.  Was his intention to present metaphors of life or was his intention to describe the condition on face value.  The author leaves this question open for the interpretation of the reader.  Were there really wild animals or were there people who radiate the characteristics of wild animals<br /><br />Ultimately I believe the whole purpose of the book was to reinforce that life emanates from a supreme Creator, who decides the destinies of all life.  There is no chance, no coincidence; no accidents; no happenstance … we all move through a preordained cycle from birth to death at the pleasure of the Creator.
B0014U4X3U|5.0|I have given this to one of my grandchildren -- unfortunately before I could figure out how to use the Paperwhite.
B005MMY534|4.0|We have watched and enjoyed the Merlin series, but when I found this we decided to give it a try.  To be honest at the beginning I wasn't that wild about it, but soon we got addicted and have now watched all available episodes.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is a fun movie that you can watch time and again.  Great performances by everyone.  The story is fun and funny.
1250027624|4.0|Beautifully presented! The history of the clothing and period articles is so interesting and the photographs make it a delightful book to peruse. I especially liked the detailed insights into the characters' personalities and characters!
B007FJFDXS|1.0|The touch control is way too quick and is essentially uncontrollable. Looked for a way to adjust but there doesn't appear to be anything
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Finally gotten around to seeing this film. Was somewhat hesitant given all the bad reviews I'd heard. Snow White's story has been told and retold probably a hundred ways. This is a slightly different retelling all-around. I liked the new approach. To be honest, I've always found Snow White's basic story to be kind of boring. Great cast that keep the long movie evenly paced, great visual affects, and a fun and suspenseful angle. I thought Charlize was great as the villian, and thought Chris and Kristen were good also. Kristen appears to have a lot of haters or people who simply don't like her acting. I thought she was good here, although I didn't think the s/l asked that much of her from an emotional level. Prince Charming, or whoever the other guy was supposed to me, went missing for much of the way, paving the way for the Huntsmen. And it is the Huntsmen who does most of the heavy lifting here. Was expecting some kind of triangle, that thankfully never happened. This is Snow White's story though, and it was nice to see her go head-to-head with the Evil Witch. Found myself unsuspectingly rooting for her when the big battle finally arrived. Seemed too short, but I still enjoyed it. This film downplayed the usual romantic angle of Snow White, which I think worked for it. I wasn't really expecting to like this as much as I did. It's a definite buy for me after just renting it.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Got it for an awesome deal. Put this album on my daughters kindle for Christmas. Don't regret it one bit. She is a great role model and the price on this was unheard of.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|This is not just a children's movie.  It can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  It is a good story that is told well.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|If you have little bears at home this movie will be well received. Second to How to Train Your Dragon for the kids' favorite movie. Great quality streaming from Amazon Instant Video, too. No skipping even on poor internet connection.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Although for the Kindle, I felt that it didn't operate quite right.  The most frustrating thing I found was that I could not get out of the game once started.  I tried a lot of things to get back to Kindle home, but had to resort to restarting the Kindle.<br /><br />The game itself was okay, but I became somewhat bored with it.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Nice game. Good story and graphics. Got about 2-3 hours of interesting gameplay for $1.25. Would recommend for those who enjoy puzzles and adventure games.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|Slow movie with few laughs.  Was really expecting more since it's a Burton film.  Only rent if you need to watch, do not buy.
B0072GPQ72|2.0|For me this is a tough movie to watch.  I was unable to finish it.  I am a little sensitive to animal suffering.  Others may enjoy this movie.
B005DOKM9M|3.0|This item is kind of flimsy, doesn't protect the Kindle very well, especially if it's dropped. I would not buy it again!!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This is a sequel that references the previous movies significantly as it happens in parallel. Even those who've seen all the Bourne movies will be utterly confused through most of it and disappointed when they realize there is very little plot or purpose to this movie. The action was good and entertaining but overall adissapointment to the franchise.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The game was free and its a good way to pass the time without thinking too much on what to do.  Love the ease of moving thru the levels.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is a fun game to play....by yourself.  You can choose your deal, and make it as easy or difficult as you like.  Really passses the time.
0385040253|4.0|This book has every knot that you can imagine.  The descriptions are good.  It is still going to be easier to go on line and see an animated knot but every sailor should own this book.
B0019BI1FA|5.0|I would definitely recommend this dvd.  I enjoyed watching it immensely.  I would certainly recommend this DVD to all Oscar Wilde fans, and evn those who are not.
B006O5YHUY|1.0|Who chose the still for the thumbnail? Don't bother watching the movie to find out who wins. You know it!<br /><br />Great acting, great action, but any sense of drama is gone.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|The game was free and its a good way to pass the time without thinking too much on what to do.  It was also a way to reconnect with a friend.
B0084P9202|4.0|Has many good songs and is very sigur ros sounding. I believe it is a must have for sigur ros fans.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is funny, thought provoking and moving.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  Men of the world stand up, your family is waiting for you!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Led Zeppelin should do this show on every country of the world. One by year to not get his member to much tired. Simply perfect. They still had the rock'n'roll magic even after all these years.
0307477479|4.0|Despite winning so many awards and making many critics' top 10 lists, I left this sitting on my bookshelf for about a year before I finally gave it a chance. I am very glad I did, as Egan has woven an inventive, often amusing and frequently touching novel with no real flat spots. The emergence of initially minor characters as the focus of subsequent chapters was nicely done though some characters were sufficiently engaging to leave me wanting to know more. The famous/infamous Powerpoint chapter late in the book was a bit gimmicky at first but the content became quite touching (father/daughter relationship) so I ended up quite liking it. Probably my only real qualm was the chapter that veered off to a dictator in a banana republic. While often funny, it was a little cartoonish compared to most of the book which while always colorful, was generally at least semi-plausible. Overall, the novel is largely deserving of its many accolades.
B009KUANWG|4.0|There are of course many great Bond themes.  This one ranks up there toward the very top.  Very well done.
1400052181|4.0|There are many avenues to explore in reading this book:  scientific, historical, racial, ethical.  Very well-written and thoroughly researched, it prompted an interesting book club discussion.
030758836X|3.0|If I could I would give this 2.5 stars, so it would be right in the middle.<br /><br />Ok so what did I like?<br /><br />-It was a really, really fun read. If you want something fairly mindless, an escape, that's easy to read and keeps you wanting to know what's going to happen then you will love this book.<br /><br />What I did not like:<br /><br />- I guessed almost all of the plot twists! =\ Many people said what they liked was how clever this book was and how unexpected the twists were but I guessed almost all of them. To me that was disappointing because I think it's only a twist if it's truly unexpected and because of that I did not feel the book was very clever.<br /><br />- The second half of the book. I thought the first half was fun, a mystery, kept you guessing (sort of because I actually already figured out what was going on), but then it just spiraled out into kinda stupid and repetitive and unrealistic after the supposedly big twist.<br /><br />-- I, like many others, found the ending extremely unsatisfying. It was also unbelievable to me. Without saying too much I will just say that Desi's family was waaaaay too rich and powerful to let it end that way. No way in hell if for no other reason would the story end this way in reality.<br /><br />- The constant f-bombs and sometimes lewd sex scenes. Just a personal preference. Maybe I'm old fashioned but it's just a turn off to me when I feel that this is done just to spice up the book and make up for lack of quality in writing. I grew up reading classic lit and I think I may have higher expectations than other readers. I feel like a great, well written story doesn't need that kind of stuff to the extent that the author included it. Although I will say in the case of certain characters (I'm trying to not have any spoilers in this) that realistically they probably would have thought all of the sometimes offensive stuff that was written for them.<br /><br />If I felt that this book was just wonderfully crafted then I would probably be like, \\"Whatevs,\\" about the myriad of f-bombs and all that but the fact is I didn't think it was that great soooo mostly it just felt like a cheap sales trick to me. Ok, if author was trying to make the characters believable then, yes there are a lot of people with mouths just like that, but there are also a lot of people who never swear, and there are also a lot of people in between those two extremes.<br /><br />So, overall I'm not sorry I read it but I do wish I had just borrowed it from my library rather than buying it for my Kindle.
B001AW156U|5.0|this product gave me the comfort i needed in my ps3 controller it works great i would buy it again if i needed to
B0079IJ0R0|5.0|Best performance I have seen.  Sets, costumes, and of course the familar music.  Elina Garanca gives a very sensuous performance as Carmen
B000VMFDW2|4.0|A very engaging look from the perspective of the rifleman/mortar man who fought many of the battles in the pacific theater.  Very interesting read to understand the nuances of war and the challenges beyond the enemy that made these battles so horrific.  No cheer leading for the American empire (past or present) here.  Just an honest assessment of one mans perspective on the battles that most history classes dont cover in detail.  Enjoyed this book.
0525478817|5.0|I was instantaneously captivated by this book. Hazel and Augustus are characters that you care about and I found myself laughing and tearing up all at the same time. I highly recommend this book!
B005LAII12|5.0|Ted is my daughters favorite movie. So her rating is a 5, I watched it last night and also thought it was pretty good. I think enjoying Family Guy helped me appreciate this movie. Also, being from New England, knowing the accent is a plus.
0156027321|4.0|I enjoyed this outside of the box adventure.  I appreciated learning some zoology and biology.  I think it is also a good exercise for the reader to imagine being alone in a boat in the middle of the Pacific - enough time and space to be alone with your own thoughts and what that would be like to explore your mind for once without distraction (until you starve, that is). The character Pi is completely loveable. I could relate to the theme of dynamic resilience - stretching oneself over and over again to meet the never ending challenges.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly has written another great Harry Bosch story in &#34;The Black Box&#34;.  Suspense, drama and unexpected twists.  I can't wait for the next book in the series.

B0086700CM|5.0|I think it's superb! My brother,9, is addicted too. I recommend this adventurous game to everybody. I might get the Brave version also. I myself, at 11 years old,  think any one can play. People who say, &quot; OMG! It buffers ALL the time!&quot; I think they have bad WiFi  or their device is broken so people who say that should listen to this. If all your apps are not responding, shut down your kindle fire and charge. In 5 minutes, it should respond. If not, look online for tips. Otherwise, consult some one who is very skilled at electronic devices. Love the game. :)
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|This movie had lots of promise.  Great premise.  Super teaser trailers.  The movie itself really kind of dragged along (aside from the high-points we already had seen in the preview trailers).
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Ending seemed rushed.... At first the book was great, flowing, interesting, and then, the twist, and another, seemed disconnected. Not well thought out. Moments of \\"how did we get there\\" I had high hopes at the start of the book. Not worth the money.
B006O3MU96|3.0|This was my first app for my new Kindle Fire HD that I got for Christmas. I had been playing the game on the iPod Touch small screen for a few weeks and had really enjoyed the game so thought it would be awesome on the larger screen.<br /><br />I was really disappointed to find out that it didn't have the presents to collect so you could buy new abilities with the points from the presents. I was used to collecting the points up and get a resurrect power and a rocket as well as costumes.<br /><br />Also it didn't have the ice storm that turns you to ice or the hail stones being pelted at you to knock you off the platforms.<br /><br />Without these the game is pretty much the same as the original version.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really thought this book was going to be a typical cheesy romance story and I wasn't expecting much of it. But bringing back  the past made it more interesting. Sky and Holder's chemistry is so addictive, I couldn't get enough of their spontaneous conversations . Before they even got their first kiss, I fell in love with this couple. Congratulations to the author who did a wonderful story.
B005HSL626|5.0|I know there's pop up ads and stuff etc. I don't even notice. My mom's terrible at it but she absolutely loves it. I like it too. I just have one question... fruit?

B0055SWM08|5.0|When I want a game that doesn't make me feel wired, I turn to this one.  Great way to use your brain before bed; calm but not comatose.  Keep making sequels - I'll keep playing.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|A thrilling read although the court scene was very similar to another one of her books (plain truth) however I enjoyed it
B0085Z3B2Q|4.0|My grils love this movie, great that it comes with both types of disks, but i will never use the dvd disk.

0399160450|5.0|My favorite writer. The story builds on and continues the story started in Locked On. Really good read, enjoyed it very much.

B003NFM3JU|5.0|Disney was at its best when it produced this work. Not really for young kids, but a real treat for teens and adults.
B0053O89WY|5.0|We are working on getting all of the season and I believe we are just missing one now.  Daughter very happy with her goodies she received for Christmas.  Had friends over to watch.
B002E2M3KC|5.0|I gave this 5 stars is because it was actually a gift for a family member. He absolutely loves the vinyl version, he has heard the album before so he knows the songs.<br /><br />It was actually a good price for a vinyl record. Not too expensive, but not too cheap. It came in good condition and arrived in plenty of time.<br /><br />If you are a Queen fan, like vinyl records, and still own a working record player, this is very good product to purchase.
B000002GA8|5.0|Beautiful voices, beautiful story, wonderful memories.  You can imagine yourself along with them on their journey.  Can't even imagine how wonderful it would've been to listen to it in person.
B008CFN95I|3.0|Kept my attention, but not amazing. I felt a little let down considering the hype this book had received. The plot revolves around solving the mystery of an artefact. A little bit like William Gibson's Pattern Recognition, but not as good.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|good book  but its definately an adult book. im at 55% and will surelly read the next books following reflected in you.
B00633W614|2.0|Book one (Only Time Will Tell) was interesting but Book two (Sins of the Father) was..<br />To predictable. Characters lost their appeal. Some incidences unreal Ie: Maise & Stan in class room confrontation.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was the best book that I have read in 2012.  I couldn't put in down until I was finished.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I had previously purchased this as a non-BluRay DVD, years before--and wanted to see the new version. It did not disappoint! The sound quality is excellent, far crisper than the DVD version. And the beauty of the visuals has been enriched, too. A stunning film!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such a good book. I read it in two days. I could not put it down. I suggest this book as a must read. It was powerful and inspiring.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|I read this book in High School and many of the topics have stuck with me to this day, many years later. I bought this book to re-read and love it just as much as I did all those years ago! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a classic with several underlying themes or just wants a good read!
0805092447|3.0|Love this story/book but was under the impression it was a board book - dissappointed it wasn't.  Will continue to look for a board book
B0053O89WY|5.0|My absolute favorite tv comedy since M.A.S.H.  The niavete and almost slapstick interactions of the cast are genuinely funny; I watch them over and over.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Gives me something to do, to go to sleep.  Doesn't bother my husband.  I can play it, while trying to solve another problem.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I first heard Of Monsters and Men on the radio on my way to work one morning. I soon fell in love with the group's new take on music! I listened to several songs prior to downloading the album, but was seeking the album for some time! This is a great album! I would recommend this album to anyone looking for some new music with an eclectic taste!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use this to manage my home network of macs and never have an issue. The ability to redirect sound to my handheld makes this superior to VNC
B001B6PBBK|5.0|well I like it because you really don`t always have the fairy tale or what you think love is.. every relationship is unique and you gotta give yourself and the others a chance.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is a really fun game, I also, like it because  it is free. I really have fun time playing it.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|If this review was just about the quality of the music, it would be 5-star.<br /><br />However, what I really wanted is the complete music rather than just somebody's idea of \\"highlights\\".  Missing \\"Do You Hear The People Sing\\", except in the epilogue reprise, is a one-star deduction by itself.  When I compare this album to the prior on-stage and concert cast albums, it really misses more than half the songs -- another one-star deduction.<br /><br />Once the full music album comes out, I'll be sure to buy it.  This taste is not enough.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I saw this movie while in theaters and LOVED IT! Since purchasing the Blu-Ray and DVD, I have enjoyed it many times! It is a feel good family movie for all ages, adults and children alike! I watched this movie with my younger family members as well as my spouse! Complete with a lesson in communication and family ties, it is a movie that should be cherished throughout the ages!!
B0091LS07E|1.0|Alicia Keys has always been among the top 2 or 3 female singers in my book; that is until now. I am sorry but I found it painful to listen to her new album. I put it on the shelf after the first and only listen. This has never happened before! I don't know where she is trying to go in her music. She is all over the place; with no direction! That is only my opinion! I saw her on Letterman, and was equally disappointed i.e. the hair, the outfit. Who is managing her, or should I say mismanaging her now?
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I could read this book a thousand times and still be on the edge of my seat with excitement every time
1616614609|4.0|This is a reboot of an old collectible card game from 1996, reborn as one of Fantasy Flight's \\"Living Card Games,\\" which are like collectible card games except that you get (almost, more on that in a minute) all the cards that are available, and there's no such thing as a randomly assorted booster pack. Instead of booster packs with random cards, Fantasy Flight is going to be releasing monthly \\"Data Packs\\" which will contain 3 copies (the maximum you can have in your deck) of 20 new cards each. So 60 total cards. The idea is that if you keep up with the data packs, you'll always have a full playset of cards, and the only determinate of winning will be skill in deckbuilding and playing, and not who spent the most money to get the best cards. I'm a big fan of the Living Card Game idea.<br /><br />One of the biggest negatives about this product is that it does not actually contain a full playset of cards. Each of the data packs from now on will have 3 copies of every card, but for some reason in this base set, most cards only have 1 or 2 copies included. This means that in order to have a full playset, you'd actually have to buy the core set three times. This is unfortunate, and a bizarre choice on Fantasy Flight's end, seemingly a transparent ploy to get more money out of their dedicated fanbase. It's too bad.<br /><br />On to the game itself. It's excellent. One of the most fun things about the game is the physical representation of a cyberpunk computer reality. The corporation's cards are set up like servers, complete with ICE in front of them protecting them. The runner's cards are set up like a \\"rig\\" computer, with hardware and software cards that get installed and take up memory units. Combat, such as it is, is unique and different from any other dueling card game I've played. The game also requires players to interact with each other. The runner wins by stealing cards from the corporation, and the corporation is forced to draw each turn, meaning that they alwayshave a supply of cards for the runner to steal. This is fantastic game design. Much has been made online about the bluffing in Netrunner, and it definitely exists, though it's not as subtle or integral as in a game like poker. The corp plays their cards face down, and the runner doesn't know what they are. Some cards are points for the runner to steal, others are potentially deadly traps. That's about where the bluffing ends, but even a little bit of it is fun.<br /><br />One thing I don't like about the game is that after a while, it feels very deterministic. I've had games of Magic: the Gathering where I held off with one life point and managed to defeat my opponent. This sort of thing would never really happen in Netrunner. Once the game has gone on for a little while, it's obvious who is going to win. All the bluffing and card drawing in the world won't help you once your opponent has amassed enough resources and cards to hammer their way through to win. It's not a huge downside, but it's there, and I hope it will be addressed somewhat with future Data Packs.<br /><br />Another problem I have with the game is that there are certain, somewhat random, things that can happen that end the game immediately and quite anticlimatically. A runner can encounter a trap the corp has set and die instantly, even fairly on in the game. The corp can have a runner look at the top three cards of his deck on literally the second turn, and have the runner end the game then when the top three cards contain enough points to win. These things are somewhat unlikely, but when they happen it makes the game feel a little silly and weak.<br /><br />Another gripe with all of Fantasy Flight's card games is that their cards are just too thin and flimsy. They clearly skimp on printing costs. Again, just a fact of life if you want to play these games, but it cheapens the experience.<br /><br />Overall though, this is one of the better two-player games out there. I like it more than Magic: theGathering (a game I've played for over a decade) for many reasons. I wouldn't say I like it better than Warhammer: Invasion, the other Fantasy Flight LCG that I'm familiar with, but it's definitely different enough to be worth a look. Recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is very addicting.  I cannot stop playing it.  I have wasted much time playing it.  This game does pass the time.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This game is really nothing special. I have played this game a few times and I believe I will stick with computer Mahjong. I had high hopes and for me, it just fell short.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|In the book mockingjay,I didn't really understand the epilogue especially about the girl and boy,but other than that I enjoy the book. I don't think it was right for Prim to die it wasn't fair and was a horrible way to end her character
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It's so addictive for young children and adults. I recommend this app for anyone who likes a challenge.
0307277674|5.0|Had another copy of this in hardback but never received it back from someone who had borrowed to read! Decided to buy another for our own collection and was happy to have found it at such an affordable price. Interesting read and this arrived on time and well packed. Thanks!
B005XLN97M|5.0|Sometimes Barbie just needs a vacation and where better to go than her pink beach house... After about 20 minutes of assembly, the house is ready for visitors... whether they want to lounge around on the main floor (kitchen and living room) where they can watch TV or eat something at the kitchen breakfast bar, or go upstairs to the bedroom where they can use the toilet (lid goes up and down) or fold down the bed for a rest (again, this is supposed to be a vacation, and we know Barbie needs her rest).<br /><br />Overall this is well-constructed and well though through, and will provide hours of enjoyment to your little Barbie fan.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I love Bones! This is a wonderful television series following the lives of Forensic Anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan and her FBI partner Agent Seely Booth. With the help of the Jeffersonian team, they always manage to solve murders using just the bones. With dark humor, comedy, and relationships underlying the series, it is a great series for an audience who enjoys this!
B004I744AS|5.0|A very useful dictionary app. It connects to an encyclopedia and also features some fun functions, such as &quot;Word of the day,&quot; &quot;quote of the day,&quot; and word games.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It had a NOT so good end but the other sections of the book were good. It did not make me laugh out loud at all but there were a couple funny parts in the book. I think some writing ideas could be better but if a kid in 4th 5th and possibly 6th you like this kind off stuff, would like this book
B005DOL0R0|2.0|I bought this for the kindle fire hd 7 but it is too small. Now I stuck with it. Don't buy this if you have a new kindle.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This game is not the same as the one available on google play. You can not do any of the special offers for free gems like the google version. Some items are only available on the google version. If you can use google play you should download this game from there.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was 13 and since then have been forever changed by this movie! With many themes and topics explored throughout the movie, this movie explores the question of are we existing in our waking life or our dreaming life? It is a truly moving, life changing movie! Not meant for everyone, but to those who love these philosophical questions, I would recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy these games.  They are fun and challenging.  I love the different types of games.  They really pass the time.
0756666937|5.0|this was exactly what my grandson wanted. he should get lots of use out of this!  thank you very much.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|cI can download and install but can't open it.  Coby tablet. Sadly i doubt that they will update date a free app. Google version is fine but can't access Google play on this device.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This app is a feast for the eyes and I love it.  Playing with it is a great way to while away a few minutes or a couple of hours. I could lose a crop!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I can do all kinds of great things w this app black and white plus many more features to play around with and I can view others creative pictures! Its fun and easy.
B009CG3M1C|5.0|Good movie, other than one short PG-13 scene on the beach this movie is PG fun.  Lots of aliens that get beat up by the Navy boys. Ok for my 1st grader had to censor a few things, my 5th grader thinks its AWESOME. Looks great on the Kindle
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is suspenseful with a great but almost unexpected ending! I could reread this book over and over again!
B000I186FW|5.0|One of the best movies out there and not a bad price I order more then one movie to save on shipping.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This app gives me everything I want about the moon and more. It is very detailed and laid out well. Great work, developers!
0802136834|5.0|An interesting, easy to read history of the wives of Henry the VII.  I'm a history nut and I love the Tudor period - so this has been one of my favorites of that genre by far.  Alison Weir is a great writer and thorough historian, I would absolutely reccomend this to a friend!
B007C3TVNA|1.0|I watched this movie an hour ago and i still have a headache! The whole time i was watching it, in my mind i was asking \\"Whats going on?!\\" It dragged on.........and on...............and on. The beginning gave away the ending and the characters seemed slow and dull.<br />I thought the dad was dumb for buying Kevin the bow & arrows in the first place. It was obvious what was going to happen. People wonder why kids are shooting up schools and doing violent things in the world,  its because of movies like this that give them the idea! This movie gives a bad message. D-
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I couldn't put it down.  Loved the characters in this story.  Was a very easy read.  Didn't take long to get caught up in the storyline.
B000VSBX34|5.0|If you love the beatles then you'll love this. I couldn't find it anywhere else for the price, I was very happy with how quickly it shipped out as well.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was absolutely worth watching. We would highly recommend it.  The cast was exceptional.  Judy Denth and Maggie Smith are among our favorites.
1616614609|5.0|Having \\"experimented\\" with numerous CCGs over the years, I never found one I enjoyed as much as the asymmetrical, cyberpunk themed Netrunner. It was frustrating to see the original discontinued after a single expansion, and then fade into obscurity. So having it resurrected as a Living Card Game in the Android (think \\"Bladerunner\\") universe gave me some hope that I might be able to enjoy this unique game again. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The base game includes 4 corporation decks and 3 runner decks; one for each faction, each having a distinct flavor, strengths and weaknesses, along with a healthy supply of \\"neutral\\" cards to round out the deck. This means that you don't have to spend hours of prep time building decks before playing your first game, and if you want to switch things up, it's a quick and easy matter. And there's structure & guidelines for building decks involving multiple factions, once you're ready to step things up to a more competitive level.<br /><br />Some aspects (link/traces, for instance) have been pleasantly simplified, leaving the best aspects (asymmetry, bluffing) of the original game preserved and enhanced. Most strategy card games leave most, if not all, the strategy back in the deck-building portion; once your hand's dealt, it's about luck and a little tactics, and considering what to tweak for the next game. Netrunner differs significantly in that, while pre-game deck building strategy is still important, in game decisions and player interaction factor much more heavily. Like poker, how you play the game (and your opponent!) will matter more than the cards you're dealt.<br /><br />Adding to the replay factor is that the experience of playing as a corp is completely different from that of a runner. Playing the corp is somewhat analogous to playing Dungeon Keeper: you're trying to build an impervious, trap-filled, deadly lair to host your machinations, while pesky heroes keep trying to kick your doors down. As the runner, you're that pesky hero, rarely sure what's lurking between you and the treasure, or even if that treasure isn't actually a trap. Timing your \\"runs\\" is critical; the on-going arms-race of digital lockpicks & weaponry vs digital walls & sentries means tough choices and gambits every round.<br /><br />So whether you're an old fan, or looking for a new game with tons of replay value, Android: Netrunner won't disappoint!
B0001ZXM54|5.0|I love ZZ Top.  They produce great music and are a real crowd pleaser.  They never disappoint the fans and always put on a good show.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|hated these books, all three of them. Appears the writer had a lot of free time on her hands. Was only able to read 2, refused to start the third.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie was funny yet thought provoking.  It was good to see circumstances from another point of view.  All of the characters were very well represented.  We loved this movie and would highly recommend it.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|I downloaded this app and regreted it after about 2 minutes because it is very difficult to control and it gets boring very quickly.<br /><br />you will only some what enjoy this app if you are UNDER the age of 4.
B00433SVP6|5.0|The book was much like all the other Percy Jackson books full of adventures and fighting ,but all in all a very good read
0470913029|5.0|Excellent, well written and easy to understand. Helped me dial in my diet and continue the journey. I highly enjoyed it.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is off the full version<br /><br />I love this game because of the warriors<br />All the dragons that I get to fight<br /><br />Upgrade
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is so fun and addicting that you will never want to stop playing it!!! It is easy at the beginning and gets harder throughout the game.<br /><br />Its worth every penny and you will enjoy it very much!!
B008Z9L94O|2.0|Vinyl isn't cut well, especially the first disc.  My vinyl setup is mid-fi at best (Vintage sony TT, AT cart, Technics pre-amp/amp, pioneer speakers) and it sounds terrible.  I am not expecting my mind to be blown, but it is noticebly different from every other LP I own.  Makes it hard to justify spending that much money on the vinyl.  4 1/2 star album+0 Star vinyl = 2 star overall
0545265355|5.0|I purchased this for a school I worked at in Micronesia.  The students love the books, it's a great serious and you can't beat the price.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book shows how one can be deformed on the outside, but a perfect soul on the inside. No matter how many surgeries you've had to make you beautiful, your soul will always be the same. It may change how it makes you act, but the soul doesn't change in an instant. It is programmed to make you deal with what life throws at you. Your soul doesn't know exactly what is going to happen, but it will have you make decisions to deal with life.
B0043RT8JU|5.0|I bought this as a gift for Christmas because I loved the book. When it arrived it was in excellent condition, packaged well, and was for an awesome price.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Almost fell asleep.  4 adults watched and none of us liked the slow moving film.  Very disappointed in this movie.
0140544518|5.0|I remember reading this book when I was young.  My students love it and it's great to talk about idoms and puns.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This game was pretty good. Wasn't long enouth tho, imo. Good graphics, Decent story. A bit morbid but good ending, especially when.you conclude the extra game. All in all, I've played better, &amp; I've played worse, much worse.  LOL
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app has so much trouble on kindle. I don't get more than a few items on my news feed and have no idea how to change it.
B0000DJE9R|4.0|Enjoy the music of the past and the song selection.  This is a nice piece of memorabilia if you like being able to understand what is being said and sing along
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I honestly could not stop reading this book ! I now have to purchase Colleens other books. I sat at the edge of my seat reading it.

B004UID2LC|2.0|This app is not as user friendly on kindle as it is on iPhone. Very busy home page, with difficulty searching.
B00005JPAO|3.0|Interesting movie which depicted the story as anticipted.  Sad, moving, seems like a factual account of the activities of the time.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is a fun game for all ages to play. i would recommend it to families. It is good entertainment for long car rides.
6304539290|5.0|My 5yr old grandson was beside himself when he watched the 1st of the the 3 videos.  I remember seeing that same look back in 1977 on my son's face.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is a good time killer. And i love playing it. I can't enough. I will continue playing love the challenge.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|As we watched the DVDs in order over two weeks we were able to link many references and make more sense of things we let go over our heads when watching them with big gaps of time in between.  We have not tired of watching the various DVDs over a few times and watching the actors and actresses mature and grow. Seven year old enjoyed the fiorst few DVDs but was a littel afraid as more scarey things were shown so we only showed him the first few.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|On both disks there were frozen spots that I had to fast forward through . That said the series is wonderful
B007FJFDXS|4.0|Game play:<br />The object is to roll your cube through a maze and reach a spot where you fall into the home spot. You can also fall off of the edge. And have to either start over or start at a checkpoint that you have reached. Don't fall off of the edge of the maze as you will continuously be starting over.<br /><br />You can move the cube by the tilt method or using your finger. If you use the tilt method you should calibrate the device using the option section. I actually found that using my finger was more difficult than using the tilt method. This was very similar to the original edge app.<br /><br />You have to overcome varying obstacles like moving walls, rolling onto a button to get something to move, building a bridge by rolling on a button or taking a ride on a moving grid for example. The game is challenging and it can be fun or frustrating.<br /><br />Main Screen:<br />* Edge Extended<br />* Options - set controls, sounds, music, language and Ghost. Look at the credits.<br />* Mobigames - links to the Mobigame web site, Facebook, and twitter.<br /><br />What I like:<br />I like the challenge of the game and the mental decisions you have to make on the fly as you play it. One wrong move and boom you can fall off the grid. The graphics are well done as well as the music and FX sound. There are 48 levels and you will be challenged for hours if not days trying to beat them all.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />The controls are still touchy. On the first edge game the tilt controls were very difficult and the finger control was a little better. On this version the tilt control was much better and the finger control was extremely difficult. I would try to roll one square with my finger and the cube would roll 4 or 5 and off of the edge. I found the tilt control to be much better on this version and that is where I had the most success and fun.<br /><br />The only permission used is full internet access but the app will link you to the Mobigame website, Facebook and twitter. The Mobigame web site has lists of games for sale and you may want to turn off your WIFI, set your parental controls or set your device into airplane mode.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Just like the original version of edge this app is a lot of fun and it is challenging. It loses one star for the controls as I just cannot understand why using a finger control on a touch pad has to be so difficult. You would think the developers could fine tune that feature before the product is released.<br /><br />The game is still a 4 star app and you should get it while it is a FAOTD. It is a unique and well-designed game and you will enjoy it. Just don't throw your tablet at the wall when you keep falling off of the edge of the maze!<br /><br />Size: The uncompressed size of the game is 42.81 MB.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Network communication - full internet accessook and twitter.

B007FEZQF8|5.0|I think it was a little rushed but in the end an excellent read. I would recommend this to anyone.
0425263916|5.0|I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK!!! IM SO HAPPY WITH THIS BOOK. ITS EVEN BETTER THAN 50 SHADES OF GREY!!!
B008HK3XKO|1.0|I purchased a hardware cover last year for my kindle fire and decided to go with this one for my new kindle vs. My advice is stick with the leather it's more durable and much nicer.. this one seems to be very flimsy and cheaply made. Not worth $25
B0086700CM|5.0|The game works great on kindle fire! We love it! My seven yr old can play it too. Fast paced game that will trip you up . Simple rules but fun.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is a perfect game for kids. They can do so many new things that helps them learn. This is a great app.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|One of the most addictive games I've ever played, and the variety seems to be endless. I don't usually play games, now it's taking up all my time............Damn you Angry Birds!!!!!!!<br /><br />Yes I would recommend this to my friends ( if I didn't like them)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Simply amazing. There is really not to much more I can say. Charlie taught me things in a way no one else has. Just amazing.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Took forever to get it!  Otherwise, it worked well and will always be used when using the Kindle Fire. Great!
1451688091|5.0|I was very pleased with the book and it will take a long time to finish it because of its size.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|I bought this as a combined christmas present for my son, husband and father to work on over the holidays. They all loved it as there is so much detail in the van. My 8yr old was able to do the simpler pieces and my husband and father enjoyed tinkering with he engine. This product is a perfect example of Lego ingenuity.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I chose 4 out of 5 because I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It was funnier than anticipated and had a cute story to it. Also, the mash-up of the music was really good.
030758836X|2.0|I was extremely unimpressed with Gone Girl. I did not care for any of the characters throughout the entire book, not Nick, Amy, Go, Andie, the (useless) detectives, anyone. Amy annoyed me from start to finish, no matter which \\"Amy\\" she was trying to be. Her little adventure at the cabin was lame, and boring. Her timing in re-uniting with Nick was random, unexpected and also boring. And I find it very hard to believe that after years of scheming she could just decide at the flip of a coin that she was going to return to Nick instead of eventually committing suicide, sociopath or not.<br /><br />And like everyone else - what was with the ending??? Nick is an idiot. And the author tried to sell us on the fact that Nick and Amy were \\"meant for each other\\" in their own twisted way. Why, because they were both self-loathing, flawed and shared dumb, inside jokes?<br /><br />The author should have thrown in some twisted sex scenes and figured out a clever way for Nick to expose Amy for what she really is. Instead she got lazy and gave us a horrible, lame ending. I casually flipped to the next page and was both shocked and confused to see \\"Acknowledgements\\".<br /><br />All I'm saying is, I've read better.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Being someone who does not usually watch action movies my husband picked this out and I actually enjoyed it. It is a very entertaining movie.
B005HSL626|4.0|i would purchase this! ITIS FUN & CHALLENGING!! mY KIDS AGE 6&12LOVE PLAYING IT. kEEPS THEM OCCUPIED!!! iT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is a really good way to help to pass the time. Challenging hands make you play multiple times, very enjoyable.
1451620829|5.0|This book, &#34;Makeup to Breakup:  My life in and Out of Kiss by Peter Criss was very well received by the recipient who is a huge fan of of the group Kiss.  He was thrilled with this gift!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|We don't usually watch musicals, but for a musical it was very entertaining and amusing. Had lots of laughs throughout the whole movie.
B005KP7EO0|5.0|I watched this movie on the airplane!  Good traditional western.  Enjoyed it very much, and it helped make the long flight more enjoyable!  I recommend!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I am a product of the 60's & 70's and a lover of classic rock.  I have not felt so strongly about a grouip since back when I was listening to groups like Pink Floyd, 10CC, ELO.  I absolutely LOVE their music.  They are very talented musicians, writers, arrangers and singers!
B0042KZJ5K|5.0|lovely cd. exactly what i hoped for and was what my husband asked for. definitely worth the wait. we are enjoying it
075669812X|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my son, and he was &#34;the happiest boy ever&#34;!  He loved that it came with the green ninja that he did not have, and spent hours looking through the pages at the different Ninjago characters that he could get!
B004XDYJRU|1.0|The paid version of this app is surprisingly not nearly as stable as the free version.  My Galaxy Nexus would repeatedly lose and crash the audio component on the device as result  of running this app.  It also buffered consistently which was annoying.  The content of the app is terrific.  Unfortunately,  I deleted it and returned to the free version offered on Google Play.  It's an odd occurrence when the supposed \\"upgrade is actually a downgrade.\\"
B009VB97EY|4.0|thank you Steven Soderbergh.  i gave it only four stars because it could have been longer.  and chaning tatum could have dressed up like a fisherman. or a rude boy. or in something furry.  i'm just saying...
B000068FWC|5.0|I have the original on vinyl and love this remaster of it.  If you can only have one Supertramp album in your collection, get this one, not a bad cut on it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|There was no option to remain logged in once seeting up Facebook on my Kindle Fire. I'm not going to login every time I want to view Facebook so this is a worthless app for me.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I fell in love with Edge and now all over again with Edge Extended even though I don't get high marks. The game is challenging and just simply lots of fun. There are  three control choices - arrows, touch, tilt. I don't do well with tilt, so I use either the arrows or touch, and they work great on the Kindle Fire HD.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Good slapstick. Intelligent humor. We watch it every year. James Caan is a great straight guy for Will Ferrell. &#34;Does somebody need a hug?&#34;
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong Artifacts is an awesome game.  It's a tile matching game using various character sets. It takes you to various continents and civilizations. It was difficult recognizing matches at first, but once you Get a hang of it, It's awesome!
B0012FCLI6|5.0|I  love, love, love, love this..................It helped me get through some hard times..<br />She put me in a state of mind that I could help myself
B002SJKWZ4|1.0|Way to hard to program, still havent gotten it to work and there is not an easy weay to just get it up and running.
0756697875|5.0|This is a really cool book. It has nice pictures. I got it for my son for Christmas and he loves it.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I really love this game. It's fun, entertaining, and very addicting.  I couldn't put it down.  Everyone should try it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE THIS GAME... I LIKE THE FACT YOU CAN GO BACK TO WHERE YOU THINK YOU MADE A MISTAKE. I COUNT WINNING AS IN GETTING TO THE END *********NOT SCORE************NOT TIME....... SO I GUESS YOU CAN SAY OF ALL GAMES I  AM ADDICTED..
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I began reading this book before the tragic events in Newtown, Conn.  In spite of that, the book was always a page turning, good read.  I would have rated it 5 stars if not for the coincidence of when I happened to be reading it!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addictive and so much fun. Its easy enough for my kids to play as well. Love it!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I down loaded this app for my android and It works great.  I really like using this Flash light app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|..on my iphone and now on my new Kindle Fire HD!!! No more using reg cards.. this is so much more fun!
B007P9ELWC|4.0|If you liked the first one you should like this one, but maybe not as many catchy lines.<br /><br />FYI to Amazon:  It's &#34;OSI&#34; not &#34;Osi&#34;
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Thank you! It came in great condition as it was expected to be in. And it arrived earlier than expected! I am so glad I had it shipped to my work-so my husband wouldn't know what he was getting for Christmas :)
B004LWZWGK|5.0|What an amazing follow-up to an addictive series!  I really like all of the action and the imaginative way the spectator thinks after watching a movie like this.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|This movie is really funny. Not for young children though. Movie shows how one person can change from material things to something greater.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Too bad about the movie choice! Keep up the good work Mr Child. I didn't know how this would get solved.
0545265355|5.0|Classic series.  Good deal and great gift for people who keeps a collection.  I bought this to give as Christmas present, they love it.
B0042U94UQ|1.0|This brand new disc would not play, which was a real disappointment for my son, who received it as a gift.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|(Kelly) Clarkson has such a beautiful, strong voice and wide range! So nice to have several of her hits on one CD.
B0087GZ8YW|3.0|So many characters so many places....sometimes hard to follow! Glad to have REbus and his old partner back together again!
B005KELQEU|5.0|this case is great, classy and I can't believe it was that cheap! I recommend it to whoever wants something classy yet trendy for their kindle!
0786860707|4.0|This book came in a very timely fashion.  Everyone loved this book!  It's a great combination of written information and pictorial...great sketches of the animation creations, beautifully done!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that there were a grouping of 4 or 5 pages that were attached at the top right hand corner so we had to go in with an exacto and trim off...but easily fixed and it didn't really effect the beauty or quality of the book.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Since many film makers are digging into the classic fairy tale reserve and making updates, there will likely be many more such films coming in the future. This one was reasonabley done and competently executed. There's nothing special or really compelling about it, but it is worth viewing for those that like the fairly tale/legend genre of films.
B0000549B0|5.0|There is nothing lIke a Jimmy Stewart movie and an imaginary rabbit! Character actors are wonderful and the story is humorous, touching and just plain wonderful.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I remember playing Pac Man for hours on end as a child.  This brought back so many memories.  Glad I found it.
B003P2C5CQ|4.0|Good collection of the best of Oasis.  Worth the purchase for the few popular Oasis tunes that got decent radio airplay.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|If you love action films with a good plot, and a little bit of history woven expertly into the story, then this is the movie for you.  The 3-D effects are some of the best I have seen.  The story is very clever.  Don't tell me you don't suspend your disbelief for other actions/scifi flicks.  What makes this one any different?  Saw this movie at the theater and ran out an bought the 3-D disc as soon as it was released.  It's worth buying just for the train scene which is phenomenal.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter and she was very happy with it.  We will recommend it to others who like this type of animation.
B000002KKD|5.0|Perfect business transaction; terrific present for husband.  It made his Christmas fun.  He enjoyed the songs and loaded them on his MP3 player.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Makes you feel you have visited Fairyland!!!...and that you could make your world better if you believe in something wider,bigger, different...with love as the catalyst to cross all the divides!
B004WDRT1Y|1.0|We bought this with high expectations, as we love the movie.  Here is a tip for 3-D movie buyers - if the movie was not originally filmed in 3-D, it will not be that wonderful.  Perhaps one exception is the Titanic, as the director in his usual professional way, took great care with every single frame.  Most of the movies that are converted are just cranked out to make money.  The Lion King had so few good 3-D effects, we were shocked.  Our policy now is pretty much just to buy the movies that came to the theaters in 3-D.
B00866JL96|5.0|I love this movie.  I bought it unseen and only reviewed and am very happy with the film.  I would recommend it to others. Thanks
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Very fun game to play on the kindle fire and I purchased it for a very good price to boot
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This wasnt really a batman movie for most of it.lets analyze who bruce wayne/batman is.he's a super genius,billionairre,playboy,philanthropist who's in incredible shape and fights crime.well not anymore.in this movie.here he's out of ideas,broke,has only one girl who is using him,cant afford to help others financialy,broken down and gets his butt kicked a lot.<br />  was the movie good ? yes,of course.but did it live up to the hype ? no ! a lot of times hollywood gets people so worked up about a movie nothing less than the second coming wont do.thats what happened here.<br />  there were a lot of unexplained things too.i had more questions than answers by the end of the movie.another thing that always gets under my skin is when super hero movies dont follow the comic books.and,lets face it,they hardly ever do.this movie had a number of mistakes.and there were a few things that were hard to believe.i mean i realize this is a fantasy movie but still.some of the special effects werent very special.banes voice sounded creepy and was kind of high for a steroid  monster.<br />  now onto the good stuff.there was some better than average action.the cat woman finaly got to kick some tail after being in 3 movies.lucius fox got to stay on.there were parts of the story that were epic in scope.the new bane was interesting as compared to the old one.the new cat woman was as well.<br />  lets compare.this is the 8th batman movie.i'd say its better than the one from the 60's as its not so silly.i did not like it better than the tim burton \\"batman\\" movie from 1989 with jack nicholson as the joker.it was comparable to \\"batman returns\\" but i think this new one edges it out due to better tech.but i like the michelle phieffer cat woman better.sexier and crazy.then there was \\"batman forever\\".i loved the riddler in this one but 2 face was mildly interesting and robin was a little punk.so \\"rise\\" beats that one out too.that was the tim burton trilogy.then there  was \\"batman and robin\\".it was really ,really silly.there were bad puns throughout and george clooney was not a very good batman.batgirl,while hot,was  crabby all the time.so \\"rise' beats it too.then we get up to the current trilogy.the other 2,especialy \\"dark knight\\" beat this one,hands down.so ,out of 8,i like this movie 4th best.<br />  i definately recommend this movie to batman and super hero fans.and i would go see it if i were simply an action or sci fi guy also.heck,theres even a bit of drama and romance too.its an better than average  movie its just not the all time classic the media made it out to be.i would recommend it.
B0058YPILY|5.0|This is one of our favorite shows.  Each season just keeps getting better as this one did!  I highl recommend.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|I really like this product, because it's light weight. I can have my kindle everywhere such as my purse, my nightstand or while having drinks, since this product protects my kindle everywhere I go. I really like it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The twists, turns and events in this book make it impossible to put down.  Can't wait to read it again.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Thrilling easy read that leaves you hanging on the edge and considering the fate of our future... plus a love story never hurt anything.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good read. His books always hold your attention.  I have read all of his books. Look forward to more to come.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I've had it for about one month.  It takes me out when I'm beating my time in the Green Dragon game four and game three. I'm unable to get the three stars in these games. I like it though.
B000IOM1Z0|5.0|I bought this CD for myself. I listened to this music many years ago so I purchased it to relive the music. I highly recommend it.
B00328G4V6|5.0|I love listening to any Jimi Hendrix music. This was shipped to me fast and sounds great on my player.

0132350882|5.0|My adult son has been programming and writing games for the computer for many years. He found this book very helpful.
0743270754|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas.  We enjoyed the movie so much and I hope that it is as good to read!<br />The book was a good price and arrived on time and in great shape.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|It was horrible quality with the play back. Usually downloads are excellent this one sucked. A complete waste of money.
B005K2KCPG|3.0|I like the album but I'm not sure what happened to my order. It never showed up in my Amazon player, I can't seem to download it to it and I'm just not sure what is wrong.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|I bought this CD for myself. I listened to this music many years ago so I purchased it to relive the music. I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Definitely a fun and hugely addictive app! I'll be honest, at first I saw this game as nothing more than a ripoff of &quot;Temple Run&quot; (and on some level, maybe it is). But it also has its own little nuances and creative flares that help it to stand out on its own.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the term &quot;replay value&quot; is appropriate here, but there's plenty in this game to keep you playing for a long time. The store of characters to purchase is pretty large (as well as hard to get - several require a TON of tokens or coins to unlock) and there's a lot of power-ups to help make the game even more fun!<br /><br />My only real complaint is that about a month ago, the game erased all my previous save data (except my high score) completely out of the blue. I'll admit, it did put me off for a little while, but now I'm just as addicted now as I was before. I definitely recommend &quot;Subway Surfers&quot; to anyone - GREAT app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't stop reading it! This book grabbed my attention from page one to page 300, a true edge of my seat read
B008G8SFGO|5.0|It took several listens before I liked this album. The lyrics are really cheesy, but they always have been. Maybe I have just grown out of them but the sound is great and overall I have to give it a thumbs up.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|I bought this CD for myself. I listened to this music many years ago so I purchased it to relive the music. I highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Every chapter left me wanting more and I'm so happy there is more books in the great trilogy.
B003SJ6XMY|4.0|Ok, so it's not &#34;Basic Instinct&#34;, still it has a solid cast (yes, even pretty boy Brosnan) and i thought it was a real treat to watch a cameo by an elderly Ely Wallach. Ewan McGregor does a great job as the ghostwriter to a former British prime minister implicated in a rendition and torture scheme with the Americans (who could that possibly be?). My main complaint was the ending, which required a greater suspension of dis-belief than should be required, but conspiracy theorists will no doubt roll with that punch. Rent it and you won't be disappointed.
B007EDYN36|5.0|I have read most all of the KISS books and books about KISS. Peter is very bitter and it would seem he has always been a bitter person. Thinking back to the high school years and the kids that were in bands I would say that most are like Peter. Can't stand someone telling him what to do, can't stand working hard each and every day and can't stand someone else having an opinion. I would say that if what he says is true about Gene Simmons that Gene is one disgusting individual.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|This is an amazing CD and DVD collection. The music is fabulous and ai Listen to the CDs all the time. The DVD is wonderful to see her perform.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is one of the best shows out there because it keeps you wondering and it has an amazingly interesting cast of characters.  Don't get too attached though, some of them don't stick around.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Reminds me of the earliest video games, with a decent challenge and simple, 8 bit like characters. Lots of replay value as well. Try it out, it's blast!
1449410243|5.0|I got this as a gift for a friend, it came much faster than expected, and it was exactly what I wanted.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|My son loves Tinker Bell and was thrilled to get thiese movies. He has really enjoyed them a lot. Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is the best ever. If you purchase this but it wont install; you just need to log off the Internet and log back on and it works.
B007NU54H4|4.0|The movie is great, the story is sweet and the visual is awesome. If you like any of the other Tinker Bell movies, you'll love this one too.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|I was raised reading Batman comics and this set of three films definitely fulfills my need for a Batman fix. The story arc is well developed and Bale makes a good yet vulnerable Batman.
B007MDB548|5.0|My son loves Tinker Bell and was thrilled to get thiese movies. He has really enjoyed them a lot. Highly recommended
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have used The Weather Channel for years and found it to be very accurate and reliable. Found no need to change
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Im glad the series continues. Enjoyed the read and looking forward to the next one already. My only question is how many times are they going to kill off his wife?
0061537969|5.0|I drive race cars and this book is wonderful.  This book can be enjoyed by anyone, not just a racing enthusiast.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|... there's not enough of it.<br /><br />Every single song on this album shines. Every last song. Jeff's musicianship has never been better. Jeff's voice, aged like sonic honey, pours over the wounded soul and salves all.<br /><br />I've always thought he was the latter day Roy Orbison. He's taken 'Running Scared' and made it his own. I never really cared for the song 'Love is A Many Splendored Thing' ... but now, with Jeff's version I can't live without it. Jeff proves that any song can be a ELO song, if it tries hard enough, someone wrote somewhere. They were right.<br /><br />Jeff's a giant. I'm so glad he's still with us, doin' that crazy thing.<br /><br />But just 27 minutes worth of music? That isn't even as much as Armchair Theatre, another album I can't get enough of ... and that's a bit too short.<br /><br />There needs to be more music!<br /><br />It must be part of a campaign by Jeff to keep us hungry for more.<br /><br />With me, it's working.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was so hard to put down. Only took  me four days to read it. Keeps you wanting to keep reading
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this game.  This is my type of passtime.  I wish there was a World of Goo 2 being made!!!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|daria's one of those series for those who want to stick a middle finger up at everything that's expected of the world.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Soooooooooo fun! Free is always good but I like challenging games. It keeps the brain going, because a mind that's not in motion, tends to freeze ;P
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The cover fits good and protects the unit well.  The price was right.  Highly recommend this unit.  Take it anywhere.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Love the series.  I read it on my android phone.  I enjoy all the twists and turns of the series.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Some good laughs and a touching story to boot. Fun to read. a a a a a a a a
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|To much f word and yes i use the f word myself 31 years in the construction business and a teddy bear cussed worst i heard. Hollywood get a grip . Or just start making pornos with teddy bears
B0042ESTQW|4.0|This does what it says.  It fit as expected and provides the protection I was looking for.  It would be nice if the areas that cover buttons on the Garmin were a different color so I could see them easier but I got used to it.
B007XHWROK|4.0|I Got this CD for my daughter for Christmas & she plays it on repeat for hours... :-(  lol I think I know ALL the lyrics.
0399160450|5.0|I am concerned about the cyber threat from unfriendly intelligence agencies and criminal types.  Clancy's books always seem to have some truth in his fiction.
B005F96UNM|5.0|I love the movie, I've watched it 3 or 4 times already and I'm still catching little hints through out. The movie gets it's theme/feel from Bunraku the Japanese theater of giant, uncanny valley dolls that...blink. Those things are weird as hell and there's an expo of them at the Morikami Museum if you have the time and are in the area. Anyway I saw the movie before I learned of the theater and still loved it. The plot doesn't go the way you'd expect, there's a lot of tongue in cheek humor which is awesome and action, well filmed action at that. No stupid quick cuts and loud noises to distract from the fact that the actors can't do the moves. Give it a try, if you don't want to buy it based on the reviews, watch it on Netflix.
B008YW5RH2|3.0|It's hard to maneuver at first but once you get playing you'll get addicted and wonder if you might get early arthritis!
B004H4XLRE|5.0|My 3 year old grandson likes all cars and loves racing them.  This lets him race 5 at a time, and set up 10 in the starter position.  Works especially well on a hard wood floor.  It sent them flying down the hall.  Lots of laughs.
0446580848|5.0|I have had a personal interest in the events such as the current fiction used to write this story.  DeMille has a good sense of humor and captures the banter between the FBI agent and the NYPD officers.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found Jobs to be very well written and likewise, very readable. Issacson keeps the narrative very much alive with plenty of detail at the same time. Jobs was quite a character.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|At first I wasn't sure if I would like this movie, but it turned out to be awesome! I can't wait until part 2 comes out
0439023491|5.0|Great book, page turner, quick read...Received in the mail in two days...have now read all the book of this series. Cant wait for the next one to come out...Thinking about reading them again....Saw the movie but the books as usual are better, you get more of a connection with the characters
146500632X|5.0|Both of my daughters have one of these calendars. We bought one for my 10 year old in November for her birthday and whan my 16 year old saw it she wanted it. They are both very happy with it. :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book cant wait to read the next two. I would recommend this to anyone above the age of twelve<br />.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|The movie was funnier than I thought it would be but it was still pretty good. It is so much like Family Guy.
B00A4CHZ2K|5.0|I love phillip phillips and his music never seems to let me down. I got this album at a very reasonable price and it has a lot of great songs. If I went back in time, I would still buy this album.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good like all the Teacher novels but I like the ones more in the military line. I would definitely read it again
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a book that stirs all emotions while reading it. I see myself in Enzo, Denny, Eve and Zoe. I laughed at the Twins and Mike and Tony. I can read this book again and again and will feel the same like when I first had it in my kindle.
B005LAIIPS|1.0|Bourne Legacy but NOT Bourne!<br /><br />I just finished watching the latest from the Bourne-franchise and I finished with mixed emotions. Does it have a great cast? Sure! Is the story-line even passable? Absolutely! Is the action well-made? Certainly! Is it high-paced? You bet! Is this a great Action-flick or isn't it? Oh yes!<br /><br />But a Bourne-movie its not. First of all it doesn't ad anything to the Bourne-universe but merely retells the story from the original movie - Bourne Identity - and even worse: How the h... is it ever going to be a Bourne-movie without Jason Bourne? I thought I could see past that, but I can't.<br /><br />In the end I have to conclude: Great Action-flick which unfortunately is missing the essence of Bourne. If you can look past this you are in for a treat. If you can't you will be disappointed. I was!<br /><br />So where does that leave the Bourne-franchise? That remains to be seen! Right now however it looks DEAD.  Sorry fans!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was a very cool book and filled with adventures! I loved it a lot!It has 24 Very cool Chapters
B009O2XY12|5.0|I play this game all the time and the only frustration is that it is so hard to replenish the jewels.  I wish there was a reasonable way to earn them instead of have to purchase them.
1932100660|5.0|This is a really important book.  I didn't realize how much information I was missing out on by keeping my knowledge to media sales adverts only - the average person doesn't have easy access to medical research and studies - that's why this book is crucial to saving lives in America.  If you know someone who has one of the major diseases of America, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc - please, read this book and buy a copy for them to read.  It could save their life.
1401322786|5.0|This book will make you really think. I enjoyed it very much. Worth reading and not very long. Interesting concept.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really liked this book because of August Pullmans courage and he actually went to school even though a lot of kids bullied him!
B000A2IPPK|5.0|Wonderful old movie kids have probably heard you talk about. Now you can show them on DVD and relive your childhood memories as well.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|First half hour was a little slow as it was confusing with all the jumping around between various people and situations, but as it started to make sense -it got really good!!  Love this series
0439023513|5.0|You will not be disappointed. This is a great book for teen agers and adults. Most students do not like to read. My students could not put this book down.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I thought this game was too easy until I got to the higher levels. It gets harder as you go and is really a challenge.
B00A757EFW|5.0|everyone loves pac man! easy to use and fun to play for all ages. Kids will enjoy it even with all the new technology these days. Simple is classic!
0375413405|5.0|My daughter-in-law saw the movie and wanted to &#34;cook through the book.&#34;  She has already started using it and it very happy with her gift.  I paired it with the Julie and Julia book which was a good plan.
1579126286|5.0|As always Agatha Christie is a wonderful author. I could read her books over and over again. You will love it.
B005R32L66|5.0|my daughter uses it. She loves it.. she can talk to her grandparents in Colorado Spirings. She also talks to her friends that way.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Must have for your collection! My kids liked it and still watch it. Its so nice to have on a DVD after all these years!
0765324857|5.0|When you make a prequel of anything, you're almost immediately guaranteed to fail because what you're basically doing is just adding fat that doesn't need to be there. Or in a better way to explain, it's like explaining a joke after it was told--you already get it, so why back track and explain why the banana peel was on the floor in the first place? And, seriously, it's a prequel, so any and everything that happens in it is pointless to know because you know what happened. That's not to say that it can't be compelling regardless but you have to make sure that whatever back story you want to use has to be open enough to fit a nice little space into the mythos of the world without wrecking the original story too much. And holy hell this book does that with the Bioshock games. It even makes the second game seem justified (Sofia Lamb and her ilk showing up right the hell out of nowhere without ever being mention in the first game, for example.)<br /><br />Taking place before the events of the first Bioshock, Andrew Ryan is on the verge of seeing his dream utopia Rapture come to life but he needs help, so he makes his rounds across the globe to recruit who he felt are the best to represent his vision. One of those people, a mild-mannered plumber from England named Bill McDounagh, whom after impressing Ryan while fixing his plumber, gets brought into the project as the general contractor. Bill is the closest thing we get to a 'hero' of the story, though it is far from his story. Rapture follows the lives of the...'eccentric' (read. from offbeat to sociopathic to psychopathic) denizens--characters from the games like scientist Brigid Tenenbaum, police officer Sullivan, smuggler Frank Fontaine, etc.--of the christened utopia, the titular city build underwater, where Ryan has promised them to be free from the restrictions of pity things like morality, ethics, and altruism. And quite a lot of them have taken him up on said offer. A few new scientific discoveries and mutated working class later and all hell breaks loose in Rapture, setting the stage for the events of the games.<br /><br />Without stepping on the toes of the franchise, John Shirley, the author, has crafted a fun science fiction book for not just fans of the games but I'm sure non fans would enjoy it as well.working class later and all hell breaks loose in Rapture, setting the stage for the events of the games.<br /><br />Without stepping on the toes of the franchise, John Shirley, the author, has crafted a fun science fiction book for not just fans of the games but I'm sure non fans would enjoy it as well.
0439023491|5.0|Love this book and series. It will really make you think. I am an adult and still could not put this book down. Students in my school love it.
0547884591|5.0|Tim unlocks his secrets to learning.  This is the amazing part.  He does it by teaching you how to cook to teach you the process of learning. .<br /><br />The recipes are unbelievable. Beset steak I've ever had and I made it in 10 min.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I love it. You hear the story so often, but it's never as perfect as reading the original. Try it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AWESOME!! AWESOME!!! Wonderful page turner, I can't wait to read book 2 and find out what the Capitol has up their sleeve!
1451695187|5.0|Written by an author to trust. This is an amazing story. It will really touch your heart. You will not be disappointed
B008XX6J4C|5.0|There isn't much more I can say beyond what was already said by others. Just wanted to give my 5 stars too! :) :) :) :) :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am very happy with this app it is very easy to play and I am enjoying it.. I just got my Kindle fire and wanted to try some apps I would like this is a good one.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Hours of fun! would recommend this game to anyone...very easy to learn and play!<br />Looking forward to playing others by same designer!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Someone told me that if you don't find Macfarlane's \\"Family Guy\\" style of humor funny, then this movie wasn't for you. They were absolutely correct. Watching this movie was torture and had I not paid to rent it there is no way I would not have finished it. PS: If you are going to have jokes about child abuse, they had better be funny, otherwise it's just sad.
B005K17RU0|5.0|simple app to use. great weather information. stays on the alerts so u get up to the minute information. great distance on radar view.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Love, love, love, love, love! I didn't think I could like the second book of the series as much as I did the first. I have already downloaded the third book and I cannot wait to read it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Needs more explanation of how much merchandise costs. Overall a good game, mostly like sim city . Just more cartoonist. Fun.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought that this was a very well written book it was funny and at sometimes just a little sad
1401937519|5.0|What I most appreciated about this book is the author's credibility and honesty.<br />I especially liked the fact that in addition to the telling of her NDE, she spent almost<br />half of the book talking about how that experience has radically changed her thinking,<br />her understanding, her behavior, choices, and way of being. It wasn't just a phenomenal<br />event, but a lasting transformation.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book had a really slow start for me but it ended up being one of the best books I have ever read! I was so sad when it was over! Give it a chance you won't regret it
B005USZML4|3.0|I liked it ok...not my usual read.  Actually seems to be more for a younger crowd.  Maybe 20-30's...in my opinion
B003G4W49C|5.0|Person did a wonderful job on this book. It was enjoyable and easy to follow. I enjoyed the book quite thoroughly.
B0087HT36U|3.0|As an Angry Birds fan, it took a bit of patience to get used to the game, but after a few levels I found it almost as addictive and a nice change of pace. I didn't bother buying bombs. I just kept trying different combinations until I got gold crowns. The key is patience; lots of patience.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Downloaded this app for my son and he loves it!  Very easy to play on his new Kindle.  We love the angry birds games!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks romance novel but with a twist. I found it very hard to put down and would definitely recommend
0375851569|5.0|Got it for my Son. Read them all again. I love Dr. Seuss. You can not go wrong with anything related to Dr.Seuss:)
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I am an XBOX player by heart and I purchased a PS3 because all of my friends had one and when I found out they made these controllers I had to get them. Great feel, long battery life and great response. The buttons that light up are pretty cool too. Its kind of a drag that you have to use a USB receiver but that doesnt stop me from thinking that this is a 5 star product.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We got introduced to this game by our good friends and are now hooked.  A wonderful game that kids can play with the adults and enjoy.  It is really a great game that requires interaction among the players and lots of good stradgy and luck.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Simple concepts to grasp and excellent design of strength training programs to follow. Anyone who is looking to take control of how they feel and look can use this book as a invaluable tool to build and sculpt the body they've always wanted. Get this book and you will not regret it!!!
B0092MKFIY|3.0|...wish I hadn't.  Pretty sophomoric stuff.  Lyrics are really child-like.  Are they trying to be a Christian rock band?  Maybe a boy band singing about love and angst with the most dramatic phraseology they can dream up?  And the music is very Indie generic.  I gave the MP3 album a good listen - twice through in my house with no other interference and once in the car hoping it would catch on.  In the end, sounded like the stuff they play at your local Starbucks that you wish they'd turn the sound down.<br /><br />I know I'm in a minority here considering the other reviews, but I was frankly unimpressed. There's better Indie out there...
B004UC4HCG|5.0|Very easy to assemble, quiet, looks good, functions as advertises.  Would recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive home theater PC.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is a wonderful film that is beautifuly directed and produced.  The acting is increadable and the music is wonderful.  Me and wife have enjoyed this film since childhood and bought the blu-ray version to share this experince with our children.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|This set has a great selection of doors, windows, and shutters!!. The kids love having enough parts to now make a more realistic looking house and cars with side windows. They love them!  Thank you very much. They came quickly and were in good condition.
B004IM14RY|1.0|Enjoyed the acting, directing, cinematography, make-up, nearly everything was fun to watch. Since I can't give the story -5 stars, I'll rate this a 1. The plot detracted from all other aspects of the movie. I felt it was an insult to my intelligence and awareness of reality.
1595825045|5.0|Aang and his comrades are part of an animated classic. This book shows all the work and detail that went into creating The Last Airbender.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This keeps with the angry birds fun and challenging play.  We have had it for a week now and my wife and I both love it.  I found myslef thinking of a new way to pass a level or do better hours after playing it.  The simple and clean game play makes it enjoyable and fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put it down.  Great book.  Full of adventure.  Easy writing style.  I loved every word of it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|There is only one problem with this book - I finished it!! PLEASE tell me there will be more Pendergast books! These characters are now like members of my family. The plot keeps you engaged till the last page. My favorite book of all time.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I purchased this for a gift for my grandaughter for Christmas.  She was oh so happy to get it.  It's a great flick.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a great simple game that keeps you going back for more and more.  I enjoy it a lot, good graphics and simple game make it enjoyable game that I will keep around.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was a fabulous book which I so enjoyed reading!  It is written well and flows perfectly.  I especially enjoyed all the interviews with the family, and other Navy Seals and how it was seamlessly put together to present an excellent story!
B0058W74UY|4.0|a good, cheap way to enjoy video on portable Android devices. It has a basic browser to find flash files on the device and storage card and initiate playback.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I puchased this for my daughter.  She is collecting the seasons.  She's happy with it.  It is a very entertaining show.
B005HSL626|5.0|My whole family loves playing this and watching others play it.  My 5 year old can get a decent score and only have a couple of times playing it.  Lots of fun to play over and over, also has some fun &#34;fruit facts&#34;.  I enjoy the challenge of trying to beat my wifes score after she beats mine.
B00ARAO720|3.0|Movie is pretty entertaining.  Cycling scenes are  a little crazy. I take it there are bike messengers in NY. Some scences are hard to believe but this is Hollywood. I would watch it again.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I bought Shogun recently to have something to read on a cruise.  Having watched the mini-series before I was unaware just how much more the book lets you into the minds of the characters and some of the other scenes going on that wasn't (in some cases, couldn't be) included in a mini-series filmed for regular TV.  While it is a very long book, it kept me interested the whole time.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Nice story line fun easy and yet challenging worth buying nice graphics a bit spokie all and all I am glad I bought it
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|Seriously one of my favorite albums of all time. The reissue is well done and the amazing amount of bonus tracks is well worth the price. There are versions of well known songs that really take you into the experience if writing an album. You can see the songs evolve and transform. There are also many unheard demos and outtakes that are a delight to Pumpkins fans.<br /><br />The deluxe box set is a must for diehard fans and is beautifully packaged in a wonderful collectors box. The artwork is killer! The song by song description by Corgan is cryptic and entertaining, much like Corgan himself. The DVD is a great example of what a well rounded band the Pumpkins were. The Pumpkins were the biggest band of that time and you see why they sold out almost all if that very long tour. Do yourself a favor and snatch this up!!
B003YTLKTE|4.0|Quality of picture was not always top notch, but that is just a byproduct of the style of the movie and equipment used to shoot it.
B000M4RG42|5.0|There's not much to say, but I love seeing the filmset of Flags of our Fathers, and Letters from Iwo Jima. It's great to see both sides to the story, and it's even better to see them in such a film collection!
B00AHSINKO|3.0|I had heard many positive reviews of this movie before actually seeing it myself. I was a bit disappointed in the content. Meryl Streep did a great job in acting. I felt the topic could have been presented in a deeper, richer way. Less emphasis on the actual sex act and more on emotional intimacy, which was the real issue.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|The story only becomes more poignant as time goes on. God bless us everyone. May we always remember those less fortunate.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I've only played it once. It was entertaining, but it did seem to be kind of easy. I'm used to more of a challenge with Mahjong.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I love Pink Floyd. I love Movies. My love for this, however, exceeds the speed of light. The way the lyrics are in tune with the film sequences feel surreal, and I could not love them more. Yes, yes, yes!
B007SSEU9O|3.0|I had looked forward to seeing this movie. But if not for Meryl Streep, it would have been a complete dud. Very slow moving and none of the pizzazz as promised in the previews. Glad I saw it but would not want to see it again.
B000WZOMRA|5.0|Danny Kaye is a fabulous actor.  Anyone who loves comedy, loves Kaye. Virginia Mayo was good also. Boris Karloff always plays a good bad guy.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I bought it for one song, but I liked almost every song on the album. It was worth every penny.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I love the Transformers series. Part 2 was not a five star in my book, but part one and three definitely exceed my expectations. Perfect balance of childhood, women, cars, and badassery.
140053271X|5.0|Great device. Bought it for my niece. She loves it. Easy to use. Downloaded books. It is keeping her busy.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Very cumbersome.  Do not like all of the buttons.  Please bring back the good old Google. Otherwise love my new Kindle Fire.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This movie's got lots of action and good special effects. Some pretty good fight scenes too. But, I got kinda lost as far as the story line goes. I'm really not sure what the plot of film is. I was expecting this to basically be a remake of the original 80's movie but it's not. Maybe my expectations kept me from enjoying it more? It's just &#34;OK&#34;.
B00005JPKE|5.0|There's not much to say, but I love seeing the filmset of Flags of our Fathers, and Letters from Iwo Jima. It's great to see both sides to the story, and it's even better to see them in such a film collection!
0439023521|5.0|This book totally sucked me in, and I had to run out and read the other two.  The movie was OK, but I think the book was much better.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This was a great book!!! Now I'm going to read pretty!! This series should be a movie that would be cool!
B00005U2JL|5.0|It arrived earlier than estimated time of arrival. It looks exactly as what's in the picture and qualiy is great!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Any film involving California just drive me into loving them. The action is fairly balanced, the storyline is thick as blood, and it feels like watching X-Men: First Class. I love films that start from the beginning. of what you did not know.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|While the series is engaging, well-written and acted, there is one ongoing issue that was very dissapointing.<br /><br />In several episodes, the Lord's name is taken in vain, something which many Christians consider very offensive. Is it not possible for script writers to be more sensitive? Would the series be any less meaningful, entertaining, or hard hitting without GD and JC in the script?
B007FJFDXS|4.0|It is fun but very complicated  but I hope  you like it.<br /><br />fun but complicated but I hope you like it.
B008H6GHL0|5.0|It arrived earlier than estimated time of arrival. It looks exactly as what's in the picture and qualiy is great!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Purchased this case for my 9 yr old daughter.  She loves the color, and I love that it protects her kindle!  Only down side is the way the stand works. You fold it back and rest it in a small crease in the back of the case. It is not very sturdy for a kid. The crease should be deeper or have a latch of some sort. Otherwise, great!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've always carried camera bags but received this with a new camera purchase. I was completely amazed at both the quality of the product and by how much I prefer the backpack to the bag I had been using. I highly recommend this product.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I purchased this for my friend for Christmas so now she has all of the movies and can have a Harry Potter marathon! She loved it!
B0044KU7KU|5.0|It arrived earlier than estimated time of arrival. It looks exactly as what's in the picture and qualiy is great!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I received this CD as a Christmas gift from my wife. I am extremely pleased with this CD. It doesn't disappoint. They still know how to rock. KISS ROCKS.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Great game for all ages. You really can not go wrong with this Gem of a game. Makes much more sense to be played on the go then when this great game was on the Sega Dreamcast years ago. Must get game so what are you waiting for, get it asap.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really like it, it is protective and flexible.  The only thing I also got 2 for my grandchildren and it not fit the new fire HD.
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|It arrived earlier than estimated time of arrival. It looks exactly as what's in the picture and qualiy is great!
0307594165|5.0|One of the easiest books by Toni Morrison that I have read. Not so many &#34;flash backs&#34;.<br />Current trials and tribulations of our War Veterans and very well written with empathy for the protagonist.<br />Brief and to the point.
B008469DGY|5.0|Really fun, especially when you learn that you can control the trajectory of the shot, even in ways that defy physics.  Really addictive and fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very Very Good - I  highly recommend it !!<br />East Download, User Friendly, Great Graphics.<br />It's such a fun game and easy to play
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought this charger to keep at work (secondary location).  It's got a long cord, and charges as well as the cord that came with my Kindle Fire.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The background color (light blue) is very pleasing to the eye/s.<br />In addition the calculator moves so swiftly and evenly.<br />Perfect large numbers on the screen.<br />Excellent!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love every song on this CD. Fun's songs just make me feel good! I can listen to them any time and they put me in a better mood. There is not one song on this CD that I don't like!
B009HEP41A|5.0|Original, imaginative and beautifully perormed. Dario Marianelli is a genius. It's up there with his award-winning score &#34;Atonement&#34;.  I predict that Dario will become in demand as much as Alexandre Desplat.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book is okay, but the start is much slower than the first book. I find myself picking it up less often than the first.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|A fun/feel good movie!  I enjoyed it a lot!  Also the quality of the movie was great!  Thanks so much!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Great authoress of all times. Enjoyable story very well narrated. Characters excellently described. The book vividly takes you back to another era!
B00914JWSW|3.0|As an avid fan, I was so looking forward to this new CD from Streisand. While the selections may have been unreleased until now, some are exceptional (i.e., &#34;Didn't We&#34;, &#34;With One More Look At You&#34;, &#34;Home&#34;), some are not  (i.e., &#34;Willow Weep For Me&#34;, &#34;Try To Win A Friend&#34;, &#34;Lost in Wonderland&#34;). It may be a nostalgic, forgotten collection, but, unfortunately,  I think Barbra should have left a few of these in &#34;The Vault&#34;.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|This soundtrack is, yes, a Hollywood version of a beloved musical. Over all I give it 4 stars. It is missing some staple songs, but remember it is a \\"highlights\\" cd. Hugh Jackman is good.( He seems to be trying to hard to sound wraspy at times though). I do like this cd's version of \\" At The End Of The Day\\". Anne Hathaway singing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is very well done for the contects it's in.<br /> My only real complaints are that someone ELSE should have sung Crowes songs. The man's singing voice is horrible!! When listing to this cd in a group that was the main complaint. \\" Master of The House\\" is a mockery of the song.<br />The new song \\"Suddenly\\" is intresting.<br />Hope they come out with a cd containg all the songs from the movie.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The story wrapped up good and tight with the previous releases. The audio quality will have your system working overtime. The video quality is pure reference.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|It was a good book but a little slower than  I prefer. It took a little too long to develop.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|It was funny, but it got old really quick.  There was no chemistry between  walberg and kunis.  Ted  is obscene and vulgar and while funny, it was just too much of the same throughout the film.  It was like watching  Family Guy.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Got this cheap (2.99) after Imagine Dragons was recommended by a friend.  Overall great album, a lot of really, really good songs on it.  My favorites are Radioactive, It's Time, and On Top of the World
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great read for anyone who takes pride in true American heroes who serve our wonderful country.<br />Rvermill@pldi
B009XY97VC|5.0|Two steps from Hell hasn't disappointed me so far and I don't think it ever will.<br />I love all the songs in SkyWorld, I'd recommend it.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I am a huge fan of Seth Macfarlane, this movie is so funny. I think one of the things that made it work so well was Mark Wahlberg. He just doesn't look like a guy who would have a Teddy Bear until he is 35, so funny number one. Then of course everything else. I loved this movie, it is a complete guy movie. My wife didn't appreciate it as much as me but she did chuckle now and again.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great story, keeps you reading. Not sure how valid the plot really is, but it really doesn't matter. Not too detailed on the bad parts, which is good.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Having watched this movie previously I gave it as a gift to a family member who enjoys this type of movie. She really enjoyed the film, amazon had a good price and fast shipping w/prime.
B005HSL626|4.0|It is fun to play and it keeps the kids occupied when we have a long wait to some where.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I really liked this movie. I wasn't sure I would like it, mainly rented it for my wife but found that I really enjoyed it too. I would definitely recommend this move, you definitely will enjoy it.
B000S88JTS|5.0|anyone that rides, needs to watch this movie, greatest motorcycle movie ever mane. great familt flick, load up on the popcorn......
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This is by far the most exciting of the Bourne series!  I can't wait for the next one.  I loved Jeremy Renner in this role, plus he is so good looking!
0525953728|5.0|I am in the process of reading this book now: I like it;seems to be a very good read! Glad I bought it
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The most appealing aspect of this book is that it is written as a series of personal interviews across many countries, with each interviewee giving his/her unique synopsis of the zombie war. The result of this patchwork approach is a very unique tapestry that together gives the reader a global account of what this war meant to humanity. I don't think there is a better way to truly capture what the worldwide impact of this event really meant for the planet. For this reason, I rate the book highly.<br /><br />To be fair, however, I'd really only rate the story itself as 3 stars since, in using this unique delivery, the author surrenders any deep character development or plot/climax as one would expect in an apocalyptic genre book. Therefore, the reader never really becomes immersed in any one character and feels rather detached from any tragedy depicted in any of the interviews, making the reading feel a bit more academic as opposed to emotional.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a gripping page-turner, I'd look elsewhere. However, if you want an extremely thoughtful and unique approach to a fun genre (and dare I say realistic?), this would be worth your time.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|What a great story.  I love the way it is written and I love the characters plus it was interesting to learn about another county, India.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game. Very entertaining-good graphics-<br />engaging levels of playtime for the hidden object enthusiast. I would recommend this game to anyone. Good storyline also.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book did something not many books can do. This book immersed me in the story, presented multiple veiwpoints, and made me actually care about a character. Best Sci-fi book I've ever read and probably will ever read.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|As a person very much into exercise (5-6x per week), I needed something to go to while on road trips working out in the hotel. I already have my &#34;own&#34; core workout, so I was a bit skeptical of what 10 minutes here would yield. However, I'm pleased to say that after my first workout, I found my abs and obliques to be rather sore the next day. So obviously this routine is introducing something that I have lacked on my own. For that reason, I am using this app even when working out at home or the gym. It is well worth the small investment as long as you commit to doing each exercise in the manner and time perscribed.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|It was fun watching, I'm a Tinker Bell fan, watched it with the family and they as well loved it
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This is such a creative television show! Everyone in the family can watch it and re-watch it! Everytime you watch it again you see something new! All of your fairy tale characters have come to life in such a wonderful and interesting way! Great job!
B006LSZECO|2.0|First off, I dont EVER write reviews.  I read them all the time.  Religiously.  For restaurants, online clothes shopping, movies, books, etc.  I could not get to amazon.com fast enough to write about how disappointing this book was.  I was looking forward to reading this book on an international flight back from the U.K.  I loved Sharp Object, and this book started out equally as exciting.  It actually stayed equally as exciting until about 3/4 of the way through the book.  I could not put the book down...even after landing.  And then we reach the terrible climax...and it just goes rapidly and infuriatingly downhill from there. Gillian Flynn completely lost me as an avid follower after I finished this book.  I have no idea how it is getting so much hype.  You get a couple dumb celebs raving about it, and suddenly it's a \\"Best of 2012\\"? Come on Amazon...was 2012 really THAT bad for new releases?
B001R3YRG2|5.0|I have seen this many times and never get tired of it. I like it more each time, many for the &#34; Dirty Harry&#34; aspect.
