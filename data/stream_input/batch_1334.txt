B004EBT5CU|5.0|I JUST GOT SAY ABOUT THE ALBUM I REALLY LOVE ALL THE SONG ON THE ALBUM THEY ARE REALLY HOT AS HELL HER VOICE IS ON FIRE
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Freezes all the time on ICS! Please fix! Using Transformer Prime. . . . . . .  . . . . . . .
1612130283|5.0|*NOTE: this review pertains to the entire Fifty Shades Trilogy*  This is a smart and funny fantasy love story set against a backdrop of inventive, frequent, and all-around really great sex. But ultimately, this story focuses on the healing and personal growth that develops within a setting of intimacy, trust, danger, and suspense. The hero and heroine aren't perfect, but they're likeable, and they really like each other.  What a wonderful debut for E L James! I hope to read much more from this author in the future.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Loved it.  It was really well done.  Better than all the others. Well acted and directed.  Cesar, amazingly performed.  Kept the excitement from beginning to end.
0143119680|5.0|Though I personally felt that it started off a little slow for my taste, once I was 20 pages in there was NO turning back. It grabbed me and held on. Such a wonderful story, even if it did end sooner than I wanted. Cannot wait for the next one!
B0061JPYX2|5.0|I see a fair number of bad reviews for this album in the print media and although there are some fair points made, I really love this album and am listening to it over and over. It's true that there's less of a cohesiveness or point of view, maybe not production values to the level of Back to Black. There are alternate versions of a few previous recordings. The vocals aren't always perfect. But the best of Amy is there. It's jazzy, bluesy, smokey, soulful, and she sings the lyrics like she means them better than almost any other artist I can think of. Listening to \\"A Song for You\\" at the close of the CD tears me up... I prefer the tone of this and Frank to Back to Black myself. If you're the same, then don't let the bad reviews deter you from giving this one a listen.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Sofia Vergara, what can one say about this lovely, voluptuous, and talented woman who seems completely unimpressed with her looks, body, and comedic innocence.  The straight guy, Eric Stonestreet, acting as gay man, is the best since Robin Williams in La Cage. He has nailed this role.  We in this household have watched every episode at least 3 times, and some we will likely watch every time we need a laugh.  We brought them on holiday to fill in our evenings when staying in was preferable than going out.  We stayed in more just to re-watch seasons 1 and 2. Visitors who came for a week who do not watch television and do not allow there 14 and 16 yr old to do so, were persuaded to join us one evening and by the end of the Pilot, were totally hooked and every evening but two they insisted on watching at least 3 episodes each evening for a week.  One hopes that the writers, actors, and editors continue for many seasons to literally make the world a more tolerant place to live in.  There is absolutely no downside to this  series. It is that good.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|So happy with my purchase. I am huge comic book (and movie) fan. So I wanted all the \\"Avenger's\\" movies on Blu-ray to prepare for the upcoming movie release. Some of the movies you kind find in stores but this one however you could not. Thanks to Amazon.com I have the whole set... almost. I should receive Captain America in a few days (also purchased on Amazon.com) at a discount price compared to that in stores. I am completely satisfied with my purchase.

B000QGEB12|1.0|I enjoy all types of movies, especially comedy and horror and I have a lot of movies that I enjoy enough to watch again and again.  Kung Fu Hustle was so awful I couldn't even get thru one viewing. After about 30 minutes of no entertainment at all I turned it off.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this app...however, there's no way to exit out that I can find.  The only way out is to hit the &quot;home&quot; key, but when I go back in, it takes me right back to where I was.  They should add an &quot;exit&quot; button.  kindle fire
B0052REUW0|3.0|While it is a very good work, the author has a bias against religion in general.  His assessment that religion has done nothing to limit violence is misinformed. While we can all point to abuses by religions, it is the commandment \\"Thall shall not kill\\" that is the basis for the morality that the writer refers to.  In Matthew Whites book \\"The Great Big Book of Horrible Things\\", he mentions examples of where religion has played a part in limiting atrocities.  However Pinker does admit that secular humanism has not been any better.  White in his book lists the atrocities associated with communism as number 2 in the list.
B005HSL626|5.0|in this game its just like the picture my cousin has this app for her iphone4 but she has the demo if your looking on for my opinion get the app!!!!! :) :&quot;) :')
B0066W1AZK|4.0|chess free is a great simple chess game perfect for advanced or beginners. two players is a great feature and single player difficultly has a good amount of settings
B0054JZC6E|4.0|to many adds but they have fun games but they take forever to get them all but some games are boring
B0050SYS5A|2.0|This seemed like a great product for us. We don't have much room to play the kinect and figured this would help with the space issue. The product does zoom in an make it so you can play closer to the tv. However the accuracy is diminished and trying to calibrate the kinect afterwards is a hassle. Ours kept adjusting too high and the ceiling fan would be in the picture instead of our feet. When we moved the kinect down to the tv stand it said that it was 2 low. We had to stack books and set it on top. Even after all that hassle the accuracy was messed up and we were scoring really low on dance central 2. Took the zoom off and it fixed the problem. All in all not worth the money spent because it now sits on the shelf every time I want to play dance central 2.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it.  Awesome game to make the time pass.  Disappointed that it makes you start all over after the update, but I like the games enough that I didn't mind too much.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This is spiritually moving movie.  I think every father should be required to see this movie.  I was deeply moved and touched by this movie.
B00076RT24|4.0|I was missing one movie in my Star Wards collection:  Star Wars IV. It is my least favorite in the series. Jar Jar Binks was so irritating. However, it is the start of one of the most amazing space operas created. The computerization of the planets is magnificent. For the first time I was able to watch all six movies one after the other. Get the entire collection!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really good I love it playtime. 24&#8542;&#8542;&empty;&#8319; lil really need (to get now no joke unless you suck at minigames
B004UID2LC|3.0|Using this app on a kindle fire, and it's great when it works. It's nice to be able to download videos to have on the device to watch when I'm not around a wifi connection. I've noticed that after a few videos are on here though, the app freezes and crashes quite a bit.
055358202X|4.0|The story itself is as interesting and unique as Martin's previous three novels.  However, he does take a new approach to the story from a narrative point of view.  Most notably: this novel only follows the story of characters involved with the story evolving in the southern portion of Westeros (the other half of the story, e.g. - the North and across the Narrow Sea, are dedicated to the next book, A Dance with Dragons).  Furthermore, chapters are no longer strictly titled by the name of the character they will be following; they are now often headed with a brief description of the character's chapter you're about to read, especially if you're being introduced to a new character.<br /><br />I find both the changes to be interesting, positive things, except if your favorite character happens not to be in the part of the world the book is focusing on. (There is not a single chapter about Daenerys in this book, though she is often mentioned in other characters chapters.) To put a positive spin on this, if your favorite character is lacking in this book, you will get to read about them in excess in the next.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it has many fun games and I love how you get a bonus after you beat a section of games
B005J6LKVI|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.  This takes you back in time and shows you a glimpse of what life used to be.  This is also one of the most hilarious, sincere, moving movies I have ever watched.  I love it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Works well, love all the different translations.  Does not seem to slow down my Kindle Fire at all even though it runs in the background.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Used to be great time waster on my Transformer prime, but since ICS, the game freezes and doesn't run. please update the game!
B0007OASII|5.0|If you enjoyed Epica, you'll certainly love Black Halo. I've listened to this album (and Epica) hundreds of times through.
0307946711|4.0|Story about two souls, one smart, witty yet lack of confidence, one charming yet drowned in alcoholism; slowly develop in a genuine, believable story about friendship, partnership and love. Fumbling and muddling through, small moment and action could change the whole course of your life, and the one you truly love.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is amazing. It worked like magic. Simple steps to follow and you can hook up your Pc to your Android device.
1932735410|5.0|Ideal to get ready for the PMP exam.......I can recommend this book to all students preparing for the exam. Hepled me a lot...
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I love periode pieces. A wonderful interpretation of Jane Austen by talented actors. Romantic and funny. Well done. Colin firth is brilliant and jennifer ehle as well as julia sawalha :) i love the dresses. If you love periode pieces this is a must have.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This trilogy is unlike anything I've read before, but I'm so glad I read it. I've been captivated by it for two weeks, which is how little it took me to read the series. I read books two and three in a span of 5 days. The trilogy was hard to get into since the first 6 or 8 chapters of book one are history and background. Don't get discouraged, it gets so much better! It's a suspenseful crime thriller that keeps you engaged and guessing. I could barely put it down. The trilogy is really dark in some areas, particularly in the middle of book one. Book two was my favorite and picks up a year after book one ends. Book three picks up right where book two suspensefully ends. Book three drug on in the beginning, but eventually picked back up. This is a must read, even if it's not what you are used to reading. Highly, highly recommend!
B0068TL23G|5.0|very good if you like puzzle games. its very simple and low tech, also has a lot of levels. works great on the fire.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Very nice cover for the Kindle.  I like that there is a stretch band to keep the top cover in place one you close it, less chance of scratching the screen.
034552554X|5.0|A great read, a lovely story!  Strong supportive female characters.  This is one of the best books, maybe the best, I've read this year. This is a story of loss, redemption, coming of age, and the power of love.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|Loved this book.  Typical John Grisham yarn, full of legal drama, but the characters are just great, full of charm, a bit off the wall and not the usual lawyer conservatives.  I did feel the story didn't close some of the ends, but I still rate this book well - it was an enjoyable read, almost a bit of a giggle, while still retaining the good plot and legal intrigue.  Well worth five stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game for free. many hours of fun. if you like solving puzzles this game is perfect for you. enjoy
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|very useful. use it regularly. just added skitch to draw notes and am excited about that. wish the kindle.fire had a camera
0439023491|5.0|Best series of books I have EVER read!!! This author paints such vivid imagery that it's impossible NOT to be enveloped in this whole new terrifying world. A MUST MUST READ!
B000001ELF|4.0|No, I will not compare the great Ace Frehley with the guitarist icon, Eric Clapton, even though I think that both would sound great together onstage.  Out of the 1978 solo releases among the four Kiss megastars, namely Peter Criss, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, and Ace Frehley, it is the last mentioned among the quartet that produced a U.S. Top 40 hit in \\"New York Groove\\", which peaked at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100. Not surprisingly, among many polls taken that inquired who was the most popular Kiss member, Ace would often, with little surprise, \\"ace out\\".  As an effort that was created over thirty years ago, Ace Frehley, the album, sounds fresh today, even in the digitized format. The guitar work is top-notch, and the focus to maintain great instrumentation so as to hone in on the drive to maintain the energy level to keep the listener tuned in, along with decisions to abandon any added production that might leave this work sounding dated in retrospect all contribute to forming the type of studio album that arguably sounds better than any release that Kiss, as a group, has issued to date.  On average, Ace Frehley, upon initial response, did not receive quite the billing of the group's Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over, or Love Gun, but it can be argued that upon reflection and another listen, the modern-day reviewer will agree that it has aged quite well into the year 2012 and beyond. Hey, even \\"New York Groove\\" is played on MSNBC's \\"Morning Joe\\" from time-to-time.  From the start, the electric guitar work is a nice continuation of the \\"Shock Me\\" highlights from Kiss' Alive II Tour and concludes with a reminder that Mr. Frehley was not so bad himself with the acoustic guitar with the closing number, \\"Fractured Mirror\\".
B006VRZ6KA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.... It seemed like they tried to reach for more comedy with Anna<br />Faris prat falls but very enjoyable!!!
B005OOSPZO|5.0|The Blu Ray copy on the Pearl Harbor Attack and the back groung leading to the attack is the Trade Mark of this movie. This Disc is very good!!! Both audio and Video are a Master Piece of Art showing the life like events of that day!! A TRESURE!!!
0525478817|5.0|Absolutely fabulous. THis book will capture you, entertain you, and break your heart before you know it. This book is John Green at his best, with each sentence beautifully crafted. Opening this book is like opening a door to another reality with people so real you feel as though you could touch them. A shocking portrayal of the effects of cancer as told from the eyes of a dying teenage girl. Although a morbid topic, you'll be too caught up in your love for the characters that you wont notice your heart break.  An instant classic to be read many more times than one, and shared as much as possible. This book's quality makes it instantly clear that green spent years crafting it. It's a #1 New York Times Bestseller for a reason: people love it. I picked it up and didnt put it down until i read it all, then I read it again.  This book will be enjoyed for many, many, MANY years to come and this work only leaves me more excited for his next book. BUY THIS BOOK.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome I am addicted because well I cant stop playing. I stay up late at night just to play this game
0062082353|5.0|It's pretty simple - SEALs are BAD TO THE BONE!!<br /><br />Thank you for your sacrifice that you made for this country..<br /><br />American Sniper is a great book with a lot of detail of all the weapons he used while in Iraq.<br /><br />Lets thank ALL of our military for without them, we would not have life as easy as we do here in the states.
B00158K1DM|3.0|Movie had large black bands top & bottom for wide screens.  This cut off quite a bit of the movie.  Our controller would change it to theatre version which created smaller black bands to see more of the movie, however, it kept resorting back to the widescreen with the large top and bottom black bands.  VERY FRUSTRATING.  If there were a full screen version, we would buy it!
B006H3MIV8|2.0|I hate to give a bad review to an album for a worthy cause, but Dylan fans need to be warned about this collection of tepid and listless covers of great songs. I wondered if these artists spent any time undertanding the songs they covered.  Most just sucked the life out of the songs.  This was ture even of talented singers like Jackson Browne and Sting. There are a few gems, however, most notably Mark Knoffler's excellent \\"Restless Farewell\\", Angelique Kidjo's \\"Lay Lady Lay\\", Johnny Cash's \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" and The Belle Brigade's \\"No Time to Think\\". The greatest pop songwriter deserves better than this, and, Amnesty, next time consult with Roger McGuin, Joan Baez, Robbie Robertson, Nancy Sinatra, Ricky Nelson, and -- of course -- the ghost of Jimi Hendrix to see how Dylan should be covered.
0805092447|5.0|After seeing this book portrayed in a puppet show by Mermaid Theater of Nova Scotia, my son fell in love with this story. He has other books by the author in the original format, but I decided to get Brown Bear in early reader and am I glad I did!!! He grabbed it from me mid-way through the first reading and finished himself. He is now on the 5th time around in just a 1/2 hour!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really great for price. really difficult at times but will keep you busy for quiet some time. I give it four stars.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Let's get this out of the way: There is a one-minute summary of the Gospel, plus some references to Christ. And fatherhood principles based on the Bible.<br /><br />That aside, I was surprised at how well done this movie is. The acting is  great - not a false note to be found (unlike the multi-million dollar Watchmen, for example, where many lines were flubbed). The story is compelling, nowhere as pollyannish as you might expect. It deals with issues families and our society are confronted with: daughters wanting to date, need for fatherhood, taking responsibility, failure, faith and disappointment, suffering, unanswered and answered prayer, the effects of hypocrisy, gangs, family tragedy, being tested, making hard choices.<br /><br /> There is a subtle commentary on the misogynistic nature of abortion, but it is so quick you may miss it. Abortion has made it so easy for a man to say \\"take care of it\\", yet feminists think it gives them power. It's sad.<br /><br />The action is well shot. And there are some very, very funny moments, especially the scenes involving the dreaded Snake King. That character is a real hoot!<br /><br />(There will be angst about the Christian core of the movie. It's only because our society is so Christianized already that we don't realize how different our ideas of the ideal family would be if our culture hadn't been radically transformed by Christ's ideals. For example, the Roman paterfamilias is not the pattern you want your fathers to be following. Christianity reformed the old, oppressive traditions where girls were married off at twelve to much older men, for example, and imposed the standard of fidelity upon men as well, raising the dignity of women and making marriage something more elevated. I recommend [[ASIN:1595553223 The Book that Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization]] to correct our ingrained ignorance about the debt we owe to this faith.)
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This case by Marware was inexpensive and works perfect. Lightweight and helps protect my Kindle. I would recommend this product!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very easy to use.  great tools to help in study and daily reading.  hundreds of dollars of tools at hand for free
B006UAWH2S|5.0|I saw this movie two days ago and I can't stop thinking about some of its messages and images.  The leads Green and MacGregor are excellently cast for their roles.  The leads are very attractive people but do well in conveying that they are just two \\"ordinary\\" people going through an extraordinary event.  The movie has two levels...the lead characters' experiences with the changing world (and each other) and the effects of a plague on the world at large.  I don't want to give away the plot but what was most moving to me was seeing how some people reacted to the plague w/violence and destruction and others helped their fellow man and found beauty in what remained.  Let me know what you think after you see it.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|While I only have used it since yesterday, this is doing everything I had hoped. I have the iPhone 4S and it will mirror everthing I have tried (Netflix, Angry Birds, FIFA 12, Safari, WatchESPN). The screen moves instantaneously with the phone. I have heard that if you have iPhone 4 it won't \\"mirror\\" and will only work with certain apps but with my iPhone 4S it works great. I would highly recommend buying this if you travel at all, you can watch Netflix in the hotel (provided they have HDMI). The Brilliant part about this particular cord is you can still charge your device while using it. Some of the other cords I have seen out there do not allow this. A little expensive but I'll be saving money on pay-per-views and able to watch these things all over.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It was extroidinary to the MAX fun! I have no troubles for this app and its so addicting!! I recommend this for everyone who has a moblie device. GET THIS APP!!
B006QPVH6O|1.0|Rarely do I regret spending money on a movie, even if I don't like it.  This one? I feel as if I was cheated. Horrible. Buyer beware.
B005K17RU0|5.0|nice app pretty accurate also.  I love the details and the option to add other cities.  The warnings are also very helpful.
B005HSL626|3.0|this app at first looks interesting but gets old too fast, not buying the full version but this app has great graphics!
1451648537|5.0|This book is amazing, one of the best stories I've ever read. It gives the most detailed experience of how Apple was founded, brought down, and then brought back up by one of the greatest visionaries of our lifetime, Steve Jobs. He changed the world in several different ways, and this book gives insight on why he did what he did professionally and personally. I recommend this book for anyone, especially those into Apple products, technology itself, or to find a way to start a successful business. It's a great read page to page.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I thought it was fun,but there were freezes every now and then during a level. I would call it fun and entertaining but I recommend the origanal Angry Birds.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Thsi ia a very nice quality Kindle cover...makes it feel like you are holding a book, which I like.  I woudl buy this again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great. have the same game on the ipod, so when i got my new tablet, had to search and get the same app again.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|ok .. not the greatest.  but enough to keep you occupied .. would recommend for someone bored.  would not pay for it though.
B0000BWTK3|5.0|Leif Ove Andsnes rarely puts a foot wrong, and this recording proves the point.  He might be considered to be a \\"natural\\" for his fellow Norwegian, Grieg, and he certainly is, but he is also splendid in his recording of Schumann's magnificent concerto.  The Grieg's fiendish last movement is superbly executed, and his musicality is everywhere evident in both concerti.  This is terrific stuff, and Andsnes brings new life to a favorite pair of \\"war horses.\\"  Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a good game for taking up time when you do not have any thing better to do. get it
B003M6ENDO|4.0|I was looking for a storyline to watch while working out on my treadmill. I finally hooked on to 24 and started with season 8. The best thing I can say about this show is that it is very intense. The action is fast paced and it is a real soap opera in that it always keeps you coming back for the next episode. The writing is a little weak and some of the lines on the show are so bad its almost a comedy. For one thing, I don't think it was ever meant to be watched back to back to back. When you watch several shows in a row, the idea that the main character can get shot, stabbed, beaten up, stabbed and still be alive seems very unbelievable. The production values are so so and you have to laugh to think a field agent can call up a president on the cell phone and talk to them. You really have to let reality slip away when you watch this show and just take the story with a gain of salt.  That all said, it is a great show to watch if you are doing something like working out. It keeps your mind occupied which allows you to exercise without the thoughts of what your body is doing. There are slight breaks between segments and you can advance the show to the 2 minute mark when watching a new episode as it is a rerun of the first show.  I watch this on Amazon prime so I am just a viewer. I don't think I would buy this, but it is fun to watch and probably would make a good spoof movie to poke fun at all the really dumb CIA type junk that they make up to aid the story line!
B0007TKNII|5.0|Hands down best Broadway musical and movie I have ever seen! The Phantom is mysterious yet loving towards Christine and their passion for each other is remarkable! I became so obsessed with this movie that I even bought the Broadway version from the Royal Albert Hall!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|If you love carnival games, 101-in-1 Games is for you! The games are addicting and graphics are good. Play away!
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love this cover!  I read other reviews about the verso prologue Cover, and they raved about it.  I think it is great.  It holds the kindle tightly in the elastic bands.  It looks like a book, an old book.  Really neat!!!  Ididn,t want a cover with a stand so it is perfect!
B006MW3VGA|5.0|As I watched tne entire first season in one sitting, I could not imagine waiting to see the second, so I've purchased it in its entireity from Amazon, in advance. I have since learned it is FREE on Masterpiece Theatre site, but I don't regret purchasing it.<br /><br />The second series begins with a couple of our favorites in some very realistic war scenes, year 1916. Once again, the casting and acting is superb, the settings flawless, and the drama compelling. I look forward to continuing on in Season Two today, as this series is like a book one just simply cannot put down. Never a fan of English miniseries, I have finally found one that appeals to me. Utterly superb !
B0061TQBRK|3.0|This is an album that is okay.  Some of the songs are excellent (Trip the Darkness, Upsidedown, and another song that I heard but don't know the title of because I have it on random) and there is quite a few of mediocre songs.  I actually didn't like it that much better than Shallow Life even though it is better.  Even in Shallow Life there was some good songs.  I was an okay album which is why I'm disappointed from the many great albums that Lacuna Coil has produced in the past.  My favorite is actually their very first one, then Comalies and then Karmacode.  Lots of effort was put into these albums as well as the other albums except for the last two.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am using it on my Kindle Fire, and it works fabulous. It is more accurate than television. The different views are great as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is awesome there is nothing wrong with it or anything. the only thing is is that u have to unlock games but that's what's fun!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app...best pocket bible ever!  always there when I need it.  got it for droid phone and kindle fire. gotta have this one!
B003R0MF5I|4.0|The story continues where Season three has ended and Chuck is getting more and more comfortable into his role as \\"The Spy\\".  This year, the story ventures into him seeking his mother.  The show is still good but however I do have to coment on the quality of the discs.  They are not as good as sets that I have purchased previously.  Scenes are been forward to the next chapter as they are faulty and is hanging on my screen.  I am upset that they are brand new and yet faulty.  It affect the eposides on the disc and I have to rewind to watch it and they will jump again at the faulty scences.
B004EPZ02A|5.0|Years ago I watched some stupid horror flick and told myself, ok finally no more of this. I am too old for this rubbish. They were all boring, not scary, just a total waste of time. I only got this because the trailer looked freaky and it received a decent rating on rottentomatoes. I must say: quite darn unsettling. And for, that, for a horror movie to actually get my heart rate up and feeling quite uncomfortable as I watch it I give it a 5.  I've never seen any of the other paranormal activities, for what it's worth.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|I really enjoy this app, when it works. The concept of periodically updating with new content is really cool but the Chinese New Year update really cause gigantic lag. I had to shut my fire down to reset because I couldn't even get the app menu up to force close. I have hit some lag on the original Angry Birds but nothing like this.
B005D4Y522|5.0|Avec Christian Thielemann, c'est le romantisme... même avec Beethoven.  Donc des tempos qui rappelent Furtvangler et klemperer.  Ici, on est loin des interpr&eacute;tations baroques.  Avec l'orchestre de Vienne, on est en pr&eacute;sence de la meilleure orchestre au monde et ça se sent.  Assur&eacute;ment, l'un des plus beaux enregistrements des 9 symphonies de Beethoven de tous les temps !
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I was expecting the games to be easier... I thought by the description that after you reach a certain point amount then all the rest of the games would be available but no you have to buy each game with the points you earn.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like being able to pick the type deal.. the game would be perfect of I could fill blanks with any card but that's just me whining.  Great fun..
B001I45UFC|2.0|This had more charm than I remember from 4th grade, but I still take issue with a few plot points. \\"Ha ha, I win because of deep magic that no one had heard of until I mentioned it just now!\\" \\"Oh, yeah, well, ha ha, I win because of even deeper magic that no one had heard of until I mentioned it just now!\\" It's almost like Aslan and the White Witch are playing Calvinball. I realize Lewis needed these kinds of plot devices to make the allegory work, but would it have killed Lewis to throw in a little foreshadowing? He foreshadowed other things. It was within his power.  The saddest thing about this for me is that there's a nice little adventure story buried under the deus ex machina plot mechanisms. At least there could have been. Perhaps a different author would have sent the characters to find their accoutrement (Peter's sword, Lucy's cordial, Susan's bow--which she never used, I'd like to point out). But Lewis decided to play the Santa Clause card, because... well... I have no idea. I had to keep reminding myself that this was only a children's book, and perhaps it would have been more dramatic if it had been written with an older audience in mind. The moments of narrative tension evaporate quickly. Most of the crucial battle takes place off-screen. The only characters with any development at all are Lucy and Edmund. Peter's supposed to be the hero, but he barely has any screen time. And I realize it was written in the 50's, but is it necessary to constantly break the 4th wall?  Oh, and can I take a moment to complain about the professor? I can only assume that he's a Mary Sue for Lewis, and yet he's this jolly, one-dimensional deified beacon of anti-intellectualism. GRR!!!  Okay, I've griped. LWW is at least fun and imaginative. And while the main machinations of the plot are transparent allegories for Christianity, they're at least not oppressive. The story is allowed to breathe a little underneath them and develop its own personality. I rather liked that the book has a sense of awe and wonder about itself, and while I can criticize it for being far too brief for its scope, I can just as easily criticize J.R.R. Tolkien for the pointless ramble that is the first six chapters or so of The Fellowship of the Ring. It was a different time and new genre, nobody knew what they were doing. LWW is mercifully short, colorful, engaging, and very accessible, for all its foibles. I guess that makes Lewis the anti-Tolkien, now that I think about it.
0316743003|5.0|I loved this book. It has a great story and plenty of technical details I found interesting. It also had some short sections written by other people. The timeline of the book is not linear, so a reader might want to start with section on the U-2 spy plane and then go back and read the first section.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Once I get started I have to beat each game. I cant leave one undone. It keeps you interested. Its a great game.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game so much, I've completed every level in the game with all three stars!<br />  yours truly, Tryne.
1592401791|4.0|I think some people are a bit harsh in their reviews. Geoff isn't dissing any of The Beatles, he is just being honest about what he saw. He was there and he offers some interesting accounts. I found it enjoyable overall.
B005HSL626|5.0|everyone is saying its bad because of the ads, but so what??? I just ignore them all. you so should get this.
0316286850|5.0|I wanted to learn about makeup to be able to prepare people for video interview and also to understand makeup when using Photoshop on portraits. This book gave me a very good basic understanding of how and what to apply. However it did more - it gave me new ideas about makeup and made me more willing to try different colors and approaches. The book has a fresh and new look at the whole art of makeup and I recommend it.
B0069GRIHW|4.0|I assume that many buyers of this are going to have all purchased LA Woman in one of it's many incarnations (I have bought two) so I am just going to stick to the extras, wherein I differ from many other reviewers. I am wary of the endless re-packaging and to some extent I agree with many other reviewers. Given that The Doors stopped recording decades ago, it is safe to assume that there is little left in the vaults and we will not hear their unique sound again, and certainly nothing in the way of \\"new material\\" of the superb quality of existing material. But what this release gives us is an insight into the inception of one of the greatest albums of all time. The \\"alternate versions\\" are crisp sounding warm-ups of songs still evolving. They contain some crackling vocals, some flubs and tracks that are far from complete, but they have a rawness of a live band jamming. Sometimes they jam the blues (including the \\"new\\" track), and sometimes they jam what are familiar and classic songs. They are as close as we're going to get to a band long gone beyond previously released material and I loved them. I go to gigs all the time and all but the most polished, tired bands do it note perfect, but it is the ones who are still working through the songs and stretching them that make a lasting impact. And this for me is as close as I am ever going to get the hearing a live set of LA Woman as a work in progress. Don't expect any great revelations or new Doors, just a fine band working through fresh material of its day.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I Love it, put together well and feels good.Leather, holds the fire securely, looks like a million and will protct it very well. Excellent quality

0740797719|4.0|James Gurney paints effortlessly it seems, and his images are nothing short of stunning. It seems impossible for anyone to give the perfect detail to such small works as he does. The sheer brilliance of the examples of his work thus overshadows his teachings which are elucidating and important. Perhaps a book with simpler examples for us mortals would have been less distracting than this tour de force of painting excellence.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This has some great fun games. Some of the games are challenging and some are more relaxed.  I really enjoy playing

B005DD7MH8|5.0|The basic idea - loser comes across the ultimate smart drug and uses it to create great success... and failure. That's not a plot spoiler because it's summarized by the lead character in the first three minutes of the movie.<br /><br />It's a different twist on drug abuse that's not really discussed much. Sure, lots of college frat boys are taking ADHD drugs to try to cover up for too much partying when exams roll around. But if we can make drugs that warp our minds as much as LSD, why not make a drug that improves acuity by a similar degree? It makes you wonder if Big Pharma does have such a drug but keeps it under wraps while they feed us more Viagra.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was nicely paced. The music was great. Acting was good. It would have been nice to see more of De Niro but I guess the movie wasn't about him or his character. If you liked [[ASIN:B000JMK6LW A Scanner Darkly]] (or preferred the Phillip Dick book), you'll find this movie a fun \\"romp in the park.\\" Not nearly as deep but also much more approachable.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|good app. educational and not annoying. some are fairly difficult but most are really good. i recommended it to other parents of kids ages 3-7

B006MMVV7Q|4.0|Yep, this movie is exactly that...great for kids and incredibly silly/cute. The basic premise is that Gargamel and Azrael are ever on the hunt for Smurf's to G can extract the essence of the smurfs to fuel his wizardry. One thing leads to another and several Smurf's end up getting sucked through a portal of sorts and end up in modern day New York City, where they end up befriending Neil Patrick Harris and his pregnant wife, and begin the search for a way back to their own realm. Gargamel and Az of course follow the smurfs through the portal. Azaria plays Gargamel, and is acceptably over the top. Neil Patrick Harris is, well, pretty much the same as always. Charismatic, but pretty much the same basic personality as in all his movies, but far less a-holish than his character in 'How I Met Your Mother'. The Smurf's all all voiced by recognizable actors and pop icons, including Katy Perry (can you guess who she is?). The characters are all cute and likable, even Grouchy Smurf, lol. There's really nothing epic or enduring about this flick per se, but it really doesnt need to be all that. It simply is a modern day Smurf's tale. Your kids will most likely love it, and the adults will at worst tolerate it, and at best will enjoy it for its charm and quirkiness.<br /><br />Enjoy!

1594203059|5.0|This book, like Ferguson's previous \\"The Ascent of Money\\" is must reading these days.  But in it he asserts that Jews are intelligent \\"due to genetics as well as culture\\", which brands him a pure racist.  He claims WWII was won with \\"Russian manpower, British intelligence and American industrial output.  Not quite true. The Brits invented radar, but we developed the much more effective cavitron.  Hillary claimed \\"We invented freedom first\\", but had obviously not read Pincus'<br />\\"1588: The First Modern Revolution\\", in which James II was deposed and a bill or rights was formed for our emulation.  Europeans believed in aristocracy until about 1912.  But what makes us smart is not genes, but the BELIEF that we are smart.  Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, formers of half of our political heritage, were elitists and racists.  Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln, giving us the other half, were abolitionists and democrats.  With this year's election we should finally have agreement between \\"populists\\" and \\"elitist\\".  If reader would like to debate this, my name is Bob and my email address is rovarose (at) aol (dot) com.
0545265355|5.0|You absolutely must read this series - a new, soon-to-be 'classic' has been born. And you might as well save yourself the time and money by buying the trilogy together, all at once. I read the first book of the series in under one day, and was scrambling to get my hands on the next two ASAP. It is one of those narratives that grips you, haunts your dreams, and leaves you thinking about its events and their meanings at all hours of the day. I finished the series over six months ago, and I still find myself deep in thought about the plot, characters, and underlying meanings of 'The Hunger Games.' You absolutely will not regret this purchase - and you need to get on board before the film comes out in March (though this is by no means the only reason to complete this series). There is something for everyone in these books. While many children and young adults have admired it, the complexity of the story and its take-a-ways are definitely thought-provoking for adults. One warning - do not begin this series if you will not be able to dedicate the time to finishing the three books within a week. You will find that you will get through them much quicker than anything else you have ever read, but you will want to have the books glued to your hands, otherwise you will go crazy wondering what will happen next. So buy these now, and embark on the journey when you can relax a little and cruise through this brilliant story at your own pace (which I guarantee will be a fast one).
B004EPYZXK|2.0|Review: Apollo 18<br /><br />For tonight's movie night we watched Apollo 18. I went in with relatively low expectations since there are very few found footage movies that actually entertain me. Going all the way back to The Blair Witch I have found the technique more annoying than anything else.<br /><br />In this case it was used quite effectively as they cut from camera to camera to show footage of the crew as they encountered... strange happenings on the moon. But the fundamental problem remains which is that it's distracting from the story.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time thinking about the cleverness of how they mimicked the 70s film reel look and the graininess of this sort of footage. It also distanced me from the characters because I was always conscious I was looking at them through a camera.<br /><br />The idea was clever, the acting and script more than serviceable and at times there was a fair amount of tension. But it felt overlong. Like a 45 minute Twilight Zone episode expanded to movie length.<br /><br />I'd stream it on Netflix or rent it from RedBox but I think that's about all it's worth.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|Somber is the key word to be used when explaining the tone of this movie.  From the get go, it teases with amazing high concept science fiction, but it quickly becomes apparent that the premise of the appearance of another Earth in the sky is nothing more than an excuse to explore the duality of events of peoples lives.  Despite the tease, the story is well done, and it provokes a wide range of thought and emotion.
030788743X|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? This book was incredible. It kept me immersed the entire time and left me wanting to see what comes next. Bravo. I could picture this as a movie but don't know how it will do the book justice. Thanks Mr. Cline. I am not worthy ;)
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|There are two types of gadget cases I've used over the years: leather-thick-paddish things to protect me against my arch-nemesis, Gravity, and one that lets me fling the thing in a backpack without fear of water-bottle-condensation, pocket-knife-gouges, and so on. This is the second type, purchased in my poverty to protect my Kindle Fire from my sloppy backpack. It snaps onto the device exactly like the youtube video shows. The stretchy-band-thingie keeps the flappy front cover from flapping, the shell wipes clean with any t-shirt on my floor, and the Kindle is covered. For the price, it's an excellent value. Except for that whole fold-the-cover-under-to-prop-up-the-screen feature. That's a hit-or-miss bust.  I got all those hyphens on sale at Amazon.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|This is a good app for the person who wants to organize their thoughts and needs them handy in more than one location. I have yet to use the full potential of Evernote but am sure it will not disappoint me.
B00009PBRP|5.0|This is a great John Wayne movie.  Funny and full of fantastic animal scenes.  Movie came on time and as described.  Thank you.
B002QFYJF4|5.0|I watched it again last night, after several years, and I was sucked-in again! Watching this film is like watching a train-wreck. The acting is so good, the people so flawed but so real that becomes uncomfortable to see. Like so many others have said, this is Cruise's finest work to date. And watching/listening to Jason Robards (who had the thankless task of lying in bed throughout the entire film), as he talks about the way he cheated on his wife Lilly, I was reminded of his classic performance of Hickey's monologue from \\"The Ice Man Cometh\\" where Hickey talks about how he came to hate his Evelyn because she always forgave him for his infidelity! I think Anderson definitely had that play in mind when he wrote his screenplay.<br /><br />As an example of ensemble acting, \\"Magnolia\\" is the film to watch. The \\"frog' scene is maddening - I fear Anderson just threw that in to say \\"hey, wait to they (the audience) sees this. It's going to freak them out!). The characters don't to react to frogs falling from the sky; they don't even olibquely make reference to that extraordinary event. Someone wrote that a torrent of large hailstones would have been more appropriate, and acutally, make more sense. I agree with that (rememeber all the references to the weather in the film). Nonetheless, as frustrating as it is (and why is it called 'Magnolia'?), the film is one I will continue to go back to just for the pleasure of watching a cast of great actors at the top of their game, and to participate in some truly great film making and honest story telling. And this new blu-ray releaes does add a new dimension to the film, especially the sound (that is so important in this movie).
B000U7SN8O|5.0|The NMH struck off the masterpiece ... even on \\"the lazy days\\" of horns and fuzz guitar you will be caught up and over the river and then when the squeezed rhymes, quick acoustic and quirky sounds reveal \\"how strange it is to be anything at all\\" ... One of the best ever - this circus wheel is stellar twisted americana
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I've been using the cover for about a month and so far I am satisfied with it. It's easy to open and close and convenient for propping up while I am reading.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this app sucks it will NOT download on my tablet. looking at the reviews why bother with it. good luck
B0055SWM08|3.0|It takes a chunk of storage space, it's more like being in flow than meditating, but it's  also a nice massage for a wired mind.
B00637HXNG|5.0|I was surprised and delighted to find this disc available at a local big box store, although not yet released to all outlets.  This is what 3D is all about!  I have a 59 inch 3D TV, and a powerful surround speaker setup.  You are there!  The sound is very clear, and you feel as if you're part of the crowd.  The 3D is also very well done, with lots of depth, and very clear video.  The camera work is excellent.  And what about the band?  Well, I'm not a Scorpions nut, but I love rock music, and this is as good as it gets.  From rockers to ballads, these guys really know how to put on a show.  The twin guitar attack is ferocious, the drums thundering, and the lead singer's voice shines through it all, just as they did back in the 80's.  There are a number of shots from half way back in the audience, lots of people capturing it on their cellphones, and you really feel as if you're enjoying the concert right along with them.  Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is one of the best games available. The only bad part was the update, which erased my progress.it was very good and I recomend it to others.

B0065AR71E|5.0|I don't usually buy strategy guides for games due to the fact Gamefaqs has everything I would ever need from a guide. I am sure many of you guys feel the same way, but this guide is worth picking up due to the fact it explores so much into the game. They learned their lesson with the Fallout 3 strategy guide and included a full index, so searching the whopping 655 pages become easier. Includes an intro telling you about everything non-spoilery about Skyrim that helps new players more than the manual could.<br /><br />They cover the main mission, all side quests (Guild or otherwise), and every radiant quest. Along with that it includes over 200 pages with mini-maps and descriptions of each individual area in the entire game.  A full bestiary of ever non-hostile, beast, or boss is included with its HP/MP, along with weakness and strengths.<br /><br />I also love the fact they add entire lists of items that you can get in the game, ranging from the named items to the lowly Iron Dagger. At the main page of each tier of questing they include a checkbox as well in case you wanted to keep track yourself over the games quest tracking. Extras are packed in with a dragon tong translation, achievement/trophy tracking, and a giant map the enormousness of the game.<br /><br />This version of the guide has a hard cover image that goes from the front page continuing to the back showing off Skyrims landscape. Unlike the Fallout 3 guide, they have glossy pages that ink doesn't rub off on you when you turn the pages. You are given two string bookmarks that are attached to the book itself that allow you easy access to pages you frequently visit.<br /><br />I haven't read every single word in the guide, but the editing looks well done and easy to read. I say buy this guide right away if you have any interest in playing this game. It's worth every penny.<br /><br />~ Written: January, 2012<br /><br />Positives:<br />* Biggest guide that I have ever own that rivals college text books<br />* Huge map that shows every location<br />* Checklist on every item and quest to allow easy tracking<br />* Glossy pages<br />* Durable hardcover<br />* Bookmarks<br />Negatives:<br />* Higher price ranged quest to allow easy tracking  * Glossy pages  * Durable hardcover  * Bookmarks  Negatives:  * Higher price range
B0071NLG0W|4.0|I absolutely enjoyed this one. It was a little over the top with the voodoo stuff but it was light and funny. Amber got on my nerves with her indecisiveness about her love life. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Some Spoilers ahead  Let me start by saying I loved the first two books. I also liked the first half of this book as well but then things started going down hill. First it seems like the book just ends about 100 pages short of where it should of. The author leads up to what should be some sort of major final battle, but it never happens. What does happen, which I assume was to shock you, turns out to feel very fake. It also happens so suddenly that I had to reread the section in the book 2 more times to make sure it actually happened.  Additionally, the book could have have saved itself had it finished after the final scene with Kat and her bow, had she actually taken the pill, but no that would be to sad I guess.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|So my boyfriend and I were just perusing the list of Oscar nominees and randomly decided to give this one a try, no expectations really. Romantic comedies always seem to be kind of crap, you know, but hey at least it's background noise and usually something to occupy your time.  After watching it the first time, he's now going to bed and I've decided to watch it a second time.  This is seriously my new favorite movie, stupid as that sounds.  You just don't get this type of beautiful cinematography combined with this throwback sensibility and it's romantic, but not cheesy, and perfectly cast...  You know, I'm a lover of Casablanca and Sabrina and all of these classic romances, and man, Woody Allen has outdone himself on this one.  I just can't recommend it highly enough, it's wonderful.  I guess I should at least say that it's a bit of a chick flick, and maybe men won't appreciate it so much, but it was good enough that it compelled me to come write a review just to encourage people on the fence to watch it. The only other one I've written was for a book someone was offering for free on the kindle, and that was just to support a hopeful author. Just saying. I knew half way through that I would gladly drop the 20 bucks or whatever to buy my own copy.
B004FOA84A|3.0|why did they charge me 99 cents for this I beat the level in 15 min and there are no other levels,crappy!!!!!!!! I want a refund
086571701X|5.0|I'm new to Aquaponics, and this book is by far, the most easily readable book on the subject that I have found. It has clear instructions on setting up a variety of systems. She is a terrific writer and communicator. If you are thinking of setting up an Aquaponic system, this book will be your bible.
0307959856|4.0|PD James isn't quite channeling Jane Austen, but she does manage to reinvigorate the characters and the charm of Pride and Prejudice in a reasonable knock-off. She paints in the details of the first novel in a wordy prologue, and then settles into the mysterious account of a murder in her usual finely honed manner. It is a quick read, and a satisfying one. In the foreword, PD James acknowledges that it takes a certain amount of hubris to appropriate another author's characters, and humbly suggests that Austen could have written a better sequel herself. I think this is probably true, but I enjoyed James's attempt very much.
B006PZBR8S|3.0|Your 10 year old will probably like this a lot, and you will be reasonably annoyed by the cliche's, and unimaginative story, but at least you'll enjoy some decent robot FX.
0307891402|4.0|This book is even bigger than I'd expected, and I love it! Beautiful cover art too. Very handy, it really has everything you need to know about Skyrim in it.  One remark however: It would be handier to just have an alphabetical list of all the quests. I was looking for a particular quests the other day but couldn't find it because it was listed under \\"Deadric quests\\", not under it's own quest name.
0718157834|5.0|Louisa Clark has lived in the shadow of her town's tourist attraction, the Castle, all her life. She has never left her small town, and has worked at the Buttered Bun cafe for so many years, she knows the in's and out's of all her regular customer's lives. So when the Buttered Bun is closed to make way for more Castle-associated tourist cafes, Louisa `Lou' finds herself jobless in the middle of Britain's recession. She has no schooling or qualifications other than waitress. She needs a job, and fast, because her parents, Alzheimer grandfather and single-mother sister rely on her paycheques. Her boyfriend, Patrick, can't help her out either - he's obsessed with the `Viking' marathon and fat-ratio-body-count zero-carbs dieting.<br /><br />So when the job centre recommends Lou try for a job as carer to a quadriplegic, she reluctantly goes for the interview. But Lou really isn't qualified to `wipe bums' - she's not even very good at helping her mother take care of her grandfather who suffers from Alzheimer's. Lou's interview takes her to the affluent side of town, to the Traynor family mansion. The Traynor's own the Castle, are descendants of the original royal occupants. They are moneyed and infamous in Lou's small town, but she never knew about the troubles they've had at home . . .  the eldest Traynor child, Will, was in an accident two years ago that has left him a quadriplegic. He has movement of his neck, but minimal control of his hands and fingers. Everything else is paralysed, and he is confined to a chair and needs 24/7 care, especially after a suicide attempt put the family on high-alert.<br /><br />Lou doesn't think she's qualified to be Will's carer, at all. But Mrs Traynor is adamant that she does not want a nurse-maid for her son. She just wants him to spend time with someone who oozes joie de vivre, who will entertain and be a companion to him. Will already has a qualified nurse, a New Zealander called Nathan. Now he needs someone to be his friend - and the Traynor's think Lou fits the bill. She's chatty and quirky, dressing in colourful tights and sparkly gumboots. She's just the sort of positive influence Will needs in his life right now.<br /><br />But Will Traynor is not the easiest person to get along with. He's bitter and depressed - constantly reminiscing about his life `before' and `after' the accident. He used to ski, bungee jump, rock climb and just generally travel the globe looking for the next adrenalin-rush. Now he is chair-bound and suicidal.<br /><br />Lou has six months to prove her worth to the Traynor's and make a difference in Will's life. And what originally starts as an easy paycheque and cosy new job turns into a mission of hope. . .<br /><br />`Me Before You' is the new novel from British author, Jojo Moyes.<br /><br />I was hearing a lot about Jojo Moyes last year, thanks to her novel `The Last Letter from Your Lover'. Ms Moyes has been releasing books since 2002, and already had seven books under her belt before `The Last Letter' was released as her break-out hit in 2010. The novel won a slew of awards throughout 2011, including the UK's `RNA's Romantic Novel of the Year Award', and is now being adapted for the big screen. More than that though, I kept hearing whispers from my fellow book bloggers that `Last Letter' was something very, very special. Still, I didn't read it - God knows why. And then `Me Before You' came my way - the all-important next book to be released after Moyes's surprise hit. I had high expectations, based purely on previous book hype . . .  and I've got to say, Moyes met and exceeded every single one of them.<br /><br />Reading the blurb of `Me Before You', I thought I had a pretty good idea of where this book was going to go, and I did have my reservations. Purely judging a book by its cover (and blurb), I thought I had this novel pretty well pegged from the first page. But I was very, very wrong. Moyes surprised me at every turn, never more so than in how deep shedelved into the `issues' of this novel, without ever preaching.<br /><br />Will Traynor lived a full of adventurous life, until it was cut short one rainy London day. Now, in his early thirties, Will is a quadriplegic who needs round-the-clock care for his physical ailments, but for his mental road-blocks his mother has hired Lou Clark to be a companion to Will. Lou's contract will last up to six months, after which time Will has a decision to make about his life . . .  he'll either find the will to live, or his family will let him go to Dignitas, an assisted dying organisation based in Switzerland.<br /><br />In the beginning, Lou is none-the-wiser about Will's ultimatum. She reluctantly goes to her new job at the Traynor's plush mansion and grows to dislike Will and his curmudgeon behaviour. But slowly, very slowly, he starts to let a little of his old self seep in . . .  Lou sees a charming and enigmatic young man, with strong opinions and a dried-up thirst for life. Lou also witnesses the many ways that Will's life has vastly changed from two years ago. She meets Will's ex girlfriend and his ex best friend. She stares at photos of Will standing tall upon a ski-slope and hears him tell tale of his trek up Mount Kilimanjaro. Lou finds it hard to reconcile that man with her wheelchair-bound charge. But Lou understands a thing or two about transformative events, and how hard it is to reconcile the `before' and `after'. Because Lou has her own personal tragedy and remembered history which keeps her in this small town, never to venture beyond the shadow of the Castle.<br /><br />Will, likewise, comes to care for Lou. Very slowly he starts to see her as more than just a dumb waitress from the bad part of town. He encourages her to read the books from his personal library and begs her to leave their small town, to see Paris or Sydney, just expand her four walls. But when Lou discovers the real reason behind her short six-month contract, and Will's potential life-or-death decision, their time together becomes even more important. Lou becomes desperate to convince Will of the reasons to live, and she plans outings and activities to do just that.<br /><br />Jojo Moyes is exploring a rather contentious issue - euthanasia. Going into this novel, I already knew where I stood on the topic of euthanasia - and that was that people should be allowed to die with dignity, on their own terms, and in their own time. But my stance was garnered from newspaper articles and raw, flat facts. In `Me Before You' Moyes really does put a face and emotion behind this issue. And it should be noted that the book is full of gray areas - Will has plenty of people in his life (including Lou) who do not agree with this potential decision to die at Dignitas. But Moyes digs - she delves and explores the myriad of reasons for Will's decision to live or die . . .  and one of the reasons to stay is a powerful one - love.<br /><br />But Moyes has certainly done her research, and in the book Lou trawls internet forums and speaks to other quadriplegics in her attempts at understanding Will. The potential diseases which could end his life, the various dangers of the body (regulating body temperature could be the difference between life and death). It's all very fascinating, if heartbreaking.<br /><br />But this novel isn't just about Will and Lou. Moyes has peppered the book with a cast of lovable characters who enrich the story. There's Patrick, Lou's long-term boyfriend who has become a fitness fanatic, much to her chagrin. Lou's sister, a single mother to Tomas who dropped out of university to be a mother to him. Lou's parents, an affable duo who are struggling to keep their heads above water in Britain's recession. And then there's Will's family - his polished mother whose cracks are beginning to show, and unfaithful father who selfishly feels the strain of Will's condition. Moyes has certainly filled out Lou and Will's lives with this cast of characters - and shedelves into the gray areas with these people too, when she provides certain chapters told from their perspective. We learn of Camilla Traynor's divided heart - her love for her son versus the condition which has turned him into someone she doesn't really know. I loved these little asides, especially because Moyes offers them up at exactly the moment when you think you have the character figured out - she then lets us pick around in their brain and read their perspective, know their struggles and illicit unlikely sympathy.<br /><br />I did cry buckets in this book. I won't give anything away, but throughout parts of the book I was a blubbering mess. Moyes certainly plays the heart-strings with a deft pen, and she does keep you guessing until the very end. But as much as I cried throughout the book, by the last page I was taking deep, cathartic breaths and feeling better for having read `Me Before You'. Moyes pushed me to think about an issue I was already firmly decided on, more than that though, she gave an `issue' real heart and perspective. I loved `Me Before You' so much, that I rushed out and bought a copy of `The Last Letter from Your Lover' (and after that, I intend to read every single one of her backlist books too). I'd say be prepared for `Me Before You' - Moyes forces her readers to think and feel every awful, beautiful, heart-rending and chest-constricting emotion.

0439023521|4.0|I was not overly excited about this book when I started it, I couldn't put my finger on it though. I had trouble not picturing everyone from the capital as something Dr. Seuss would conjure up. About halfway through the first part my apprehension eased and I was becoming more interested in the characters. By the time the games began I was sucked in. I loved the way the romantic subplot was woven in and how the games played. I wasn't getting into the mutations at the end, but it served it's purpose on how cruel the people running the games are.<br /><br />I've heard the rumblings about how much this story is nearly identical to Battle Royal, but honestly, I don't really care. It's a good story, they both are, and I feel Collins interpretation was an excellent tribute to an idea that was done decades ago with the Most Dangerous Game. Since neither story is totally original, I will not do that comparison here.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed it more than I initially thought I was going to.

0374275637|5.0|The notion that I am unaware of almost everything going on in my brain at any given moment is a concept that I am still coming to terms with a week after finishing this monumental book. How can I not be aware of what I'm thinking? Kahneman's guided tour through his revolutionary research career leaves little doubt that my conscious awareness (System 2) is all too eager to delegate the management of my well-being to automatic processes that do a decent job of keeping me alive and socially accepted the vast majority of the time (System 1).  Recognizing that a good deal of my thinking is done without my approval, I have been going back through this book to try and understand how my aware thinking interacts with/controls/answers to the background processes. I have not been very successful in finding a clear discussion of just how this interaction occurs. Kahneman seems to have made a very deliberate choice to only discuss those findings that are firmly supported by research. While the bulk of the book is a first-hand account of his experimental psychology program, he readily discusses the work of other psychologists to expand on and clarify various aspects of the topic under consideration. This leaves little room for speculation on how we can use what little awareness of our thinking that we do have to improve the automatic responses that dictate the majority of our actions and make most of our decisions.  While Kahneman may not offer concrete suggestions, the insights that he shares into our thinking process provide hints to how one might modify the performance of System 1 using System 2. Just one example that I've found is a passage on page 383 of the hardcover. Kahneman tell us that \\"System 1 represents sets by averages, norms, and prototypes, not by sums...The memory that the remembering self keeps is a representative moment, strongly influenced by the peak and the end.\\" Is my taste in food, books, music, or movies nothing more than a reflection of the quality of mymeals or the novels that I've read? Can I shift my preference for certain experiences merely by paying more attention to my choices and making an effort to diversify my activities?  This is just one type of question suggested by this marvelous book. Kahneman's awkward acronym, WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) suggests other ways to consciously modify our automatic responses. If What I See Is All There Is, will keeping my focus on the good parts of my life make me happier? Will focusing on those tasks that I can influence and ignoring those things I can't influence make me more satisfied with my career?  This book will force you to reconsider what you have always thought about your thinking and how you make decisions. The decision whether or not to read this book is an easy one. Don't think about it. Do it now.

What happens when the butcher cannot fully realize that you are single, and need only one serving? What if your dating profile is misunderstood? What if you had stretched the truth, and then find out your match has not been entirely truthful either? What if the one matched up with you rejects you on the spot, saying that he had preferred somebody much younger, even though you fitted his original age-range? How do you, as a young woman, feel when the date you had been paired up with, by a dating service, turns out to be your own father? How do you date when you are afraid of disclosing yourself for fear of being hurt? Love nevertheless can develop. And so it goes...

B000002UB2|5.0|Hi all you Beatle fans who still have an interest in vinyl!  This review is coming a year late as I didn't even think of writing a review on the Vinyl 2010 issue even though it is SIGNIFICANT in what it is......  And namely, what it is, dear people, is an 'RE-1' issue that I will bet a double cheeseburger is from the 2009 digital remasters that blew everyone away when they  came out on cd. As Abbey Road is the only Beatles lp still in print in the United States this kind of makes sense. But the other big surprise is that it's pressed on  188 gram (yeah, I weighed it) Virgin Vinyl and I will go on record as saying that it does sound significantly better than even my British/UK first pressing with no banding!  If your a Beatles junkie you probably remember that a few years back they re-released AR with a T-shirt in a box-I didn't buy one of those but looking up release information  on the internet, it seems that indeed, there was a 'fresh' vinyl remastering for the album, and it does look like somebody at  capitol used the new Digital tapes as the master. It doesn't say anything on the jacket, and in fact it seems like Best Buy was selling a DIFFERENT US pressing than this one I bought from Amazon!?? That makes no sense unless they still had old stock on the 1992 issue, which would look like this one and have the same catalog number: C1 07777-46446-17.  But again, the first thing that caught my attention when I pulled out the record was it's weight, then when I looked in the dead wax area and saw the 'RE-1' inscription, I got very excited. And I still am! I've compared this again to the original British first pressing Apple issue, the BC-13 analogue issue, the British DMM 1995 Re-Issue, the Mobile Fidelity Half Speed Mastered version, and the earlier US Capitol issues, and this one sounds better than all of them! It just sounds 'right' without a hint of Digital-ness. So again, the hobby of collecting vinyl takes an unexpected turn for the better. Who would have thought that a humble US pressing in the year 2010 would trump all other versions???  Gerard Masters

I'm glad to now own this on DVD but wish the transfer were a little better.  From Beyond has an excellent transfer, this one is acceptable but nowhere nearly as nice.<br /><br />And for people that would compare a 30+ year old movie to something new, you've got to be crazy.  Of course low budget movies from the 80's shouldn't be comparable to new gen movies.  I wouldn't try comparing my current computer to the one I had in the 80's either.

B001AFF25W|4.0|This Kindle book  provided an excellent incentive to get up and go on some projects I've had lying dormant. The chapters are short and each provides a specific lesson or rule to follow. This starts right from chapter one, unlike other books that save the meaty stuff till the end. I would say a good half of the rules were relevant to me and of those a handful really hit home. When it comes to procrastination there is probably only one or two main things stopping any of us and these may be different for everyone, so by the end of this book I was very happy to have found something to get me going and fighting through the difficult times in my work.<br /><br />This is not a scholarly book but one based on practical advice which is what I needed. I've read other books by researchers who say they have found out what ails most procrastinators and the key of those book in the last chapters doesn't apply to me! Hence this book that seems to cover many different types of people should be good for pretty much anyone.
B004LROUNG|4.0|A SPOILER ALERT IS NOT NEEDED.  THIS IS A REVIEW, NOT A SYNOPSIS<br /><br />Finally, a Grisham book that lives up to his (former) reputation!  This one's got it all.  Characters we can bond with, those we detest, and above all, an underdog we can root for.<br /><br />This one sheds some light for us into the assorted worlds of lawyers; the huge, hundreds-of-dollars-per-hour firms; the ambulance chasers; and the murky world of tort law and big, class-action lawsuits.<br /><br />It's easy to identify with the protagonist, David Zinc.  On a not-so-fast track to partner, he re-examines his life, making an instantaneous choice that forever alters his path.  Grisham makes him real for us--especially those who wish they could say, \\"Take this job and shove it!\\"<br /><br />This book brings Grisham back to his glory days of writing.  He immediately makes the reader understand and feel the protagonist's thoughts.  He seamlessly sets up the backdrop for what is to become a book you will not be able to put down.  Characterization is spot-on and not at all generic, despite some of the characters' flaws.<br /><br />Secondary and even tertiary stories are interwoven.  But, Grisham never loses sight of their importance and maintains the primary one without sacrificing them nor, the back story.<br /><br />Okay, Mr. Grisham, when can we read your next one?
B004V8W54Q|1.0|I foolishly assumed that the blue ray version of Brazil would have special features.  It does not.  I suppose I got the impression there would be features and a commentary by Terry Gilliam because the five star reviews spoke about a commentary, but if you look closely you will see that amazon has merely copied the five star reviews from the Criterion Collection 3 disc DVD version of Brazil and pasted them as reviews for the blue ray version.  Shame on you, Amazon!<br /><br />If all you want is the best movies ever made on blue ray, then by all means get this disc.  But don't assume that you will be getting commentary and special features.

0446547603|1.0|I got this book along with two other Sparks novels as gifts because someone wanted me to see what he's all about.  I went in with an open mind knowing nothing about him.  I've never read an interview with him, never seen any of the movies based on his books and, besides \\"The Notebook\\" don't even know what they are about.<br /><br />That said, this book is pretty awful.<br /><br />It seems that this guy gets book deals because his first book sold millions and now millions of people who lap up bad drivel still flock to buy his sugar-coated nonsense.  Just really bad writing.  The dialogue is cliched, the setting is cliched, the plot is cliched.  This book is far worse than the other two I read.  But they were all bad.  And I went in with an open mind.  Really.  But this is the sort of writing that anonymous authors pen for Harlequin.  It was embarrassing.  Are so many people so longing for a good love story that they'll take any cookie-cutter, by-the-numbers sap such as this?<br /><br />The characters are stupidly perfect...and do not really exist in any world other than the one in this book.  Oh, such a lovely girl.  She doesn't own a TV and just loves coffee and old books.  She has no flaws and is just dandy.  Snore.  Oh, such a lovely man.  He has kids and lost his wife and don't you just know he's a terrific dad who struggles but is really a good guy.  Snore.  Oh, the kids are so clever and sweet.  They're loyal to their dad and mature beyond their years.  Snore.  Oh, the people in that town are so lovely.  There's a church on every corner, which MUST mean that everyone there is good town-folk.  Why?  Because church people are always so lovely and nice.  Snore.  Wait...what's this...?  A villain?  He's the villain because....he's constantly being a huge, evil jerk.  Just because.  In fact, he's so cartoonish, he might as well be curling his moustache throughout the book.<br /><br />Drivel.  Just awful.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and seek out writing that's actually worth your time.

B0045HCJSK|4.0|John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson star in this solid Western.  Dean plays the drunkard who, after two years of being in the bottle, wants to crawl out, dust himself off, and gain some respect.  John Wayne is Sheriff John T. Chance, Walter Brennan plays an old coot, and Ricky Nelson plays a...wait, who is Ricky Nelson?<br />Starring the lovely Angie Dickinson whose character falls for John Wayne's character and directed by Howard Hawks.  As a family of bad guys are trying to release one of their own it is full of action, some humor, and singing.  Yes, well you have Dean and Ricky, a young hot new talent , so you have singing.  Not a lot, so don't worry about it.<br />Now, if this film seems familiar to you, please remember there was a remake in the form of [[ASIN:B001KS0THU El Dorado]] with Robert Mitchum and James Caan.  I happen to like the remake a lot, mostly because of the interaction between the three main male characters.  It could also be because I saw the remake first and also really do not like singing in what I think of as a serious work.  But that only takes away one point.<br />If you like John Wayne, Wasterns, or Dean Martin, may I suggest this DVD?
B0059XTTW8|4.0|\\"Tinker Tailor Solider Spy\\" is an espionage genre film. Set in the 1970s Cold War tensions between Britain and the Soviet Union are presented as anxious with indications that there is a double agent within the highest echelon of the British Intelligence Agency.  The narrative of the movie concentrates on the meticulous unraveling of discovering who the traitor is.  The cast is absorbing with Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, and Mark Strong.  It is a classic styled spy film and the mild pace of the story allows the viewer to assess the many factors and variables in order to discover the truth. The speed of the narrative may not suit espionage enthusiasts who are accustomed to rapid fire movies like the Bourne films. However, this movie challenges the viewer to think, which certainly counterbalances any lack of speed.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
0865478570|3.0|The point that literal translation is neither necessary nor sufficient for success is well made.  Bravo!  But this book would have been more enjoyable and engaging if its author had not beaten this point to death.<br /><br />If David Bellos had looked at the rather brilliant translations of the Tintin books into various languages, he would have been able to drive home his points more forcefully.  And the Asterix books are fine examples as well.<br /><br />The discussion has been opened.  We have a good base.  I look forward to future developments.<br /><br />Interestingly, I see no references to attempts to translate The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy into other languages and media, though that invention of Douglas Adams's gives this book its title.  Belos might consider that when Adams wrote the book, he was translating the radio show into a new medium, and this is as challenging and as much an invitation to creative innovation as translating the series into a foreign language.

B003AQBYUG|3.0|Whenever I purchase a Bluray movie that was converted from an older film, the first thing I do is look at the reviews to see what people say about the video quality. Needless to say when I saw that people liked the video quality of this release I jumped on the great bargain. I'll be honest I'm just not that impressed with it. I usually sit kinda close to my TV because I have a small apartment so I can really notice the missing pixels in the transfer. The video quality is very grainy. If I sit back far enough though it's not as bad. Oddly enough the quality was actually better in Alien than in Aliens. I know it's not just my system setup either as most of the movies I have look absolutely beautiful. Avatar for example made me nearly wet myself when I saw how rich the video quality was. Is it enough to make me regret my purchase though? Probably not. But I still expected much better.

Its light and easily adjustable.<br /><br />As said in the bad reviews the headphones will break on you within a few months most likely, which they did for me just the other day when the sound cut out in the right ear.<br /><br />Overall these ARE the best headphones I've ever used and had such a influence on me I was going to buy another pair right after they broke, but decided to try out some padded headphones for a change. Its a bit of a gamble for how long they will work, but worth a try.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Light<br />- Great bass<br />- comfortable, adjustable fit<br />- good balance of volume output and outside sound blockage<br />- great price for a good product<br /><br />Cons<br />- plastic<br />- breaks in time and with more usage<br />- flimsy

B000A0K2JO|3.0|This did just what I wanted it to. I had a keyboard with only a USB male connector. This device converted that USB connector to the older style of male connector: PS/2.<br /><br />Ideazon Merc Stealth illuminated gaming keyboard owners:  Attention!<br />This device WILL NOT WORK for you. It works perfectly well with another USB keyboard that I have, but not with my USB Merc Stealth. And this is not a unique defect of my Merc Stealth unit. I read some message boards posts on other websites, and there is an entry in the Merc Stealth manual that corroborate what I have said. The Merc Stealth will simply not work with this PS/2 adapter.<br /><br />Also, I read a couple of other reviews here at amazon, and apparently this device does not always work. Therefore only three stars.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|This is a pretty interesting movie in my opinion.  I gave it four stars.  Primarily because of the historical facts that are related here.  In response to some of the other reviews that have been posted, a few points to consider from my viewing:<br /> I think people miss the point of the pie.  The pie was an extreme response from Minny to an extreme position of her employer.  The extreme position was a law passed that those who cook for you; raise your children; clean your family's mess and take your verbal battering as though you did not have any feelings, had to have a separate OUTSIDE bathroom from the house they took care of from top to bottom.  Was it wrong to bake the pie? From a Christ centered point of  view YES.  We all know that people when they have had enough often have an extreme response.  Minny had had enough of this vicious woman's denigration of who she was as a person.  The employer used her \\"Whiteness\\" to humiliate Minny because of the Minny's \\"blackness\\".<br /> Although the movie is fictional, the experiences related in this movie was the real deal on a daily basis just a little over 4 decades ago.  The reading of the Jim Crow lawbook made it clear as to how depraved Jim Crow was.  I was born into and lived under Jim Crow until I was 14 years old.  I still remember the laws.<br /> I also remember my family telling me of how my grandmother when she, in their opinion, got too old to work was just let her go.<br /> You cannot legislate morality; but history teaches, and this movie bears out, you can legislate hatred. From the negative comments, this movie obviously makes many folk uncomfortable because it reminds us of these facts.<br /> Yes, it is another movie about some White woman taking the lead in helping blacks 'free' themselves or help themselves.  I find it difficult to believe this woman was raised untouched by the morals of the day among southern Whites.  And to have attended a college in MS at this time makes it more improbable considering the extent of racism at the major colleges of MS at that time.<br /> Finally, the response of the Skeeter's boyfriend was so real.  He probably did think everything was fine because he wasn't the one being humiliated.ism at the major colleges of MS at that time.   Finally, the response of the Skeeter's boyfriend was so real.  He probably did think everything was fine because he wasn't the one being humiliated.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|The pictures of many of the extraordinary objects made me a little disappointed that I couldn't shop in their antique store.  All and all the game is worth a strong 4 1/2 to 5 stars.  The objects were cleverly shown in different ways to keep things interesting.  The premise of the game was pleasantly different and the dialog made me smile at times.  Just a little disappointed with the Mini games:  some were redundant and others too easy.  But I'll still play this game a few more times at least, after rotating through my other H.O. games.  (And several of those are G5 also!)  And for those of you that don't like being asked to leave a review:  You can click \\"No\\" to make it stop asking or \\"Ask me later\\" to make sure you've played enough of the game to be sure of your opinion.  No big deal.

030788743X|5.0|Ready Player One has just made it to the very top of the list of my favorite books! It is quite easily the most entertaining book I've ever read. Now, some people may claim that it doesn't have as much intellectual merit as other books but that doesn't matter one bit to me. I've read many great novels of all genres and have never picked one up that was more fun to read than this. The story felt like nerd porn. It practically oozed 80s nostalgia and had enough nerd culture references to make me squeal with excitement.  Honestly, if you have even the slightest interest in nerd culture, video games, or even just a sense of adventure, you won't regret reading this at all.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have always loved Fantasy fiction. But, my first allegiance will always be with Science Fiction. Before I even touched a Fantasy novel, I read sci-fi (mostly the \\"Star Wars\\" novels by Kevin J. Anderson). As I got older, I tried going back to Science Fiction again, but there was a problem.<br /><br />I hate Science.<br /><br />With most modern Sci-fi novels for older readers, one can get easily lost in a sea of techno babble. It wasn't until a few years back that I remembered why I read Star Wars novels. Star Wars was more about \\"soft\\" sciences, like Psychology, History, Religion, and Sociology.<br /><br />In my search for \\"soft\\" Sci-fi , I read books like \\"Dune\\", \\"1984\\", \\"Fareheit 451\\", and \\"I, Robot\\". I devoured all these books and others greedily. And I wanted more.<br /><br />Then I found \\"Ender's Game\\".<br /><br />\\"Ender's Game\\" takes place in the far and not too distant future. It's a Utopian like future, where the world is united as one government. This Utopia is threatened when the insectoid aliens called Buggers invade<br /><br />The aliens are beaten back, led by the famous Mazer Rackham. And now, with a third war looming 70 years later, the human race needs another hero like Rackham. So in hopes of finding another savior, the military takes gifted children away from their families, and trains them to fight.<br /><br />It may sound all cutsey, but this book is more for readers older than 14.<br /><br />It's very hard not to spoil this book. Even though the description may seem generic, the story is far from being the same worn out plot. The characters are far from being the same worn out tropes. The twists and turns are many, and always shocked me. It made me want to keep reading, to uncover the shocking true motives of the characters.<br /><br />Overall, I give the book 5 out of 5 stars! I have a feeling this book will still be known years from now, and be listed among the best Sci-fi novels of all time.<br /><br />The book is available in Print, and for most ebook readers.

0307959856|4.0|As a long time fan of both Jane Austen and P.D. James, I was very excited to see that one of my favorite mystery authors had tried her hand at an Austenesque sequel.  Now the Austen sequel market is rather full, most of it with pitiful shlock, but James brings something unique to the table - a well-versed knowledge of the author and crime stories that lends a ring of truth to her story when others have failed.  \\"Death Comes to Pemberly\\" is not perfect but for those yearning for a respectful \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" sequel, P.D. James mostly delivers.<br /><br />The story begins six years after Elizabeth and Darcy are married, now the parents of two boys, with Jane and Bingley living close by and their connection to Lydia and Wickham all but nonexistent.  On the eve of Lady Anne's Ball, an annual Pemberly event, Lydia shows up in a wild haste proclaiming that Denny has killed Wickham in the Permberly woodland.  However, when Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam search the woods, they find a drunk Wickham over the body of a dead Denny, confessing that it is all his fault.  As much as Darcy and Elizabeth have tried to keep Wickham out of their lives, he always finds his way back in, and they are drawn into helping him put up a defense when he is tried for murder.  Much of the rest of the book deals with the inquest and the trial and I must say that it is not as interesting as it could be, nor does the solution seem particularly satisfactory, but more of a cheat.  The true delight of this book lies in the background stories that James weaves for the cause of the murder and the further lives of these characters that we have grown to love.<br /><br />\\"Death Comes to Pemberly\\" is a fast-paced read, a delight for all Austen fans and fans of P.D. James alike.  Yet it is definitely not the author's greatest mystery and she does spent a great deal of time rehashing many elements of the original story and even elements of her own creation.  She does a commendable job in capturing the language and feel of Austen's time and she is truthful to Austen's characters.  It does not feel as if she is trying to capitalize on the Austen mania where other authors have and that is what makes this a better story than most Austen related works out there.sten's time and she is truthful to Austen's characters.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Get a cup of coffee and a big screen hd-tv to experience this truly unique piece of film art.  Be completely awake (hence the coffe), prepared to thinking, because much of this film is silent.  This leaves the viewers to sink into their own thoughts while they contemplate the breath-taking images of the beauty and power of the universe(hence the hd tv), contrasted with an intimate drama of human experience.  One can not watch this movie without being arrested by the mystery of life, God, the universe, and what it all means.

B000LYCNJQ|5.0|This is the only version of the original theatrical version on dvd.  It is not as clean as the remastered versions but probably comparable to a VHS version.  Its not true wide screen, but beggars cant be choosers.  But it is the original and very watchable.  Be careful if buying this used, make sure your getting the two disk set and not just disk one.  Some people are selling just the remastered disk 1 without the original version under the guise of this listing.  Shop around you can still get new complete sets here and on ebay for fairly reasonable prices.  Bottom line in my humble opinion this is very watchable. And until Lucas decides he wants to re-master the original releases without additions and cgi effects, this is the best you can get at the moment.

1451648537|4.0|Around the year I was born Apple was started in a garage in California. Two men shared a vision to bring the PC out of the hands of the scientist and into households as an appliance. Apple would not fulfill that vision alone, but they played a huge part in it and they continue to today. Their little company went from nothing to the the most profitable in the world in my lifetime. That's a story any business major MUST read and that is the story you will find in this book. Being a software engineer who's life has been impacted over and over again by the subject, this was an emotional journey for me. It is a very well written biography about a not-so-perfect man. It's a story about how when imagination and creativity are given authority over engineering magic happens!

0802473156|5.0|The 5 Love Languages is one of the most profound and useful books on maintaining healthy relationships that I have ever read. Not only is it simple to assess the love languages of those we love, but it's also simple to put those suggestions into action. I said \\"simple,\\" but not always easy.<br /><br />As is often the case when couples pair off, opposites attract and then clash. By nature we automatically show affection to others in a way that we would like to receive affection ourselves. We give love in the only way we know, but it's not interpreted as love by the other party. That person speak a different love language. Fortunately, when we realize what constitutes \\"love\\" to our spouse and other family members, we can learn to effectively speak their love languages.<br /><br />I credit Gary Chapman with a huge breakthrough in healing and strengthening our bonds with one another. No matter how difficult a relationship may be, I believe it can be improved by applying these simple truths.

B0000CABBW|4.0|The movie is set in New Zealand and tells the tale of Pai, a young spirited Maori girl, who strives to be accepted by her grandfather, Koro, the tribal chief. The emotional story starts with the tragic event of the death of Pai's mother and twin brother during birth. Pai's grandfather Koro is devastated by the death of who he thought was going to be the next chief of the Maori tribe. Pai's father skips town in search of himself, looking for personal fulfillment, leaving his parents to care for Pai. Legend says that the Maori ancestor known as Paikea, came to New Zealand, saved by a whale when his canoe capsized in a storm. The Maori people hold this animal in high regards, and consider them to determine who their next leader will be.  From the beginning, the Maori leader has always been a first born son. After the letdown of having a granddaughter, Koro begins a class for the boys in his tribe to teach them the ancient ways in hopes of finding the chosen one. He kicks Pai out of the class when she refuses to sit in the back because she desires to learn the ways of her people. Pai turns to the whales, crying out in desperation for their help. Her cry is answered when a herd of these giant animals are beached on the shore. The whole town unites to try to save them. It is only when Pai realizes her destiny, climbs atop the whales back and guides it out into the deep, that they are saved. It's a beautiful story of fulfilling ones destiny in spite of opposition.  Though this is a story of an indigenous religion, its principles relate to religions all over the world. Every religion has traditions and leaders. We pass down these traditions from generation to generation, whether by story telling or by the written word. In this tribe, the leader has always been a male. In most world relgions, this is also the case. Women are not usually in positions of leadership, and even in some religions are considered to be the lesser sex. In all religions, there is a focus of worship, whether it be a person, god, animal, etc. Also, no matter what we believe, we all have a destiny to fulfill and most likely will have to overcome opposition to fulfill it.

B005LAIIS0|4.0|Let's get one thing out of the way.  This is not a story about psychotic rogue wolves seeking to eat humans.  This is not a story about werewolves.  It is about survival in a part of the world unwelcome to man.  A group of oil workers on the Alaska pipeline are heading to Anchorage for a little R and R when the plane goes down in the frozen wilderness.  Miraculously 7 survive the crash.  Liam Neeson is fortunately one of the survivors.  He is a marksman employed by the company and is charged with keeping the workers safe from wolves.  He is suicidal because of the recent death of his wife.  These early scenes must have been difficult for Neeson given his own personal circumstances.  In any case, those memories of his wife sustain him as he attempts to lead the survivors to safety.  Attempt is the operative word here.  In addition to below freezing temperatures, blizzards and a lack of food and water, the group must also deal with a pack of wolves looking for dinner.<br /><br />Ottway (Neeson) knows wolves are cunning hunters and will pick off the men one by one if they let their guard down.  The movie is terribly moving at times as each of the men has their own skeletons in the closet or loved ones waiting to see them.  They are full of grit but a lack of weapons and adaptability to the elements puts them at great risk.  Yes there are confrontations both with the wolves and each other.  And yes, the wolves are vicious but in a realistic way.  Escapist material?  You bet, but don't look for a happy ending.  If you sit through the entire credit list at the end of the film, there is a very brief scene that may make you feel better.  See it!

B005LAIGH8|3.0|I almost didn't see this movie.  It was getting such bad press by most critics, but then Oscar seems to think there is something there.  Now I certainly don't agree with the Academy much of the time but still, they often get it right.  Oskar (a very good Thomas Horn) is a boy of about 12 who lost his father (Tom Hanks in flashbacks) in one of the towers on 9/11.  They were very close.  More so than with mom (Sandra Bullock).  Oskar is a strange young man, borderline autistic.  He admits that he was tested but the results were \\"inconclusive.\\"  For sure he is odd.  One of those kids that gets picked on in school for wearing black socks and oxfords instead of Nikes.<br /><br />Oskar discovers a key inside a vase he accidently broke and believes that his dad wanted him to find the lock that matches.  The key is inside a small envelope with the word Black written on it.  This is a clue Oskar's father left for him he convinces himself, so he set out to find out where the key fits.  This is the first thing that is a bit puzzling.  The key is clearly one that fits a safety deposit box, but all the adults don't seem to see that.  So he tries it on numerous doors, padlocks and other locks in his search to find the right Mr. or Ms. Black.  Early on he traipses all across the boroughs of New York City, on foot!  Then he is escorted by an old man who is known as \\"The Renter\\" because he lives in a room let by Oskar's grandmother across the street.  The old man (Oscar nominee Max von Sydow) can't or won't speak.  But he writes clearly in bold letters on a note pad he carries.  Ultimately Oskar discovers where the key belongs, so what we have is the improbably journey.  Along the way, flashbacks of 9/11 and the associated guilt Oskar feels surfaces.<br /><br />The film is clearly sentimental and to some degree manipulates our emotions.  I don't find this terribly obtrusive, but Oskar's emotions are sometimes a bit much.  Still, reading some of the professional reviewers I find opinions all over the place.  Some even say they were offended.  Huh?  Is this Oscar-worthy in terms of Best Picture?  No.  Is this a sallow, bland, irritating, self-important film? No.  This is one of the most overly underrated films of the year and one of the most overly overrated at the same time.ions all over the place.  Some even say they were offended.  Huh?

B002L9N4DS|5.0|How do I begin to describe one of them most incredible films of the last 50 years....I can't. I just can't do it justice. But I will do my best to tell you how this movie has affected me. Every one of you has seen this film. The whole world has seen this film. There is nothing I can say to those millions of you who have seen this All I can do, is give you my review.<br /><br />I will not go into detail. You already know every scene, every line. I just really wanted to have my say posted by Amazon.<br /><br />The obligatory `cliff note' is Tom Hanks plays the part of a mentally challenged man whose life interacts unwittingly with persons of fame and politics.  He has no ides of the impact he has in people's lives. and simply sees the world `as it is', and yearns for the love of his life, his Jenny. In fact, everything he does, is driven by his love for Jenny.<br /><br />You will never EVER see a better performance by Gary Sinese, as the physically and severely soul wounded Lt. Dan. EVERYTHING he has done since this movie, is compared to this role. Robin Wright Penn will never have a role as perfect as she had as Jenny, the woman he has loved since childhood, but shuns him repeatedly, in search of her own life. And as to Tom Hanks? Well, he is one of the premier actors of the modern era, and his performance in Forest Gump eclipses even his role in `The Green Mile' (my other favorite film). Hanks so `under-plays' his simple-minded Gump character, to the point of diamond brilliance. In the end, he finally get's his life's desire, and hears the words he waited for his whole life, from Jenny...\\"I love you\\". And then, she is sadly gone. But we get a glimpse of a whole new beginning in his life, with his son (played by Haley Joel Osment).<br /><br />Yeah, I know there is nothing new in this review that really describes the film. My point was, is, watch this movie on DVD as often as you can. Not only will it enthrall you, it may just make you a better person. The emotion in this film is so tangible, if it does not make you weep at the human condition, than you have no heart.make you weep at the human condition, than you have no heart.

B0025VLELQ|5.0|Seeing this movie again is like reliving my childhood. I grew up in the age of video games and modern space discoveries so watching this movie as a kid pretty much defined my childhood. I also believe Sci-Fi was in its prime in the 80's and 90's, because if you notice, most of the films from this era are highly rated and influential. The genre had just come into its own and was producing classic after classic, culminating with Terminator 2, which was probably one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time. They just don't make them this way anymore; fun, full of life, as truly well-made movies and not solely made to be \\"blockbusters\\" or \\"cash cows.\\" It's a totally different era nowadays.  It is truly a classic, because you watch it now and the fun, light hearted attitude remains enjoyable, despite the \\"old school\\" vibe of the film. It's also a classic due to its CGI being one of the first of its class, paving the way for future movies; a credit that is somewhat under-appreciated in my opinion, as if it were not for TLS and Tron, movies like Terminator 2 may not have had the groundwork to draw from.  The Last Starfighter is an underrated classic representation of the 80's era science fiction film.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover for the Kindle Fire. It really protects the Kindle while giving it an awesome look. Most of the time people don't even realize that it isn't a book until I open the cover.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a great movie about faith, fatherhood, and family in the setting of the world of law enforcement officers. I really liked how their Christian faith stood the test of time in the movie, and that the characters' love for Jesus Christ was clearly on display for all to see.
B004LUS390|5.0|This is a fantastic app!!! It's very advanced with a bunch of different tools, brushes, and a customizable color selector. I am a novice artist, but once you get the hang of things it's very easy to use! I love the symmetry tool (since I generally design dresses, it's come in handy many times when drawing prints and some dresses). No problems whatsoever with installation or updates. Great interface, and saving and emailing drawings is quick and easy (if you don't have an email app, which you need in order to email drawings, I recommend skitm@il). All in all, fantastic app!!! Definitely worth the 2 bucks!
B0063GORYU|5.0|easy to play and challenging. always fun and mind wakening. I recommend this to all solitaire players.start playing now and have fun
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|This is a fun app for kids and casual doodlers. It's pretty basic, and a great app, just not what I was looking for as a somewhat more advanced artist. Still, its fun and easy to use!
B000002AD0|5.0|This album is sick--both sides, every song.  It's strong, it's fast, it's slow-- it's early Santana and it's pure smoke !  Whether a long time fan or just into it, this is a tremendous purchase!
B0025KW29U|5.0|I adore this movie. It's about as perfect as they come. It is funny, quotable, and still possesses an admirable degree of depth, and the songs are really good (so I similarly recommend the soundtrack.)
B005HSG3U6|5.0|lightweight and easy to use - protects my \\"fire\\" which is what I wanted. flips open and can stand if you want, not expensive would recommend.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I thought for a little while that I'd never complete a level, but after a while things turned around.  well worth the price paid.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This novel has it all:  witches, daemons, vampires, history, both American and English, and a fascinating story line with great characters.  As good or better than the early Ann Rice.  It draws you right in and holds your interest throughout.  Can't wait to read the second book to see what trouble they get into in London.
B006ZDU7QI|3.0|Sorry, but....most of the songs are freaking great.  All of the singing and playing is freaking great.  This band is a monster talent.  Howthehellever, I think that they think that every idea they come up with is brilliant.  And that just isn't the case.  Therefore, the mix is whacked in my opinion.  They've turned the mix down on the soft spots and cranked it up on the loud parts.  They may consider this brilliant, I consider it stupid.  I got tired of turning my volume control on my stereo in my vehicle up and down during songs.  Sooooo, I just ran the songs thru a DAW and rebalanced it.  Raising the volume 2.5 db on the quiet parts.  I believe they were looking for mind blowing dynamics.  But it doesn't work the way they did it.  (to me)  STILL.....I LOVE THIS BAND.  AMAZING TALENT!!!!  Cranky Old Man
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I waited a long time to watch this one.  I was expecting some cliché super hero movie with the usual cheap thrills.  Not the case here.  The story really helps this movie be great.  I love how Thor is humbled when everyone knows he is the strongest and the most cunning of them all.  But he was far too arrogant and ill-considered to be handed the throne.  During his humiliation as a human being, I had several laughs, especially the scene in the hospital!  Thor was also well casted.  Everyone played their role well.  There are MANY super hero movies out there right now, and this one DEFINITELY deserves your attention.  Give it a try.  Most people will like it.  I'll be getting it on blu ray pretty soon!  <NEWS> Thor will be making another appearance in the movie \\"The Avengers\\", which comes out this summer in theaters (2012).  And I've read that they are working on a script for \\"Thor 2\\".  I hope they don't ruin this super hero by making him all warrior and no integrity in the second movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's really hard, but challenging at the same time. I love it!!!!! There's some I have trouble passing,  but that's all the fun in the game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to have everything I need in one place.  It's a great app and easy to use.
0743219619|3.0|I love PD James and regret that the Adam Dalgliesh series seems to be over.  I had skipped this book in the series, forgetting about it.  Then I happily found it when I was done and was so excited to have one more.  It has been a chore to read.  None of the supporting characters we have come to love are there.  Dalgliesh, recovering from some kind of illness and considering quitting the force, gets a letter from an old friend who is a priest, assigned to something like an assisted-living facility for people with chronic and terminal illnesses.  The environment is dreadful and the patients are flat, depressed, and sick.  Dalgliesh is sort of depressed himself and the whole thing is dreadful and dreary as someone has said.  Even the most sympathetic characters make you feel sad because their situation are so hopeless. Many have been abandoned by their families and are trying to make the best of horrible situations as their lives draw to a close.  I can't wait until I finish.  This book is depressing, but it's PD James and these book are too rare to just give up.  If you haven't read others in the series, just move long and come back when you're desperate for PD James.  OR get it over with and enjoy the rest.  James is a remarkable writer who crafts incredible, incomparable tales of suspense with engaging and interesting characters.  Just not this time.
B004LWZW7E|1.0|\\"In Time\\" is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen! Save yourself the t-he \\"TIME\\" and never watch this terribly written story!<br />Oh and if for whatever reason you decide not to heed my warning, and a 1/4 of the way through the movie when you realize it's the stupidest and most ridiculous POS ever, but you wanna keep watching because maybe they'll start to possibly explain the movie or perhaps give you some background on this pathetic time technology... DON'T!!! This movie explains nothing. These people walk around with literally, their life savings on their arms! Which!! anyone can just grab and take at will. AHHHHH!!!!! are you kidding! The writer couldn't even come up with a sensible way to end the movie, just a 2 man army, about to rob the worlds biggest bank. What the....! I want my \\"TIME\\" back!!! The absolute ridiculousness of \\"In Time\\" repeatedly made me physically and mentally iLL!<br /><br />And to add to my comment here's some more ridiculousness: After a certain age these people dont age or exercise, anything, especially the rich. They're even afraid of going swimming for fear of drowning. But some how she's like a world class sprinter(in heals no less)! oh and they roll a convertible(top down) down a hill and walk away! oh but not before the bad guy simply grabs his arm and just simply starts to steal all his \\"TIME\\" LMFAO!
B0068TL23G|5.0|A fun puzzle with plenty of levels to keep you busy.  I also like the Internet high scoreboard and I'm trying to reach the top score (most are from Japan).
B003O5MO2A|5.0|I was a teenager in Connecticut at the time this LP was released. The critics didn't give it much in the way of praise due to the dearth of new material. If anything people now had documentation that BOC was one of the best live bands of the period.
B006PZBR8S|2.0|Hugh Jackman was paid $9million to act in this movie: maybe he should take that money and hire a better manager that can get him decent scripts.  This was just sad to watch - Jackman, usually a pleasure to watch, decided that his character should be shouting out his every line. Probably to distract the audience from just how bad this movie is.  Zero character development, thinnest plotline ever, stereotypes vs. actual characters, and a truly, horrendously painful russian accent.  The robot, Atom, is very cool though. I would have been happy to watch more of it.  They should have just cut out the \\"estranged father/son bonding\\" stuff, and just put in more robots.  At least THEY could act; which is more than you can say about the actual human actors in this movie.  Please don't spend your $4 on renting this: just wait till it comes out on tv.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is definitely fantastic, top-notch!!  However... it's not for children to see, way too intense at times.  Age 13 and up only!  I absolutely LOVE the ending!!  \\"Where are you men of courage?\\"  It's a WA-HOO moment at the end!
B0052U59F4|5.0|This story was amazing online, and now it's now a great ebook I can read over and over. I've read all three and am now on to review the rest.  :o)
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|This movie is billed as an action movie; but what it is is a big time snooze fest. For a story that's about a guy who is a stunt driver by day, and a get-a-way driver by night, it's absolutely amazing just how BORING(!!!) this dredge of a movie is. Even the opening get away scene (which definitely does set the tone for the entire movie) has no excitement, or anticipation, built into it. The scene was a kin to watching the O.J. Simpson white bronco \\"chase\\" scene. And that comparison is actually an insult to the white bronco chase scene, as at least the bronco chase scene had a sense excitement and anticipation to it. There is absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters/actors. All of the characters are losers and we, the viewers, are given absolutely no reason, what so ever, to care one tiny bit about any of the characters. Ryan Gosling (sp?) tries his best to channel Clint Eastwood's \\"man with no name,\\" and few words, and fails MISERABLY(!!!). This was my first Ryan Gosling movie, and very likely my last. I've always heard what a terrific actor Gosling is suppose to be. Well, based on his performance in this train wreck of a movie, if Gosling is the future of movie making, it's no wonder that Hollywood is floundering so badly.  This is not a movie to waste your time, or your money, on. If you're thinking of buying this terrible excuse of a movie, Please, please, please do yourself a favor, and PUNCH YOURSELF IN THE FACE for even thinking about it.  In fact i punched myself in the face twice, 1 - for watching the movie, and 2 for writing a review about it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty awesome and really challenging to try to unlock new games I hope you decide to try this really awesome awesome game and the only reason it didn't get five stars is because it takes a little while to get enough points to unlock new games
B006PZBR8S|5.0|This is simply a great movie for anyone of any age to watch.  You have the underdog winning against all odds and a father finding his son.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I liked this movie but I really loved the music.  I have it on my computer and in my car.  Would recommend this.  Not a very long CD.
B000035P5E|4.0|Excellent portrayal of a determined Nazi spy.  Sutherland is outstanding as such.  The other roles are played quite well also.
B002SR2PKG|2.0|This review contains information that may spoil your reading of the book!<br /><br />I was really looking forward to reading &#34;It&#34;. Stephen King is a prolific writer of international repute with loads of Hollywood hit films based on his novels. He is undoubtedly an excellent story teller with his flair for description and mood setting flowing off this book's pages.<br /><br />The problem with &#34;It&#34; is that the frequent use of flashbacks in time to describe what happened to the main protagonists in their youth immediately serves to remove any notion of suspense. The reader knows that the main characters reach adulthood safely and so most of the book turns into very well written segments describing the various childhood traumas with no real trepidation felt by the reader. This rapidly turns to boredom as the reader quickly realises that the story will only start to pick up with only about 10% of this large text left to go.<br /><br />This is a shame as the novel directly suffers because of the sequence of its contents. Furthermore, there are consequently huge chunks of text that offer nothing in terms of developing the story and come across as &#34;filler&#34;.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game. makes you want to unlock the new games. fun for kids too. some games are addicting.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I never knew the story behind the Foo Fighters.  I love the way this documentary was produced.  It included interviews and history on all current and previous band members.  Loved it :)
B005KELW26|4.0|If you had read features section of this product before ordering you would have found that it states \\"Durable leather-like finish\\". You should have seen it wasn't leather, don't write a bad review because you can't read...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Well, let's just say I ordered the trilogy and spent about 20 hours reading it, only stopping for sleep. I haven't read a book that I was unable to put down in quite a long time... it will be a series I will read over & over again, and I've only been able to say that for two other authors before. I am looking forward to the movies coming out now to see this come to life. I can only hope the movies will be as good as the books!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|is a great app. many games and more for you or your kids.  I like to play it all the time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Just awesome wish I could get it on my phone,but it Kean unlisted on site. Shame to would share this with everyone everywhere I went. wish they. had a Pc version..
0525423656|2.0|This book was a disappointment for many reasons, the first one ? Matched was a great book, and my expectations were high.  The second biggest disappointment was Cassia's unexpected change of plans.  Half the book she was looking for Ky, doing the bravest things to get to him, putting herself in danger constantly, and once she finds him, all she thinks about is the rising... Really?  Their moments of bliss were cut short because of her and her stubbornness, because it wasn't enough to finally find him, to finally be with him.  The end of the book focuses on Cassia on her quest to find the rising, leaving Ky behind. So much for true love.  There were awkward things throughout the book like Ky picking up this random kid named Eli and protecting him like he was his child. Also this weird weird girl named Indie that up till the end I was still wondering whether she was good  or bad.  Another weird thing was Ky's thoughts about Xander, his jealousy towards him made me think better of Xander and worse of Ky.  Some writers do such a good job getting you into the story, specially if its a sequel. This writer not so much.  I had a very hard time remembering all the details and situations in Matched.  Overall a terrible sequel.
0446585025|2.0|I like Ellen.  I had hoped to learn something about Ellen in reading her book. She begins her book description with \\"I've experienced a lot the last few years and I have a lot to share.\\"<br />Great!  I'll get some insight into this quick, witty, easy-going entertainer. Nope. It's little more than a stand up comedy sketch. If that's what you are in the mood to read - buy it.  If you are looking for some insight into Ellen borrow it from the previous reader and save your money.  This 241 page book is probably under 200 pages of print.  Her \\"Meditation\\" chapter is four blank pages - oops! Sorry, there is one line at the end of the fourth page. Her \\"For the Children - Part 1\\" chapter includes four pages for the children to color - followed by a blank page. Are there funny parts?  Of course.  This is Ellen.  But if you are looking for anything more than Ellen sitting in her car dictating the last thing she thought about, saw, heard, or experienced and putting her clever spin on it, you'll be REALLY disappointed! Bottom line, I was disappointed.  Can I recommend it? Absolutely not.  Save your money - seriously, I'm not kidding!!
B004I3U7US|4.0|I have already forgotten how I came across Anna Calvi, but her band's playing has absorbed me since.  One of the curiosities about Calvi is the odd gulf (perhaps not so odd) between her tiny demeanour and voice offstage in interviews and the powerful space-filling persona when she sings and plays guitar.  I'd recommend anyone to watch some good YouTube concert clips --- but they don't replace the CD.  On the cd Anna's studio voice is clearer, as some of her lyrics are murmured/whispered, which is problematic in a concert setting.  Calvi is a very talented, intelligent, and professional artist, and I hope she copes with the next couple of years of the craziness of tours.  I'd really recommend you see three Youtube items.<br /><br />One: the brief NOISEVOX video interview, of which her last sentence is crucial.<br />Two: watch the proof of the private:stage personae split, in her Le Trianon concert performance of JEZEBEL.<br />Three: her Le Trianon masterpiece, LOVE WON'T BE LEAVING, that lifted a thousand people out of their seats and gave us a guitar solo to remember for ever.<br /><br />This is a mild young woman, barely five feet tall, who played violin at age 6 and at university earned a music degree in violin --- yet wields that 'axe' as excitingly as Hendrix.  I cross my fingers for Calvi's career.  She is unique.

0062082353|5.0|You are a left-wing bed-wetter and naive peacenik who thinks it is possible to wage war without killing<br />Not for you if you are a literary snob in search of the kind of eloquence found by late Victorian writers in WWI<br />You get the idea.<br />This is written, with full credit given, with the assistance of writers who did not get in the way of the story. The story teller comes through, his language, colloquialisms, profanity, and unvarnished honesty. This will probably become the \\"With The Old Breed\\" of the Iraq war. I just wanted to know what it was like to get into the head of a man who actually went through several life changing experiences. Where did he come from? How did that shape him? What made him decide to be a SEAL? What is training really like (just as awful as I have heard)? Did he have a family and how did they manage? How did he end up a sniper and how did he rack up so many kills? All of these questions were answered to my complete satisfaction. All these bloviating reviews about his ego, REAAAALY? Sounds like a lot of envy and effeminate nonsense to me. Yeah libs, there are still some real men out there, willing to risk their lives and willing to do the dirty work that can't be accomplished sitting safely behind a keyboard or the ivy covered walls of a self-important university (want to talk egos?) could not put it down and will be recommending it as one of a long line of combat narratives, Plumb Martin of the revolution, Watkins of the Civil War, and York of WWI.

045122499X|5.0|Usually, sequels are disappointing. This one, following the pillars of the earth, is just as riveting. The story is very different, but the theme is all too familiar to follett's fans. History comes to life while the characters go through suspenseful situations relevant to universal themes. I bought after after resisting for very long, because of the sequel syndrome I suffer from. I dd not regret it. My only regret: there s no sequel to this one!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app was great from the beginning and it's improving all of the time.  it's hard to believe it's free.  I highly recommend it.
B006MQRLSA|2.0|Thrill to the general manager interacting repeatedly with his daughter and ex-wife. Jeer at the late-middle-aged baseball scouts arguing around a table. Stare at the supporting cast talking on phones, sitting at desks, walking down halls, spitting from dugouts, and chatting in locker rooms. Two stars for the fat statistician, who steals all his scenes.
B005V20JKI|2.0|Great concept for a game. There's just one problem: if I'm holding a diredtion button, I have to mash the jump button multiple times before the game figures it out.
0385535139|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"The Litigators.\\"  This is my favorite Grisham book I have read in quite awhile!  It isn't as serious as some of his other novels are, but that made it fun to read.
B004ZJADNQ|1.0|This is the same as the 1996 version. You have to turn your volume way up to hear it clearly. I'll stick with the 2003 Japan release which has amazing sound compared to this retread version.

B004D5HRJA|5.0|A great job was done by the remastering crew in charge of this project. The music is now crystal clear and all evened out.
B0001MDPVS|2.0|I have this weird compulsion to where I feel the need to purchase the clean versions as well as the explicit versions of albums. Sometimes you get neat little bonuses that way; some clean versions will have their radio or TV edit versions where sometimes words are replaced, or on very rare occasions you get a bonus track not on the explicit album. That's why, when I saw both the explicit and edited editions of this album at my local FYE on sale (The clean one for three dollars less), I decided to grab both.<br /><br />Let's start with the first disc - the original album. The original album is solid the whole way through. I remember the first time I heard Illmatic and I wasn't all that impressed with it, thinking that the album was a bit overhyped. After growing up a bit, maturing a little, I see Illmatic as a gritty, rough and somewhat unpolished testament to Nas as an artist just starting to get on the scene and trying to stand out from other artists in his field, and even though this was in the time of CDs where a lot of artists broke past the forty minute time frame of vinyl albums and a lot of albums of the time were starting to average in at about an hour, Nas rocked the scene with a ten track album, one of the tracks only being an intro so in actuality there's only 9 songs. There's so much going on in the songs, in the instrumentals and in the lyrics, and sometimes his words go on to sound less like a rap song but more like a well-written crime novel.<br /><br />The edited version of the first disc does not preserve any of that, as instead of having words just drop out for censoring purposes like a lot of other releases, it reverses all the words against the beat. One of the songs' endings is played backwards for a good fifteen seconds straight - it just ruins the whole mood of the song. I'm sure there's a technical reason for this - maybe the master recordings would have been too troublesome to go back and drop the expletives out of, but it just leaves you with something nobody is really gonna want to listen to. Not to mention that not only are obscenities cut out, but almost any reference to guns or drugs are also played backwards, which - if you've ever listened to this or any other Nas album - you'll know this happens about ever twenty seconds or less. At one point, it censored \\"bullet\\" in a moment where he said something like \\"bullet holes\\" or \\"bullet wounds\\" - in my opinion, not something that really needed censoring.<br /><br />The second disc - the supplemental bonus material. Included are four remixes of songs from the original album, all of them are pretty forgettable. Some of the lyrics, if not all of them, have been rerecorded as you can tell by certain inflections on words that Nas makes that he didn't in the original album version. For one of them, \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\", he actually changes some of the lyrics. It's not bad, but it's not great or really all that necessary. Then there's two new tracks, both of which aren't bad. One song, Nas kind of goes on for a bit too long bragging about how the first he just spit was written during the Illmatic era ten years ago to the point of being obnoxious. Overall though, both songs are worth a listen and really the only highlight of the second disc. On the positive side of the censoring issue as well, all the tracks on this disc have been edited properly. Words either drop out or are played backwards only on the vocal track, keeping the beat in time and not messing with the rhythm.<br /><br />Presentation-wise, the package is okay. Some pictures, what appear to be outtakes of the original Illmatic photos, but that's about it. No liner notes, no retrospective note from Nas about looking back at the album that he references on pretty much every release since - just credits and the same old thank yous from years ago. Not that big of a deal.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't have a copy of Illmatic already, sure - pick up the CD. But, please, even if you like clean versions or are just purchasing the album for a child or something, do NOT bother with this edition. Get the explicit one. If you're buying this to play it on a college radio station or something, do NOT bother. If you're handy with GoldWave, you could make this clean version yourself maybe two hours and it'd still probably sound better. The only good edited portion of this release is the second disc, but the second disc is musically the worst portion of the package. It's like choosing between watching Citizen Kane on a static-filled 19\\" tube TV off a VHS with bad tracking or settling for watching a 55\\" LED TV playing the blu-ray of Ernest Scared Stupid in full 1080p. The pros and cons of each disc nix each other out for the most part leaving you with a product that's almost impossible to enjoy.<br /><br />Just buy the advisory edition. For the cost, you might as well pick up the anniversary edition with these bonus tracks so you can at least hear the two new tracks, but the original album is the main feature. A classic somewhat torn apart in this particular release.
B003B02O0U|5.0|I can't believe everyone did not give this five stars. This book was fantastic. There was danger almost on every page, I almost had to read it sitting up because I kept waiting to see what happens next and who it was happening to.I have read four Grisham books and he has not dissappointed me yet.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a wonderful game. it has lots of varieties. everygame iv played was pretty fun and not too hard.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game to make the time go by if you are going on trips or if you are just bored.  Some of the games are pretty hard and they DO NOT all go by quick.  The only flaw is that after almost every time you play one of the games there are advertisements.  But the rest of the game is GREAT.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This is an amazing compilation of authentic traditional Hawaiian music. Absolutely lovely. Even though I do not understand the words in the songs I am touched by the melodies and the soulful mastery of guitar strings. This music sends you on a journey. A must have CD for anyone who appreciates slack key music.
0452273331|3.0|'The Fountainhead' was Ayn Rand's first major literary success, selling over 6.5 million copies to-date. It was written after Rand read a biography of Frank Lloyd Wright and worked in an architect's office. Its central character is an individualistic young architect who skips (collective) tradition to pursue his own ideas (modernity).<br /><br />Protagonist Howard Roark is an architecture student expelled for refusing to adhere to convention. Moving to New York, Roark his hired, and then fired for insubordination. Another opportunity, and firing follow.<br /><br />Eventually Roark receives a significant commission and accepts - on the grounds the building will be built per his design. Returning from a long yacht trip he finds the finished building deviates from his design, dynamites, it tried for the destruction, and the jury finds him 'Not guilty.'<br /><br />One final assignment - design a skyscraper depicting the supremacy of man.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: It is easy to understand why the manuscript was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted. The book also provides a good example of why fiction writing and reading can often be more trouble than it's worth - vs. a simple, succinct summary of ideas.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I really enjoyed the film. The action was great, and the chemistry between the actors was good. The one complaint was that it was often hard to understand/hear what they were saying. Needs a second viewing. Looking forward to seeing the second one.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|An awesome light weight cooking set for one person! I've used it in high winds and sub freezing temps for cooking/warming food and boiling water and the results are always great. A simple set of instructions would be nice though for the ones not familiar with alcohol stoves.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome and I don't know why people didn't like this game is really good so I give a 5 star
B0054JZC6E|4.0|1/29/12. by Linda   I have only had this app for a few days but it seems as if there is enough here to keep me busy for a while. Some of the games are difficult to maneuver,and I'm too cheap to spend my points yet on different ones. I'll just hang in here and see. what happens. n ae
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I've been waiting for this app since I first got my Kindle Fire. I love how Push email works, the only thing I'm worried about is how much power Push uses up.
0307593312|4.0|This doorstop of a book could actually be used as a weapon; at 925 densely written pages it is that big.  I will say from the start it is the reason I gave it a four instead of a five because it is an intimidating book to wade through if you do not have a relationship with the author's work already. You have to have the commitment coming into it.  1Q84 is a parallel universe that is extremely close to ours: just tweaked.  Our two protagonists, Tengo and Aomame, have a chance encounter when they are ten years old, which forges a love that cannot be fulfilled elsewhere.  They spend the next twenty years travelling through life just getting by emotionally, taking the path of least resistance and never fully engaging with the world.  Their life purpose was introduced to them and everything else pales when compared to it.  In the end, this book was a love story for me. Two lost souls looking for that which would complete them, and when they would not go to the mountain - Aomame chooses to wait until life happens to her (that she would just run into Tengo), and Tengo settles for good enough and pretends he is happy - the universe decides to bring the mountain to them.  Their paths are set up to cross once again. This is hampered by Ushikawa, the third POV character and for me, the personal demon of the heroes. For Tengo he offers money, and then conversely loss just to keep the status quo.  For Aomame he brings sorry and threats into her life; to be exposed insomuch she resorts to hiding herself away from life altogether.  All the supporting cast seem to be offering distractions, stumbling blocks, or just plain outs to keep them from their destinies, from happiness.  The ghost of Tengo's father keeps is an exception. He keeps showing up on their respective doorsteps to accuse them of ultimately being disingenuous, to let them know he is not fooled by their carefully crafted lies of fulfillment.  So what does that mean for us the reader?  Are you living a happy life? Are you fulfilled, striving to find your purpose?  Destiny is what we make it and more often than not the one thing that holds us back is our own fears.  You do not need anyone's permission to be awesome.  Somewhere out there is our own 2Q12, a universe in which we face our fears and be little more honest, a little braver.  A universe where we overcome ourselves and find the happiness that is within all of us, just waiting to enjoyed.  As I said in the beginning, a 5 star review reflects the quality of the story, the beauty of the writing, and the accessibility of the work to an average reader.  Murakami hits the first two out of the park, but he is one of those writers you really do have to work up to, and 1Q84 is a Master's level course.  If you have never read him before I would recommend one of his earlier works like Norwegian Wood or Sputnik Sweetheart.  But definitely put this book on your read before I die list, because ultimately it is not to be missed.  It is Murakami at his best.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A King fan for decades this new novel is more plot driven with a mere sprinkling of King horror. The 900+ pages flew by as i was instantly caught up in the premise of &#34;what if&#34;! Worth every penny! Now my only problem is that my next book will pale in comparison.
B004GYY714|5.0|It an amazing app. I listen to this rather than buying music. My only dislike is that their are a few good radio stations restricted. Better then iheart radio though!
0553801473|2.0|I expected to enjoy this book, and kept doggedly reading along in hopes a plot line which made sense would appear and pull the story together.  It never did. It may be my fault as I did not read the earlier stories in this series. Perhaps I'm out of line thinking that a book should stand alone.  This one starts in the middle of events and ends in the middle of events without resolving anything.  It jumps from character to character, keeping the more unpleasant ones alive and suddenly killing off those which the reader has come to care about, to no particular benefit to the storyline.  I wasted quite a few hours reading this book thinking it would surely improve.  Wrong.  The author has talent but needs to turn his work over to an editor who knows how to weave a tale.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The game is really cool and fun. I like how some games are challenging and how frustrated I get to complete the game.
B004EPZ02A|1.0|I feel my children could have done a better job at making a thriller. Super disappointing just like the other two. The ending made no sense. Do not waste your time or money on this movie.

B003VS0CWY|5.0|I've always loved this music with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, but unfortunately I don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, but I was able to go to a friend's house and see the extras from the film.  Very interesting information about the movie, and about the kids (that have since grown up) that acted in this movie.  What a beautiful country this was filmed in, I would love to go see the mansion where this took place someday, it's on my \\"bucket list\\" (and I have a lot of years).  YOU'LL LOVE IT!
B006DHAT5K|5.0|I was in the mood to watch a romantic comedy Saturday evening, so I put in What's Your Number? starring Anna Faris and Chris Evans.  After seeing a preview for the first time, I had a really good feeling about this film.  Ally (Anna Faris) conspires with her neighbor to track down all of her exes in the hopes that one of them will be Mr. Right and she won't go over having 20 sex partners.  What she didn't count on was falling for her the guy who was helping her with her quest.  Adorable, hilarious and just an all-around feel-good movie.  I loved it and I'm sure all my fellow romance lovers will feel the same.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a free copy of this DVD for review purposes. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.
B0031RS64G|4.0|this book got under my skin. it took me two times to read it. the first attempt, i was lost around a quarter of the way in and just couldn't continue. i'd given up in frustration, so lost. someone said to me that erikson likes to throw the reader into the deep end; to me it was more being dropped into a raging sea. i floundered, reaching for the expected features of a fantasy novel and as i failed to touch them, i was adrift.  i'd put the book aside, bought a new kindle fantasy novel and tried to move on, only to find my thoughts returning to gardens of the moon, wondering. as complex and confusing as it as, it had piqued my interest. i picked it up again.  it isn't an easy read at all. the first half of the novel jumps from one scene to another, crowds of characters are introduced, leaving the reader puzzling over how it fit together. there were a lot of moments when i stopped, trying to remember who a character was or what was being talked about. conversations centred on magic or history that has yet to be explained are intimidating. fantasy books that infodump can irritate me and erikson is the extreme opposite- he tells the reader _nothing_ at all. you have to pick up the threads, pay attention, slowly weave together a complete story. it was difficult, slogging through chapters, sorting out scenes, until, somehow, just over halfway through i realised that this is an incredible book. as it came together, i sat breathless, eyes flicking to my battery level, hoping i wouldn't run out of power before the end of the next chapter. this book needs to be judged as a whole.  the start is rough. it is confusing, frustrating, at times almost nonsensical. this is a book requiring stamina, stubborness from a reader. if you endure and battle through, the novel will reward your efforts.  there are definite flaws. by the end i could have called a rollcall of characters, rattling off their names, but i knew very little about them. there was so little insight into character. i didn't really _like_ any of the characters. i didn't know them well enough to judge them. characters were more roles than people- they were there to perform a function. at times, telling them apart was so hard. almost all characters spoke in the same way, making them hard to differentiate in conversation. i was reading the kindle edition and didn't realise that there was a full cast list at the end. i got through without it and managed but i think that quick reference could have made it easier to know who was who.  when i'd finished, i felt satisfaction equal to the amount of energy i'd put into the reading. this isn't a perfect book but when i was done, my first thought was to pick up the next in the series. i'm not sure if the writing style can last for multiple volumes but still it is there, under my skin, that need to puzzle and struggle through even more just to see where the complex concept is really leading me. i will be reading more of erikson.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is a very good app. I enjoy playing it very good graphics and good game play. It is a very booms app and I recommend it
B001HN690O|3.0|There are few movies in general, and perhaps even fewer animated films with the right balance.  Kung Fu Panda 2 is certainly not one of them.  The problem with this film is that it's trying too hard to be funny, and comes across as irritating and goofy instead.  There are several scenes where there are opportunities to show emotions, but they are quickly turned into stupid jokes.  It's worth seeing, but don't expect a masterpiece, and it's definitely not Oscar material, despite being nominated.
B0001WTWCO|1.0|I won't rant, so I'll say it simply. This movie sucked. I saw \\"Chariots of Fire\\" in my late teens and like that better than this one viewed at an older, more mature age. This is the kind of movie the critics would fawn over-it's pretentious, over indulgent, and slower than glacier movement during the ice age. You give the Academy an English accent, and they need a cigarette after the flick. None of those things individually makes a bad movie. It's the way all are done together. I seriously think people liked it either because that was the trend to appear to understand film, or they were bought in by the sappy TV trailers that alone had women grabbing their hankies. The only thing worse than the movie, was watching the crowd view it. Years after this won, only \\"The Blind Side\\" came so close to insulting the intelligence of movie goers by disguising itself as quality film, backed by a good marketing team. But this is still the King of Crap for award winners. It's bad in general, but it has no place in the \\"Best\\" anything categories.
B00005N6KG|4.0|This works much better for me while running than earbuds which were always falling out.  Very light weight. - can't even tell you're wearing it.

B004GYY714|4.0|Easily the best radio app I've seen. I replaced Slacker Radio and Scanner Radio with TuneIn as it does everything that both apps do better, and without any of the artificial limitations placed on most free apps. It certainly encouraged me to purchase the paid version. There is also no intrusive / annoying advertising.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-- Wide selection of Radio stations, emergency bands, online streams, etc.<br />-- No annoying advertising.<br />-- No features advocating the paid version (features not available in the free version are taken out, and don't get in your way or pop up asking you to upgrade).<br />-- UI is well done, and always keeps the currently playing station handy at the bottom so you can stop and start it quickly.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-- None that I can honestly list as cons. It would be nice to be able to record radio, however, as this is in the paid version I can't honestly list it as a con.
B0068TL23G|3.0|I was just beginning to really enjoy the game, but then on the fourth (or so) time I tried to play, the game wouldn't open for me (Kindle Fire). If I can redownload from the Cloud, I will reinstall it and try again.  The game was not challenging at all until Level 9, and I was working on (stuck on) Level 12 when it quit opening.  Neat idea for a timekiller.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|After downloading the free version of TuneIn Radio I was very impressed, and decided to buy the Pro version. The only difference that I can see is the ability to record streams for later viewing, but for the price point I don't mind in the slightest as the feature works very well (I have yet to encounter any of the problems listed in the 1 and 2 star reviews).<br /><br />The things I said in my review of the free app also apply to TuneIn Radio Pro: \\"I replaced Slacker Radio and Scanner Radio with TuneIn as it does everything that both apps do better. ... There is also no intrusive / annoying advertising.\\"<br /><br />Device Used: Kindle Fire<br /><br />Pros:<br />-- Wide selection of Radio stations, emergency bands, online streams, podcasts, etc.<br />-- No annoying advertising.<br />-- Free version available if you don't want to pay for recording.<br />-- UI is well done, and always keeps the currently playing station handy at the bottom so you can stop and start it quickly.<br />-- Ability to record streams DVR style for later playback, or for rewind capabilities.<br />-- Can be used without signing up for a TuneIn Account (though if you have one, it will connect and put it to use).<br /><br />Cons:<br />-- None that I have found. Works like a charm.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I wanted this games so bad so I got it and it is not worth $0.99. so it dapends I still play it I just thought that it would be hater than it turned out to be.

B005PTQPU0|1.0|I sort of liked *a bit* the first and last songs and the Elton duet, though I hate the man.  Overall ... well ... it sounds like pointless crap. When reviews are as meandering as some of the ones here are, you know the ones that claim they like this, don't really know what they're listening to.  Dislike the deeper voice too.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Tony Bennett still has it.  Though I don't like it quite as much as his Duets (thus 4 instead of 5 stars), this album is a pleasure to listen to and puts me in a good mood any time I do.
B005K17RU0|3.0|certainly could be better but its ok! app needs work bug its not Bad for now. looking forward to upgrades.
B000091VNH|5.0|There are many great songs on this album.  I want to focus on a song that didn't get much press, but carried with it to the album name, \\"No Need to Argue\\".  What I get from this song is the let down when you find out that someone comes clear on their sexual orientation.  A understandable letdown happens when you finally realize that someone is gay.  Zombie is a unique song that is hard and soft at the same time.  I enjoy all the songs on this album.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am addicted to this game. I just wish the locked games didn't cost so many game coins because it gets boring playing games that you've already beat over and over to collect more coins.
B0012GMV58|5.0|Continuing to develop the jazz-fusion style first evident on `Caravanserai', this 1973 release is a mature and polished piece of work with probably the most pure-jazz feel of all Santana's 40 years of musical output. `Welcome' was Santana's fifth studio album in as many years.<br /><br />On first pass, the album seems to embody a laid-back style to the point of being `easy listening'. But listen again: what you discover is a finely crafted work of artistry with a variety of interesting compositions, exemplary production values and never a note out of place. This is a mature work, aimed at a more discerning and mature audience than the (excellent in other ways) band's previous outings.<br /><br />Some new blood worked with Carlos on these studio sessions, notably Alice Coltrane (widow of the great John Coltrane) on piano, and John McLaughlin, fresh from working with Miles Davis and his own virtuoso fusion band The Mahavishnu Orchestra: i.e. musicians steeped in jazz and with a strong contemporary jazz pedigree. Gregg Rolie had by now departed the band, and a trio of established jazz singers are employed for different numbers: Leon Thomas, Brazilian impresario Flora Purim, and Wendy Haas. The soundscape also deploys tasteful cameos of soprano sax, flute and restrained orchestral strings. All combine to give the album its clean, jazz-fusion sound.<br /><br />The standout track on the album for fusion fans is `Flame Sky', an intense 11.33 minute, 2-part instrumental tour-de-force in minor keys (there's a key-change in the middle to initiate the second part) with Carlos and John McLaughlin playing off each other with exemplary virtuosity  to build a crescendo wall-of-sound climax (nb if you are a fan of McLaughlin's MO studio sessions from 1971-73 and you've never heard `Flame Sky' you're gonna love it). Otherwise, Carlos's own playing is restrained in scope; following the maxim \\"less is more\\" he makes just the right contribution to highlight each number, but doesn't overdo it.<br /><br />Post-2003 re-releases of `Welcome' feature the additional track `Mantra', a nice instrumental jam between Carlos, Tom Coster and Mike Shrieve, which you won't find on earlier issues.<br /><br />Altogether a great repeat-play album, still fresh after almost 40 years: a beautiful sound for all occasions.rdo it.<br /><br />Post-2003 re-releases of `Welcome' feature the additional track `Mantra', a nice instrumental jam between Carlos, Tom Coster and Mike Shrieve, which you won't find on earlier issues.<br /><br />Altogether a great repeat-play album, still fresh after almost 40 years: a beautiful sound for all occasions.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 3/22/11**  It's pretty useless to review a Britney Spears album for its artistic merits. Like so many pop singers before and after her, Spears is better looked upon as a muse for some of the best commercial songwriters and producers of her time. Lucky for me, many of those behind-the-scenes folks are working in Sweden. And from that standpoint, the album's best tracks all sound like standouts from four different Swedish bands/artists (namely Alcazar, Robyn, the Tough Alliance and Tove Styrke). This alone makes the album a pleasant surprise.  1. Till The World Ends - I really blasted this song a couple weeks ago, but I've gotta admit that somehow it's grown on me. Some tracks just take longer. Still nowhere near the best songs on here, but it's a nice opener. The chants remain the standout. 8/10  2. Hold It Against Me - It's the exact opposite with this one. The more I hear it, the more I tire of it, which ends up bringing it about level with the first track, rating-wise. It doesn't have quite enough melody to give it staying power. 8/10  3. Inside Out - This one just isn't hitting me. I appreciate the sound that they're going for, but the melody's completely underwhelming and the production plodding. 6/10  4. I Wanna Go - Now THIS is more like it. This is hands down, no question, the album highlight and could be a monster single for her. Like Madonna's Hung Up a few years ago, it harnesses a flawless, swirling dance beat. (for those keeping track, it's also the \\"Alcazar\\" song of the four standouts) 10/10  5. How I Roll - Stupid title, but another standout. It's got the kind of quirky electro attitude that you'd expect from an artist like Robyn. And although Robyn does this kind of stuff so much better, this is quite enjoyable in its own right. 9/10  6. (Drop Dead) Beautiful (ft. Sabi) - This is very much a filler track. Everything, from the heavily processed vocals to the dull production/melody is pretty shallowand forgettable. Not horrible by any means, but it doesn't leave any impression. 6/10  7. Seal It With A Kiss - And we're back to interesting territory. There are parts of the chorus (the background vocals) that sound like the Tough Alliance (a Swedish indie-electro band). It gives this song a really cool vibe. Couple that with a great melody and hook and you've got something very special. 10/10  8. Big Fat Bass (ft. Will.i.am) - Ugh. Every time Will.i.am features on/produces a track for another artist it's guaranteed to be one of the weaker/trendier/more derivative songs on the album. This is actually more interesting than I expected, but too repetitive and obnoxious to warrant too many repeat listens. 6/10  9. Trouble For Me - I can't begin to describe how much I'm sick of the David Guetta-esque beats that open this track. It's so overdone and ruins what could be a decent song. It's not a very pleasant listen. 6/10  10. Trip To Your Heart - This shows off the potential of what this album could have been. It's lush, mature and endlessly melodic. It reminds of of the experimental tracks that Spears recorded with BT for her third album (though they never actually made it onto the cd). By far the prettiest song on the album. I wish she'd record more like this instead of chasing trends. This is something I'd imagine Tove Styrke singing. 9/10  11. Gasoline - This is probably the poppiest song on here and the most like her previous work. Luckily, it's a great example of that classic Spears sound that so many people grew up with. This would have fit perfectly on her second or third album. 8/10  12. Criminal - An odd flute-assisted track with a slower tempo, bubblegum melody and rebellious lyrics. It's one of the standouts, though it doesn't necessarily fit with the tracks that come before it. 9/10  Album Grade: 7.9/10
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Many hidden object games can seem a little silly as well as fun because there really is no reason you are looking for the items. Sure, in Paranormal Agency you are sometimes looking for a phone and have to find 20 random objects in an absurdly cluttered room beforehand but the paranormal aspect really lends credence to many searches.
B002UXRH10|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 11/16/09**  Well this is certainly different, isn't it? Amidst all the speculation and anticipation, Rihanna's gone and recorded an album of sparse, emotionally dark pop music without an obvious single in sight. It's easily the strongest statement (and album) of her career so far.  1. Mad House - An intro, so I won't give it a number grade. It's somewhat frustrating, because this would have made an interesting full song and should have been one. Also, it doesn't segue into the next track very well at all. As a statement of intent, though, it works.  2. Wait Your Turn - This is the album's \\"buzz single.\\" I was instantly taken with the chorus, especially the way it opens up the harsher, less melodic verses. The braggadocio before she drops her guise mid-album. 9/10  3. Hard (ft. Jeezy) - A smart single choice in this hip-hop obsessed country, I didn't think I'd like this as much as I do. It's got a tough sound, and Rihanna spends more time rapping than singing, really. Another attitude-driven song. 9/10  4. Stupid In Love - The first overtly Chris Brown related song, this has the classic Rihanna ballad feeling to it. It could have easily been on her last album. The big difference comes lyrically, and the lyrics here are very nice. 9/10  5. Rockstar 101 (ft. Slash) - Probably the weakest link on the album. The bombast is all there, but it lacks a real melody. It's meant as a posturing song, but with Slash on guitar, I feel like she could have come up with something more dramatic and classic. 7/10  6. Russian Roulette - The soaring guitar solo that opens this fits perfectly after the last track, and kicks off the string of songs that make this album such a triumph. The chorus to this is still quite good, though it's more of a mood piece than a smash single. 9/10  7. Firebomb - One of the absolute standouts, Firebomb features a soaring melody, chugging pop guitar and lyrics that are at once very personal and totallyuniversal. If released as a single, this could do wonders for her career. It's beautiful. 10/10  8. Rude Boy - Taking a cue from Beyonce, this trancey, r&b-flavored uptempo packs more of a punch than I realized on first listen. It does slightly break up the theme of the album's second half, but it's one of the catchiest tracks on the album. 9/10  9. Photographs (ft. will.i.am) - This is what the Black Eyed Peas would sound like if they weren't annoying. It reminds me of a sped-up version of Cheryl Cole's 3 Words, which is a very good thing. The track has a subtle, shimmery feel, complimented by will.i.am's more aggressive rap. 10/10  10. G4L - A moody revenge fantasy, this is incredibly dark material. It's not overly concerned with melody, but that's okay. It's pretty compelling regardless. The lyrics are over-the-top ridiculous, but delivered in a truly chilling way. 9/10  11. Te Amo - Already a number one hit in Brazil, this is melodically one of the strongest and poppiest songs on the album. Lyrically, it tells the story of another woman coming on to Rihanna, and Rihanna's attempt to let her down gently. The synth after the chorus is gorgeous and very trancey. 10/10  12. Cold Case Love - The late-album highlight, this Timberlake-penned track is nothing short of extraordinary. Beginning with a dramatic, organ-backed classic rock melody, by the time this is over it's exploded into a full-on epic. The drums, when they finally come in, are spine-tingling. The lyrics, too, are genius. 10/10  13. The Last Song - Flowing naturally from the last track, this continues the rockier, dramatic sound. The lyrics here are very dark, presumably detailing a suicide, or at the very least a death. Extremely atmospheric and moody. 10/10  Album Grade: 9.3/10
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun to play and I really enjoy playing it because there is loads of games that fit my liking but this one stood out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003VYAVGA|5.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 11/18/10**  I've never listened to an entire Take That album before -- not in their 90's heyday, not during their 00's resurgence. And before I heard the lead single from this, I wasn't too excited about a new album (even one with Robbie Williams). So take this review for what it is: the thoughts of a casual (relatively indifferent) fan. What I can say for sure, though, is that producer Stuart Price has certainly had a good year. If his 2010 album work was a trilogy, this would be the epic conclusion. It's as much his record as it is Take That's.  1. The Flood - The band have enjoyed a string of massive hit ballads over the past few years, but it seems that it was all building up to this. It's an incredibly majestic, redemptive song. The perfect comeback, produced to utter perfection. 10/10  2. SOS - This is where the album takes a startlingly (excellent) turn. It's a full-on paranoid dance track -- not what I would've expected from the new Take That. The interchange between vocalists works wonders and this again supports my theory that any song with SOS in the title is bound to be a good one. 9/10  3. Wait - A string-laden midtempo with more of an r&b sound to it. I like how this carries on the electronic elements, but it's one of my least favorite on the album. It sounds a little too mainstream compared to the more experimental aspects of other tracks. 8/10  4. Kidz - This is a big, apocalyptic track... a cross between Muse and the We Will Rock You musical. It's got a cast-of-thousands sound to it, with a heavy glam beat, dramatic stomps, and a sneering Robbie vocal. Excellent. 10/10  5. Pretty Things - This couldn't possibly sound any more like Bowie. It's a languid, distorted music box ballad that didn't hit me on first listen but grows each time I hear it. It's more a solo Robbie song than anything, but it's a great one. 9/10  6. Happy Now - We've now entered the second half of the album, which is strongerthan the first. This kicks it off quite soaringly. It transforms from a tricky verse to a pulsing disco chorus. It's the most immediate song on the album. 10/10  7. Underground Machine - Less instant, but just as impressive. This is one of the more experimental sounds for them -- big glam swagger, industrial guitar riff and a loopy falsetto chorus. Like a lot of songs here, it's basically a Robbie solo track, but unlike anything you've heard from him before. 10/10  8. What Do You Want From Me - Though I would've chosen a different vocalist for this, there's no denying the strength of this song. It's like Fire With Fire part two. It's got that ballad vs. dance track sound that Stuart Price produces so well. It builds to something pretty epic at the end. 10/10  9. Affirmation - A perfect seque from the last track, this has quickly grown into one of my favorites. It's got a dramatic prog sound to it, with Bowie-esque verses that build into an explosive chorus. I'm amazed that this is even the same band as the Take That of the nineties. 10/10  10. Eight Letters - The big closing ballad. The lyrics are highly self-referential and autobiographical. It's probably closest to the sound of the previous two albums and seems to utilize the entire band more fully than on most of the album, which is fitting given the meaning behind the song. 9/10  11. Flowerbed - Technically a bonus track, but it's on every version of the album so it'll feature in my review. This tender ballad opens with processed vocals for the first minute or so before revealing a simple, delicate melody. It feels a little unfinished, almost like an interlude, but it's certainly pleasant. 7/10  Album Grade: 9.2/10

B002T45VX6|4.0|**Originally posted on \\"#1 Hits From Another Planet\\" - 10/14/09**  Shakira hasn't disappointed me yet, and her winning streak continues with her new album, out this month. It's not the electro-dance masterpiece it could have been, but there's still plenty to love.  1. She Wolf - What to say about this song that hasn't been said already? It was a ballsy choice for a single, high on quirkiness and riding a disco beat that sounds like nothing else on American radio right now. I'm glad to see that the gamble paid off. This will be remembered as one of her signature moments. 10/10  2. Did It Again - At times this is more a series of grunts than an actual song, but the disparate elements do come together quite nicely. On first listen I didn't like it so much, and it's not nearly as strong or memorable as She Wolf, but I like it now. Very catchy. 8/10  3. Long Time - This is back to the Hips Don't Lie sound, and it's not really anything special or different, but it is fun, uptempo Shakira. 7/10  4. Why Wait - This one mixes sounds from tracks one and three, covering all of the bases. It's a strong album track, but definitely not single potential. It sounds more like the dance album Shakira had professed interest in making. 8/10  5. Good Stuff - A slower track with a strong melody in the chorus and more of a chanting verse. The middle eight is especially cool, here, and I love the instrumentation in the chorus. 9/10  6. Men In This Town - Along with the title track, this is definitely the pinnacle of the album. Pure electropop cheese with a brilliant melody and hooks upon hooks. This should definitely be a single. It feels very different than what people might expect from Shakira. 10/10  7. Gypsy - Another strong midtempo track. The lyrics and melody fit her perfectly. This song does a 180 from the last one, which makes it stand out in the context of the album. 9/10  8. Spy (ft. Wyclef Jean) - I don't know what to think about this one. Parts are very annoying, but the beatis quite good and the melody's pretty strong, too. It's an interesting experiment, but gets kind of old as it chugs along. 7/10  9. Mon Amour - This feels very much like it doesn't fit with the rest of the album. It's way rockier than anything else, though in a decidedly new wave/80's way. I feel like the production could be stronger, but the chorus is very nice and I love the hand claps. 8/10  10-12. Spanish versions of album tracks, so I won't review.  Album Grade: 8.4/10

B005ORVN1Y|4.0|My review for the five CDs + 1 DVD-A contained in Sector 3. The intent with purchasing these new 2011 remasters is to sell off my 1997 discs.  Signals: Without a doubt, the best sounding release of this classic since vinyl. The instruments are much clearer; Neil's drums are in unison on a sound dynamics level with Geddy's bass and Alex's guitar. Finally a great remaster! So long 1997 CD!  Signals 5.1: Ummm...what the heck is this!? The box advertised Signals in 5.1 DVD Audio. It's one of the main reasons I bought this set. Instead of this, what I'm hearing are revisioned, alternate outtakes. I shouldn't be so negative; these revised tracks aren't bad, far from it! But I wanted SIGNALS 5.1, not Signals v2 5.1! I need to get better acquanted with this one, perhaps. Once the disappoinment wears off, I will revisit this again. But buyers beware: if you are expecting the original 1982 classic on the DVD-A disc, your ears won't be happy.  Grace Under Pressure: Of the five discs in this set, changes with this remaster is not as noticable on any level that I can detect. I may even lean towards the 1997 remaster edging out the 2011 release in overall clarity. The '97 CD has a bit more punch in bass and low end sound, while the Sector version sounds ever so slightly thin and reserved. Another way to describe it is the '97 CD sounds like the band is in your living room, while the 2011 remaster sounds like they are down the hall with the door open. I read on various websites that the team involved with the remaster had to use 192khz backup tapes, due to issues with the original P/G tapes degrading (sad news). I'm uncertain what master was used for the P/G 97 release, but from the sound of it, my guess is it had to be better source material, if not the original master tapes. I will not be selling my '97 P/G CD.  Hold Your Fire: A fantastic remaster here, bordering on revelatory. Be aware before buying that a few of the tracks are alternate versions, and were not originally released on HYF in 1987. Some string arrangments and other subtleties are present that were not on the original album. These updates are not bad though, in fact many are very well done. The song's foundation are not changed in the least, only some bits and pieces were added, I assume to bring more color to the tracks. The changes should not distract the listener; only a purist will have issues here. But again, this is a marvelous remaster. Since the music contained on the 2011 release differs from the '97 remastered release, I will not be selling my HYF CD.  Power Windows: WOW, this one is off the charts awesome! A brilliant remaster and quite possibly the best CD in the set on a technical level. What else is there to say.. you need to hear this! Bye bye, 1997 CD!  A Show Of Hands: Brilliant! A stellar upgrade from the 1997 release. This 2011 upgrade sounds more bold, is not as muted as the '97 release and is one of Rush's more underrated LIVE CDS in their catalogue. I actually like versions of songs on this CD better when compared to the studio tracks. See ya, 1997 remastered CD!  I hope this helps with your decision, if you are sitting on the fence. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase of this set and will pickup Sector 2 soon. Sector 3 earns a solid 4 stars from this long time Rush fan.

1439156816|5.0|I found this book concise, informative and a joy to read.  It gave me a great deal of useful information on writing - from keeping style simple, to not over-plotting, to my personal favourite, the brief chapter defining writing as telepathy (you just have to read it)!  Anyway, if you like to write, I recommend you buy this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Just as the title of the review states, this is *the* best weather on the kindle market. First, it is well integrated within the Fire OS UI as to not bug you when you use it. This especially true since it uses the standard notifier menu for updates. Second, it does not bug out when you have no WiFi spot connected, so it will only show the most recent update until you get online for an update.
030788743X|5.0|The answer to the question is \\"yes.\\" I remember when the first Pong game came out. We were enthralled, and we had no idea what would soon follow. Pac Man, Joust, Asteroids, Dungeons and Dragons, the list is endless. Ready Player One takes you on a nostalgic journey through the history of these wonderful games, placing them in an amazing story about a techie nerd who defeats a mammoth conglomerate and takes home winnings beyond imagination.  Wade lives in a futuristic world where few own everything and many scrabble for what's left (sound familiar?). Wade spends most of his time in a virtual world, where he attends school, meets others in virtual chat rooms, and becomes an expert game player.  The wealthy owner of the largest virtual arena passes away, leaving his fortune inside his domain. There are clues to follow, but once the gates are opened the fun begins. Wade, his compatriots and competitors, must solve gaming puzzles to advance through the maze. A huge corporation has armies of techies grinding away at the code, and it appears they will overtake Wade and his small team of exceptionally gifted gamers. The ending includes a twist that is worth the entire book. Can't wait to see the movie!  Kevin Gerard - Author of Diego's Dragon, Book One: Spirits of the Sun
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this game is wonderful and challenging... it is great tot times when you have to wait or when you are just bored. I would definitely. recommend.
014241722X|3.0|I've never read a Grisham novel before but was anxious to read this one when I saw it. I teach 7th graders so this one was in my school library. I did enjoy it. It was not as suspenseful as I'd hope and the ending was indeed an abrupt ending. I see he has another couple books in the series but I doubt they will include an ending to the first one. Oh well. Not sure if I'm going to try them or not. It was, however, an easy read and the writing flowed well.
0374275637|2.0|Kahneman's basic idea seems pretty clearly correct. The work is important but this book is terrible.<br /><br />This would best be described as a popularized version of his work. He gives you 'tests' and then tells you with misplaced certainty what your results were. Then he goes on to tell you how your results confirm his theory. And if your results differ, he ignores you.<br /><br />Due to the considerable repetitiveness of the examples, being ignored becomes irritating at best.<br /><br />There are also examples where Kahneman reveals his own biases and doesn't seem to recognize that.<br /><br />The 'cab' problem begins this way: \\"A cab was involved in a hit-and-run accident at night.\\" He goes on to assume what is only his own assumption that it was the cab that left the scene of the accident. But it could just as easily been a second vehicle, not a cab, which left the scene. Nowhere does Kahneman explicitly state that it was the cab that 'ran.'<br /><br />Apart from showing his bias against cab drivers (I am not one,) Kahneman just isn't paying much attention to his examples.<br /><br />In this same example, he chides you if you don't apply Bayes' theorem in calculating your answer. Sure, I studied Bayes' theorem 20 years ago but haven't looked at it since. So, no, I don't immediately remember how to apply it to this example. Kahneman gives us the result but doesn't help us with the theorem.<br /><br />I'm 30% into the book and I'm not sure I'm going to finish it. It teaches too little and offends too much.

1569242739|3.0|I like this book for a number of reasons. It's handy in a pinch. If you're vegan and you want to make cupcakes, you don't have to search the Internet for a recipe or convert one from another book. There are plenty of flavors of cupcakes to choose from and almost as many frosting choices included in the book. But, honestly, I have had a lot of mixed success with these recipes. Overall, the actual cupcake parts of my concoctions taste okay. None have been fantastic. The vanilla cupcake texture is on the spongy side. The flavor of the carrot cake cupcakes is pleasant, but the texture is crumbly and airy. You can taste the flax in the peanut butter cupcakes. The chocolate recipe could definitely be richer in flavor. Actually, the vegan chocolate chip muffin at Whole Foods is more chocolaty! The frosting recipes are really good, but too sweet for my taste. I can't recommend another vegan cupcake book, though, so if you aren't interested in converting other recipes this really is your best choice. If you're not an experienced vegan baker this is probably your best place to start as well. I can, however, say that the authors' cookie book ([[ASIN:160094048X Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar: 100 Dairy-Free Recipes for Everyone's Favorite Treats]]) is GREAT.
B00514HDNW|4.0|Reviewing a book by comparing it to its movie is not the ideal thing to do, but I did watch the Will Smith movie first, which itself was not the first movie adaptation of the book - The Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man both were based on the novel and came out more than 30 years ago, and only more than a year later read the novel.<br /><br />Robert Neville's character in the book is more complex, more prone to weaknesses, and more fallible than the movie character.<br /><br />In a post-apocalyptic world where a bacteria has killed most of the world's human population and turned the survivors into blood seeking vampires that stalk Neville's house at night, Robert Neville must live and survive, though seemingly without purpose. He frequently succumbs to bouts of drinking, frustration, and rage. He wages a lone, sometimes gruesome, and what often looks like a pointless battle against the vampires. Company comes in the form of a dog, that brings back to him a modicum of humanity he had long forgotten he had, and then in the form of a young woman who has just lost her husband to the vampires. The end is bleak and quite unlike the movie.<br /><br />This book is supposed to have inspired such legends, so to say, of the field as Stephen King and Dean Koontz. Not to mention its influence on a whole genre of gore-filled zombie infested movies of the 70s and 80s.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I have the audible.com version and have watched a number of video lectures by Dr.Krauss generously available on youtube and this individual is doing a job well \\"above and beyond\\".  You will enjoy all the neuron growing as your brain opens all new departments as you take in some insights about the \\"Real\\" (?? :-)<br />I cannot even come to adequate terms here but we could say our Universe as it exists in \\"Superspace\\".<br />The questions a Cosmologist who comes from Particle Physics might consider are truly astonishing not to say mind blasting.  What scientists a trillion years might think is just one!<br />A great bonus is Dr. Krauss reads his own book for you at audible.com making for an unbeatable presentation!<br /><br />Wonder-full and you may never look at a blank wall the same way again.
0439023513|1.0|I've been reading a lot of reviews for this book on here, most of them hating this book. I'm just going to do a quick review of this, since there are already a lot of reviews here similiar.<br />Mockingjay was flat out dull. Lifeless. Katniss is like a avox; she just seems to do stuff for other people, never truly doing what her heart wants, and that's too bad. I never really liked Katniss, but she was much better in the original HG than here.<br />Another thing this book had trouble with was the whole concept of war. This book tried to be exciting, but honestly, I could care less about Katniss and her not very deep speeches. \\"We burn, you burn with us.\\" Ok, not exactly mouth dropping for me. Also, back on Katniss being like a avox, her going from place to place, thinking about Peeta, war, Gale, family, death, what not. Collins just doesn't make it work. At some points it seems hard to even continue reading because of how boring all these speeches get.I think what bothered me most in this book was Prim's death. We all remember back in HG when Katniss volenteered for tribute, taking the place of her little sister. That was nice and all, but it doesn't seem to matter now. Prim got to live a little longer, but she gets killed young anyways in Mockingjay. Hopeless, anybody? Yeah.<br />Then we finally get to the end of the book. Its not the usual happily ever after, its more like Katniss is basically zoned out. I was expecting something bigger from her, but she doesn't take notice. Of course.<br />All and all, just read the first book. Sure, go onto the second book, just don't read this one. This book made me feel \\"meh\\" about the entire series. Honestly, let's just be happy it ends here.
B003ATPRWO|4.0|one thing i can say about this book is that it is fast paced and generally unputdownable. however, it feels like there is something missing from the book, and many events seem to go a little too fast. i think the author should work on his writing style to make uglies a little more unforgetable. maybe it was just because i had just finished the book thief, but nevertheless, the plot was intriguing enough so that i will continue the series and hope it gets better!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its just like the one I had on my PC mammy years ago. It passes the time &amp; runs perfectly on my tablet. Highly recommend it.
B00351YEVC|4.0|the boy in the striped pyjamas is a very good book. the plot is well thought out and it is hard to put down. the only problem for me was that since it was in the perspective of a nine year old boy, the writing is a bit childish. therefore i would only recommed this book to early highschool years. it is also a way to introduce the holocaust to youths. i also think the ending could have been way more detailed, but since its from brunos point of view, the writing is too basic. however, the story lineis definitely a aviour of the book. a tear jerker!
B0058VW36U|2.0|everytime i try to purchase the app it tells me that there was an error trying to purchase the app then it tells me to try again! what should i do?
B003R50F00|5.0|The Book Thief is by far the best book i have ever read in my life. it is life changing and written so, so beautifully. it is narrated by death, which at first i thought was a little weird. but then you see death to be kind. he takes the reader on a journey about a book thief-a young girl incredibly swayed by words themselves. it is set in Nazi Germany, in Munich.<br />i truly recommend this book, definetely for young adults to be introduced to the horrors of world war two, and even more for adults. it is definitely a life-changer. and a tear jerker, at that.<br />it is so amazing. it's a book for reading lowly, savouring each word

B0015AARJI|1.0|I'm pretty sure the item is a fake.  The battery doesn't last 2 hours and it matches many of the criteria listed here:    [...]    At first I thought it just \\"took a while to break in\\", but after several months I decided to do some research.  It took about 10 minutes to discover that I'd been duped.  Very surprised and disappointed.  I will contact Amazon to see if they will help.    Be careful!!!
B004LROUW2|3.0|I went back to read some of the other reviews, to see if I had missed something.  Sadly, I had not.  Like many of the others, I've been a fan of Murakami's for years.  Started with Dance, Dance, Dance, went on to Hard-Boiled Wonderland, Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, etc.  Actually, I enjoy when the characters are cooking and/or doing mundane things, because I know that things will soon twist out of true, and the story is on. But, this story wandered for too long.  Even when he leaves things unanswered, Murakami leaves you with some clue as to how things might progress.  This work just fumbles around, with no real sense of denouement, and ends with a feeling of, \\"That's it?  All that time for this?\\"  I had heard that there was a bit of a chance that Murakami might win the Nobel Prize this year.  If the Committee was paying attention, they'll wait a while after this one.  Which is a shame, because he certainly deserves it.  But, not for this.  For all its size, this will stand as a lesser work.

B00000K3CR|5.0|Again, Tom Hanks from the mid 80's to the early 00's was TOTALLY awesome.  He's really good in a sincere, dramatic role.  Of course this movie is proof that he's a pretty darn good comedian too!  Ah, being a kid again.  Wouldn't you love to go back to your early teenage years?  Yes, you would.  Rediscover what the world was like at such a young age without worrying about bills, your health or your future?  Back when friendships were in full swing, and relationships seemed like a thing that would never happen to you.  Back then your only *real* worries were turning in your homework assignments so Mrs. Raymond wouldn't get upset.  Oh who am I kidding- I never grew up!  I'm living this fantastic life every single waking moment, haha!  All joking aside (though I'm not actually joking about that- I'm a little kid in a grown mans body!) Big is a welcome addition to any movie library.  The glowing 5-star reviews you see here on amazon are no mistake ladies and gentlemen- this film will have you wishing you were young again.  I have nothing but overwhelmingly positive things to say about Big.  I just love watching a 30-year old man (the same age as me, coincidentally) having the absolute time of his life acting childish, and totally enjoying himself.  You will see Tom Hanks playing pinball and getting into hissy fits, having fun with a pinball machine, and squirting silly string at his best friend.  Of course the storyline is that he works for a company that comes up with toy inventions, and well... isn't THAT a fitting job for a child living inside a full grown mans body?  haha  He finds a woman at his workplace and they hit off a great relationship.  He actually manages to get the woman to loosen up and stop acting so darn serious all the time!  Have some fun!  Jump on the trampoline with the lights on and the window blinds open!  Before any of these major changes take place however, the character of Tom Hanks finds a magical wishing machine while visiting a carnival withhis family.  Well this machine surely made one of his wishes come true- to be big.  Now the ending... I guess it's a pretty good ending.  Perhaps it felt a little undeveloped/anticlimactic for my tastebuds, because I was assuming he'd go to sleep, wake up and be young again.  Nopers!  Overall, enjoy Big.  Being a kid again... ah, what a trip!

0321701763|5.0|Yes, this is very useful for those of us who only remember playing with Photoshop in the 90's...yes, the 90's.  This is a step by step, lesson by lesson class with photos on DVD that you actually use in the lessons.  For those who need the basics step by step this is five stars.  Those competent in earlier Photoshop versions might want to get a different book.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Yes, there are plenty of laughs in this movie, but the core issue is not a funny one.  The comedy aspect of this movie just keeps it from getting real depressing.  It reflects a shameful part of our history from a different angle.  I really liked the fact that the movie did not end with a \\"everything is now fixed\\" ending.  It is not a totally downer of an ending, but it re-enforces the fact that one person could not end racism, but everything thing one person did to stop racism ended up helping in a small way.
0441013597|5.0|I must admit that I do agree with Arthur C. Clarke when he called it the sci-fi answer to THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Dune is an epic masterpiece. But unlike, Tolkien's difficult texts such as LOTR or THE SILMARILLION, Dune is difficult in a sense that I tend to get lost in its structure of the story. The language is fairly easy to grasp but the structure of the book may caught me slightly off-guard.<br /><br />That's probably because I tried to align the similarities of the book with the 1984 David Lynch's movie version. I admit that there were edited scenes that were not in the movie that I read in the book. Nevertheless, I'm pleased with the outcome.<br /><br />One part in which I'm lost is the transition when the Atreides folded space from Caladan to Arrakis. It seemed as if there a whole chapter is missing from the book describing that transition stage. Can anyone verify that for me. Suddenly, they've arrived on Arrakis. That doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Anyway, check out my suggested casting if the new movie is considered to be made: [...]
B005FITILO|1.0|Went to this movie with a lot of great expectations, especially after watching Theron in an interview where she talks about doing comedy was a lot of fun.  This movie is not funny.  The subject matter is not funny.  I find it interesting when someone does comedy that most people think is not funny they call it dark humor.  This is not dark humor, it is just a dark, sad movie.  This is about watching someone who has some serious mental issues continue down a very dark road.  Near the end of the movie you find out what is the cause for the major mental issues and it is not a funny / humorous cause in any way shape or form.  At the end of the movie, there are no answers and no resolution.  You may say that is fine because that is how life can be.  This is the sad truth, which is why I go to movies so I can escape the cruel world for a couple of hours.  You will leave this movie depressed in a lot of ways.
1451627289|5.0|Over 800 pages and not a dull word among them. Any book that holds my interest this long must be terrific, and that's my opinion of Stephen King's 11/22/63. Time travel is such an intriguing concept and this novel takes you along for the ride, back into 1958, where there's a chance to erase the past and change the course of history. I'm still buzzing from the excitement. A few practice runs at changing the past before the big real life event Jake Epping is on a mission to prevent builds the suspense, and his trailing of Lee Harvey Oswald adds to the uncertainty and anxiety. The characters are well developed and King does a great job of taking the reader inside their minds to feel their emotions (or lack of in the case of some). The love story woven in is beautiful and quite heartbreaking. I was most interested to know how Stephen King would change the world if Kennedy lived and the ending surprised me. Nothing inevitable about this book, I couldn't even tell if he would save Kennedy or not, because King's style is unpredictable.<br /><br />Before this book, I wasn't a Stephen King fan and only read one of his books many years ago...can't even remember the name of it. This book has changed that.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app works really good if you just want to type, but I don't reccommend it if you are looking to use wordart and things like that. Overall, this app works really well.
0060873027|1.0|As a Crichton fan (I have read all HIS books), I was shocked to read this one - in fact I could not even complete it. This one can never qualify to be a Crichton book - the concept may be his, but this shows how even a good concept can be ruined by poor story telling, artificial dialogues, laughable scenarios - examples: 'hero going for company tour on the next day of his brother's death', 'police not identifying a witness of the accident, who by the way is an employee of the same company!' and many more....<br /><br />This is a travesty to the Crichton legacy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app works perfectly. I reccommend this app for anyone who loves to game. I play this game all the time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it is very accurate and worth the time to download 5 stars I just cant stop saying how great it is it does everything for you instead of you doing everything for it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Cover fits perfectly, protection is 100%. The front cover's soft interior also helps keep my Kindle from sliding around when folded back and works amazingly well as a support stand when watching movies, something I was skeptically of when I first got it. 2 thumbs up for it's simple yet effective design.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael's voice, with the clever arrangements, made us want to vote this as album of the year; it's our new favorite Christmas album. This has much of the spirit of the holidays on a ride with a variety of energies, including duets (Shania Twain and the fun Puppini Sisters) that show he's an entertainer who delivers class.  Clean and sharp musical arrangements. Doesn't the producer, David Foster, also accompany Bocelli?  I'd buy another one.
B005LLX582|5.0|The film does take quite a bit of effort to like but the music is out of this world and there official sound track does not cover it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great way to pass the time.  Response is sometimes tough to get use to, but it is free (thus the 4 stars).
B0036EH3WK|5.0|You would be crazy if you didn't instantly fall for this show.  I remember when I started to see commercials airing before the first season played on TV.  I hardly thought twice about the show.  Here I am more than 6 years later, and I am a die hard fan.  This series gripped on to me and still won't let go after I watched the series in it's entirety twice.  Every episode leaves you wanting more and more.  I found it almost impossible to only watch one episode in a day.  On to the review of the Blu-ray themselves: they are awesome.  The first thing you notice is the menu screens of the disc.  They look great!  The show should only be watched in HD - standard definition does not do it justice.  I found the Blu-rays to lag in just a couple spots throughout the entire set.  I can't say enough about the quality of this show and Blu-ray set.  Do yourself a favor and pick it up today.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great choice of versions and easy to load and use. Giuseppe seveeral different versions when preparing. a lesson and this works very well.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I finished the book last week and decided to wait to post a review to collect my thoughts. Many people don't like this conclusion to the trilogy. The first two books were compelling page-turners and the ends left you thrilled or eager to read the next one. Mockingjay, while compelling is not the same as the first two. The series takes a bit of a dark turn and starts to pose philosophical questions such as, \\"when do victors of a war become the monsters they defeated?\\" and \\"What are acceptable loses in any war?\\" and \\"Can you ever truly come back from a war?\\" The answers are found in Katniss' world view and her thoughts revealed in the book. I won't spoil the ending for you because there are those wondering who will Katniss end up with? Gale, her childhood friend or Peeta, her Hunger Games companion? Obviously this book revolves around the rebellion against the capital and Katniss' role in that.  There are literary items that I'm not fond of, such as introducing characters and subsequently killing them off, as others have suggested, but unlike some authors I've read, at least she introduces them more than 3 chapters before she has them bite the dust. Besides, if there is one thing we've learned from our American soldiers is that you don't know if the person you're walking next to will be there tomorrow. Suzanne Collins wrote this book in an honest way; in war, there are casualties and there are survivors and few victors.  I enjoyed the book. Not as much as the first two, but I feel it was an ending that I could live with. It wasn't a \\"Hollywood ending\\" where he hero/heroine makes a last minute move that saves everyone and the world takes a turn for the better, which is good because I typically leave those movies disappointed in that the ending was \\"too good\\". Suzanne Collins rather, takes a focus on Katniss and removes her view of the whole world and focuses on her next move. Where is she going, what's her next objective, how does she respond to this exact circumstance? All in all it's a recommend for me at 4 stars.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love this app!:)But needs more robots lin atom, zues, and twin cities and a militia player mode.But still rocks:)
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I was looking for a case that didn't add bulk but protected my kindle fire. I love it! It works great. The stand feature is not real sturdy but works as long as you don't bump it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This application would be much better if you could also use it without the Internet.  Maybe not have full use available,  but reading at the vertigo least.
B005P3NPXG|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because they're \\"covers.\\" However, they're really good covers! Very true to the original arrangements, which is important to me. The dude can really sing and if you're a fan of the old school stuff, you'll love this contemporary take on these classics...Enjoy!...
0307595862|3.0|This was my first Harry Hole novel, and I was pleasantly surprised. Harry is a police detective in Norway. Harry has a drinking problem, which he is struggling with. Unfortunately, the new case of a serial killer is his main concern and the toxic mold in his apartment isn't helping.<br /><br />The story is full of twist. It keeps the reader guessing. Who is the mysterious 'Snowman' killer? Woman are disappearing and ending up brutally murdered. It is an entertaining read, yet hard to go into details without giving up too much of the story. The book is a translation from the original language. I found the beginning of the book a little disjointed. I wasn't sure if this was due to the translation. I did enjoy the book, and I heard from my local bookstore that 'The Leopard' is better.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B002VPE1AW|4.0|AVATAR   This week assignment was to watch one of three movies and write a review.  Also, I needed to explain how it illustrates indigenous sacred ways as it relates to World Religions. The movie I choose was the 2009 film \\"Avatar\\".  I choose this movie because it received good reviews and it was recommended to me by some friends.  \\"Avatar\\" was a great film that included epic battle scenes as well as learning to appreciate a foreign culture.   The movie begins by introducing the main character, Jake Sully. Jake is a Marine whom was injured and now is restricted to a wheelchair.  Jake does not let his misfortune handicap him.  It only inspires him to work harder to prove Doctors and skeptics wrong.  Jake takes a job and travels to another planet called Pandora.  He is then linked in with another alien body that was genetically engineered using human DNA along with Na'vi, native creatures, DNA.   While operating his avatar, Jake meets Neytiri, a Na'vi native who belongs to the Clan that is threatened by the company who Jake works for.  The company wants to mine for precious rocks that are located underground where the Na'vi resides.  The Na'vi do not want to move and do not want the humans to destroy or alter the forest.  The Na'vi believes the forest is alive and everything in the forest has an energy that they all need to share.   Neytiri is then instructed by her father to teach Jake the Na'vi way of life. Jake is faced with challenges at every turn.  He has to learn the language, customs, religion, as well as how to ride and fly majestic animals.  The other members of the Clan do not want Jake around and think of him as an moron.  Over time Jake works hard and learns the way of the Na'vi. He begins to see the animals he hunts for food are his brothers in life and thanks them for giving their life to feed the Na'vi.  He starts to understand the trees have ancient powers and healing qualities.   Many ancient and current cultures think of nature as Gods or having spirits that guide and heel people.  As in our text Living Religions by Mary Pat Fisher, on page 58 it shows a sacred tree in Mexico that people placed articles of clothing on and offer prayers to the Great Spirit.  Also on page 60, it shows the Efe pygmies of the Ituri Forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  They believe the forest is a Great Spirit similar to the Na'vi.  M.Diehl
6305882592|4.0|Great movie, a classic dark comedy about strange ways of love.Save your money and get Netflix and watch it with anytime.$60.00 for a DVD,get real................
0062082353|4.0|It was well written but what I think made it stand out was Chris including his wife's comments about his training & travels.  We all know what is expected of the Seals but knowing what a Seal's family is going through is very interesting.  A very good read.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|does just what it need to do...keeps the kindle safe and it's easy to hold. I like the little stand you can do with the cover
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Thank you Unidocs Inc. love your application. Basically this lovely little thing turns your PDFs into an intuitive book that will function even better than the integrated software the kindle fire has for its books. The text to speech needs a little bit of work since it only reads the text reflow (raw text) of a PDF document and if you have a really intricate PDF it could be really annoying. (in my case) The first letter of each word that begins a paragraph is spaced out for example: &quot;The&quot; when viewed in text reflow is &quot;T he&quot; so when you select text to speech it will read it: &quot;T&quot; &quot;he&quot; even though when the document is viewed with its intended formatting the spacing is absent and looks seemless. If Unidocs plans to update this app I really hope that they focus a bit more of their attention on their text to speech feature and not only gear it to read PDFs formatting but also beef the heck out of it by adding some options like setting reading speed or highlighting the words as they are read to you. Maybe more voice personalities? Hell, if they could get Amazon to fund them to improve and intigrate these features for the kindle fire's book reader app I bet the kindle would sell like crazy. Come on Amazon, no thumnails for page scrolling through books? really?
B001TH8UUA|1.0|Since this was an Amazon product I was hoping this would be a good product, with one of the cables I had a bad experience, the pin that holds the cable and sits in the port got stuck in the laptop and the cable came out by itself....the crimping on the cable and HDMI pin was very loose and so it came out.....so watch out, the 2nd time I had a cable it just stopped working after about 4 - 6 times.........so not a good product and not reliable.
0307949486|5.0|Great book.. I could not put it down. Stick with it for the first few chapters.  You will not be sorry you did.
B004G6009U|5.0|I loved the film; its story, animation, music, and humor were all superb. Maybe worthy of the Disney 'Renaissance era' and proves Disney still has it in them when it comes to producing an excellent all around animated film for all ages. It holds up too as it's still great after multiple viewings over the past year.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
B005T87QCI|5.0|A awesome game and has magnifisent grafics. I sigest Real Steal if your looking for action and fighting(the best game).
B001GXYBY6|5.0|As a fan of the orginal cartoon. I can only say one word to rate this movie. Amazing! I watched this movie knowing how the cartoon was. As a cartoon, speed racer was 100% imagination and fantasy. The cartoon had these imagary super cars with all sorts of neat gadgets and weapons. The adaptation from a fantasy cartoon to big screen movie was superb.<br /><br />I was thinking now that I am an adult I would not like the movie because I grew up and now liking movies that were realistic. I was wrong. If you watch the movie with the mind set that the movie was based on a cartoon and not anything real then this movie is one for you.<br /><br />5 stars to this cartoon to big screen adaptation!<br />Bravo!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|each of the games are easy to get caught up in. the lower levels are easier to buy and beat but I like how they slowly get harder and make you want to keep going.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Had anyone but Meryl Streep played Margaret Thatcher in this film, I imagine that \\"The Iron Lady\\" would be about half as interesting as it actually is. Streep's majestic performance is yet another example of her uncanny ability to inhabit a role so completely and so profoundly that it becomes nearly impossible to distinguish between actor and character. Streep nails Thatcher's voice, her tone, her mannerisms, her deportment, every nuance of her identity. Her performance is so remarkable that she actually manages to make Thatcher likeable in a number of scenes. Jim Broadbent is equally impressive as Thatcher's loyal and supportive husband Denis, and the rest of the cast is solid as well. But the real attraction here is Streep--this is a tour de force performance, and it will be difficult indeed to deny her a third Oscar.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it. very entertaining and challenging. great to pass time. love love love love love love love love love
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Will Traynor was a high-flying executive living his life to the full - exotic holidays, gorgeous women - when an accident sees him confined to a chair as a quadriplegic, living at the back of his parents' house.  Two years on, Louise Clark is hired as his \\"carer\\".  Her job is basically to babysit him: feeding him, chatting to him, giving him medicine.  However Will doesn't want her there and basically ignores her at all times.  If Lou wasn't desperate for work she would quit, but gradually she starts to care about Will and to realize that part of her job is to give him a will to live.<br /><br />The novel unfolds without any dramatic surprises.  From the halfway point I'd figured out exactly how it would all come together BUT that didn't affect my enjoyment of it one iota.  Will and Lou won me over - I cared about them and miss them now that I've finished the book.  Jojo Moyes lets the story unfold slowly, so that you feel that you're living it all with them.  I read most of the book in one setting, staying up later than I'd intended, because I just couldn't bear to put it down.  And by the time I got to the ending I had tears rolling down my cheeks, which doesn't often happen when I'm reading (the last time was ([[ASIN:0061537969 The Art of Racing in the Rain: A Novel]]).<br /><br />I could tell you that many of the secondary characters are stereotypes.  I could critique the absence of plot twists.  I could even point to editorial errors.  All these things are true, but it's still such a compelling read that I can only say: read it.
B005VPRET4|5.0|Our oldest child (boy) has loved legos forever and hated having to share them with 4 younger sisters. Now are daughters are starting their own collections and are very happy with the new lego friends sets.  The colors are very bright and vibrant and the directions easy to follow.  They love playing with them and the little accessory pieces even make it more fun for them.  Great toy---about time Lego!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. It's a great time killer. Now my daughter loves it too. This one is a keeper.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|This movie was very intense!  It's a must see film that left me in tears, cheers, and awe!  It display love conquers all and in the end love prevails.  I don't like watching movies twice but this is a must see again! It's after 1 am in the morning and tears won't stop falling.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover works just as advertised, perhaps a little pricey for what it is - but if it lasts it'll be worth it. The cover protects my Kindle without adding a lot of extra weight. One funny thing about it, though, is figuring out which side actually flips open, I often find myself trying to open the wrong side. I'll get used to it. Seems like good quality material, and the stand works well enough!
B00005JLRT|3.0|Star Trek Nemesis(2002) was a critical and commercial flop at the time. The TV show Star Trek Enterprise was cancelled years later. At the time, the Star Trek franchise was \\"running out of gas\\". Even I thought Star Trek Nemesis was disappointing at the time. Star Trek Nemesis is a decent film. It has state of the art visual effects, a good music score by the late Jerry Goldsmith, good action scenes and some good acting. The film does suffer from a flawed script and corny dialouge. It retcons facts established in the TV show Star Trek The Next Generation(1987-1994). The crew of the USS Enterprise has to stop Shinzon(Tom Hardy) from destroying Earth with a diabolical weapon. Shinzon is a clone of Captain Jean Luc Picard(Patrick Stewart) created by Romulans. Shinzon was raised by Remans, a warrior class that Romulans find inferior.   Stuart Baird does a decent job directing Star Trek Nemesis even though he knew little about the Star Trek franchise. Bryan Singer, Wil Wheaton, Whoopi Goldberg and Kate Mulgrew make brief cameos in the film. Over 50 minutes of footage was cut out to speed up the pacing of the movie. The tone of the movie is very dark. Deanna Troi(Marina Sirtis) is \\"violated\\" by Shinzon and people are maimed and killed in fairly gruesome ways. This film has the guts to sacrifice one of our beloved characters! Ron Perlman is quite good as Shinzon's Reman viceroy. The Reman make up is an homage to Nosferatu. Dina Meyer is good as a Romulan woman. The plot for Star Trek Nemesis is an homage/rehash of Star Trek The Wrath of Khan(1982). The scene where the Remans invade the Enterprise is similar to the scene where the Klingons invade the Enterprise in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock(1984). There's been a giant trend of rebooting franchises in the past 8 or 9 years. Star Trek was rebooted in a big budget 2009 film directed by J.J. Abrams. Star Trek Nemesis is a weak Star Trek movie, but it's still decent.
0307949486|3.0|I feel like I'm being generous by giving this book a three. It had its moments, but overall I found it banal and unsubstantial. Each plot element was either overly contrived or eye-rollingly predictable. The characters were one-dimensional, flat and static. My biggest problem with this writer is his repeated use of excessive and irrelevant explanations of computers, statistics and other random factoids that drawl on with no importance to the plot. I feel like I had only to read the first line of every paragraph for the majority of this book in order to feel I wasn't wasting my time. It was just too drawn out. Maybe it would have been better in its original language. Perhaps the long descriptions would have had more flavor to them. As it was written in the English version, the writing just didn't captivate me. I liked some of the twists, but I guess I'm just not a mystery person. Mysteries draw you in by denying you a handful of crucial details until the end, with which to surprise you by. Suspense alone is not enough to keep me entertained reading a 600 page book. No way I'm going to read two more books even longer than this one.
B005OLF6BI|2.0|I AM A BIG FAN OF TAYLOR SWIFT AND HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS. I HAVE 4 COPIES OF ONE OF TAYLOR'S CD's. THIS CD INCLUDES A LOT OF FANS  SCREAMING.  I RARELY LIKE LIVE CD's AND THIS ONE IS NO EXCEPTION.  I WILL CONTINUE LISTENING TO TAYLOR'S OTHER CD's.  I WILL NOT LISTEN TO THIS ONE.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|I think \\"Femme Fatale\\" is Britney's strongest CD that you can choreograph many dances to through most of the CD, ESP \\"I Wanna Go\\" and \\"Trouble For Me\\". This DVD of her tour in Toronto is even better. \\"3\\" \\"Trouble For Me\\" and \\"S&M\\" make the whole concert worth buying, but the rest make it impossible to buy later on. There are only 2 downsides to this DVD for me. The biggest is that the concert IS dubbed, so it does sound more like her CDs, which I understand and appreciate when dancing to it, but it really sucks because I can never see her LIVE. The other downside is that \\"Criminal\\" and a few other songs were removed from the setlist BEFORE this was filmed, so if you are looking for those perfomances like I am, you will be severely disappointed. Overall, I would buy this again anytime I could afford it, and I watch it 3-5 times a week.
0802798225|4.0|The plot of this book is a mixture of Romeo & Juliet with a little Taming of the Shrew thrown in. The reviews of this one have been good so I had to find out if it was really THAT good.<br /><br />Its enough to say YES! It IS! I loved the chemistry between the two main characters (pardon the pun). I thought the writing was beautiful, fitting and poignant throughout the book. I particularly liked the spanish thrown in to emphasis moods and emotions. It didn't matter if you didn't understand half of it (I googled some!) but you could tell when the atmosphere of a conversation was about to change for good or bad.<br /><br />The main characters are completely open and easy to imagine with their own situations and demons they have to face while growing up in very different circumstances. One minute you feel your heart warm to them and the next, well, a spanner gets thrown in the works, and you just can't believe things won't go right, I mean, give them a break!<br /><br />I enjoyed the whole book. There wasn't any part I didn't like. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because the end finished too quickly and skipped several months which I thought could have easily been filled. I don't know whether the Author had gone over her allocated page count but I would have like more.<br /><br />So, overall, if you like YA romantic then this ones for you!
B001F6TXME|3.0|I received this item in good working condition.  Plugged it into my D90 without any issues.  Reaction is very slow, sometimes it takes up to two seconds or will require a second press to take a picture.  Also, the button is a little mushy so you don't know whether you're pressing it right.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is a great Kindle Fire Thin & Lightweight Folio Cover Stand.  It adds very little thickness, weight or bulk to the Kindle Fire.  The stand works well on stable & flat surfaces. The inside of the screen cover is soft and protects the Kindle Fire screen whike keeping it clean.  It is a decent value at $30 to protect my $200 Kindle Fire.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Shipped really quick and love the product. Perfect for the price and easy to pop my Kindle fire into. I almost bought a cheaper one just to save a few extra bucks but this case works perfect for what I want. It's hard on the outside, soft on the inside. I would definitely recommend getting a case just to protect the screen.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Yes, it is the usual dark future with forebodings of the end of the earth (does any sci fi predict a bright future?) but this is worth a look for sure. Good story is even better with the likes of Dennis Quaid. My biggest gripe was the very, very poor sound quality especially when Nadia had anything to say. Without giving much away they all had to whisper a lot but that should not mean we should not be able to hear clearly. To the makers of this movie I say, get into the new century and use quality equipment that allows the audience to hear even whispers. Not rocket science any more. This movie should have had subtitles when Nadia speaks.<br />That being said it is a pretty original story and carried off very well. The use of not letting you get a real good look at the \\"enemy\\" too often works well. A technique becoming more and more employed as in Cloverfield.<br />The movie is enjoyable and above most so give it a try.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Very good to be reminded about what matters.  Life is too short.  A reminder not to take people or opportunities for granted.  Take time to knit the hearts of our children to ours.  Take the time to be better \\"neighbors\\".  The commitment to do what is right and godly will be tested, it is a matter of time.  We see consequences of right and wrong choices throughout the movie.  Truth is always the best.  Doing what is right, even if you stand alone.  Very, very well done.  I did let my children watch.  My 7 year old noticed how smoothly Christ was shared in a particular scene.  This movie took me through a lot of emotions.  Laughter, suspense, sadness and grief.  Keep the tissues close by.
1439148813|3.0|I never imagined giving Gene Kranz's book less than a five-star rating, but it is so dull that I kept putting it down. But any Apollo aficionado would be remiss without reading this.<br /><br />I learned of many new things, like the mission-threatening mishaps that occurred on Apollo missions 14, 15, and 16. Everybody knows of the difficulty the Apollo 14 crew had extracting the LM, but I never realized that their first landing attempt was waved off as they worked through two additional landing-threatening problems: abort-switch contamination (VERY scary), and a malfunctioning radar altimeter.  I also learned that the TLI was really an ascent to a higher (250,000 mile) orbit that intercepted the moon.<br /><br />No coworker is mentioned without an obligatory paragraph (or three) about what made him or her special. Ironically after this is done for everybody, no one seems special. It would be difficult to keep all the characters straight anyway, but the author makes it worse by alternately referring to them by first and last names, effectively doubling the number of people to remember.  For example when Gary Coen is mentioned on page 358: the author writes \\"Gary continued...\\" and then later in the same paragraph, \\"Coen continued...\\"  It is cOnFUsiNg!  8-[]<br /><br />The author's take-charge attitude that served us all so well in the face of time-critical, irreversible decisions was not useful for writing a memoir. He should have recruited a co-author as [[ASIN:0312263511 Gene Cernan]] did.<br /><br />More than any other books I have read, this one and [[ASIN:B004KAB3ZM Michael Collins' book]] convey the mind-boggling complexity of these missions, and the effort, coordination, and mental toughness required to pull them off. Each mission was truly an amazing team accomplishment. It is an inspiring tale.
0545265355|5.0|These books are marketed towards teenagers/young adults, however at age 25, I really enjoyed them. I usually don't read series that are super popular (I'm about as anti-Twilight as you can get). I hadn't even heard of the series until a couple of months ago but after seeing the trailer for the upcoming movie, the series intrigued me and I'm so happy I bought it.<br /><br />I know everyone knows the general idea of the trilogy's plot but I like to include the plot in my book reviews so here: The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins tells the tale of 16 year old Katniss Everdeen who lives in District 12 of the nation of Panem, a futuristic country that lies in the ruins of what was once North America. It is governed by the Capitol, which is located near what was once called the Rocky Mountains. District 12 is located in once what was Appalachia. Every year, the Capitol forces all 12 districts to select one boy and one girl between the ages of 12-18 to represent their district in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death event that occurs in an arena. When Katniss' 12 year old sister Prim is selected, she volunteers to take her place in order to save her. 16-year old Peeta Mellark is chosen as the boy tribute for District 12.  In order to survive the games, Katniss must make choices that pit survival against humanity.<br /><br />I won't go into any detail about the next two books or else I might spoil the plot, but the first book is probably my favorite out of the three.  A lot of people seemed to dislike Mockingjay, but I liked it more than Catching Fire to be honest. Katniss' character does seem to degrade in Mockingjay and a lot of people seemed to have a problem with that based on other reviews. I however felt that with the Games and the events in Catching Fire and Mockingjay, it's understandable that she behaves in a certain way since she's still dealing with the trauma and stress of what she has gone through. I loved how in all three books, each chapter basically ends in a cliffhanger, making you want to read the next chapter right away. I also liked how the series ends too. Suzanne Collins doesn't sugar coat everything like a typical Hollywood-like ending would. She however, tries to end it in somewhat of a good note, although Katniss and the others are still emotionally scarred. It's basically a bittersweet end.<br /><br />It took me about a month to get through all 3 books but if it wasn't for nursing school, I'd had them all read within a week or less. Thirty-one dollars for 3 hardcover books (with beautiful dust jackets!) and a nice bookcase to store them in is a great deal. Overall, it was an excellent series and I am really looking forward to the movie that comes out this March!basically ends in a cliffhanger, making you want to read the next chapter right away.

0385344228|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob\\" by William Landay is a great read.  Fast-paced and suspenseful, it is hard to put down, and there are plot twists aplenty, especially at the end.  While it is placed in the crime genre, it could with equal merit be a  psychological study, a story of family dysfunction, or a courtroom drama in the vein of \\"Law and Order.\\"  The book is told from the point of view of Andy Barber, assistant district attorney for the town of Newton, Massachusetts, who lives a comfortable life with his wife, Laurie, and their 14-year-old son, Jacob.  Then tragedy strikes: a classmate of Jacob's is murdered, and Jacob is accused of the crime.  The rest of the novel deals with the impact of this accusation on each member of the family.  Adding to the mystery is a secret about his past that Andy has kept from his wife for their entire marriage.  This secret forces both Laurie and Andy to face the past and evaluate its impact on the present.  The novel is structured on two alternating parallel lines.  The first is the story told from Andy's point of view, one year after the murder.  The second is a transcript of testimony before the grand jury and from the trial itself.  These passages are dialogues between Andy and his nemesis in the district attorney's office, Prosecutor Neal Loguidice.  The latter's name is pronounced \\"la-JOO-dis\\" and has the suggestion of \\"Judas,\\" the betrayer.  This to me was the one false note in the book.  Loguidice is villainized, most unfairly, in my opinion.  The book would have been stronger with a more neutral portrayal of the prosecuting attorney.  Another intriguing aspect of \\"Defending Jacob\\" is Andy's denial of reality with respect to his son's involvement in the crime.  Faced with overwhelming evidence, he continues to assert Jacob's innocence, despite attempts to make him face reality by both his wife and a psychiatrist who evaluated Jacob.  Despite his profession and experience with criminals, he is blind to his own son's guilt, with stunning consequences.  In addition, the book deals with the \\"Nature vs Nurture\\" argument regarding how we become who we are:  Are we just born a certain way, or are environment and upbringing responsible for how we turn out?  This aspect was especially interesting.  The end of the book is disturbing and astonishing, though on some level understandable.  This book will find wide readership, and I would not be surprised to see it turned into a film.  I recommend it to anyone looking for suspense, courtroom drama, and dysfunctional family dynamics.  You will not be disappointed.
B005G4TJI4|2.0|I guess i should have done more research before i bought this. I enjoy the transformers franchise and even though i feel like the 2nd and 3rd movie will never live up to the quality of the 1st I enjoyed this one enough to decide to buy this bluray/dvd hoping that the blu ray format and additional special features would keep me entertained. Well when you put the movie in you are treated to; the movie, different audio languages, and nothing no commentary, behind the scenes, deleted scenes,etc.......If you want nothing but a movie buy it off itunes or something, I'd recommend getting the other special edition version that i learned about after I already bought this one
0307292134|4.0|I'm not going to talk about the quality of the material, as most of us already know it. I will talk about this specific production. The books are bigger than I expected (which is a good thing for me), they look very beautiful and the quality of the paper is also good.  The only problem I had was the packaging. The box that contains the four books came very damaged to me. It was torn in several places, but I guess that was because they travelled from America to Greece.  This is why I gave it four stars, were it not for the damaged box, I would have given 5 for sure!

B000UPSKO8|5.0|A wonderful Opera Gala! All the singers and the orchestra performed beatufully. I especially enjoyed the female and male duets and the quartet from Rigoletto. Anna Netrebko's encore from Lehar brought down the house, as she danced, tossed flowers to the audiance and messed with the first chair violin player. This is a must see!! Anna has become quite the entertainer!!!  All of the singers seemed very comfortable with each other and the conductor. All are having a great time and this adds to the enjoyment of this DVD. I highly recommend it.
1933865407|5.0|Massive oversize coffeetable book filled to the brim with gorgeous art. From rough sketches to markers to full paints, every page is a masterpiece. I am a massive Timm fan and this book blew my mind. It is worth every penny. The book is a little light on text, with no actual input from Timm himself, yet I couldn't bring myself to care, the art is so good. Heavy on the nudes but with a  PG DC section, along with a horror/pulp section heavy on the Hammer films. Get the Bruce Timm Modern Masters from Twomorrows as a companion piece.
0307949486|5.0|When our library mystery group read this mystery for its monthly selection we discussed the strengths of the book: original plot, crisp writing, contemporary issues, fabulous setting etc. but other mystery series have these.<br /><br />What made THESE books runaway best-sellers?<br /><br />Listening to the other participants talk it came back to one dynamic: Lisabeth Salander<br /><br />She's a modern-day super-hero. Her acumen and facility with computers is so agile, it seems she can do anything, overcome any obstacle, and get back at the bad guys. She fascinates us. We root for her. She's emotionally vulnerable but invincible at the same time. Most of us have never met anyone like her, but you can't help but like her. And she is on a heroes journey of becoming whole again, learning to figure out where she fits in and what her purpose is. Her immediate purpose is to overcome a series of obstacles and help to solve a missing person mystery. This is a central conflict that is, as my writing-lit instructor Adam would say, is &#34;personal, concrete and specific&#34;. Will she and the journalist be successful? This is one reason why you keep turning the pages, but the other reason is that you want to see Lisabeth work to the height of her potential as she is so unique.<br /><br />She carries these books--take her out of them and they are like any other top, well-written mystery series. With her in them, they stand apart.<br /><br />In this book the violence and sex was overly-graphic for my taste, but I was willing to put up with it to see what Lisabeth would do next.
030788743X|5.0|Email excerpt to a Geek friend.<br /><br />Dude, this is perhaps the absolutest best book I have ever read.  Well, not read but listened to, since I only do audio books.  Well, not really, I do a lot of Kindel books too.  But none the less.  This book rocks for a lot of people; geeks, people that remember the 80's, Sci-Fi guys, and just about anyone that loves a good read.<br /><br />Ok, so it's not the deepest book I've ever read, but it's deep enough not to be superficial.  I sure hope Cline writes more.  I'll easily pay $100 for his next book.<br /><br />I think any tech savvy kid all the way to old farts like me (soon to be 57) will love this book.<br /><br />Russell
B000002TYX|5.0|This CD collection is definitely a very unique one. If you're looking for a collection of hits..this isn't it.

B001EN71DG|5.0|I didn't buy the BluRays, I won't buy the 3-D BluRays that will be released after they've all played in theaters, and this DVD collection is another reason why I won't be buying another copy of a Star Wars movie until after George Lucas dies. Why pay $300 to watch it almost exactly as I could from the old VHS?  When Lucas finally kicks it, someone smart at Lucas Arts will finally compile all of the different film versions (including the for-real originals, but formatted for modern TVs) and release them as a 27-disc BluRay set. I'll pay $300 to have my childhood back then, thank you.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|Having heard all the awards season buzz about The Artist, I was inclined to see the film, despite many criticisms I had heard voiced about it being a mostly silent film. And can I say, the film is no less entertaining for it's lack of vocal dialogue. Though many may fault the film for this, I found it to create a refreshingly different film for theatre-going audiences who have likely never seen a such a film. With delightful performances from Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo in particular, the two create characters that are an absolute pleasure to watch throughout the movie. (Not to mention the adorably charming dog!) The film as a whole creates a beautiful presentation of the classic era of Hollywood, not only in plot, but in how the film is presented and filmed, and is an absolute must-see for anyone who treasures Hollywood and the history of the filmmaking industry.

B006PZBR8S|4.0|The Real Steel is not a film that you would go to expecting a really good movie, but, for the most part, it is enjoyable. Is it perfect? Of course not, but with all the garbage that comes out these days, this movie was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Its story is made up of, or reminds you of, other movies you may have seen. Rocky, Transformers, and Over The Top are the ones that stand out for me. Overall, it works. A problem I have with many movies these days is a difficulty feeling any connection to whats going on or major characters. There are plot holes, things move to fast, or it just doesn't work. Real Steel is able to have fun with the fighting robots while also having a story between a father and son, and both sides of the movie come together to make what ends up being a decent movie.<br /><br />You really dislike Hugh Jackman early in the film. He is basically a scumbag and deadbeat dad. Though they don't go into too much detail through out the film, you can tell part of why he has become this way is because he was a pretty good boxer in the past and was replaced by these robots which made him obsolete. I really was getting into the fight scenes and they were done in the Rocky way, which means you are almost cheering from your seat for the good guy to win in the end.<br /><br />Overall there's not much I can say against this movie. It gets a little dull a couple of times earlier in the movie, and a couple of the minor parts in the movie were not really necessary, but the negative reviews for this movie really make no sense to me. At the least its a good popcorn flick, but you may walk away surprised that this kind of movie is as good as it is.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|cover came promptly within 2 days of ordering. love it. it looks like an old book but paperback sized for easy handling. Quality of the material and stitching was very nice. do recommend it. would love for it to have come in other colors to personalize it but that wasn't an option.
B006TLFIAQ|3.0|If you go into this movie believing it will be great because of the all star cast, then you will probably find yourself somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />Robert Deniro does not have a large role in the movie, which is disappointing because he is one of the best parts. Jason Statham plays the same kind of character as every movie hes in which is finally becoming tiring. Clive Owen did a good job and you end the movie really not sure if he would be considered a bad guy or not, or just not all there in the head. I was happy to see Yvonne Strahovski in something outside of Chuck since that series is ending (besides her being beautiful of course).<br /><br />The action in the movie is done well, but you just don't feel much of a connection to the main story of the movie. Statham is brought out of \\"retirement\\" to save Deniro, but it moves so fast at first that its hard to care. I was more interested in whether Stathams girlfriend would be killed than if Deniro would die. There was something definitely off about the movie, and the only thing I can think of is that the people making it felt a little hamstrung by trying to follow what is supposed to be a true story.<br /><br />This movie is the type you rent for a low price or see on something like Netflix. It is not worth buying.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a nice grippy clear case for the iPhone 4/4s.  It is clear and well-fitting, about the same thickness as my earlier Griffin Elan Form Graphite case that it replaced.  As with the Griffin, a raised ridge on the front gives the screen enough bumper protection that you don't have worry about putting the phone screen-down on a surface.  An excellent value.  Very happy with it.

Developer thanks for many hours my family has enjoyed taking turns solving the puzzles!

0439023513|1.0|I raced through the trilogy in under a week, just to come to this ending that was not in line with the book, and just detracted from the first two, well-written books.
B005UKJX4E|4.0|After reading the negative reviews (and there are many) I wasn't sure what to expect.  I found the first 30 min odd for the sake of being odd.....after that I couldn't stop watching it.  I was surprised how much I liked it.
B005974CNA|5.0|I am one of those crazy DT fans from 20+ years ago that want another SFAM.  And this Cd ROCKS.  I really liked the last 2 or 3 (Systematic Chaos, Octavarian) and they had some of their FINEST moments, but not like this one.  This cd is really IT, and the most refreshing thing DT has done in a long time.  I am SO glad that Portnoy left because I really think he was adding too much of a 'dark' influence into their music, and although the darkness will probably never go away with DT, we (the DT fans) needed some relief in this area.  From start to finish, this is the best DT stuff in a LONG time.  I am not sure I should that thank John or any of the others in the band, but what really got me was that this was one serious rockin CD that stood out from the rest of the bunch.  I felt that what Mike P. was adding at the time was some real negative or almost death metal growl to your songs (go back 1 CD for that one) that was simply crap, so there.  Dream Theater are simply the best at what they do, and this CD is no exception.  Get the 'Scenes from an Memory Pt 2\\" and 'Images and Words' first, then just enjoy all the prog rock they do so well with this one.

B005CM9DX6|3.0|Like many other reviewers that hated this thing, I agree.  To tell you the truth, I was not ever that crazy about the cookie monster vocals from Opeth, but the music behind it made up for it.  Now we have no cookie monster, but we have no cookie either.  I have listened this CD 10+ times thinking that I would find out what they were doing thing time around, and I just don't get it.  Being a major prog rock fan guy, I left this one with the kind of leeway that most critics would have left it in the dust by now...but it just fell short.  Overall, it has some great Opeth moments, but some of the slower parts are like BAD Pink Floyd and by the time my interest is back with all this boredom, yep, some great Opeth guitar stuff...not good enough guys, from a band I have really had so much respect for since Blackwater Park just wake the f*k up and make something that really moves me, like so many of your CD's in the past!!!

0385341008|5.0|I really like this book, it was relaxing read... The whole book is all written in letters, from one person to another, it is not by chapters. I was pleased when I finished it, I did like Juliet (the Main character), she was a strong woman who knew how to stand up for herself, and she knew what she wanted and she went after that. I like her. I wish I had the confidence to go after all the things she did, and not let people tell her what she must to.<br /><br />Give this  book a chance when you first get started, its a bit boring maybe 30 pages in, I started understanding the the character so I kept going, I got into the story I kept wondering hmmm I wonder whats going to happen next.
B003Y5H4Y8|1.0|\\"The Debt\\" is a well-made, well-acted fantasy that pretends to be a realistic thriller.  I'm sympathetic to the storyline, but I hate to say it, this one is laughably bad.  GREAT ACTING though, and the actual production itself is well done.  But the script is ridiculous, thoroughly lacking in credibility, and in the end, this is an exercise in \\"fantasy escapism\\" and nothing more.  The story concerns the intertwined lives of three Mossad agents who were on a mission in East Berlin to capture and return to Israel for trial a Dr. Mengele-like Nazi who had been hiding under an assumed identity.  The operation becomes botched, and the doctor gets away.  But the Mossad agents agree to tell their superiors that while they succeeded in capturing the doctor, he escaped although got killed by them in the process of trying to escape, and would not be returned to Israel for trial.  Allegedly, this secret \\"haunts\\" these agents for the next 30 years (yeah, right), to the point that it disrupts their lives.  And the rest of the film is how at a late stage in life, two of them attempt to fix the problem.  It would have been more credible for the story to be geographically placed on the moon rather than East Berlin.  The idea that a \\"secret operation\\" could have been run for an extended period of time by several strangers living in an East Berlin apartment building who go unnoticed and do not attract the attention of the Stasi or police would make anyone who knew anything about the Stasi and the East German police state laugh or cringe--I'm not sure which.  More than probably any place on earth, literally nothing could happen in East Berlin without the Stasi and the State knowing about it--often before it even happened.  There is absolutely zero credibility that an operation of this sort could have taken place, so instantly, this story is a fantasy and nothing  more.  There's also likely equally little credibility that any intelligence operatives, let alone Mossad agents, would be \\"haunted\\" by a botched operation for the rest of their lives.  Based on what I know (including having known some intelligence operatives even if at the time I knew them I was not aware of that fact), if these people had the sort of psychological makeup that would lead them to being \\"haunted\\" like this, they would have never been intelligence agents in the first place.  Helen Mirren is, as usual, great.  The acting overall is great.  The production is professional (although I'm getting a little tired of the \\"realistic\\" camerawork that leaves the screen image shaking rather than stationary).  But in the end, this movie fails badly, undermined by an utterly preposterous script.
B00004T9UF|4.0|On this album, Eminem actually has things to rap about that make sense and alot of the songs are more serious instead of clowning around about twisted and demented topics.<br /><br />The only drawbacks to Eminem's progression are:<br /><br />- \\"Kim\\" may be Marshall Mathers venting about his ex-wife but I don't consider this music. I don't even consider it entertainment frankly and I'm surprised so many people say this is one of Eminem's best songs. This track sounds like a soundbyte that you'd find in a movie where a psychotic murderer kidnaps someone and takes them out to be executed; it BARELY resembles a song structure.<br /><br />- a couple songs like \\"Amityville\\", \\"Under the Influence\\", and \\"The Kids\\" are below par; \\"Drug Ballad\\" is mediocre.<br /><br />- the skits are pointless<br /><br />D-12 doesn't really do anything to help the songs in my opinion, but all the other guest artists on the album (including Dido's clip) boost the song.<br /><br />All in all, definitely a huge step forward in the right direction for Eminem's career.
0439023521|4.0|Being a mature adult, I thought I had left YA fiction behind me. I picked this up since my 8th grader is reading this in school. I'm glad that we are both agreeing on at least one thing lately and that is that this book is very good.  Is there violence? Yes, but I would not say it is just for the sake of violence. As a parent I understand the apprehension other parents might feel at letting their children read this. On the other hand, I am in the camp that believes we have been coddling our children way too much in the last few decades as well as insulting their intelligence.  Some reviewers feel that the tributes did not rebel and only went along with what was asked of them. For some of the tributes this was true. But Katnis (and a few other tributes) do rebel. Albeit it is not in the way that we would expect, there are small rebellions throughout the story which add up to Katnis outsmarting the gamemakers in a witty and powerful manner. I will be reading the rest of the series, even if there isn't a happy ending.
B0060ZJ74O|3.0|I was told by a friend that this movie was about \\"A ball of money that belongs to the MLB that Brad Pitt must retrieve before a bomb goes off.\\" To my surprise though, it was actually about computers making baseball teams up. Now, I am not a big fan of computers thinking for themselves after watching movies like The Terminator, The Matrix and other movies, but to my surprise I fell in love with this movie.<br /><br />While Brad Pitt was fine in the film, it was Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character that stood out to me the most. His actions and words brought a certain sense of believability to an otherwise emotionless, computer controlled world. It doesn't hurt that Mr. Hoffman isn't hard on the eyes either. Unfortunately, his scenes are to few and far between so I had to take off two stars. Don't let that dissuade you though, this movie lays the groundwork for more computer/sport movies, and I believe this genre will take off after this. Defiantly a \\"home run!\\"
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the developer made a game that was interesting in concept, but a little frustrating in its requirement to play the same very simple games over and over in order to progress. i like the game, but it seems like it is designed to spend more time viewing ads than its worth.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Although my health isn't what it used to be, and I may only live another 10 years tops, its good to know that I will get to see the end of the Twilight saga in my lifetime. Many adults regard these movies as simple teenage fodder. This is far from the truth. These movies define an entire generation of young adults whom will become the next doctors, lawyers and perhaps even president's. The lessons that can be learned from both Jacob and Edward are not only heroic, but are characteristics that all men should aspire to be.<br /><br />As we all know, vampires are not real. This is a sad fact and unfortunate. The good news is, Werewolves have been spotted on occasion in both Italy and England. I personally have enjoyed the company of at least two of these gentlemen and we had long discussions on the legitimacy of werewolves in the twilight saga. \\"They must actually have werewolves on set telling our secrets.\\" I was told by one, while the other simply stated that \\"Its eerily realistic to my own condition.\\" Amazed by this, I asked for inconsistency's between real life and the movies themselves. \\"Although Jacob takes his shirt off often, much like I do, he often forgets to take his pants off.\\" Surprised by this answer, I followed with \\"are you wearing any pants now?\\" the gentleman then stood up from the table he was sitting at. I can vouch for his sincerity in this matter.<br /><br />You may be asking yourself, what does this have to do with The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part One? Well the answer is simple. The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn part two, three and four MUST have Jacob naked throughout if they wish to attain the authenticity that the werewolf community demands. Although we, the audience, have been captivated by the magical story and endless love of Bella and Edward, we cant let Jacob become an unrealistic non-nude side character any longer.

Other than that, very good quality product.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for \\"Real Steel,\\" I thought it looked like a big-screen version of the old Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots game and I had no interest in seeing it. However, once it was released and the positive word of mouth started to spread, I decided to take my 10-year-old son and a few of his friends to see it. And guess what? We all thoroughly enjoyed it. It truly is a modern-day Rocky, root for the underdog, story. The effects and robot battles are outstanding and the performances by the human actors are very solid. It's so much more than robots fighting. There's an emotional story at it's core. I've seen it twice now and got teary eyed at the same part both times, (and that doesn't happen to me very often). It reminded me of some of the great movies from the 1980's that weren't designated \\"family\\" movies, but that you could take the whole family to and everyone would enjoy.  The bottom line with Real Steel is that it is a true family film for kids 10+.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love this game, very challenging.  I also like the music. It is relaxing. This game is hard to put down. It will hook you!

B004UXUX4Q|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'The Descendants' was directed by Alexander Payne, who also was a co-producer on the recently released 'Cedar Rapids'. Both films fall under the rubric of 'quirky indie dramedy' and director Payne seems to be drawn to this sort of quirky subject matter. While the 'quirkiness' and the 'comedy' are present in 'The Descendants', it's more muted than some of the other films Payne has been involved in.<br /><br />'The Descendants' involves how a family copes after the mother winds up comatose, following a near fatal head injury while water skiing, off the coast of Wakikiki in Hawaii. The husband, Matt King, somewhat mechanically played by George Clooney, is a Honolulu-based attorney who refers to himself as the 'back-up' parent. The first part of 'The Descendants' involves some rather ordinary scenes of Matt attempting to reign in his rebellious daughters (10 year old Scottie bullies a classmate and 17 year old Alex is found drinking when Matt goes to fetch her at the exclusive boarding school she's been staying at).<br /><br />Matt begins his journey of self-discovery when he's forced to make a decision as the head of a large family that owns a large parcel of land on the Hawaiian island of Kuau'i. The family has seven years to dispose of 25,000 acres before the family trust expires. Matt has openly backed the family majority's decision to sell the land to a wealthy developer, over the objections of many of the locals who fear that the pristine land will be spoiled by over development.<br /><br />I'll repeat here my definition of the quirky indie dramedy--it's a film that features a \\"quirky protagonist, who must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing with the aid of quirky allies, while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo.\\" The reactionary group here is the developer and the family members who conspire to sell off their land, to the detriment of the community at large. The quirky protagonist is Matt, who generally resorts to inoffensive, quirky machinations, to achieve his goals. The only real negative note that casts Matt (as well as daughter Alex) in a bad light, is when they refuse to accept the apology of Troy, who was driving the boat, when the mother had her accident. Otherwise, he can be found engaging in such quirky and harmless stratagems, such as mouthing off to his comatose wife in the hospital room or giving a passionate kiss, instead of a peck on the cheek ,to the wife of a man who had an affair with his wife, prior to her devastating injury.<br /><br />When Alex reveals that her mother had an affair with a man, Matt is determined to seek him out. This constitutes the 'second act' of the film and we're curious to see what Matt decides to do. Along the way, Matt gains an unusual quirky ally in the form of Alex's tactless teenage friend, Sid, who ends up being punched in the eye by the comatose woman's father, who holds Matt responsible for his daughter's injury.<br /><br />Through perseverance and outright luck, Matt finally tracks down the man his wife had the affair with; he's Brian Speer, a real estate developer, who Matt finds on Kuau'i, vacationing with his wife and kids. Fortunately there are no violent recriminations as Matt merely gives Brian a tongue lashing and promises to keep the affair secret from his wife (kudos to the screenwriters for keeping things low key and light weight!).<br /><br />Things get wrapped up in 'The Descendants' also on a low key note. Matt simply changes his mind and decides not to sign off on having the family sell the land to the developer. There may have been a taste of revenge on Matt's part, since Brian was set to receive some hefty real estate commissions, had the land been sold to the developer. But Matt makes it clear that it's his love of the land that compels him to go against the majority of the family's wishes.<br /><br />'The Descendants' is very light weight but has its heart in the right place. Not only does Matt get in touch with his altruistic side by keeping the land but also learns to become a better father. The family also is able to 'move on' after the mother is taken off life support. Only the quirky comedy (that's not very funny) gets in the way, epitomized by Julie Speer's rant, at film's end, when she 'loses it', revealing that she's figured it out that husband Brian indeed had been having an affair all along, with Matt's wife.<br /><br />I'm not sure if 'The Descendants' deserves all the awards it's been nominated for, since a main part of the story, Matt's decision to seek out his wife's lover, turns out to be markedly inconsequential. Nonetheless, the film is mildly interesting, especially in light of the protagonist's self-discovery, where the community benefits and a family is made whole.h with his altruistic side by keeping the land but also learns to become a better father.

B004YZJ7M4|5.0|How could sci-fi have killed this series? This episode is extremely suspenseful.  The writers seem to have no problem killing off characters so I was holding my breath waiting to see who would not make it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been exercising 4-5 times week by attending group exercise classes at the gym (cycling, kickboxing, pilates, yoga, weights) for >5 years, and I really liked my routine. I get bored out of my mind on treadmills and elliptical machines, and I know I don't push myself enough when I try to do weights or pilates on my own. Recently my schedule has changed and I can no longer make it to my favorite gym classes. I purchased several of Jillian's workout DVDs (30 Day Shred, Yoga Meltdown, Ripped in 30, and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism), hoping that they will substitute my group exercise classes, and allow me to be able to work out whenever I have the time for it, without trying to make it to the gym on time. I've used the DVDs for about 2 months now, and I LOVE THEM.<br /><br />It's hard for me to write a review of each individual DVD because I treat them as one big workout library and I often mix and match the DVDs for my daily workout. That said, if I had to pick just one, it would be The 30 Day Shred. The exercise pace and difficulty matches the gym classes very closely, and I found it to be the right mix of manageable and demanding. Since I did similar workouts at the gym prior to getting the DVD, I didn't feel like I had to work up my way through the levels, but they didn't feel too easy either. Also, even after a couple of months, the workouts (even level 1) still provide me with enough challange, i.e. once you progress to a higher level doesn't not mean that you can't use a lower level for an effective exercise. I usually do one of those workouts and follow up with one of the Yoga Meltdown DVD workouts, for a total workout time of just under an hour.<br /><br />Of all of the JM DVDs that I tried this one is the least demanding on the wrists, although all her workouts include some wrist movements, and so if that bothers you it may be necessary to take a day off in between.<br /><br />I like Jillian's style, the other girls in the DVD are pleasant, and overall I'm very happy with these workouts, I didn't get bored of them in 2 months, and I really look forward to doing them each day. I've never tried workout DVDs before and was rather dubious about them, but my circumstances pushed me to try them, and I'm glad I did. I get to continue with the type of exercise I was used to at the gym but on my own schedule.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this cd only knowing the songs that have been out on the radio (which are quite a few of the ones on the cd) and ended up loving the entire disc! Definantly a must buy!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  It is so addictive! This is a great app especially since it was free! It is very easy to move the cards around.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Works well and was exactly as described.  Fits very well and appears to keep the device safe inside of my backpack while traveling.  No issues with it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good variety of games to choose from. I like this free app. I don't find the ads bothersome at all.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Even though the story wasn't complete I wish I would have stopped at the second book. There are more unnecessary deaths and complications and no satisfaction of a decent ending. Even if the overall purpose is to show war is hell, the last book doesn't share the attention to detail and enjoyment of the first two brought. I would recommend against reading this book. Very disappointing.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Needed memory for a new HP printer - very expensive from HP - but very inexpensive from here! Came in a few days - works great! Highly recommend!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am very satisfied with this game. It is a little complex but once you get the hang of it, it can be very fun. And a great way to pass the time.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|it doesnt work as good as i thought its just a color it doesnt reflect off of anything it doesnf evej show up on ur hand.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|This album is probably my favorite from Avril, although I don't even like it that much. I sort of hate her others.<br /><br />The songs I like from here are Girlfriend, Hot, and Keep Holding On. Her songs all have a similar tone, beat, rhythm, they're just all way too alike. I think she really needs to branch out.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very detailed with hour by hour forecast, radar &amp; video. loads fast, not sure what others issues are - works great on my Fire. wind speed/direction, sunrise/sunset (great for a fisherman) Overall an excellent app!
B0001UL7RY|3.0|All the songs sound way too similar... I like a couple, like Nobody's Home, but I guess Avril's music just really isn't my style. Her vocals are powerful, and not light. I think I prefer pop.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome and addictive :) love this app<br />can not get enough and can't go to bed without finishing a level :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|can be entertaining at times. some games are kinda lame, but pretty fun most the time. for a free app its good
0553801473|5.0|In honesty, this book is a tease. GRRM is created a unresolved story of chaos, and I think we can expect much and more from his next book. I guess I like being teased.<br /><br />My only disappointment was the lack of Davos in the book (WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST TEASE), he is by far my favorite POV after Arya fell off the face of the Westeros to do whatever the hell she's doing... I'd imagine GRRM has big plans for Arya and Bran, but I cannot hope to even guess at what that might be.<br /><br />Overall, it was well written. I love that GRRM has no mercy for the \\"hero's\\" of the story. I expect to see a lot more of Davos in the next book. I enjoyed this book, and hope you fella's did too.
0446585025|4.0|It was pretty funny. An easy read and entertaining. Ellen is such a funny person, it was fun getting to see little snippets of her life.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|So I thought this game was a lot of fun at first but then it takes a while to get past some of the levels and it takes a long time to get enough points to do a bunch of the games but other than that its great!!!
B0068TL23G|5.0|I really like this game, keeps the mind busy and is excellent for the kindle Fire.<br />Realmente me gusta este juego, mantiene la mente ocupada y es excelente para el Kindle Fire.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I should first say that two of my favourite books of all time are _Pillars Of The Earth_ and _The Winds Of War_.<br /><br />I had hoped that Follett would do for WWI and the Russian Revolution what Wouk did for WWII. I love these types of historical fiction, where the seemingly-dry events of days past come to life through the eyes of characters and the situations in which they find themselves.<br /><br />The first third of the book is extremely promising, as Follett brings all the players on stage and uses his superb skill at crafting characters to get the reader invested in this story.<br /><br />But then the worst thing happens. We get to the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and just as that set the world on a collision course, that event does the same thing for the book.<br /><br />I suspect that Follett wrote this during the same period that he was adapting (poorly) Pillars of the Earth for television. Because once the events unfold in Sarajevo the book turns into a horrible teleplay.<br /><br />There are still good narrative scenes surrounding the more private dramas of central characters but whenever Something Historical needs to happen, Follett falls back on Teleplay 101. He gets his characters in a room. Dinner Parties, brunches, tea--pick a meal, pick an excuse. Without fail he describes the food briefly and then has two characters on ideological opposing sides start having a \\"conversation\\" where he lays out the dueling ideologies of the time. From Sarajevo onward a full third of the book's text is comprised of expository dialogues set in the dining rooms and restaurants of the world. It feels both incredibly lazy and horribly contrived. This is, in my opinion, where \\"Show, Don't Tell\\" has become a curse to the writing world. Whereas Wouk doesn't shy away from infodumps in _Winds_, he does so in a way that completely engages the reader. Here Follett is \\"showing\\" by means of turning his infodumps into dialog. And it is boring, boring stuff.<br /><br />Thankfully there are still nuggets of interestingness when he backs away from the \\"As you know, Bob\\" method of writing and goes back to the small stories in the lives of his characters. These parts were all that kept me reading past the Battle of the Somme. (Seriously. He reduces one of the bloodiest, most tragic battles of the 20th Century into a brief narrative and a couple dialogue scenes with officers in dugouts. Over tea, of course.)<br /><br />If the book were smaller, it would have been better. If it were larger it might have been better. As it stands now, it's only merely a good book because of Follett's genius with characterisation. If you want a similar read I suggest either Wouk or (even, dare I say it) Jeffrey Archer.<br /><br />This is only recommended if you REALLY love Follett and are REALLY curious about what one British guy thinks about WWI and the evils of communism.s when he backs away from the \\"As you know, Bob\\" method of writing and goes back to the small stories in the lives of his characters.

B0071PS7AC|5.0|this game rocks I abalotly love it its great for aldults and kids its unbelivaby good I love it I can not put it down
B006GG1KOC|2.0|to easy for 11 year old please retkink buying this games really needs more levels I mastered this game in a matter of minutes
B0015DROBO|3.0|The first half is painful, a tech manual is more fun to read.  The family history with who begat who, which is important to the storyline, is difficult to follow for a while. But I liked the central characters and wanted to see what happened to them.  The second half of the book went much more quickly and held my attention.  I've purchased the second book to find out what happens next.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is super fun it is just awesome. but this game pays you for rating it in points gadbnmllljhg jhfddsdfgbhujjjkkjbv. hgdssfhb

B004I744AS|5.0|It's more than a dictionary, it's a learning tool. You can set up the home page with several information options (word of the day, this day in history, etc). I enjoy this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun little games to pass by time.  It takes a little while to get the hang of a few, but overall a good app.

B005MRXS78|1.0|Don't buy this item. As they say you get what you pay for is true. This pan tilt head only has one speed which is too fast for subjects at any distance and up close it's difficult to get it right. Midway during the pan the head often glitches and does not pan smoothly. The IR remote is difficult to use as well. The Camera person has to make sure to follow the receiver just right or the pan will glitch. You don't want to use a IR if you need a wireless remote on a pan tilt head. A brief review so hopefully someone avoid making a mistake. Carefully research your options and spend more with a multi speed and proper radio frequency e.g \\"2.4 GHZ\\" remote if required.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Unfortunately, a lot of apps and software do NOT work the way they're advertised. Either by design, or by buggy code. I'm happy to say the Splashtop app breaks this chain of misfortune. I have the server app installed on my home PC and have the Android app on both my Samsung Nexus S 4G running ICS and my HP Touchpad running ICS and it works perfectly everytime I've tried.<br /><br />The only negative I could find was it lacks encryption, but this does not concern me, as I don't do any sensitive computing over my cell phone.<br /><br />Video and audio playback works great. Now, don't expect video playback to be hundreds of frames per second, but videos are definitely watchable with (I'm guessing 20-25fps), which is a feat in itself. Sound playback is spot on. This is over a wifi connection, but to be honest, with a good 3G/4G signal there's very little difference. During testing, I intentionally drove to a \\"fringe\\" 3G reception spot and although performance was hindered, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I was able to use my PC to watch movies from the middle of the mall on my cell phone. Amazing.<br /><br />Again, thank you to the app developer for creating an app that does EXACTLY what it advertises.<br /><br />Recommended.
B006NFKUF6|5.0|This game was awesome but it needs to have a longer free tripe and should have a survival mode. Overall I like IT!

B006MHWXMS|4.0|I needed something that could grow with me, and this seems to be it. I have tried similiar apps and they just don't do what I want. Right now it lets me know when to take my medicine, reminds me when I have bills to pay, just normal everyday things that forgetful people forget. You can put a reminder in the event and then u can choose different intervals. when you make an adjustment, it will ask if you would like to change just one in the series or current and all future ones.  neat features, checklists, etc. my favorite part is being able to.  check off each task, whether its text or a list. needs a little work, but otherwise, its great! my least (minor) favorite parts are, no ability to change font, no personalization, etc. and the sorting option IS straightforward but can be frustrating to use. other than no calendar, it is still worth it as my complaints do not interfere with actually using the app.

1451627289|4.0|I don't write (or read) lengthy reviews.  The bottom line on this King novel is that it is fun to read.  It's not great literature that will be read in college classes one hundred years from now, it's just fun.  The most notable thing I can say about it is that King has departed from his \\"horror\\" and I for one welcome it.  There's no gross out descriptions like \\"Pet Cemetery\\" and no \\"supernatural entities\\" that control everything.  Yes, you have to accept the fact that time travel is possible, but that's really not new or unique.  You'll like the characters, the pace, the possiblities (who hasn't wondered how life would be if JFK hadn't been killed). Did I say it's \\"a fun read?\\"

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game keeps my seven year very entertained. It keeps her total attention. When she passes a level, she is so excited. I recommend this game to everyone.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good games.  not to hard to earn points for more games.  I like the darts one.  some are dumb but some are fun.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I give this book 5 stars.  I could not put it down.  Very well written and the ending was better than I had expected it to be.  Highly recommend this book.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I've owned this book since I was about 12 or so... Maybe 15... (I'm 25, now) I'm not sure anymore. I go back and read it again very couple of years. I finally got the kindle edition (on my iPad) a few months back and finally got around to reading it through again this past week. I couldn't put it down. I enjoy it every time. This time I'm looking at Speaker for the Dead... Haven't gotten it yet, though.  This time when I was reading it, my mom mentioned that she had seen a newsletter that Ender's Game was being made into a movie, starring Harrison Ford. Sure enough, March 15, 2013 (according to IMDB), with Ford playing as Colonel Graff. There were some scenes in the book that I wondered if they could even pull off (especially in the barracks -- anyone who's read it will probably know what I mean), but it's one I'd be kind of excited to go see.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|when I got it I was bored nowww I loooooove it so much so much fun and not boring at all
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I have tried every level and I am addicted to this game. It takes real skill and thinking, which is always a plus for a game. The challenge increase with each level, and you really have to think about how to shoot the birds to the right place. I found this game intriqing.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It has all the features would expect (hourly forecast, 5-day, and radar, which is lacking in another popular weather app)

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Unlike what you might think, this is not a baseball movie. OK, it is based on the true story of Baseball manager Billy Beane but the movie is made so it might as well be based on a basketball, football or stock-trading or just any other topic, because the true story behind this movie is how one man's vision and leadership managed to change his team and essentially to change the game (to some extent).  I like that the movie doesn't make Brad Pitt's character perfect. It shows some flaws and it certainly doesn't make him right all the time but eventually it is his leadership and vision that change the team and in every minute it's clear (in the movie at least) that everything that's going on in his team is his responsibility.  The entire cast is brilliant including every actor and actress in every little role. Too bad Robin Wright (no more \\"Penn\\" there...) only gets a small part. She is very good.  This is one of this year's best movies out there. I hope it will get some Oscars but I wouldn't count on it because it's not \\"Hollywood\\" enough.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love love,love this Bible App!  Have it on my cell phone and my Kindle Fire. Very quick and easy to use love the reader voice also....very rich voice ...not robotic sounding....

Teacher. I know this is not exactly the primary selling point of Steven King's massive new novel, but as a dedicated teacher myself, I am immensely grateful for King's sympathetic portrayal of a tough, rewarding profession.<br /><br />Jake Epping, small town English teacher is in for a very strange ride. The book opens at the end of the 2010 school year, with Jake alone in the staff room, still correcting AP English essays. He is remembering an essay from a student in an adult English class; the only piece of student writing to ever make him cry. He receives an unexpected, mysterious phone call.<br />What does this prosaic, homely, endearing portrait of a teacher's relationship to his students have to do with a time travel story involving the assassination of a president?  Everything. Jake's story comes together in an elaborate, nostalgic, convoluted saga that does, in the end, come full circle without any dangling thread of a story line.<br /><br />Any time travel story has to establish the method of travel in some believable fashion. Jake Epping's journey begins through a time portal in the storage room of Al's Diner. Al's is an art deco-style diner, housed in a silver trailer. The portal always opens to the same date in 1958. How appropriate. With the method of time travel established, Jake Epping and the reader begin to consider the uses of time travel and the possibility of changing the past to substantially alter the future. It is Al Templeton, the dying owner of Al's Diner & Time Portal, who convinces Jake that preventing Kennedy's assassination would prevent much death and suffering.  Jake agrees to take it on. He goes back to 1958 to make his way to Dallas and a fateful day in 1962.  A lot can happen in four years. King tells his story with great attention to the atmosphere of the decade and accurate historical detail. There is affectionate nostalgia for the community of a small town high school, and there is a love story. There are many moments of great suspense, and graphic scenes of violence, but they do not dominate the story. Eight hundred fifty pages, thirty-plus hours of listening, just flew by.<br /><br />The audio version is performed by Craig Wasson. I enjoyed his reading very much. King creates so many completely human, likable characters and every one of them is voiced believably. Wasson handled regional accents from Maine to Texas realistically without being overly exaggerated. I loved that he added a bit of Burt Lancaster to his pawn broker voice. I liked his Walter Cronkite better than his Chet Huntley impersonation, but both of them added flavor to the story.is affectionate nostalgia for the community of a small town high school, and there is a love story.

0061353248|4.0|This book gives an excellent introduction to the human irrationality, especially on making decisions.<br /><br />The discussions on relativity, arbitrary coherence, and effect of expectation clearly show how irrational human can be, and I suspect them to be related to deep issues on psychology and sociology. Also, the discussions on social norm, procastration, and options are interesting and practical.<br /><br />After reading the book, I start to wonder what in the book are really new. What I mean is some issues (e.g., ownership) are well known in psychology, but it is applied in a new context. On the other hand, I suspect that there exist some issues in the book which are not much discussed in existing studies, but gives totally new insight.<br /><br />I wonder how other people feel.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Defeat! After one day of use the App failed & redirected to makers webpage. Not worth the 99c. Game is OK, good for most ages.
B00005JMCN|5.0|My granddaughter (9 years old) loves horses and the movie really captured her. We have seen is several times.  SHE never tires of it.  It was a great transaction. No worries
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I was a little doubtful about reading this book, as Mark Russinovich is not an established novelist - he's a leading expert in operating system design and architecture for Microsoft. However, my fears were unfounded, and once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down.  The plot is very plausible, and narrative flows along nicely with a few well placed twists and turns. Highly recommended!

The main character is a Bloodstain splatter analyst who besides working for the police, In his spare time he finds and kills criminals who get away from the law, and finds \\"creative\\" ways to kill them. He trys to balance his work life with his family life, and his \\"Dark Passenger\\" life, all in all a great series for those who like dark humor tv shows.
B0071NLG0W|5.0|This is the third novel in the Amber Fox series and I think that this is the best one so far. I have enjoyed reading the others, [[ASIN:B003B3NYS8 The Fashion Police (Amber Fox Mystery No 1)]] and [[ASIN:B004VGWJYE Be Careful What You Wish For (Amber Fox Mystery No 2)]] but feel that each book has improved as the series progressed until this one, which is her best yet. We have come to know and care about the central characters, I especially like the chemistry between Amber and Brad; and there is plenty of comedy provided by Tia and Amber's dad. I thought that this is her best in the series so far because the story is more gripping and focussed than the earlier stories with an exciting plot. It was hard to put this book down and I read it in one day!

1594202842|3.0|This book is essentially a chronicle of Amy Chua's life as a mother and her interpretation and application of Chinese parenting. It is not particularly insightful, well-written, informative or interesting. I expected much more from the content and quality of writing considering how the book was about raising superior children who excelled at and mastered pretty much everything. The writing was not compelling or intelligent whatsoever--nothing on par with what I expected from a Yale law professor--and most of the content was anecdotes about drilling her daughters on their respective instruments and fighting with her daughter Lulu. Much of what was written just made Chua seem like a complete and unreasonable nut, which she was surprisingly aware of and insensitive to with regards to her husband and children. The book held my interest although it did get pretty repetitive, but I expected it to be more of an intelligent and reflective cultural comparison than a biography.

B00005QFE5|5.0|There are some movies that are just great films!  My wife and I almost turned it off as it starts out in black and white and because it is hard to know where it is going but hang in there. Like the wizard of oz, it picks up when it turns to color. It is one of the most heartfelt films we have ever seen. Not sappy at all, but will pull at your heartstrings.  Simple in it's entirety, even the expressions on this fine actress capture deep emotion.  This is a great film to see, and will become a favorite.  No kung fu, or \\"action\\" but captures the essence of the heart.  A 10!  well done.  unlike a lot of american films which are so 'visually stimulating', this takes the time to develop the charectors and emotions.

B004LWZW4M|1.0|My daughter highly recommended it to us. The first half of the movie is so boring, and just nausiating.  We kept waiting for it to improve, but never did!! This movie is terrible. No redeeming qualities at all, and at the end, we were both incredulous, that we wasted our time.  On a scale of 1 to 10.....a minus 10. Don't waste your time or money. I almost saw it in the theater. glad I didn't. Go see Tintin instead!!

0385534639|5.0|Dear Mr. Clarke,  I am writing briefly to thank you for taking me on such a magical journey through your circus.  By a stroke of sheer coincidence, without any foreknowledge whatsoever, I began the journey last night somewhere around sundown.  Needless to say I was entranced from the very first footstep, and as has happened to me on only a handful of occasions during my lifetime, I literally could not bring myself to stop.  I made the entire journey without pausing for sleep or the myriad of other real-world demands; this was not entirely troublesome as the journey was somewhat like a dreamy sleep itself and I much prefer your world to the real one anyway.  I will not take up too much more of your valuable time.  I find myself rather reluctantly awake now and in a rather befuddled state of mind, as if trying to grasp remnants of a fading dream.  I lit a candle on the wishing tree last night... but until my wish comes true I must return to the real world clinging to the hope that the circus will appear again some cloudless night and that I can journey through her iron-wrought gates once more.  In Memoriam,  Joshua G. VanDerWouden  rêveur reconnaissant

B004JZBGWI|1.0|I was looking forward to having this app, and very disappointed with it.  I installed it twice, thinking I may have skipped something the first time.  Just don't see what the use of a \\"sticky\\" note is when it doesn't show up on my Nextbook 7's homepage.  The only way of knowing there IS a note is by the icon on the top of my tablet where the clock, battery, etc are.  Will be looking for another app.

0307593312|2.0|OK, so this novel wasn't as terrible as After Dark. It was also not as terrible as What We Talk About When We Talk About Running (if you were to broadly compare his fiction and non-fiction in terms of \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\"). Personally, I feel like Murakami has been trying to reinvent himself. 1Q84, though, doesn't stray far from his favorite tropes and stylings.  To not ruin it for people who haven't read the book, I'm not going to talk about the plot of this novel. I'll just say that it lacked the substance of The Wind Up Bird Chronicle, for example. In fact, it was trying to do things that were very similar, but it fell short. There were some loose ends in the story which didn't make much sense even if you suspended disbelief. The book could have also used a good editor. I wouldn't call reading it a slog, but it could've used a judicious eye. Maybe because it's US release was rushed or because Murakami has gotten \\"too big,\\" as a writer, to edit, this just didn't happen.  If you're a Murakami fan, you're going to read this book anyway. And you're going to enjoy it in places because it's going to remind you of what his novels were like and what they could be when they lived up to their full potential.  If you're not a fan and are picking up a Murakami novel for the first time, I'd recommend you start with anything else. Namely--and these were the novels that made me fall in love with him--The Wind Up Bird, Kafka on the Shore, South of the Border West of the Sun, even his early stuff like Pinball 1967 (might be getting the year in the title wrong), or Hear the Wind Sing. Those novels really captured your imagination, tugged at your emotions, and left you with something you'd remember for a long time.  1Q84 is an OK story but there is a vapidness to it. Even though the novel is 1000 pages long, you don't feel a deep connection to the characters. It's like Murakami was too hung up creating an epic, his next masterpiece; too distracted to craft this love story with love. And it's too bad that he's being recognized for this \\"epic\\" novel now, even though his previous works were the real epics. But isn't that how things happen in western literature? When you're producing your best work, your magnum opus, they don't read you; when you're at the end of your career, writing mediocre novels to stay afloat, they laud you as the \\"best writer of our century,\\" or some such bs. I'm not excusing the fact that this novel was mediocre, it's just unfortunate that he didn't get recognized earlier, when he deserved it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Well worth the 0 dollars! It is fun and addicting! I think it should have a few ways to help you beat the games in it because I am stuck on about 2 of them.

I Played it relentlously, however, it has decided to revert to a much larger size.  My Kindle Fire screen can no longer see it in its entirety or even play it. This is so frustrating....  Hopefully, yours will not convert for larger screen display. Please fix this problem because it keeps me from playing the game now.

B003Q6D1Z6|5.0|Having lived near Ishpeming Michigan for many years before moving out east, I knew immediately that something was awry with the photos of the characters.  But this movie is so full of interesting and sensitive twists and turns that it is absolutely gripping.  I don't for a minute think this was faked ala Blair Witch.  It is just too true to be comfortable for most people.  Bravo to the filmmakers for following it to the difficult end.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|Rocky was released in 1976 and earned the #78 spot on the AFI top 100. It is a powerful testament to this movie's strength that here I am, a female and not someone who watches boxing, and I adored the movie. There are just so many layers in here to appreciate.<br /><br />Rocky is a barely-making-it boxer who is struggling to do the best he can. He knows this life is very hard, but he feels he has little other choice. He diligently keeps chasing a woman who works at a local pet shop, even though she barely gives him any encouragement. He sees beyond her plain appearance and shyness and appreciates her love of animals and her gentle nature.<br /><br />Then, fate intervenes. An African-American boxer is in town and no whites will fight him. They all invent excuses. Abusive language is thrown around like \\"jig clowns\\". It is upsetting to realize that there are people out there who will be so nasty just because of someone's birth skin color. Rocky gets chosen out of a list simply because of his name - \\"Italian Stallion\\" - to be offered the fight. There is no expectation that this dirt-bottom boxer will even slightly hold his own against the champ.<br /><br />Rocky doesn't even get much time to train. He has to go from his barely-making-it status to being in the center of a publicity whirlstorm. He has doubts. He is realistic. But his girlfriend believes in him, and she herself blossoms and flowers under his gentle care. She was told by life that she had to rely on her brains because she didn't have much of a body. Rocky was told the opposite. It really shows how much people are shaped by the world around them and its negative messages.<br /><br />Even the side characters shine. Rocky tries his best to redirect a young teen girl who is throwing her life away. She's abusive in return. Again we see just how much people get set onto a path and find it hard to escape.<br /><br />I have parakeets and I admit to loving how parakeets are infiltrated into the movie :) The ad-libbing with them is great!<br /><br />Even though I knew how the movie was going to end, I had tears in my eyes. It is just that powerful.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ng with them is great!<br /><br />Even though I knew how the movie was going to end, I had tears in my eyes.

0385341008|5.0|I just read the most marvelous book: The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows. I picked it up and did not set it down until I had read all of it. Now I want to go back and read it to savor the wonderful word phrases (including the wonderful title!).<br /><br />I was touched by The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. The curious title got my attention from the beginning. I picked up the book and opened a random page. I skimmed a few pages and decided to get it. Then it sat, waiting on the kitchen table for more than a week! Today I picked it up and fell in. Wonderful characters, fascinating story, and very well written. One of a few books I want to read again.<br /><br />On page 116 Juliet writes: \\"Have you ever noticed that when you mind is awakened or drawn to someone new, that person's name suddenly pops up everywhere you go? My friend Sophie calls it coincidence, and Mr. Simpless, my parson friend, calls it Grace. He thinks that if one cares deeply about someone or something new one throws a kind of energy out into the world, and 'fruitfulness' is drawn in.\\" Brian Tracy calls this the Law of Attraction. I find it fascinating to experience this phenomenon while I am reading this book! It is as if the lead character - Juliet - is encouraging me and showing me that my dream is not only possible but also can be a continuing source of joy.

My parents and sister were at my house for Christmas and when we tryed to watch our beloved movie, no go.  I went on-line and found a copy in DVD.  It arrived a couple of weeks later.

There is something about this series, or more appropriate, the world in this series, that just grabs you.  I don't usually overlook sloppy writing but I sure overlooked it in these books because of the content.  The violence is a little contrived but I overlooked that as well.  This is a very entertaining series.

B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Remember when the Athletic A's won 20 straight games?  Neither do I. But this is the basis for the movie Moneyball. Brad Pitt stars as Athletic A's General Manager Billy Beane.  Back in the day, Beane was drafted into the Pros right out of High School on the promise that he was going to be one of the greatest ball players in the history of baseball. Alas, this prophecy did not pan out. Beane never grew into the athlete the scouts imagined he would become, and after multiple trades, he became a scout and then GM of the A's.  After losing three of their greatest players to the Yankees, Beane realizes they will never compete with the kind of money teams like New York or Boston are willing to throw around. He visits Cleveland for a possible trade and meets a fresh-from-Yale gradutate, played by Jonah Hill.  Hill's ideas about players and how the stats come into play for scouts intrigues Beane who hires him as his new Assistant.  Of course, their new ways of doing things upsets the veteran scouts and even the team's field manager. (Philip Seymour Hoffman)  How could a bunch of no-namers lead a team to victory?  I was impressed with Jonah Hill. I have grown tired of his kind of comedy so it was refreshing to see him in a semi-serious role next to the always-great Pitt. And Philip Seymour Hoffman can hit any role out of the park.  This is a decent baseball movie. It tacks on the added bonus of being based on actual events. So even though you may know how the movie will end, it's fun to see how things worked out behind the scenes.  The only downside was the length. There were many times I felt it could have ended or, at least, cut out a few scenes to make it not as long. Of course it could have been that I was tired and ready for bed but had to finish the film first...
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|When they won a few awards at the Golden Globes, I thought I must give this show a chance. I had heard of it earlier but thought it's some sort of a show about a moving circus. Then I saw Peter Dinklage's amazing body language upon receiving the Golden Globe for acting. I was still not convinced about whether or not I should see this show so I asked a knowledgable friend if this was anywhere in the league of Spartacus. He said it was maybe the best tv show he had ever seen putting aside the Sopranos and The Wire (former my favorite, latter his all time favorite) so anyway I decided I must watch.<br /><br />The show is based on kings, seven kingdoms, dragons, magic, demons, jesters, men, harlots, a very bleak sense of humor sometimes almost too cruel but the direction is absolutely stellar which means despite having such a prodigious quantity of creatures and characters, the show maintains a thoroughly engaging plot and script.<br /><br />At the end of the first show, I sat at my screen unblinking and revered by what had transpired. The last four episodes of this season were so engaging that I saw them one after another. The ninth episode called Baelor is when I stood up in front of my television screen hurling words and pumping my fist in the air. I don't clearly remember but it was a scene in TROY which made me do something like this almost a decade back.<br /><br />Anyhow, all characters, whether likable or despicable, seem to have a stranglehold to them.<br /><br />And yes, it would be safe to add GAME OF THRONES to the lineage created by many first seasons like \\"Prison Break\\" , \\"Lost\\" , \\"Spartacus\\" , \\"Sopranos\\" as one of the most REMARKABLE and unobtrusive study of the land. I, however, secretly think this may just turn out to be the greatest television series ever. Writing a review for something of this magnitude isn't easy. And oh, Ned Stark and his younger daughter were among my two favorite characters of this show. Can't wait till April for the second season.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|Product just as described- not any darker or lighter in color, brown strip is actually a handle (could be if you want it to).  Good sturdy material. No complaints so far!
B005LAIIS0|4.0|I saw this hoping that I would like it as much as I anticipated, but the ending kind of disappointed me. I did enjoy the movie and I felt the movie did a great job at making us(the audience) seem to want to seek vengeance upon those vicious wolves, but I guess we have to use our own imagination by the time the credits roll at the end. Kind of an open ending. Don't get me wrong. I like it when films do that, but I don't think it worked for me here. I wanted more but didn't get it. However, I did really enjoy the movie overall. Great acting, good directing, and interesting characters. I give it 4 stars! I wanted to give it 5 but watch the ending and you'll see my reason for removing a star from a potential 5 star movie.<br /><br />Updated: Okay, the fact that you have to sit through the entire credits to see the conclusion in theaters is still unfair!

B00000I8BX|5.0|The theme of this album is nothing new but excellently executed.  Burton's imagination and lyrical prowess reaches a level of artistry and passion which seems to define him and the band. The musicianship is tight, precise and somewhat indicative of the story.  I've had this album since it was released some twelve-plus years ago and has never faltered or become monotonous.  If you like metal; especially the industrial heavy stuff, this should be a no-brainer. Now on the subject of their genre; whereas industrial metal seems, to me at least, kinda flat and messy, Fear Factory managed to add an organic nature to the music. Raymond's drumming broke ground and I believe set the bar for most metal drummers today.  Dino's guitar playing is sharp and technical (although, in my opinion, sometimes struggles with melody)and his overall sound adds to the organic nature of their music. Christian, while he doesn't really ever break free from the guitar lines, follows Dino's extremely fast riffs with precision. On this album I think their chemistry comes together with true alacrity.  Buy this album.

B005FITIIC|5.0|If you have business experience and already understand what caused the financial meltdown, you're likely to enjoy this movie.  Rather than getting into a lot of technical details about the financial aspects, it depicts the kind of Wall Street people who were involved and what they were thinking and doing when they first realized they had a massive bursting bubble on their hands (and books).  We see that they're people who are, for the most part, highly paid to the extent of taking their incomes for granted, coldly calculating, and lacking a moral compass.  In the end, it's about putting their personal interest above that of others, regardless of who might be harmed, provided that no laws are apparently being broken.<br /><br />Personally, I found this movie gripping.  Through great acting and story, and without over the top gimmicks, it maintains an austere tension which is almost understated yet very powerful. And Jeremy Irons is particularly mesmerizing in his role as CEO.
0385534639|5.0|I know my review is coming late to the party, there are 725 reviews posted before mine, but I just finished The Night Circus and felt compelled to say something.  It's a wonderful story told in a wonderful way. Some reviewers complained about the slowness of the first half of the novel and the wonderful pace of the second half. I would suggest that the second half seems to move so quickly as a direct result of the first half doing its job so well, of setting up the characters, the scenes, and the intrigue which ties them all together. Some stories don't need to be a horse race from start to finish, and this, in my opinion, is one of them.  Some reviewers complained of flat characters, but I might suggest that they missed the main character, which is the night circus, and it is the circus which is drawn out so well, in beautiful detail. I found the characters to be very three-dimensional when defined within the context of how they interacted with and/or contributed to the circus. Their depth is revealed in their contributions. When you see the creative output of a person, do you not see the depth of that person as well? That's how I saw the characters. I felt I knew more about the clockmaker, Herr Friedrick Thiessen, from the clocks he designed than anything else the author told me about him. His clock was three-dimensional, and thus he was as well.  I would recommend this novel to anyone who would enjoy a well-told story. The fact that it is also a unique story is just a bonus.

0142402753|3.0|We love this book, my two year old eats up all the books from this author and illustrator. I would give it 5 stars, but I am a little unsure as to why the title has been changed from the original \\"Smartest Giant in Town' title it is sold under in the UK (which is where we bought our copy and brought back to the States). I know that in America we don't really use the term 'smart' to describe a way one might dress, but I always thought it seemed clever as he was 'smart' as in he was dressed smartly but he was also'smart' as in his behaviors were the right thing to do. I'm disapppointed that the publisher thought it necessary to change the title to 'Spiffiest' which just sounds silly and vain. I am now wondering if we should buy any of the other books on the US market and if they will be similarly changed, or if we should just go direct to the UK site to order.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|If I could this movie would get 3 1/2 stars...only because the special affects are awesome. The story line is...hmm, maybe 1 1/2 stars. Very predictable with the bad Russian Dude, the rich bratty kids and the divorced irresponsible husband....I believe it is worth the price (9.99) just for seeing the waves wash over the Himalayas and the Aircraft Carrier crashing into the White House upside down,  You need an HD TV to enjoy.
0142405809|5.0|The Snail and the Whale is a modern classic and a true must-have for your child's library. A good friend gave it to my son when he was born and we didn't get around to cracking it open until he was about 18 months and it has been a firm favorite ever since. It is written beautifully and is a perfect bedtime story as it is so lyrical and soothing. I cannot recommend this one highly enough. I literally feel like we've been in a magical world after we are done reading!

B005FLX2WC|5.0|I admit to never hearing about Beth Hart before, and I bought this on the strength of Joe's reputation, but I was more than pleasantly surprised. I gave the album a high rotation playing, enjoying it more and more with each listen.  While Beth Hart growls out some fantastic earthy blues vocals, Joe supports and compliments her with some subtle and restrained guitar licks. Every so often, just often enough really, he lets loose with a few screaming smoky solos.  A fantastic partnership from 2 amazing performers, hopefully more will follow and maybe even a tour DownUnder too?
B00007GZR5|5.0|Chris Nielsen (Williams) and Annie Collins (Sciorra) marry and have two children. They seem to enjoy their blissful success, but it doesn't last very long. Both of their children are killed in a car crash, and now Chris and Annie are more disconnected than ever. One year later, Chris himself is killed in a car accident, and he is sent to heaven. There, he discovers his power to create anything that is produced in his own mind. Albert (Gooding, Jr.), his longtime mentor, guides him through the process.<br /><br />What Dreams May Come is a very beautiful film. Even if it's very different from the original novel (which I have never read, by the way), it does its job very well with its fantastic visuals. The heavenly landscapes created by the human mind are very creative: special effects are particularly stunning. The plot may be a little thin, but the most important elements in this film are the visuals. The acting is also satisfactory: Robin Williams plays yet another dramatic role without a hitch. He is completely convincing as a man who [almost] finds himself in harmony in heaven. Annabella Sciorra is lovely and memorable as Collins who is struggling to cope with her huge personal loss. Cuba Gooding Jr. gives a terrific performance as Albert: it's clear that he is enjoying himself with the role.<br /><br />What Dreams May Come is not perfect, but it's still a beautiful film. I admire it for its stunning visuals and for its wonderful performances.<br /><br />Grade: 8.7 out of 10

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I bought this amplifier because my Asus EEE Transformer's volume output for video media wasn't loud enough. Sidewalk traffic would drown out the sound of the tablet. This amplifier allows me to crank it up or turn it down as I need to. It even has a little clip so you can attach it to your shirt or jacket (very handy). It's not nearly as heavy as I expected it to be, and the micro-usb charger gets it to full charge in very little time. The only drawback I can see at all is that there doesn't appear to be any kind of gauge or signal to indicate that the battery power is getting low.<br /><br />This amplifier is terrific.

0307949435|5.0|I got this book for my sister in law and some friends who wanted to know how I lost so much weight in 4 months(30 lbs). I originally read the book Good calories, Bad calories by the same author which is pretty long and very detailed and this is the slimmed down version. All you have to do is cut down on carbs and this explains why and also explains all the dieting mythos that dont work even though they are pushed by the govt and medical\\"professionals\\". you dont have to count calories and exercise your butt off to lose weight. All I did was limit myself to around 50 grams of carbs a day and eat all the protein and fat I want. I have not changed anything else. I do not exercise more or starve myself, just no carbs and I lost 30 lbs in 4 months. I have tried all that calorie counting stuff in the past and if you think about it all those diet meals have pasta, pasta and more pasta and you exercise like crazy just to lose like 10 lbs and then it stops. This works and besides what have you got to lose besides some extra weight.
1586487981|4.0|Inteligent book with a first class research. The authors revise each approach to poverty and its traditional ways of elimination.  It should be read by anyone dedicated to the subject. Congratulations. José
1416583432|5.0|really liked this book. It explained why dogs do some things I've always considered weird and reinforced things that I've always believed about my dogs that my wife thought was crazy on my part. I do believe that dogs are very smart if given the right environment and training. I believe you should actually know your dog by talking to them and doing more than just feeding and petting.
1594202842|2.0|I'm Asian; unassuming strangers seems to think I'm like Amy Chua.  The number of conversations beginning on such a premise are astounding.  That's why I had to read the book.  It wouldn't have been fair to critique her methods without hearing her point of view first.  I found her exactly as I thought I would, even while trying to keep an open-mind.  The book is trite; the author is robot-like, lacking the elements which create human relationships that last.  For a Harvard graduate and Yale professor to make so many simplistic assumptions about others throughout her book is so absurd, that alone merits a read.  For instance, according to Chua, playing percussion leads to the use of illicit drugs.  Fascinating?  Yes.  Food for thought?  Not really.  It does, however, give a glimpse into a culture that produces numerous prodigies as well as suicides.  I give it a mixed review.  I'm open to hearing what she has to say, but it really didn't move me or bring me any closer to accepting her point of view.  Chua on the other hand, is taking her royalty checks and laughing at us all the way to the bank.
B0042K6HRO|4.0|I ended up watching the entire series using my Netflix streaming service because it was included in the price of our subscription.  Initially, I thought the show wouldn't be able to keep my interest.  Sure, the girl is hawt but kind of scrawny in a vegetarian kind of way.  It just didn't seem credible that such a frail frame would be able to actually kick the butt required to accomplish her objectives.  But, after a while that kind of floats to the back of your mind and the stories, which are pretty well written, take over your attention.  I wouldn't have paid $2 per show but it was well worth watching as a part of my already paid for Netflix service.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Much opinion has been expressed here about who is better in this role or that, which recording is a \\"favorite\\" etc. What seems lacking is a historical perspective on the recording and the cast. In that consideration, we see even more the impact of this recording.  The live Turandot of the 1960s and 70s was unquestionably Birgit Nilsson. Her silver-wrapped lightening voice soared through the house, rode over the orchestra in a bath of sheer brilliance and power. She jokingly referred to singing Turandot as a good warmup to get her ready for singing Isolde. The excitement of Nilsson and Corelli live on stage, battling it out was legendary. No one else at the time or since could carry the role on stage with such convincing power and coolness.  Dame Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti had been singing together on and off for 7 years or so when this project came long. They were the \\"hottest\\" singers at the time, having revived Bel Canto opera and moved it far more forward than had been possible in the 1950s with Callas. In 1972, it seemed no one thought Sutherland should record this. Not many thought Pavarotti could either, though his laser-like focus was not so different from Nilsson's, although rather smaller. Critics couldn't wait to line up and decry this \\"vanity project\\". Sutherland herself had to be convinced. It was not her \\"fach\\". She would never have attempted to sing it live in the theatre, mainly for the type of wear-and-tear performing this role regularly would inflict on her voice. She also would not try to step into the incredibly large shoes Nilsson was still wearing around the world's opera houses. She was interested in preserving her Bel Canto reputation, had many more operas of that genre on her list of operas to accomplish live and recorded. She was also in the midst of a French Romantic revival led by her husband Richard Bonynge. What Bonynge knew, as certainly Decca and Mehta knew, was that this role was a chance for Sutherland to use ALL of her voice. Let the enormous instrument soar over the orchestra (and chorus -- listen to Gloria, Gloria...after the riddle scene). In fact in hindsight we see that Turandot and Esclarmonde (Massenet) were the only two roles she sang which did in fact show off the full range of her voice, especially sonically. She was able to just sing out with all her might and power.  In the end, critics lined up to praise this recording. Even those who were quite dedicated to disliking Dame Sutherland [however, she was not yet Dame Joan]. It is almost universally considered to be the greatest Turandot recorded. Sutherland brought steel and ice with and undertone of innocence and warmth, eventually allowing that warmth to show through. The ease with which she navigates from top to bottom and back to top again is breathtaking and a testament to her incredible technique. This comes as more surprising since the role sits low for Sutherland. With a top note of \\"C\\" [a third lower than her high notes people were used to hearing], this was another reason people did not expect her to deliver the goods. Since that C was not so high for her, she approaches and sings it every time with such little effort, while many sopranos of great stature and voice sing it and let you know they are working! Sutherland had received criticism constantly about her diction, yet it is so clear on this recording, except in the notes above the staff, which is perfectly normal for any singer.  Pavarotti had shoes to fill as well, since several great dramatic and spinto tenors had sung the role of Calaf in the time leading up to this recording. Franco Corelli was accepted as the major Calaf of his time, becoming one of his signature roles. Del Monaco, Bjoerling, DeStfano had sung it, each with his own special turn on the role, all with a big sound. I personally still give the edge to Corelli's Nessun dorma over all others, but not his studio recordings. You have to hear him sing it live to appreciate it. Virility in sound, passion and fire. Yet, Pavarotti brought to the table that focused voice that cut through an orchestra and rode to the top of the house with clarity. There is passion in Pavarotti's voice. There is his unique sound and his unparalleled technique. Lastly, like Sutherland, the range was not so challenging for him, so he was able to work on his focus and strength. His note is also top C. He brings to the role an evenness along with Sutherland's evenness, yet his voice never sounds strained, and always sounds masculine.  What really works here is that these two great artists, who step out of fach for a studio recording, rise to the top of the crop of such great signers and recordings which came before. Nilsson and Corelli were recording at EMI, like Callas, and the warm, technical masterful sound of Decca adds to the merits of this recording. EMI liked microphones so close to the singers you could hear them breathe in. Corelli's high B in Nessun dorma distorts on the EMI studio recording. He is careful in his studio recordings as well, having been attacked by critics for non-musical singing, portamento and such. He comes alive in the opera house. Pavarotti and Sutherland sing this studio recording as if they were live on stage. The excitement is palpable.  Montserrat Caballe brought to the table her famous pianissimo high notes, luscious tone and warmth and beauty. Exactly what is needed in Liu, who must be a beautiful lyric as well as portray innocence and sadness, yet loyal and in love with Calaf to the death. Before Ms. Caballe came such voices as Renata Tebaldi, who sang the role with liquid beauty and gold. Caballe is wonderful as Liu and equal to her predecessors as well.  Lastly, the smaller roles are nods to older singers of great merit, historically pairing them with the superstars headlining the bill. Ghiaurov was in his mid-forties, but Peter Pears as the Imperatore was a surprising but well-thought addition to the cast. He is in his 60s on this recording,making it easy for him to portray the elderly emperor. This was sometimes the tradition at many performances to have a revered elder tenor sing this role. Pears is frighteningly convincing here.  Finally the forces gathered under Zubin Mehta's sure hand are icing on the cake. The orchestra and chorus are spectacular, perfect in every way for this. Decca's top-notch recording technique is unparalleled. Taken together, all these things make this a rare and marvelous recording, one that every opera buff should own, one that lovers of Turandot should not be without. It is simply a \\"must-have\\". It is not the \\"only\\" Turnadot one should have, for one cannot discount the century's greatest live singers of these roles. The joy is comparing that steel in Nilsson, driving forward with her iron will with the gold-wrapped iron of Sutherland, able to take \\"In questa reggia\\" at a comfortably broad pace. Sutherland accomplishes what many singers dream -- setting down for posterity the pinnacle of performance of a role. She seemed to do it more times than not. Lucky are we who get to hear.
B000PFUA9G|3.0|This album is fine. I like Brad Paisley's voice, so had purchased this several years ago. There are some good, well-known songs on this CD - but a lot of lesser known ones too.

1596680296|5.0|I have spent days and days looking thru sock patterns and books for beginning (or even experienced) knitters and been very discouraged. I have very large feet (Women's size 11, Euro 42) and so, so, so many sock patterns are written for 'women's size 8' feet...or say 'small, medium and large' with No Clue what sizes (either in inch measurements or in shoe sizes) that means.  Then there are the books that have a couple of patterns for large feet (or men's socks) but inevitably the sock you love most is in a completely different size than your feet. It's very discouraging.  This book not only shows you how to measure your feet for correctly fitting socks...Every Single Pattern in this book is written for Every Single Size (by circumference in inches if you have it, or shoe size if you do not)...from children's medium to adult large!  This should be the First Purchase for every beginning knitter who wants to knit socks!!!

1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 is not only Stephen King's best novel in years, it's one of his best novels. The genre is time travel and it's informed by Jack Finney's (The Body Snatchers) Time and Again (highly recommended also), as well as Back to the Future--but familiar ideas are always transformed by King to transcend their original source. Although at 849 pages, the novel could've been edited for pace a little, you spend time in a world you regret leaving when the journey is done, and you regret leaving the characters even more. While it's difficult to review 11/22/63 without major spoilers, I can say that it's emotional and sweet; but be forewarned that King's work always has sharp teeth.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|and fun and I enjoy the games. the anamations are basic but hey whatever. one more star once the graphics and stuff start to get better. sometimes it takes me a minute to figure out what to do because I don't understand the directions right away.
B00003CWOL|3.0|Kevin Smith's unflinching onslaught upon organized religion that masks its intentions under the guise of an over-indulgent, goofy stoner road trip. Although he's chewing on some very thick meat in this one, a weighty, opinionated take on a touchy subject isn't quite enough to compensate for the sheer volume of quirks and trademarks the writer/director once again puts up on display. Every on-screen character speaks in long, unbroken monologues; basically mouthpieces for Smith himself. Jay and Silent Bob, the inessential links to Smith's earlier films, feel shoehorned into a plot that would've worked just as well (if not better) without them. Punchlines are virtually spelled out along the bottom of the screen, or glaringly in the backgrounds. It's a pity, because the film does have some valid points about the shortcomings of organized religion and the evolution of spirituality - particularly Catholicism - but amidst so much sinewy excess that central message is nearly clouded beyond interpretation. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, still fresh from the success of Good Will Hunting, turn in strong performances as ignorant fallen angels but ultimately find little else to work with.

B000002O9S|5.0|I remember my dad and his brother staying up all night listening to the blues when I was a child, (and supposed to be asleep)... Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Albert Collins, Buddy Guy, and BB King, just to name a few. I was just around nine or ten and had no clue what the heck I was listening to, but I knew I liked it. It was raw, soulful, and real.  Well, from then on I was hooked. My father is passed now, and this is the album I keep coming back to that reminds me of him. I may be a bit biased but I do believe this may just be the best acoustic blues album ever made. The recording quality is stellar, and Muddy is, well, flawless. I love that I can here the creeks in his wooden chair as he moves around while performing. Like I said, for my money, it just doesn't get any better than this.

0375842209|2.0|This was the first book I've read by Zusak, and I found it hard to get through. The problem was the writer's habit of writing down to the reader. He seems to think it's necessary to explain his points, even when they're clearly made. For example, after describing acts of kindness done by one of the story's characters, he tells us, \\"She was a good woman.\\" It appears that he doesn't trust us to draw such conclusions for ourselves. Or maybe he doesn't trust himself to tell a story well.  In any case, I found the writing ham-fisted, perhaps appropriate for readers in the 9-13 age group but not for older - or for that matter, more sophisticated - readers.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games main characters are Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark.  Some important minor characters are Haymitch and Effie.  Peeta and Katniss are very likeable characters.  Katniss really likes the outdoors and is a great hunter. She is mentally strong, courageous and has great will to live. Peeta is more of a home body. He is shy and is often timid to do things that Katniss does with ease. Haymitch and Effie are Katniss and Peeta's guides for the Hunger Games. Haymitch is a drunk but does help Katniss and Peeta a lot before and during the hunger games.  Effie also helps a lot but is rude at times to both Peeta and Katniss.  The external conflict for both Peeta and Katniss is surviving the Games.  This shows Character vs. Character because they must fight and kill all 22 other tributes in the Games.  The internal conflict is Character vs. Self. It is this because Katniss and Peeta must come over the will to give up in the Games.  The reaping at the beginning really gets the story rolling.  The reaping is when names are chosen at random. The names chosen will be entered into the Hunger Games. There is two names chosen from all 12 districts. The Games start with opening ceremonies.  Katniss and Peeta made a bang with their costumes that had real flames. After the opening ceremonies the games are just around the corner and it gets everyone excited for the games to begin.   I really liked this novel. It was one of the best read. I liked how it made you feel like you really knew Katniss. It was written in first person so you knew exactly what Katniss was thinking about. The first person point of view was also bad at times too. You really didn't know what the other characters were truly thinking. I like how there was constantly something happening so it was never boring to read. The games had so much action that there was never a down time. Also there was always suspense so I never wanted to set the book down. Suzanne Collins always used foreshadowing to keep all readers reading so they could find out what truly happened.  I would strongly recommend this book to others.  I would do this because the book was very well written.  There was always suspense and action to keep me and probably you as well interested.

It's relaxing to play, the battery lasts a long time, there's no need to drag cards around on the screen, and the back button immediately takes you back to your desktop and saves your game so you can go back any time later and resume playing where you had left off. All in all a very nice addition to my carefully chosen collection of apps.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|WARNING: I GIVE YOU HEAVY CLUES/HINTS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT MIDNIGHT WHICH TAKES PLACE EARLY IN THE FILM. I DO NOT CONSIDER THIS TO BE A \\"SPOILER\\" BUT OTHERS MIGHT.<br /><br />The film opens with a lengthy jazz tune while showing us the splendor, romance, and fantasy of Paris to set the mood. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a role Woody Allen wrote for his alter-ego. He is a Hollywood hack writer wanting nothing more than to be a struggling novelist living in Paris in the 1920's. He is engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams). Like Woody's other main characters, he recognizes when people are pretentious and pseudo-intellectuals such as Inez's friends. This is a running theme in his productions either in front of or behind the camera. Hint: If you couldn't understand why Allen is a genius from his other films, feel free to skip this one.<br /><br />Gil desires to move to Paris. Inez is somewhat Republican and can't imagine living anywhere but the USA. One evening the two couples are out. Three of them want to go dancing while Gil does not. Instead he opts to take a nice leisurely stroll back to the hotel. Unfortunately he didn't drop any bread crumbs and like too many Americans in Paris he doesn't speak French so he can't ask for directions. (If you have ever been to Paris you know all those French can speak English, but won't because they enjoy watching us struggle with their language.)<br /><br />Then at midnight...Allen creates a whole movie around one of his old stand up comedy bits come to be known as \\"The Lost Generation\\" [...] which goes like this:<br /><br />\\"I mentioned before that I was in Europe. It's not the first time that I was in Europe, I was in Europe many years ago with Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway had just written his first novel, and Gertrude Stein and I read it, and we said that is was a good novel, but not a great one, and that it needed some work, but it could be a fine book. And we laughed over it. Hemingway punched me in the mouth.<br /><br />\\"That winter Picasso lived on the Rue d'Barque, and he had just painted a picture of a naked dental hygenist in the middle of the Gobi Desert.

0385341008|5.0|This book is available in digital format from my public library,  so it cost me nothing to read.  However,  now that I have read through it,  I'm sure I will want to read it again.  I am considering buying the book.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end.  I liked the author's seemingly uncomplicated use of letter-writing to tie the chararacters together and weave an interesting and entertaining story.  I felt like I was being allowed to read these peoples' personal mail--often things you would say only to a dear friend. Perhaps my literary needs are not as sophisticated as those who have posted negative reviews.  Or, maybe they just didn't get it.  I did \\"get it\\"; and I loved it.<br /><br />Not everyone is expected to love every book that is published.  That is why I use the public library.  The books are free,  and with a digital book, if I don't like it, I don't even have to leave home to \\"return\\" it.

B005QI4TP8|2.0|My feelings and inpressions of Florence are not favorable.  I'm sure that those who have greatly favored this work are indeed fanatical hypnotic fans of Florence.  Unfortunately, my feeings are that Music is a mysterious connection between body, mind/soul and spirit.  Somewhere along that line, it seems the Florence becomes a black hole of self-indulgent masturbation and self-impressed expression.  For me, it's nauseating.  Indeed, the backup band is GREAT!  How they tolerate being subordinate to the self-indulgences and verbal grunts of Florence amazes me and is to be commended.  Luckily, it's nice to see someone like Florence who is earning money rather than drawing upon mentally crippling disability, I feel.

B003R0LBVW|4.0|In this story we meet smart, talented, and well off individuals who benefit from every opportunity of modern American society.  However, every character is in competition with someone or some principle by which they feel threatened.  Their freedom to chose, to dominate, and to compete ultimately inhibits their ability to develop honest relationships.  In pursuit of their own agendas, they keep secrets and ultimately hurt and disappoint each other over and over.  In spite of all of the pain, the theme of forgiveness is woven throughout, which keeps the read from being too depressing.  My only criticism of this book is that there seemed to be little to no middle.  The author develops the characters early lives and ties the ending together artfully, however there are large pieces missing in exactly how we end up with a depressed Patty and an angry middle aged Walter.  Overall, this is a smart and honest book that I enjoyed very much.  The author weaves in (sometimes overly wordy) political commentary, which I found to be interesting and thought provoking.  I would imagine that the political portions will be more palatable to those with liberal political leanings.
0143119680|2.0|My biggest problem with this book was that there was too much going on with too little detail and no focus. It seemed that the book was meant to be another Twilight with witches and vampires and a little bit of classical mythology tossed in. We also had daemons and warmbloods, the only thing missing were werewolves. There were scenes that reminded me too much of Harry Potter.  Although the author is a Professor of History, this book was very light on any historical facts.  The heroine, Diana Bishop, was supposedly a professor specializing in the history of science, yet we were treated to a few generic \\"gee whizzes\\" about a few scientists, but no depth. The review on this book claims the author \\"adds a scholar's depth to this riveting story of magic and suspense\\".  If this book represents a \\"scholar's depth\\" then doctoral scholarship is in big trouble.  There were all kinds of confrontations, but the tension was quickly diffused. Even the torture scene was all smoothed over and the heroine quickly recovered. The hero is a vampire, and he was too trustworthy, too much in control. Matthew and his mother have lived for more than 1500 years, yet they were essentially defanged. This was one of my biggest problems with the book - all of the characters were two dimensional - either totally noble or totally bad - no shades of grey.  Even though the book wasn't very interesting I kept reading, hoping that the premise would pay off. Since this is a trilogy, I treated this first book as an introduction, but it wasn't good enough to make me want to read the next book to find out what happens. As I came to the last pages I just didn't care what happens to any of the characters in the past or the present.
1400032717|4.0|I know that I am late to the party -- but the beauty of books (especially good ones) is that they never get old. The stories in them live on forever, because good books manage to capture some timeless quality of human existence. Mark Haddon has done a wonderful job in this novel (which I managed to finish in a day!), and his world (rather Christopher's world, as narrated by Mark) is so beautifully etched out that I couldn't help but laugh and feel sad at the same time. What a wonderful story, what an excellent writer and what an amazingly novel way of putting words on to paper -- show me another best-selling fictional novel with a proof that involves the Pythagoras theorem! I thoroughly enjoyed this masterpiece and highly recommend it -- especially the carefully etched out art!

0061537969|4.0|This is possibly one of the first novels that made my cry. I finished this in 3 sittings and could have possibly done it faster, if it wasn't for the need to wake up on time everyday morning. This was a beautifully crafted story (a bit contrived maybe, still) and the narrating dog -- Enzo -- made for a wonderful character. Although I am not a big fan of racing, I could literally see the cars whizz by me as the author described the races -- now that is good writing. This novel deserves all the praise it can get and some more! A must read.

1606865617|3.0|Arundhati Roy's God of Small Things is a wonderful piece of literature; as I have always maintained, this female can write. Her command over the English language is comparable to very few. Although beautiful for the language, the book as such was pretty average -- if only she had devoted more time in developing her characters, instead of describing Kerala with so much detail, things would have been different. On a side note, if this book won the Booker Prize, I am totally at a loss to justify Adiga's White Tiger winning it at a later date!

B00005LC4Z|5.0|I love all of Tom Hanks films....and he always gives 100% and more......This role is no exception.  I have viewed this 12 times or more...and each time it affects me the same way.  A very emotional, heart warming film.<br /><br />The entire cast were perfectly selected for their roles and most memorable:<br /> Robin Wright as Jenny...You just keep hoping she'll go running back to Forrest (even tho you've seen it before)<br /> Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan...He's classic....and the double amputee effect..very convincing<br /> Mykelti Williamson as Bubba....He and Hanks are a perfect match as buddies...like peas and carrots<br /> Sally Field as Forrests mom....The southern accent really adds to her character.<br /><br />So many classic scenes...You wont ever tire of seeing this masterpiece.
0316056871|5.0|I have been a Tina Fey fan for years, all her stuff cracks me up. I was expecting a book filled with funny stories and jokes, instead it was rather serious, and you know...I loved that. Don't get me wrong, this book will have you laughing to the point of tears at some times, but it isn't filled with fluff stories meant simply for amusement. The best part of this book, is that even the funniest parts contain a lot of meaning and truth. There is a bit of something for everyone, most of all for people who like intelligent humor.
0062082353|5.0|I saw this book in an article on theblaze.com and was immediately drawn in by it.  I am a student, therefore I try not to do much personal reading during the semester, so I can stay focused on class.  I broke down last weekend and purchased this book.  I am a slow reader, but I am already done with it and considering a second go of it.  This book is well worth your time, especially if you are like me and have a huge respect for our armed forces in the first place, and read it in a day or two.  Enjoy!

0062119044|4.0|While most reviewers readily admit their dislike of Eva, her selfishness and coldness, I found Franklin insidious. While Eva seems to be taking full responsibility for Kevin, listing all her faults and bad behavior her adoration of Franklin to me smacks of brainwashing. She loves Franklin and their life together. Franklin emotionally blackmails her into having a child, brow beats her during pregnancy, guilts her into staying at home (he's a freelancer, she's a CEO why is she the stay at home parent?) and always lets her know that he is the better parent. He continually underminds her and she lowers her self esteem every time. Kevin is an egnima and probably just evil but I think he thinks of her with more respect than Franklin does. His escalating behavior to me is trying to connect (For better or worse) to the one person in his family who doesn't love him just because she should. I have to say I saw most of the climax coming but that didn't lessen it's impact or keep me from thinking about this book again and again.

B006ISJQ26|2.0|This is a directorial debut for William Monahan, Oscar winning writer for Martin Scorsese-directed \\"The Departed.\\" With two names Colin Farrell and Keira Knightley, you may expect something great in \\"London Boulevard\\" (the name is probably inspired by \\"Sunset Boulevard\\"). The end result is somewhat disappointing, though.  Colin Farrell is Mitchel, an ex-convict who just got out of prison. Being hired as a bodyguard for a famous actress Charlotte (Keira Knightley) living a secluded life surrounded by the paparazzi, Mitchel starts thinking of a new life plan, but his old friends including Billy (Ben Chaplin) won't let him do that. And when a brutal local gangster Gant (Ray Winstone) steps in, things get more complicated and dangerous.  Based on the book of the same title by Ken Bruen (author of \\"Blitz,\\" basis of a Jason Statham film), \\"London Boulevard\\" is a British film noir with great atmosphere and on-location shots (thanks to the Oscar-winning cinematographer Chris Menges, \\"The Mission\\"). The cast is interesting, including David Thewlis and Anna Friel, with unanimously effective acting (though typecast Winstone was much better in \\"Edge of Darkness\\" for which William Monahan wrote the script).  The film's problem is obvious: too many subplots and characters. Anna Friel's role as Mitchel's sister is underdeveloped, and so is the character of Keira Knightley, who looks terribly bored. The story doesn't know where it is going (what does Mitchel or Charlotte really want to do anyway?). The film's pace is rushed (especially the second half) and the conclusion is a huge letdown.  The best part of the film is some stylish shots and the classic 60s rock soundtrack including The Yardbirds (used three times in the film).

0439023521|5.0|I had a parent tell me at a Scholastic Warehouse sale that this was a terrific book so I picked it up for my son. But then a friend posted on Facebook about how great it was and I figured it was time to read it first. I'm so glad I did. Like so many others, once I started I couldn't put it down. What a great story with incredible characters. It is very unique but then again has a lot of similarities to Shirley Jackson's The Lottery and Stephen King's The Long Walk.<br /><br />I loved Katniss and her spunk, ingenuity, and determination. The detail and plot development are great and you can feel the tension, the heat, the cold as you read what Kat and Peeta have to go through.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away because I loved reading it with no knowledge of plot or anything. That made the unraveling of the story really great.<br /><br />This is not a book for young kids. There is death (starvation, murder and attacks) of children of many ages. It is Big Brother to the extreme.<br /><br />Well worth a read by teens and adults.

B0061TQBRK|5.0|I've heard several good songs from Lacuna Coil, but yet never forked over the cash to buy one of their cd's. Well that's all history now, as I bought their lastest cd, and I'm not dissappointed. A couple of months ago I bought Evanescence (self titled) cd, and I thought that was incredible. Well this one is just as good. I just hope my country (USA) catches on to this great album, but I'm afraid they will be too busy listening to Katy Perry. Too bad, because this band, and this kind of music has much more to offer. If someone from Kroq here in L.A. is reading this, you better give this a spin on your radio station. If I was a dj, I would definitely start off with 'Kill The Light', which is probably there best song on the album. I hear sports radio talk show host, and guest athletes anlayst always saying \\"to the eye\\", or \\"what the eye see's\\". Well I'm going to use the reference 'to the ear'. And to the ear, this song sounds the best.  Now let me talk about track ten, which is a cover song of REM's 'Losing My Religion'. I read other reviews here on Amazon saying this song wasn't done good, or to that effect. One person wrote he always skips it. Our your crazy? Lacuna Coil did an amazing job on this. Personally I prefer this to REM's. In fact, This is my second favorite song on the album. When Cristina Scabbia hits that high note on this, it gives me chills. It also has somewhat of an electronic techno beat to this, which means you could probably play this song at the clubs. A dj will probably give this a mix though. Another song I really like is one of the softer songs called 'End of Time'. This song is highly emotional, and if your married, or have a girlfriend/boyfriend, this song will definitely hit home. By the way, I love how Lacuna Coil has two singers (female/male). And yes, the female singer (Cristina Scabbia) is a much better singer, and way better looking. But having the guy (Andrea) gives the band another dimension, and makes them more unique. At first, I too was wishing it was just Cristina singing, but then I realized the band is just better with both of them sharing the singing duties.  Other great songs on this album is their first release 'Trip The Darkness' (I love it when Cristina says \\"Come to me, Come to me\\"). The fourth track called 'Give Me Something More' is really good. And 'The Army Inside' really stands out. And really all the other songs are solid. Really this band deserves to be famous here. This cd is as good as Evanscence, Paramore, 30 Seconds to Mars, or Breaking Benjamin album to name a few. Americans, put down your pizza and give an ear to Lacuna Coil. You'll like what you here, I promise you. Italy has more to offer than just pizza, Venice, the Pope, and Rome.
B001I82RVS|5.0|First off, allow me to inform you that there is much less ridiculousness in this one than the aforementioned films (aside from a few cheesy ads).  The gore is still absurdly over the top but less silliness overall, give or take a few scenes.  Creepier for sure and def. simpler, in terms of the amount of main characters/antagonists/protagonists involved.  None of that really matters much anyways with the amount of strangeness+violence in this!  Practically every gruesome scene progressively informs u why u love these types of films.

He was and is a spy for the CIA and I have read that she also worked for the CIA.  However, she loved cooking more than anything.<br /><br />Child's fascinating story, with the wonderful Stanley Tucci playing her lifelong husband Paul whetted my appetite for seeing that entire story with Streep as Child and Tucci as Paul.  i felt every time we cut back to the other story that we were seeing a romcom (romantic comedy) instead.  tucci and streep were making one movie and the other movie was director nora ephron's typical contemporary woman's story with plenty of female bonding and romcom elements (I have a very hard time with a lot of her work with this romcom emphasis that borders on too cutesy for words).  By the time we got to the end of Powell's story, I was just about sick of her and her friends.  I also would have cut Powell's friends from the story entirely.  They added nothing.  However, I can't give it less than 4 stars because the Child part of the story is simply marvelous.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is awesome! Works great on my droid x. Highly recommended. blow stuff up, get an erection, shoot in your pants missle fun.
0316044695|5.0|This book is one of the best I have read in a long time.  It brings you inside the seals and even more into the heart of Marcus Latrell. As on already said, the best Hollywood screen writer could not come up with a more intense story. This book brought almost to tears as you feel like you are with those very special Seals of Operation Redwing.  Thank YOU Marcus for bring this story to us.  I pray each will be remembered.  I know I will carry them in my heart.
0670022950|5.0|I have not read this book: I am giving it five stars as it is clearly a substantial thesis - any other rating would be arbitrary and besides, readers alway seem to prefer positive over adverse criticism.<br /><br />So why am I writing a review, albeit a very short one: the problem I have is simple: I believe it is simplistic to conclude that there has been a decline in world violence over the centuries on the basis of statistical per capita analysis.<br /><br />To put it crudely, with the frightening increase in the world population, it would always have been difficult, in the twentieth century, to get the killing fields to keep up, in percentage terms with preceding ones. It is true that great progress has been made in the mechanised means of slaughter: on the other hand, the freedom available to the slaughterers in the past to roam and kill must have meant that there were far fewer impediments if one chose to go down this path. Would it not, in previous centuries, have been easier to kill ten people out of a hundred than to kill a thousand out of ten times that number? I repeat, I have not read the book, but I am sceptical about the statistical validity supporting his basic premise that violence has declined. I may be wrong and am willing to be shot down in flames (metaphorically speaking).
B0069UP2PI|1.0|The cast in this movie blew me away. The cast alone is why I went to see this. BUT, the cast wasn't worth the time wasted on it. This movie is terrible. It is soo depressing it will make you think getting that disease would be better than suffering through this movie. You will never get that time back, it is seriously gone forever. Skip it. Save Yourself!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great case for the Kindle.  Simple yet very good quality and versatile... Perfect for someone who does not want a simple, sleek case...
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am wearing out my stylus; this game is so much fun that I can't put it down.  I wanted a Kindle Fire so that I could read more books.  Solitaire has me doing anything but reading!
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|When we ordered this camera, like hundred of other I imagine, it had great review stating how wonderful the pictures turned out, even in low light, and how many photo's it could hold.  We received the camera and gave it to our daughter (who does love it despite our disappointment).  Here's why NOT to buy this camera:  Indoor pictures are absolutely pointless, even with a steady hand of an adult, the pictures are blurry in a well lit room with the flash.  The flash is SOOO bright that it whites out the picture if the person is closer than 10 feet, and beyond 10 feet the subject is BLURRY (see above).  Amazon FRAUDULENTLY advertises the camera as holding 80 pictures.  It DOES NOT.  it holds 56 at best, and while this would be fine if it advertised as holding up to 56 pictures, I suppose someone thought that a little salt in the wound wouldn't hurt by skimping on the memory since they put in a cheaper blur recording CCD.  (last I bought an SD card it was 8GB and was sold for $10, how much are they saving by skimping on the memory in this toy??? 250MB would have allowed a mind blowing number of pictures, or at least the advertised \\"80\\"!!!)  To Amazon's credit, the packaging does (Fraudulently) say \\"holds up to 80 pictures.\\"  I guess Amazon figures two lies make it okay.  Great.  The reason we give any credit to the camera is because 1) it has very few buttons so as not to confuse children and 2) outdoor pictures in bright sunlight are okay and 3) the pictures are a nice 3mp resolution (when taken in bright sun so as not to have a blurry subject), 4) it is cute being made of Lego blocks and all.  Our daughter loves \\"her camera\\"  and for that it's not going back.  Buy it, or don't, but at least KNOW what this camera is, IT IS NOT THE ONE REVIEWED SO POSITIVELY IN THE AMAZON REVIEWS, the manufacturer or Amazon has switched the cameras for a lesser model.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Great from start to finish. Amazing filming, great music, tone and atmosphere. So much accomplished with a spare and moody script that exploded when least expected. Brilliant.<br /><br />Fans of the \\"Fast and the Furious\\" series need to look elsewhere however.
B00004STDN|5.0|this was one of stalones best.  you feel like your hanging on that cliff, thru the whole movie.  many heart stopping moments...from the beginning to the end. never a dull moment.  was on the edge of my seat thru the whole movie.  put this one in your collection... the story line, was a bit unrealistic, but somehow, they made it work.  i enjoyed this movie very much and would recomend it to anyone.
B005ZKYXZI|1.0|Why is this movie not available in single-disc Blu-ray? Rhetorical.  We know why. Greed! I would guess that the studio doesn't release this movie in single Blu-ray versions because they can rip you off for more money by [only] offering the movie in two or three-disc sets and charging a lot more for it.  And I am not just talking specifically about this movie. I rarely see any new release that offers a single Blu-ray disc.  And this movie is way overpriced to begin with. I've seen this movie in stores selling for over $30. Whoa! Any Blu-ray movie release that is over $20 is outrageous.  We are in a worldwide economic recession. The value of the dollar goes down daily. Inflation is rampant. So why are the studios using price gouging tactics? Again, rhetorical.  Come on guys, give the 99% a break or we are all going to pay for your greed in the end. And I do mean END!  Did I say \\"boycott?\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I luv this app it is so fun great for kids of all ages there are puzzles it has great graphics your child will liv it
B0068TL23G|5.0|This game is simple fun.  The controls are intuitive and work well.  The trick is coming up with a good route and the game helps you by rating your solution.  The levels are all a bit different and provide new challenges, so the game doesn't feel repetitive.
B005974CNA|4.0|One of the best, definitely, after Systematic Chaos. Highly recommended and the DVD is a great insight into the hear of Dream Theater.
0380730405|5.0|This is one of the best books of the 20th century. A must-have for any book collection, yet it is not available to buy for my Kindle. Why not. When I type in rebecca by Daphne du Maurier it comes back as no match found.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a fun, addicting game. I play it all night long! it's very addicting. i definitely recommend it! Especially on road trips.
1400069181|4.0|One of us entered this book a skeptic.  The other entered wearing her own pair of TOMS...  Start Something that Matters tells the story of Blake Mycoskie and his quest to start something that matters.  While on a rare vacation in Argentina an idea started that would spawn a movement.  TOMS Shoes was quickly born along with the company's One for One philosophy: \\"With every pair purchased, TOMS will give a pair of new shoes to a child in need.\\"  The novel explores Blake's journey to set up a new kind of company along with setting the roadmap for others to start something that matters.  At the heart of TOMS is a great story.  It seems only fitting that Start Something That Matters is also filled with countless great stories (seriously we could count, but hopefully you've come to expect nothing less from this blog).  No two are alike, yet each account was about individuals harnessing their entrepreneurial spirit to start organizations that have a positive impact on the world.  There were examples of large organizations like charity: water, which helps distribute clean drinking water to those in need, and examples of much smaller organizations, like SENDaBALL, which mails handwritten notes on balls to people as a unique gift idea.  Start Something that Matters can be read in one or two sittings and will provide plenty of career food for thought.  The concepts aren't wildly unique, but seeing them combined together in a flourishing business model that balances charity and profit was inspirational.  Plus, the maturation of TOMS was incredibly interesting.  Everything from company culture to maximizing resources was discussed.  And just when you're ready to think up an excuse why starting your own something that matters won't work, Blake drops a quick \\"overcoming obstacles\\" story that inspires you all over again.  Sorry to go all Tony Robbins for the past two paragraphs, but this topic seems to have us both charged up.  Now, what type of business could we start???  Hmm, maybe we need to head on down to Argentina and drink a nice big glass of Malbec wine...
B006JPS1OM|3.0|Still waiting for this thing to download but it looks pretty fun. The only thing that looks annoying to me is it costs 5 bucks for the full version and that's way took expensive

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I go to one of the churches that made this app and I love using it. Its everything I am looking for.
0316067598|3.0|I found the story to be very interesting but the injections of religion and politics coupled with the sometimes overly descriptive method of describing some situations left me wanting less... not more.  It seemed as if the author was trying to build up his fallen friends a bit more than he had to. By being where they were and by being what they were that is reason enough to call them heroes.  A good story, not great.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app, works flawless over the network, but a bit sluggish over 3G. Still, it has good controls and options and runs way better then I expected!
B002W5GPVE|5.0|I decided, even after having read the bad reviews of the Kindle edition, to get this ebook. I haven't found any of the errors pointed out by others - maybe the book has been updated since then. It is from cover to cover a great tool for students as well as researchers. There is no doubt in my mind, if you are doing a case study, or even thinking about doing one, you need to read this book! As with research, this book approaches case study methodology from many angles and discusses each angle's positives and negatives. In addition, the book is supplemented by examples and exercises throughout.  I would actually endorse the use of the Kindle edition, as it is much easier to highlight, take notes, and jump between them afterwards. This is a great function which keeps you from using physical objects or coloring in the physical book. In this way the ebook functions as a database of references and comments as well as the book itself.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This case looks great!  The pink color is very chic.  I've gotten great comments on it.  IT's thin and does the job, which is to protect my kindle from scratches.  Love it.
B000BNX3B4|5.0|i absoulutely love this movie and can view it over and over again! and what a bargain amazon has it for! its a typical chick flick premise but for the more mature i would guess. i do love the love story that developed after the hilarious blind dates she had been on. plus the reference the ever so great dr. zhivago :)
1609611543|5.0|This book has alot to think about, and good information, and practical advise to change health habits for the better.

0470474874|5.0|This is an excellent guide to Excel 2010. Either if you are new to Excel, or need an update on new features. In an easy language you are being guided with lots of useful examples that you can use in your daily work with just a little customizations. As a bonus this book contains a cd-rom with all the examples and a searchable pdf version of the book. This is surely good work. I give this book my best recommendations.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Too slow- the action could only be 'fast' if you like a fantasy novel mixed with a very slow dull romance. The author makes the mistake of having the central character too powerful too quickly- an issue that is the book equivalent to a television show \\"jumping the shark.\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy playing.  I wish the games didn't cost so much to unlock though.  I haven't unlocked very many games but I really like the soduko.
B000E41MS6|1.0|Christopher Eccleston is a fine actor, but honestly I'm not sure how Doctor Who got picked up for a second season after this. I'm by no means a whovian or whatever they call themselves, just a fan of sciFi. I've seen the rest of the series and just now got a hold of season 1. There are some interesting episodes, but to be blunt this version of the doctor is a complete and utter tool. The character obviously looks down on humans and pretty much says as much a couple times. (This is one of the things that concerned be about The 11th Hour when Matt Smith's Doctor started babbling about humans filming the end of the world on their cell phones. Apparently forgetting no one on the planet knew it was the end of the world, just something spectacular happening in the sky. But that's another rant) Honestly (and this is hardly a spoiler since there's 5 other seasons with two other doctors) when this doctor dies and regenerates that's about the best scene in the whole series. Mostly because I know how good the Tennant stuff is. I think had I suffered through this when it was released new, I'd have never gotten through it at all and wouldn't have bothered to watch any of the Tennant or Smith stuff.  Christopher Eccleston's actual acting is great, the stories are actually alright, it's just... Why would you want to watch or hang out with an alien who is all about reminding you how much better he thinks he is? Idiot monkeys in deed. It was good to watch just to see the beginning, but this condescending version of the doctor just made me want to punch the TV.
034544678X|5.0|I loved this book, it showed a wonderful way to behave around our best friends.  It opened up ways to train and what to look for in pets.  I loved her stories that she shared and the examples that she gave.  For me it became one of the bases for my training classes.  Wonderful read and very informative.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I am in love with my Kindle...  really took my time to find a good quality cover that would last and look good too, so glad I bought this one.  I get many compliments, you won't be disappointed, it's well worth the money.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Not what I expected, it doesnt work like in a android format. It wont show some programs on the TV, that are streamed. But I guess is a beginning. Not bad for the price at all.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|In a world beyond earth humans entered into a foreign land named Pandora that they did not know much information about until they learned how to communicate with the strange alien blue creatures. The creatures, called Na'vi, are natives of Pandora.  Jake a former amputated marine, was recruited to join the efforts of solving Earths problems in the Avatar Program created to find a way to find the material needed to complete the efforts of helping Earth. Jake is the Avatar who is first set out on a mission to gain the trust of the Na'vi people in his form as human and Na'vi mixes. During the time he is learning the culture and meeting the people and soon gaining their trust and respect he falls for one of the Na'vi female people. As they have learn to respect him he also learns to respect their way of life and soon takes part in it and it becomes apart of him. Going against his own people Jake tries to help the Na'vi  by telling them what it is going on. He has mixed emotions about doing his job and helping the Na'vi. But he realizes where his heart really is and helps the Na'vi save there planet from the humans and force them off their planet.  The movie was a great adventure and action packed film. I felt like I learned the way of the Na'vi right through Jake Sully's eyes. I believe the writer did a wonderful job capturing every aspect of the culture of the Na'vi people. The director allowed us to experience life through a Na'vi warrior. It was an enjoyable feeling seeing the vision of James Cameron come into play.

1451627289|5.0|This is an oddly structured novel, told in 4 arcs.<br /><br />The first is the introduction, which establishes Jake and introduces the concept of time travel. It reminds me of a short story, the kind of intentionally amusing oddity he would have included in the Night Shift or Skeleton Crew collections. It's a little far-fetched, but played out so casually, as if there's nothing to it, that it works. Little details, like buying the same pound of meat hundreds of times and then using it to sell 21st century hamburgers at 1960s prices ease us past the point of disbelief.<br /><br />The second arc is Jake's first extended visit to the past, which is really just an homage to King's past. Not that there's anything wrong with that - in fact, this was my favourite part of the book - but I suspect some readers will find it self-indulgent. Personally, I loved revisiting the town of Derry, seeing the evil that permeates through an outsider's eyes, and running into the kids of IT. Later on in the book there are also some obvious nods to Cujo (rabid dogs come up a few times) and Christine (a sinister Plymouth Fury plays a role), as well as to Hearts in Atlantis and The Dark Tower saga.<br /><br />The third arc comprises the bulk of the story, and deals with Jake's second extended visit to the past. Here we get an interestingly (perhaps too) nostalgic look at the world of the 60s, one of King's best stabs at developing a romance (between Jake and Sadie), and a healthy smattering of social and political commentary. This part definitely drags in parts, and is largely the reason I had to put the book down and give myself a break for a week or so before continuing. As events take us closer to the JFK assassination, and we really get to see how the past struggles to harmonize and protect itself, the story does take off, but it is a bit of a slog to get there.<br /><br />The final arc of the story is one that I am sure will polarise audiences. Personally, I loved the Twilight Zone eeriness of it, and the unexpected way in which King deals with the aftermath of Jake's intervention in the JFK assassination. It's a bit heavy-handed, for sure, and easily the most fanciful part of the story, but it really brought everything to a satisfying conclusion with no lingering what-ifs.ich King deals with the aftermath of Jake's intervention in the JFK assassination.

B000BVD460|4.0|good, I'm not a fan of Eminem, but I bought this cd to know a little of their work. very good album that I recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is extremely useful. the different versions are very helpful, and the reading plans are perfect. great app! get it!
B004X2M9VY|1.0|I just watched the first six episodes, but I have had more than enough. Each episode's plot is completely incoherent.  Its a lot like Lost - the writers keep coming up with new plot twists and mysteries instead of justifying or explaining old ones. Of course the series has always relied heavily on this type of writing, but season 6 takes things to a whole new level.
B0055SWM08|5.0|good...at first i was questioning if the reviews had been messed with by the maker, but its actually an awesome app especially if you are confined within the prison of amazon appstore
0439023521|1.0|Am I the only person who hated this book?  I have read thousands of books, and this is the worst book I have ever read.  Do not let your children or teenagers read this book!  I cannot believe this is considered a young adult book.  I felt sick while I was reading it.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|Like most of Roland Emmerich's movies, this one deals with massive destruction on a Global scale. The difference this time being that the destruction level is ramped up to eleven. Unlike previous films, in this massive tsunamis and unfathomable seismic activity take out much of the planet's inhabitants. No one is safe. Entire continents melt into the ocean. The whole state of California slides into the western seaboard, and yellowstone park becomes the world's largest Volcano. To top it all off there is an excellent sequence where the White House, now converted to a shelter, is wiped out by the USS John F. Kennedy. All this is great.  Most of the events I described, in fact pretty much the entirity of the devestation takes place roughly in the first forty-five minutes to an hour. After the first hour the film's quality takes a noticeable nose dive. Without the cgi and special effects we're left to an old hat to carry the film; the story. Problem is, with the world coming to an end someone must have forgotten to write one.  The film sports a great cast, I can't think of anyone I would ditch, but some of their stories make them seem largely irrelevant. For example, the main character played by John Cusack has no real connections to Chiwetel Ejiofor or the people planning for this event. His main connection comes from Woody Harrelson, who plays a coot he makes the fortunate choice of listening to. They should've given him stronger ties to the characters in Washington. As a result the story in Washington serves a mere exposition so we have some idea as to how John Cusack and his family can save themselves.  Next is the main story, the John Cusack story...if you didn't smell it coming...is a...you guess it...divorced father trying to win back his kids. Okay, seriously, didn't your writer or team of writers ever express some desire not to use what's been used in basically every disaster movie? How many times did he want the word \\"cliche'\\" used to describe this one?  Someof it is very good, I imagine some of their observations about the crassness of our Governments and how money would buy a chance at survival were very on point. I particularly like how they handled Danny Glover's President Wilson. Sadly, in the past, Roland Emmerich has delivered sharper stories that were not so all over the place. The destruction in this movie can't be matched though.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My Kindle is mostly stored in my purse as I use it for my long commute and it protects my device very well. It is lightweight, but I feel good that the microshell will help protect my device if I drop it. The stand part is a little iffy, but I don't really care to use it anyway, so I still highly recommend this product.
B00068C7WA|4.0|Piano Man is my total favourite track by Billy, heartfelt and singing from experiance, I also recommend you look out for an excellent cover version by Martyn Joseph.  Tell Her About It, An Innocent Man and Uptown Girl are all good stabs at The Four Seasons sound, while We Did'nt Start The Fire is a fantastic montage of wordplay which could have come from Bob Dylan.  A few songs are not for me, She's Always  A Woman, Just The Way You Are, Movin' Out and My Life, they are maybe too middle of the road sounds.  Billy Joel's music has many faces and that's part of of his appeal, so there is likely to be something for everyone.

To our surprise this one was just a good as the first and had some cool life lessons in it. We are so glad that we purchased this movie to have in our home library because it will be watched again and again!

B005NQ5LSC|5.0|This edition of Ip Man was very good.  I think Donnie To did a good job recreating Ip Man.  He's not as fast as Donnie Yen but he did alright.  I especially liked the part where Ip Mans' son, Ip Chun kicked his Donnie's butt.  It made for a lighthearted break in the movie.  I would definitely recommend this movie.  I've got the first two on Blu-ray & this one too.  If you get this one, you've got to get the first two.  It's some of the best Wing Chun you'll ever see.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|When updating to most recent version, the app deleted all tasks.  Very disappointing.  Update should not wipe out all app data.

Interesting characters and the perfection to which the house staff adheres to will grab you.  This movie made me want more, much more....Highly Recommend Downton Abbey as well.

0525478817|4.0|I must begin this by saying that although I've been a massive Vlogbrother fan for over a year, this is my first John Green book. So going into it I was super excited, and also a little nervous, I was afraid I wouldn't like it and it would completely tarnish my Vlogbrother love.  And well...  I still don't quite know what I think.  There were some aspects of the book that I just adored. Flat out- ADORED. Let me tell you, flailing doesn't even begin the cover it. I might not have been literally rolling on the floor (hehe literally joke) but I was convulsing in my chair with laughter.  My family thought I was going insane. I have no regrets.  Favorite aspect of TFiOS: The writing.  John Green might not appreciate this, but I think he might have just killed my \\"Hey, maybe I could be a writer!\\" dream. I will never be able to write like that.  And I'm okay with that. Because John seems to have writing beautiful funny books pretty much in the bag. I read TFiOS slowly, over a week. I'd read something really deep and wonderful and then I'd walk away and have to think about it for a while, and then I'd come back for some more amazingness. He proves that one doesn't have to be wordy to make a point. I don't know how a man in his 30's knows so much about understanding teenagers so well, but somehow he does. Hazel and Gus... they were just so... right. I loved them both. I loved that Hazel was a sweet normal person without being annoyingly perfect or on the flip side dull and boring. Please do not get me started on Gus. Because he was adorable. Yes, I just called a man who smoke (metaphor or not I find smoking to be highly unattractive) adorable. He was just that amazing. I would also like to start a fan club for Hazel's parents, mostly because... well... THEY WERE AMAZING.  Basically I loved them all.  Something that really struck me about TFiOS as a whole was that it reminded me of the first \\"real\\" book I ever read (I remember like it was yesterday) It was a chapter book toldfrom the perspective of a dog named Spunky, it was a pretty normal story-about-a-dog chapter book except for the one thing. Spunky's little girl died of cancer. And it was the first time in my short life I'd really had to think about cancer and death.  I remember balling my eyes out. I couldn't have been more than 8 years old. TFiOS reminded me of the feeling I had when I read my first good book. Those feelings were new, different, and they came from a place I didn't previously know existed.  That is what The Fault in Our Stars did to me.  And it was beautiful.  Now that I've ranted and raved just like all the other nerdfighters and  everyone else out there who's intelligent enough to see a great book when it's literally right under their nose. (Well I suppose it could be literally over their nose too if it was held right...) I must admit I have a couple of things that... irked me about the book. And in my effort to strive to be a unbiased reviewer I shall share with you what exactly those irkings are. Most of these are things that personally bug me, and I'm well aware of the fact that I'm in the minority here. Most of the them have to do with the end of the book so...  (Note: There's another spoilers free section at the end)  ***SPOILERS PROCEED NO FURTHER***  ***UNLESS YOU HAVE READ TFIOS ALREADY THEN GO AHEAD AND READ***  ***OTHERWISE CEASE AND DESIST***  Unfortunately there's an aspect of TFiOS that I found... well... unfortunate. And it's not something that's limited just to this particular book, but teen literature in general. I feel like authors feel the need to add corpus amounts of language and sex into teen books in order to be \\"real\\". Now I know a lot of people out there are just fine with swearing and premarital sex and that it's part of their everyday lives, and call me old fashioned, call me a prude, but I just can't condone it.  I was fine with most of the \\"content\\" in TFiOS. I was relieved that there wasn't too much explicitness and that the S-wordswere used sparingly.  But then when I happened upon the one F bomb I was shocked. Although I acknowledge the fact that if anyone has a \\"right\\" to swear, it was Gus, I was still  disappointed.  You have to understand this from my perspective: I work in the children's department of a library. I have 13 year old's who ask me for book recommendations. I sincerely wish I could pick TFiOS off the shelve and give it to them and tell them that THAT is what amazing writing looks like.  But... I can't.  I know that John's not writing these for 13 year olds, but here I am, almost 21, and I still don't want to subject myself to harsh profanity. Can't we just have good books without going through all that?  It would just be nice... that's all.  Okay personal rant now done, on to plot annoyances:  1)I knew Gus was going to die. I'm sorry, but the moment they mentioned how \\"healthy\\" he was I knew right then and there he was the one with the death that was going to pull my heart out of my chest and stomp it to pieces and then expect me to go on living life. It was a matter of simple deduction: You can't kill the protagonist. John Green may be an artist, but he's also a best selling author, Peter Van Houten was not one, so he can end his novels horribly like that, John can't. It's the cost of fame. Also: It's a cancer book, if no one died it wouldn't be realistic. I'm not being callous, I'm being realistic. Cancer is just a way of speeding up our eventually demise. Someone had to die.  2) You know the big twist in the end, when Hazel finally realized the reason Peter Van Houten is the way he is? I had been begging Hazel for chapters to realize that and I found it slightly unrealitic that she never, after years of going on and on about how he so perfectly knew what it was like and dozens of re-readings she never once thought \\"Oh he probably knew some one with cancer!\\" Never? Really?  ***END OF SPOILERS***  ***YOU CAN START READING AGAIN***  *** RIGHT ABOUT... NOW***  A lot has happened to me since I was 8 years old, the first time I smudged ink on a book page because it felt like someone I personally knew and loved was gone and I'd never see them again.  I've had to watch family members be lowered into graves, and watch their loved one's curse the day when the autopsy came  back positive. I've shared tears of joy with others when the scans come back clear, and they're given a new lease on life. I've seen a mother's drawn, tired face crumble when she learns that her little girl's worst enemy is back again... for the third time.  Although reading the The Fault in Our Stars did dredge up all these hurts and feelings from some of the worst parts of my life, strangely enough it didn't depress me. It more made me sad in a \\"It's like happy for deep people\\" way. I was happy that I felt I understood more what these people go through, I felt like maybe I could be more understanding, a better help, that I'd knew now how to pray for them.  And I consider that a priceless gift.  Thank you Mr. Green.
B003O86FMW|1.0|A dreary repetition of the 1st volume in the series. Not recommended.<br />I dont think teenagers, even, could find this story worthwhile.<br /><br />Why so many 5 star ratings??  Scammers?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it but it could have a wider veriety of games to get and be unloved other than that its awesome!
B005DOKM9M|5.0|This product fits well, protects my Kindle Fire just like I wanted it to. It has a great appearance and a great value.
0131479415|2.0|I'm beginning to wonder how many agile books I can buy/read which say essentially the same thing. I bought this one because it looked like it covered some of the areas my team is struggling with in our 1 year/1,000 Story project. It is a light and easy to read, but it didn't ever seem to get beyond the basics and there wasn't anything I could suggest for our next retrospective....
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love my Fire. It does almost everything I do on my laptop plus more.  I've had no problems thus far. The only thing I would want in it is for it to have 4G  Capabilities.
0143119419|5.0|\\"More Money Than God\\" is a detailed account of the creation of hedge funds, outlining the evolving strategies each new group pursued. The book is thick with annotations to a large volume of source data, combined with in depth interviews of people involved, this wealth of information is woven together to create an enthralling read.   Mallaby's proposition that hedge funds act as a risk management financial insurance system is compelling when compared to the de facto alternative: taxpayer funded handouts to corporates 'to big to fail' and therefore incentivised to take on more risk. An excellent book, highly recommended.
B006PZBR8S|1.0|This movie was definitely inspirational to many. This movie attempts to make you feel there is hope of making up for not being present in your child's life. For the ladies, this movie wants to give you hope that the loser you are just too lazy to leave and too lazy to kick in the butt will suddenly transform into a great dad and partner. It achieves this through a boy that is more adult than any grown up in the whole movie. Which he had to be since there are no mature adults present in his life or the whole country for that matter. What a waste of time. If I wanted to see a display of lame uninspiring adults...I would have gone to Wal-mart.
B000X107GI|2.0|THE BATTERIES WERE GREAT FOR THE FIRST WEEK OR 2, NOW I'VE TRIED THE 3RD BATTERY & THEY DON'T SEEM TO WORK WELL. THEY'LL WORK FOR A BIT, MAYBE A COUPLE DAYS THEN QUIT.  BUMMER. THE COMPANY SHIPPED THEM FAST THOUGH.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|Definitely worth seeing, this film's unique perspective explores a side of race relations hitherto ignored. Unfortunately, it pulls its punches in the depiction of the role white females played in perpetuating vicious racism, particularly in the South. I lived through that era, and always wondered why women had no moderating effect on the atrocities mostly committed by white men.  Then I saw archival footage from the direst events of the period depicting rabid women screaming for violence against blacks.  The truth is that none of the horrors that occurred in this country's long, slow, agonizing (and ongoing) climb out of the cesspool of race hatred could have occurred without the encouragement of white women, the group most threatened by the impending loss of undeserved privilege. White men may have been the boot on the necks of blacks, but white women were wearing that boot.  The film fails to explore the awful metamorphosis of women who were lovingly raised by blacks, and who then entrusted their own children to the care of blacks, into virulent bigots. Greed, selfishness and a depraved indifference to others provide the why, but the gap in this film is the how. We are left to speculate about the mechanism of transformation.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Really love this app! I would recommend this app to anyone who reads the Bible. Beginner or advanced readers can use it with ease.
B006ZBRMOU|4.0|Well I have to say that I'm sad to see this series end, but it was it was a good final installment to this addicting series.<br /><br />WARNING:  REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS:<br /><br />In this third installment, we find Christian and Ana married.  Ana is still struggling with her Fifty Shades and what it means to be married to a completely loving, but completely controlling, frustrating beautiful man.  They love each other unconditionally, there is no doubt about that, but Ana is still struggling with obeying her husband and Christian is still struggling with being less controlling.  Things get dangerous for both of them when Christian's past catches up with him and puts his wife and family in danger.  Besides the danger, Christian and Ana, get some unwelcome news that puts a strain on their marriage. Christian does something heartbreaking and extremely stupid and Ana has to face her lingering doubts about their future together.  It was nice to see Christian finally accept that Ana truly loves him, that he is not as awful as he thinks he is and that he is worthy of her unconditional love.  I was thrilled to see that Christian still kept some of his edge and that things had not gone completely \\"vanilla\\" in their relationship.  I was glad to see a happy ending for them both and really enjoyed the extras at the end from Christian's POV.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|this is a classic final fantasy-esq rpg but optimized for aneroid with touch controls. playing on kindle fire.  if you get stuck with the airship switch settings to controller. you DONT have to do this if the menu/map buttons get in the way, just touch near and slide the cursor off screen in the direction you're trying to go.  Review: a few quirks, story writting is a bit corny and some &quot;engrish&quot;. mostly just dungeon crawling without any side quests or much town interaction. interesting leveling options and skill learning like ffIX. good price for a good game.
B000UR9QHQ|4.0|I love this film, I have always loved this film. What classic horror fan hasn't. But this Blu-ray takes it a step above. Looks, and sounds incredible. Everything you have always loved is here, plus more. Great extras too. If you love this film, get the Blu ray, trust me, you won't be disappointed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|nice and easy, colorful, I don't. really like the advertises that pop up each new deal tho. I would probly get this app again

This book grabbed my attention right away, and kept me rivited through out the whole book.  It was a great read and I think I finished it in 3 nights.  Chris Kyle, is a humble man and a great american hero.  His bravery and heroism was inspiring to me.  Chris, all the Seals, and all of our Military have my utmost respect.  Great Book!  Great Read! Great American Hero!!  Thanks Chris for sharing your story.  [[ASIN:0062082353 American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History]]
0307352145|2.0|I am an extreme introvert, and very comfortable with that.  I purchased this book in the hopes that it would shed new light on the introvert lifestyle.  But, I found the author to be somewhat self-congratulatory in her writing.  Kind of a \\"Hey, look at me\\" approach to the subject.  The first third of the book is actually about extroverts and how powerful they have become.  Like we didn't know that already.  The author also goes about name-dropping throughout the book.  At one point the author's advice to introverts who find themselves in the wrong career field is to simply change careers.  How nice if it were that easy!  The author mentions Al Gore's pseudo-science as an example of an introvert who has made a difference.  I would have expected a better example.  Ms. Cain describes herself as an introvert, but after reading the book I would describe her as an extrovert with sensitive tendencies.  No introvert that I know would have gone the places she went, done the things she did, and dropped the names that she dropped.  I would recommend the book to extroverts in that the author gives an equal amount of her efforts to their lifestyle.  I personally felt that the author was telling us introverts how to live in an extrovert world - how we must adjust.  The author also goes into great detail with long-winded examples, and after a while with no point being made I simply skipped over to the next section.  In fact, there were some examples within examples.  I felt the book did not flow well, I found myself wondering what point the author was attempting to make.  These are just my opinions, but the bottom line is that this book is not at all what I was expecting.
0811870413|5.0|I live in Athens Greece, so bread is really important for us. I always wanted to make the best bread possible, but it was impossible to find in a bakery in Athens. Of course there are good bakeries, but I was looking for EXCELLENCY.  When I watched the video of this book, I got overwhelmed by the author's passion for bread. I instantly bought it. This was the book for me.  I didn't get it on the first time. I made several mistakes and tried really hard for approximately 2 months, but finally my perfect loaf was done.  Once you make the perfect loaf, then everything else is easy.  What is really exciting in this book is that it makes you think like a baker, not an average home cook.  Really inspiring.
B00505470O|5.0|What can I say about this album? It's the greatest listening experience your ears will ever hear! The mood and melody of the album sets a nice tone reflecting 80's New Wave with a hint of chill vocals. The Within Without is a great single,  so are Echos and Eyes Be Closed. Some of the tracks are upbeat and are reminiscent of some 80s Bowie/Early Eurythmics stuff. The album cover is different,but it nicely sets the tone for the emotional effect of the album.Overall, this album has been on my ipod all summer and fall, and it never seems to get old. You'll enjoy it as well!

B0000AQVCL|5.0|Review no. 479. Wow! I had no idea that Jet's very first CD when over this well. Anyway, due to the fact that there are simply way too many bands and artists worth checking out these days - and those are just the good ones. Jet comes from Melbourne, Australia. Know I remember hearing tunes off this CD on TV commercials several years back when this CD first came out. This is prime old school / good old fashioned down-to-earch garage rock. Tracks that (literally) had me playing this CD nonstop (at first, anyway) are \\"Last Chance\\", the M-U-S-T hear radio favorite \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl?\\", the rocking \\"Rollover DJ\\", \\"Get What I Need\\", the power-ballad \\"Get Me Outta Here\\", Jet's anthem (?) \\"Cold Hard B*tch\\" (still hear this on the radio quite frequently), \\"Take It Or Leave It\\" and the Syd Barrett-ish album closer \\"Timothy\\". Also wanted to mention that one of this disc's other ballads \\"Look What You've Done\\" sort of maybe reminded me of Guns 'N Roses. Should do a lot for fans of the White Stripes, Mooney Suzuki, The Strokes, MC 5, The Hives, AC/DC and The Hellacopters. A must-have.
B0042X9L6A|1.0|I wonder how many people who have left positive reviews will find themselves in this situation - very soon.<br /><br />The battery door is useless. Got stuck the first time I went to change batteries. Then fell apart in my hands, rendering the flash totally unusable. Seems lots of people are having the same problem.<br /><br />Shoddy build quality totally undermines this flash. Nikon should be ashamed.
B0029LHW4A|4.0|Jet's third CD, as I didn't realize at first they only had three discs out (so far) at this time. Definitely holds up to the band's second effort 'Shine On' (see my review). Tunes here that managed to make an impression are the foot-stomping \\"She's A Genius\\", \\"Black Hearts (On Fire), \\"La Di Da\\", the familiar-sounding \\"Goodbye To Hollywood\\" and the catchy \\"Times Like This\\". Line-up: Nic Caster & Cameron Muncey - guitar & vocals, Mark Wilson - bass, piano & vocals and Chris Chester - drums & vocals. Definitely, a should-have.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|this is a grate game for children five and under my niece loves it and I have seen a greart improvement in her education it works grate on kindle and has amazing graphics!!!!
B002UJYW6M|5.0|Jane Austen is one of my favorite writers, I could read her books over and over again. These penguin classics aren't just about but the book but the beautiful cover that comes with it. I have started to collect the penguin and puffin classics. This was my first but I love them all. However I do not recommend buying these classic editions for your kindle. There are much better options for a digital copy.<br /><br />Yet if you want it to sit on your self, these are perfect! I love the way mine looks on my bookshelf.

B0034G4P4O|5.0|The plot of this movie is confusing, like many adventure films these days.  But the animation is superb.  Like watching a Norman Rockwell illustration come to life.
B004LROUW2|1.0|kindle version: This is a book I definately should have downloaded a sample of before buying. Luckily, I was able to get a refund on the kindle purchase as I gave up after 70 pages. The main characters were uninteresting or unpleasant people and I was not lured into a compelling story line. I decided I had much better reading material waiting for my time and just stopped. I really don't see what the fuss is about. Oh well....
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King has a real grasp on how to control an emotional roller coaster.  I could not put the book down.  This is vintage King in the arena of The Stand in which you have just enough of the macabre to make it a King novel.  Story flows very well and has his trademarked fantastic analogies.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover for my Kindle Fire is both lightweight & durable.  Very happy with it.  Very reasonable price.  I suggest the screen cover by MalWare as well.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome play it all the time don't care what anyone says this game is freaking awesome honey's don't forget it if u don't like crap off
0316098329|2.0|I was quite taken by the topic, but was disappointed in the execution. The author could have done so much more with the topic had she given voice from a different perspective than a five-year-old. The self-talk was inconsistent and unrealistic, and I found it terribly distracting from the story itself. Because she decided to tell the story from a child's point of view, she was quite limited in how much of the story she could tell. The day-to-day, minute-by-minute details got very old, and the focus on breast feeding was too much!

B002NXSRW0|5.0|Growing up I was a huge GI Joe fan and was excited for a movie. It is corny at some moments but overall a good movie. Just keep an open mind and remember its just entertainment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app for all ages and genders great fun loved it takes up spare time great for long trips and vacations
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why do I rate this as one star?  It has nothing to do with the movies (I am a fan), as they are wonderful fun (minus Christian Boring), but has totally to do with the production of the Blu-ray set.  First off, there is so much copy protection on these, they take MINUTES to load up before you can watch.  This is unforgivable.  Secondly, this is NOT the \\"Complete\\" saga.  This only contains the latest reworks of the movies.  You do not get the addition of the original presentation, nor do you get extras like the silly Ewok TV special.  Thirdly, there are no Blu-ray enhancements (other than the basic better image and sound).  No interactive pop-ups or anything to muck around with.  Finally, the playback is severely inhibited.  Basic mechanisms like reverse slow motion, or scene looping are not functional.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has its times but then you have yo play he same games over and over to unlock new ones but all in all I like it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nothing to fancy but a great way to waste time. I play all the time. also great for kepping the little one occupied

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just read The Hunger Games yesterday. In one day. I am not one to usually jump on a popular book band wagon, but it was recommended by Amazon for me, and I literally could not put it down. I couldn't believe it was a \\"young adult\\" novel. Very graphic. Sort of like 1984 meets Lord of the Flies meets The Running Man with a little Handmaid's Tale thrown in at the end. It has that kind of \\"lost cause\\" situation, with a hero who beats the odds, that is the premise behind most good fiction. However, in this case, winning may mean survival, but is not winning at all when you have to lose your humanity, freedom and self-efficacy to cross the finish line. I won't give away the ending, but WOW.
0525478817|5.0|Where do I start with this book?  I've been a John Green fan ever since Looking for Alaska, a book I desperately wish that I'd written.  Now comes another one that I wish I'd written, but I will have to content myself with writing about it.  I won't bother with telling you the plotline - you can read the book description for that.  Instead I'll tell you what this story does for you -or did for me, anyway.  The Fault in our Stars takes you apart slowly, lays all the pieces of you out, mixes them up, then puts them back together in a different order. You come out of this story a different person, a little sadder, a little more joyful, and a whole lot soggier.  This is the only time I've cried for the entire last two-thirds of a book. By page 117, I was sniffling.  By page 199, I was leaking tears.  From page 204 on, I was a quivering wreck.  Lest you think this book is a downer, just know that the weeping comes with equal parts of cheering and laughter as you root for Hazel Grace and her true love Augustus. They are two of the bravest, most likable protagonists to come along in a YA book in a very long time. The emotional weight of the book comes from the fact that we really love these two kids and are hanging in there with them the whole way.  If you want to go on a profound, life-changing journey, read this book. If you want to fall in love, read this book.  Dang it all, just read this book.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|There are already a bunch of people that have reviewed the movie and I assume even more will review it later, so I'll be brief and just say that I absolutely love the movie (5/5 stars) and already have it on pre-order.  However, for those of you trying to decide between blu-ray and the regular DVD, here are a few things that might help:  First off, the Blu-Ray really only has two true extras, \\"The Minutes\\" and extended/deleted scenes. Overall, the Minutes special was good. It was probably about 15-20 minutes long. (I didn't time it so I'm just guessing by what it felt like.) However, it is NOT a making-of feature like I originally thought.  It's actually a bunch of fake interviews that took place before the movie was made that involve most of the main characters, as well as some new ones, such as one of the original creators of immortality. They were interesting and added extra information to the world, but if you're looking for an actual documentary on the creation of the movie, you'll have to look elsewhere.  As for the deleted/extra scenes, they were hit and miss. Some of the scenes added some very interesting information that I wish they'd kept in the movie while others merely added a line or two to an existing scene and it didn't make any difference at all. Overall, I think there were about ten of them (again, I'm guessing since I didn't count) but the first three or four are the \\"added a line or two\\" variety and pretty boring.  So, that's all I gotta say. I just wanted to let people know.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|One of the fun things about school used to be writing compare and contrast papers on subjects and maybe that's what The Doors are offering in \\"L.A. Woman, the 40th Anniversary Edition.\\"  This two disc set has the original \\"L.A. Woman\\" album as it appeared in 1971, although the songs are remastered they're not the 2007 remastered/remixed versions.<br /><br />The first disc is the \\"L.A. Woman\\" we all know and love and doesn't need to be reviewed 40 years on. \\"L.A. Woman\\" has been well defined, The Doors blues album, Jim Morrison's farewell ode to L.A. and a rock album that, without any hyperbole (or very little) was almost instantly a rock \\"classic\\" album.<br /><br />The fun in listening to \\"L.A. Woman, the 40th Anniversary Edition\\" is disc 2 with the alternate takes, false starts, and the studio chatter between The Doors its clear they were having a lot of fun recording \\"L.A. Woman.\\" In the alternate versions its interesting to see how the now classic songs evolved and sounded different, and even changed from take to take, Morrison changing lyrics and even his delivery between takes, and how musically even some of the phrasing was different from the final versions, especially in an album that was recorded within a short period of time. The addition of \\"She Smells so Nice\\", which sounds like a Grateful Dead jam and not a Doors song, but it's a carefree blues romp with absolutely no pretensions that segues into \\"Rock Me\\" a standard The Doors played a lot live.<br /><br />If you don't mind the inclusion of another remastered album \\"L.A. Woman, the 40th Anniversary Edition\\" is a five star recommendation that you'll find yourself listening to years from now, just like the original.<br /><br />Jim Cherry writes The Doors Examiner.
B0063TX06I|1.0|You will expect at least a decent remastered process for this true gem, like they did in 2011 with Bee Gees First, Horizontal and Idea. But don't let them fool you, this 2011 Main Course isn't remastered at all.  This one sound exactly the same as the 1994 Polydor version, even the cover art are better in polydor version than this 2011 made by rhino.  It is very disappointment for all Bee Gees fans, especially when you see what other labels are made with  other catalogues like Beatles or Jethro Tull.  I am not complaining about the music, the music here is great and we all love the Bee Gees and this album is one of the best.  I really want this album with the appropriate remastered process, songs like Country Lanes, Songbird, Baby As You Turn Away and All This Making Love deserve a great remastered, the other songs are great too but we already have them in other compilations already remastered.  If you don't have this album I strongly recommend to buy it.  It is really great music, but if you already have the polydor version don't bother on this one.
0312330537|5.0|A wonderful book. A masterpiece.  It is one of the best books that I've read in 60 plus years as an avid reader.
B003XQ2VOG|4.0|This review is from: Fantastic Voyage (1966) - The Lost World (1960) - The Towering Inferno (1974) - Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea ( (DVD)<br />I love sci fi and beautiful sexy women. I've seen all these movies a few times but am glad I now have them on DVD for our family library.<br /><br />The color was good and so was the audio.<br /><br />My favorite was Fantastic Voyage about a Russian scientist getting brain injured who has the secret of controlling miniaturization over an hour. The US has a top secret base for microscopic miniaturization but it only lasts one hour. A submarine, scientists and doctors, and Raquel Welch as a technician are miniaturized and injected into the body of the Russian scientist in order to laser dissolve his brain clot. Fantastic imagery of the inside body parts and blood system. Stephan Boyd stars with Donald Pleasence. Donald stars as a scientist and an enemy saboteur. Raquel Welch is attacked by sticky antibodies on her skin tight leather like outside the sub mission suit. She is gorgeous and again exudes female sexuality. She even has some lines in this movie. I liked her better in her fur bikini in One Million BC. This DVD was 4 stars without Raquel Welch and 4 1/3 stars with her in it. Good plot and acting. Great special effects and the sexy Raquel Welch.<br /><br />One of my favorite authors is Sir Aurther Conan Doyle creator of Sherlock Holmes (See my reviews) . He also wrote The Lost World and more. The Lost world on DVD is about Professor Challenger finding a plateau deep in the Amazon with prehistoric monsters and more. There was an ancient Amazonian Indian tribe and a sexy Indian women who helps the trapped expedition members escape. Along the way diamonds and a T Rex egg that hatches are found and brought back to the civilized world. Michael Renee stars of the epic The Day The Earth Stood still (See my review) is in this DVD. Sexy Jill St John also stars. Great plot and acting. The dinosaur scenes were only 3 star and could of been more varied. The two dinosaurs looked like a doctored up Iguana and a Crocodile. 4 stars<br /><br />Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea staring Walter Pidgeon as Admiral Nelson (Starred in the Epic Forbidden Planet and Peter Loree as Professor/Commandore Edly (who starred in the epic Disney Twenty Thousand leagues Under the Sea )( See my reviews). Sexy Barbra Eden (star of I Dream of Jeanie) stars as a Leutenant nurse. The Van Allen Belt catches fire from a Meteor storm and Admiral Nelson and crew of the fantastic submarine Seaview must hurry to launch a nuclear missile to put out the sky fire. Giant octopus attacking Seaview and a UN attacking sub scene. Great special effects. Good color and audio. 4 stars<br /><br />The Towering Inferno was not a sci fi movie but a survival story about a 120 story building in San Francisco catching fire. About 200 die and lots of destruction. This movie won 2 Oscars. Lots of stars in this movie. Steven McQueen as a Battalion Fire Chief and Paul Newman as the architect of the building star. Two of my favorite actors. Also Robert Wagner, Robert Vaughn and Fred Astaire star. I reserve my opinion on this movie as OJ Simpson had a role in it as a security guard. I don't want to voice an opinion of anything he ever played in. I wish I could of erased the OJ part. Deliberately not rated.<br /><br />A nice DVD set for your family library.

0439023521|5.0|Really enjoyed this series of books, this book being the perfect opener.  Though it was violent and morbid, it told an important story about a future society gone wrong after a violent civil war.  The revolution caused by and told through these books is uplifting in theory though the story itself is dreary at best through the end.  As with all revolutions, important people have to die and endings do not turn out as planned.  A+ books, hope they do not ruin them with the movies!

B003924NY0|5.0|Johnny Winter's lone entry in the hugely successful \\"Original Album Classics\\" Series is a genuine nugget. A 5CD Mini Box Set concentrating on his rightly celebrated Late Sixties/Early Seventies Blues-Rock output - it's also mid-price into the bargain.<br /><br />Released 24 January 2011 in the UK (1 Feb 2011 in the USA) - each CD is housed in a singular card sleeve which repro's in miniature the back and front artwork of the original vinyl LP (with recording info, production credits etc downloadable via the Net from Sony's website). Columbia/Sony Legacy 886976561727 breaks down as follows:<br /><br />Disc 1 is \\"Johnny Winter\\" released May 1969 on Columbia CS 9826 in the USA and June 1969 on CBS S 63619 in the UK (34:14 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 2 is \\"Second Winter\\" released as a 3-sided 2LP set in November 1969 on Columbia K2S 9947 in the USA and May 1970 in the UK on CBS S 66321 (46:57 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 3 is \\"Live/Johnny Winter And\\" released March 1971 in the USA on Columbia CS PC 30475 and in the UK on CBS S 64289 (40:12 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 4 is \\"Still Alive And Well\\" released April 1973 on Columbia KC 32188 in the USA and in the UK on CBS S 65484 (44:32 minutes)<br />[Note: Tracks 11 and 12 \\"Lucille\\" and \\"From A Buick Six\\" are bonus tracks]<br /><br />Disc 5 is \\"Saints & Sinners\\" released February 1974 in the USA on Columbia KC 32715 in the USA and in the UK on CBS S 65842 (41:48 minutes)<br />[Note: Track 11 \\"Dirty\\" is a bonus track]<br /><br />Winter's debut LP \\"The Progressive Blues Experiment\\" was released on Imperial Records in the States in April 1969 - so the first disc on here \\"Johnny Winter\\" is actually his 2nd album and his debut for Columbia Records. Along with its impossibly cool follow-up \\"Second Winter\\" (a 3-sided 2LP set where Side 4 was blank) - they are vinyl treasures I've had on my turntables for over 40 years.<br /><br />Highlights from both include the twin guitar boogie of \\"I'm Yours And I'm Hers\\" along with the stunning National Steel slide of \\"Dallas\\". And as if to stamp his credentials on the genre, the cover of the Muddy Waters staple \\"Mean Mistreater\\" features two huge Blues Legends - Willie Dixon on Bass and Walter \\"Shakey\\" Horton on Blues Harp. Speaking of mean harmonica warblers - Winter's own Harp playing on \\"Back Door Friend\\" makes him sound like some 70-year old veteran. The immediately impressive \\"I Love Everybody\\" track from \\"Second Winter\\" turned up on those CBS sampler LPs in 1970 and 1971 while his cover of Percy Mayfield's \\"Memory Pain\\" sounded so hard rock - a great opening salvo and a clever reading of the changing sounds of the time.<br /><br />But like Rory Gallagher on \\"Live In Europe\\" (another genuine guitar hero), it wasn't until 1971 that you heard the full power of Winter and his band on the now legendary \\"Live\\" album. There are versions of the Stones' \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" and Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" that are arguably definitive - blistering stuff. I'm afraid I threw many a guitar shape to these tracks in my living room as a teenager...oh dear...<br /><br />The final two albums featured here - \\"Still Alive And Well\\" and \\"Saints And Sinners\\" - saw RICK DERRINGER both join the ranks and produce. The Canned Heat/ZZ Top boogie of \\"Rock & Roll\\" (lyrics above) and the Slide Blues of \\"Too Much Seconal\\" showed that the magic was still there (even if the drugs seemed to be getting the better of him). His version of the Stones \\"Silver Train\\" from 1973's \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" sounds so much like them that it might very well have been an outtake from that Stones session with Winter singing lead vocal instead of Mick Jagger. His funky spoken intro of \\"I'm hungry...Let's do this f****er...\\" to \\"Still Alive And Well\\" raises a laugh to this day and his raucous version of Chuck Berry's \\"Thirty Days\\" is great fun too. And on it goes...<br /><br />To sum up - nearly 6 albums worth of great Blues-Rock for roughly two quid a record is a bit of a no-brainer really.<br /><br />No Winter of discontent here folks. Recommended.<br /><br />PS: and if you want more check out his late Seventies collaborations with MUDDY WATERS on Blue Sky Records which feature Winter producing and playing on all (see the 3CD \\"Original Album Classics\\" box set). There is also a Legacy Double of \\"Second Winter\\" and a \\"Woodstock\\" version of \\"Johnny Winter\\" - both have bonus discs with superb previously unreleased live material from the period<br /><br />PPS: in the 'comment' section attached to this review is a list of all titles in the \\"Original Album Classics\\" Series to January 2012 (over 145 titles - 5CD and 3CD sets)RS on Blue Sky Records which feature Winter producing and playing on all (see the 3CD \\"Original Album Classics\\" box set).

B001R10BMS|3.0|This is the last and final film with Sean Connery as James Bond. He's aged a bit but there's nothing wrong with that. The script is not top notch. A little on the cheesy side. There are some scenes under water which look alot like Thunderball. Thunderball was still much better than this. If you're a big James Bond fan then you should get this. If you're a casual fan then maybe this is not for you. Hard to say. I did enjoy it, it just wasn't as good as other James Bond films. Like I think the best James Bond ever would have to be \\"You Only Live Twice\\". Then comes From Russia with Love, then second is Thunderball, Then third favorite was Goldfinger, then Dr. No. The worst was Timothy Dalton. The two films he made were so poorly written and poorly performed that I have to wonder, what went wrong? This is an adequate bond film and is worth giving a look at.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|The Windows version has &quot;strikethrough&quot; as a text format option.  Please bring it to the other platforms!  Otherwise, this is a daily use program.
1609611543|5.0|This book was recommeneded by my chiropractor.  It is a wonderful read! If you are going to purchase it then you should read the whole thing to fully understand why this doctor recommends a wheat free lifestyle.  What I found very helpful was it isn't just about being wheat free - most people replace wheat whith substitutes that are just as bad for you - which should be avoided just as wheat should be avoided.  I have recommened this book to many people and have adopted the lifestyle.  All sorts of aligments have cleared up with my family including mystery rashes and pimples.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  I would suggest everyone with a good heart watches this one! Great movie for a great movie night with my loved one.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|After re-reading Pride & Prejudice for the second time, then reading Christmas at Pemberly for fun, I was looking forward to submersing myself in a good ole PD James mystery set in one of my favorite venues.  Alas.... I was so disappointed.  It was only because of the author's reputation that I read it through to the end.  The characters never did leave the page and the plot was unimaginative.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I must be honest, I was never one to watch smallville on it's tv run. I thought it was only a teen show. What a mistake that was! I started watching smallville on amazon video playback and was completely hooked. What a fantastic series!! It's a shame so many armchair bloggers criticized the series. It is a fabulous combination of superman, DC lore and creating a pre superman saga that was believable. The first 5 series was dedicated to teen Clark and the second half was adult Clark. It was a wonderful journey. Watching Clark and company grow up was one of the best show experiences I have ever had. While this was a bit pricey, I was happy to pay it to have the entire series so I can leisurely go thru all the seasons over and over again. Every actor and actress on this series was spectacular and the writing was terrific. Despite having their budget cut, the series still delivered joy, pain, laughter, chills and thrills. And we still get to see Clark take to the sky in the finale! A great investment even for a non comic book reader.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I titled my review surprise BC of all the poor to medicore reviews I have read. Let me start this review off by saying its not the developers fault the your carrier decided to load ur phone full of bloatware. So don't just rate something 1 star BC ur pissed u can't delete bloatware.  MY devices Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Samsung Droid Charge(Verizon)  This app is great in my opinion. It does all it says. Cloud play is great. I read some ppl claiming that their music got lost. If this is the case for u make sure when buying ur music it was saved to the cloud drive. All music bought from amazon is free to store in the cloud and unlimited. However uploaded music is limited to 5gb which is quite small.  So when choosing b/w Google Music and Amazon that's something to consider. Both players are equally good. I think the deciding factor here is where you have bought more music. personally I have bought more from Amazon BC of the $5 alblums which are cheaper than what Google sells music for.  1annoying thing is the app does emphasize the store part of the app as much as the player. The album view could also be made to look more aesthetic.
0525423273|3.0|The book was cute. I thought  the author kept stretching the story. But I enjoyed it.It took me forever to finish it seems like it dragged a lot. It is a very cute read.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|While this does what it says it does, the item is extremely cheaply made. The auto reverse and rewind never worked, and the play button stopped working after the first play. I do NOT recommend this product.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Works great for me so far, but it constantly requests update downloads, and now I see that the terms &amp; conditions are quite invasive; they can use or sell your notes or uploaded info at their leisure to promote their app. Considering uninstalling this just for THAT reason.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This is a great game to have a bunch of friends sit around and think of ways to make new elements. I am currently at 272 and I have not used any type of guide

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have found this case to be the perfect for the Kindle Fire. It snaps on securely, props up the screen for video viewing, and overall just feels great in your hands. Many people have reviewed poorly siting poor workmanship or design, but honestly I wonder if they reviewed the wrong case. This case is extremely durable, yet so lightweight it doesn't feel like I have added a case at all. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a case. If I had any complain it would be the packaging delivered in. Packaging was very typical amazon minimalist, but the case arrived quickly and without damage.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I don't recommend buying this watch at all. I've had the watch for 18 months and began having battery problems after I downloaded the latest software for it from the Garmin website (at 13 months...one month out of warranty...ouch). The watch started to shut off far too soon, sometimes after just minutes, claiming it was out of battery even though it had sufficient charge when I left the house. I don't run a lot and have never gone over 2 miles, so it didn't go through a lot of charge cycles or even get used very much. I had hoped it would help me get into shape but now I'm frustrated and mad that I wasted my money. I tried a hard reset and now the thing won't even stay on for more than a few minutes at all and it alternates between saying it's 0% charged and 99% charged.  I don't seem to be alone with battery problems either. I searched the internet and found many with similar problems on the 405 and 405CX. I could send it back to Garmin and get a refurbished watch for $110 but I've read online that others who've done this have ended up with refurbished watches with the same battery problem!!!  When it worked, it worked great. I liked how it gave me a pace time while I ran, kept track of how far I'd gone, and measured my heart rate. But now it's e-waste and worse, I don't have insentive to go out running.  My husband and I bought our watches at the same time. His seems to be working fine, though I don't know if he's upgraded his the software on his watch or not. But it could be a matter of time until his fails. Unless you want to gamble your money, I don't recommend this watch.
B004UID2LC|3.0|this app worked fine until the update that was pushed last week.  now, just mp3's download. videos can only be viewed, which is why I gave this 3 stars. hoping that next update fixes video issue.
0439813786|5.0|I like to keep my reviews pretty short. Hugo Cabret is pretty deep for a book that's mostly told in pictures. You have a boy named Hugo who tries to figure out the mystery of an automaton. That's basically the premise in one sentence but it's so much better. I loved the wonderfully drawn pictures, and the story was great. I need need to see the movie ASAP.. I recommend it reading it because it's short and sweet. What do you have to lose I read it in like an hour.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I really enjoy this game, but it's rather cumbersome.  It should be easier for continuous play, such as not having to keep re-selecting tiles, background, etc., for every single layout.  I would also prefer not to have to redo the tutorial with each new username.  The game apparently does not allow resetting stats on the same user, so I've been changing usernames back and forth.  Other than those nits, the graphics are great, and the layouts very intricate.  One of the best majhong programs I've tried.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app has so many translations and Bible study plans. It is a great way to keep up with daily readings.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|A true classic of horror. It has aged very well and certainly has passed the test of time. I could read it over and over again without fail.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is pretty fun but some of th games are really dumb.  works well on kindle fire. great time killer
B00140PK6O|5.0|The lives of villagers in Cranford are chronicled in this five-part series.  Dame Judi Dench is superb as the retiring sister of a much more outspoken, firmly conservative spinster, played by Dame Eileen Atkins.  There is romance, despair, hope, and death, all tied together in a way which brings delight.
B000002N3N|5.0|I've only found Enyas music 3 years ago  and have enjoyed listening to it every day. Her music is very spirital and honest .

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun and challenging , at first I didn't like it but as I continued to play I enjoyed it.
B00005JMK0|5.0|Usually, when a movie doesn't come out on DVD for a long time, it's because of music licensing issues.  When the original contracts were drawn up for the music used in the film, they negotiated for film distribution, vhs distribution, and possibly television distribution.  However, when it comes time to release on a new format like DVD, they have to re-negotiate again to use the music.  Sometimes, the record labels, bands, and/or songwriters play nice in the negotiations and the DVD comes out right away.  Other times, it turns into a major battle and holds up the release forever.  Occasionally, the company that owns the rights to the movie (but not the music) will just replace the music with different music and release the DVD.  A good example of this is the original DVD release of \\"Sixteen Candles\\".  Read some of the reviews here on Amazon and you'll see tons of people complaining about the songs that were changed.  I'm willing to be that Electric Dreams is one of those movies where the music rights are preventing a DVD release.  What a shame.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I wish they had more games that I knew but it is still a great game and I suggest getting it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because of all the translations and some include audio which is very helpful. I like to listen to the audio especially in some of the more difficult reading of the old testament.
B00000F14B|4.0|It is a great movie, but the DVD I bought had problems in it.  I had to index forward and come back (fast reverse) in order not to miss too much.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pleasant way to pass the time.  Some games are very addictive.  It doesn't take too long for the points to add up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good app for any age, because it is free is very appealing and I like that you only have to tap cards for them to move!
B005LAIGMS|5.0|I loved Haywire, it was a refreshing old school action movie with a simple primal and clean plot (revenge) that relied on awesome fighting scenes and great action rather than the much over used special effects that we see way too much nowadays.  I was REALLY impressed with Gina Carano in this movie not only was this her first real movie, and not only was she in there with a top notch all-star who's who of Hollywood cast where poor acting would have REALLY stood out but she was the star of the movie, who the movie was focused on, and she did an amazing job of carrying this movie.  Gina's fight scenes were just awesome!!!!!, her portrayal of a gorgeous badass black opps contractor for hire was totally believable..............I also found myself both liking and rooting for Mallory Kane (Gina's character) and the fighting scenes were so brutally real i found myself cringing and wincing at some of the impacts................Like I said it was hard to believe this was Carano's first real movie, if she doesnt become a \\"bigtime\\" action star like the Rock I will be very surprised and very disappointed!!!!  I'm REALLY hoping for a sequel to Haywire it kinda reminded me of the Bourne series movies..........All I can say to anyone who  didnt like Haywire, I think either you dont really care for action movies or you saw the big time all star cast and figured there would be a much more complex plot with more dramatic character development and acting  rather than the simple very clean plot that I feel worked very well, with the main focus on the amazing fight and action scenes..........on a similar note to anyone who didnt like Gina Carano as Mallory Kane, you have to ask yourself was she believable as a gorgeous badass black opps contractor for hire, did you find yourself liking and/or rooting for Mallory Kane, did you find yourself cringing or wincing during any of the brutally realistic fighting scenes.........if you answered yes to any of these then Gina did a great job............Good actors or actresses inspire strong feelings, they pull you into the movie and make you feel what they are feeling, like or hate or root for them........Poor actors are either miscast and/or not believable in their roles or say or do something annoying or distracting that takes our focus away from the story and character they are trying to portray. The acting and casting in Haywire was top notch.  Right now the Rock is the ONLY real \\"bigtime\\" action star we have Stalone, Arnold, VanDam, Seagal,  etc......have pretty much passed the baton and are pretty much retired action movie stars, and we've NEVER really had a woman action star............I think just like The Rock, Gina Carano has the charm, charisma, beauty and skills to become a bigtime action star.........I think thats what Soderberg saw in her as well, and I think thats why she was so popular in MMA...........she has that \\"something special\\" that will allow her to fill a key niche and make lots of amazing badass movies, she's a total package with amazing fighting skills that translate to the big screen very well, great charisma and charm, and a rare combination of beauty, while still being totally believable as a badass..............I cant think of another action star who was as good in their first movie........she was MUCH better than Arnold, VanDam, Seagall,  Rampage Jackson...........and worlds better than Triple H, John Cena etc.........under MUCH more difficult circumstances ( being the STAR of her first movie with an all star who's who of Hollywood cast to measure up to)  Like the Rock I also think Carano could be versatile enough to play other roles than action and be good.  she has a lot of charm and charisma and a genuine down to earth sweetness and I think she would be could in romantic comedy type movies and of course super hero movies and dramas...........Not sure if she could be mean enough to play a villain or not though........but I do think she would make an AMAZING  Wonder Woman........since Lynda Carter played that role I NEVER thought another actress could match up to her but I take that back today Carano has the beauty, charm, sweetness and amazing smile to play the role plus she brings the badass amazonian comic book presence to the role as well that I cant see ANYONE but her bringing.  In closing I'm hoping to see more Haywire sequels!!!!...........and ALOT more Gina Carano!!!!!
B005HSG3VK|1.0|Very disappointed in this cover.  It is cheap looking and ugly.  The plastic and cover is so thin it probably won't provide any protection at all.  The only good thing I can say about it is that it fits in it easily.  Tried to get the stand to work, but I can't.  If you want something protective and lightweight, use duct tape.  It would look about the same.  Update:  Returned this and got an M-Edge Incline case which I purchased from Best Buy.  Paid the same price.  Classy looking, adds real protection, and a place for the stylus.
B003WFA09Q|4.0|I happen to be a huge period piece buff, and David Copperfield is so rich with characters. Perfect for showing off the acting chops~and the acting in this version is top notch. Uriah Heep is one of the smarmiest characters in literature and watching his character in this adaption made my flesh crawl. Perfect!

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I highly recommend reading this book, it is well done, accurate from what I have seen and goes from point a to point z! Steve Jobs was an amazing person, bit of a jerk at times, but a must read.
B0043URV5U|3.0|Firstly I'm starting off by saying this set is the best mastered set of Bob's music to date including the remasters and really blows the first hits collection sound-wise away. That said there is a whole lot of room for more material, each cd clocks in at around 55 minutes, I bought this set at Wal-Mart because it boasts an exclusive track titled \\"Living Inside My Heart\\" the glaring omissions were previously mentioned in other reviews but what I don't understand is the necessity for edits. \\"Katmandu\\" and \\"We've Got Tonight\\" both lost a full minute and there is no reason, it's not like there isn't enough programming space. If this set is intended as a recap of a stellar career and a swan song it's a rather stingy way to close out. The second best thing about this, the price is at a single disc rate.

0439023521|5.0|I think this book is listed as being for teen/young adult readers, but after hearing two local DJ's talk about how much they both enjoyed the book, I got a copy for myself.  The Hunger Games is a pretty plausible potential future scenario, and it hooked me from the very start.  I would definitely recommend this book to younger female readers, because the heroine is a young girl dealing with difficult circumstances, and using her wits, hunting ability, and determination to succeed, not her looks or her body.  It's an exciting, quick read and I didn't want it to end.  Fortunately, it doesn't since there are two more books in this series.

B002ZG98UA|1.0|I can't believe I paid money for this. There was no character development, no plot etc. It's pretty bad that they actually had a budget to make this movie, the effects weren't even that great as there was no substance behind them. Don't waste your money on this.
B0068TL23G|4.0|Overall I'm glad I got this game. I enjoy games that make me think and may require a few tries to get the best solution. Tweak the game and options a bit and this is easily a 5 star app.  My biggest complaint is the only way to modify lines while playing is to click the undo arrow button at the bottom which removes lines in reverse order that you placed them.  Several times it would have been helpful if I could choose which line to remove as I might need to make changes to the line I drew first but would like to keep some of the lines I drew since then.  Hopefully the developers take a look at reviews and consider this for an update.  Note: I got this when it was the FAOTD but would probably pay .99 for it.
1439192812|4.0|The book starts out explaining what science is and several of the pitfalls of understanding into which people fall.  Illustrations by Dave McKean are interesting and colorful to say the least.  I loved seeing his renditions of James The Amazing Randi, Penn & Teller, Richard Dawkins, Hume, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the wide variety of mythical figures and real cosmic objects and other items of nature.  Dawkins does a great job of pointing out the arbitrary and silly aspects of world myths that have been repeated so often that they are so imbedded in the cultural psyche as to be respected if not fully believed.  Myths from various world religions were used to contrast how people once answered questions in comparison to how they are answered today, with science.  It is arguable that the first and last chapters are the best parts of the book.  Dawkins explains what science is and what he and others mean by magic in the first chapter.  In the last chapter, Dawkins ends his with Hume's take on miracles.  He doesn't say that miracles do not occur, he simply points out that it is more productive to question claims of miracles and judge their probability rather than accept them without question.  He points out that there are more options than many people take into consideration when a story is told.  The story could have been true, the people in the story could have been wrong or deceitful or the entire story may be fictional or terribly exaggerated.  That is not to say that the rest of the book doesn't have important material.  The best science chapter in the book is on who the first people were and an explanation of our ancestry.  It was a colorful and clear explanation of the times involved and the way inheritance works over long time periods.  Of course, this is part of Dawkins' specialty.  There are parts explaining rainbows and seasons and a variety of other scientific concepts that are a good reminder for those who haven't had a science class in a long time, and thesection on why bad things happen was a very important one, which I would recommend to anyone.  I was a bit surprised that illusion artists, such as Sandro del Prete or authors on illusions such as Al Seckel weren't mentioned in the section on why people see images that they expect to see in odd places, and Michael Shermer has written on many of the topics that Dawkins brought up, but his is also absent from the discussion and illustrations.  The book is not without its faults, however.  Dawkins factually, it is quite accurate.  I must note that there is an illustration describing antibodies, yet erroneously referring to them as T-cells.  Dawkins explained that his favorite meaning of magic is the poetic one in which it is anything that causes awe, hence the title of the book.  However, the book was so short and directed toward such a young audience that I'm not sure that it will cause much awe at the wonder of what is truly real.  I have been awestruck by the anatomic details outlining our evolutionary heritage, math that can unite and explain rainbows and how to track an elephant as well as discussions of the mating strategies of wasps, all from Dawkins' books.  Perhaps having learned the science in \\"The Magic of Reality\\" so long ago is what has jaded me to this.  I do hope young children will find this book engaging, but it certainly could have used more humor and perhaps a bit more of the style of  David Macaulay's \\"The Way Things Work\\" or Larry Gonick's \\"Cartoon History of the Universe\\".
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I purchased Ms. Clarkson's CD because I like her MUSIC ... not her politics.  I also like the Dixie Chicks and could care less what they said about our last pres.  If I only purchased items based on the artist's politics or religion? what a STUPID way to live!  I saw her perform on Saturday Night Live and in a Toyota commercial and decided to give her a shot.  I'm enjoying the CD but DO NOT believe I'm endorsing Ron Paul in any way ... can't stand the guy.

0062119044|5.0|I must admit that I am shocked at the simple minded bad reviews of this book. This book will stay with me forever, and no, not in a good way but that is the point of the book.  Yes, the main character is pretentious and hard to like but made that way for a reason. This is a very deep book. This is a mother's struggle to figure out why she had such trouble loving her son and being able to admit that she just might be as bad as he is. Of course there is no answer to why Kevin did it, if so she would be famous as the person who put an end to school shootings and sociopaths. You can tell a story without a happy ending or explanation. Why everyone expected the reasons to be so cut and dried is to me an idication of people who should stick to romance and murder mysteries with no character depth. This character is baring her soul and never claims to be perfect. She tells things that most people could never admit or come to grips with.  This book is horrifying but that is what grabs you. I will admit he first 50 pages are a struggle because. of the over the top metaphors, descriptions, and vocabulary but makes up for it to those who stick with it. I personally enjoy a challenge and a chance to expand my own vocabulary.  If you are buying this as a light read or to figure out exactly what makes a kid shoot up their school, don't bother. This is a dark and tragic tale that leaves you angry and broken hearted.  I personally thought it was the most gripping thing I've ever read and that's all that matters to me. Reviews have become too personal and without merit. I'm starting to think they should leave the written part out because if I would have believed negative reviews I would have missed out on an amazing book.

0316172324|5.0|I read this book in a day and a half.  I could´t stop reading it.  It was smooth as reading a novel, yet so full of information and concepts.  Throughout the book the author Malcolm Gladwell is smarting moving gradually from concepts more easy to grasp and accept  to more difficult ones as he touches issues we perhaps don´t want to accept as easily.  The book starts by making a very interesting point regarding the \\"blink\\" we are able to have, the intuition we have that something is either wrong or right, or one way or another, and how that may well be the better judgement we can ever make of something.  The book then follows on and shows how this intuition, this understanding from the unconscious mind as he calls it is a quick unconscious interpretation of all the information we have stored in our heads, which we cannot correctly and quickly enough analyse with our conscious/thinking mind, but which we can with our unconscious mind.  The author then goes further and shows how these unconscious decisions are either correct or wrong depending on the accumulated information we carry on our minds.  The unconscious mind making a good decision: the tennis coach that could correctly predict when a player was going to double fault in a match with 90 to 100% precision, but could´t understand how he was predicting it.  The unconscious mind making a bad decision: the orchestra conductor systematically not hiring women specially in instruments traditionally considered man instruments because their ability to listen correctly and have a good judgement on whether the player was good or not was affected and influenced by their unconscious mind and all the stored prejudiced against women players.  And just as I was finishing the book and thinking to myself: \\"This is very nice information and sure explains a lot of the behaviour I see around me but how do we use it to our advantage?  How do we go on implementing it, how do we fix the bias and use the intuition capacity of our mind to our advantage?\\", the author dare us to think in our lives, to think in the processes we lead or participate in, what information is in excess and is confusing our mind to take the correct decision and filter that information so that we do not have access to it.  He gives the example of the orchestras in the US which in 25 years of having behind the screen auditions increased the number of women players form 5 to 50%.  The author suggests something similar is done in courts where people should not see the person being accused of a crime.  I hope the book also get reads by physicians.  The example the book gives of a doctor which was able through a mathematical and statistical approach identify the key parameters in confirming whether a person was indeed suffering a heart attach and draw an equation and a decision tree based on those parameters is nothing knew to science and engineering.  I hope the medical community starts doing more of that.  What an statistic and mathematical approach to the issue at hand is able to do is to put into an equation the knowledge otherwise acquired only through experience.  By doing so, our mind is then free to grasp other principles which somehow we have not been able to put into equations (and perhaps we never will) and can only be gained through experiences and be processed in our unconscious mind.  Different people will get a different perspective of the book depending on the circumstances they are living, to me the above is a summary of what I got most from the book.
1451627289|5.0|I love time-travel stories and my expectation and anticipation for 11/22/63 was high. I have cautiously wended my way back to reading Stephen King and so far it's been a mixed bag (I loved Cell; I found Duma Key and Under the Dome to be adequate) but 11/22/63 was masterful storytelling by King.  Told from a first person narrative, 11/22/63 introduces us to the protagonist, Jake Epping. Jake is conscripted by his friend and local diner owner Al, to go back in time to 1963, via a \\"rabbit hole\\" discovered by Al., to try and stop Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating President Kennedy.  The catch is that the \\"traveler\\" always ends up five years earlier to the year 1958 and no matter how long the travel is gone back in time, only two minutes will have passed in 2011. Jake has personal motivations for going back in time, so he takes up the banner for his dying friend Al to try to save JFK and along the way, change the tragic fate of one of his students. Soon Jake discovers that the past fights back against being changed and on the way to his mission to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating JFK, many things occur to balance and harmonize the changes that Jake's presence makes in the time stream.  It's a given that there is usually no happily-ever-after with a Stephen King novel, but at least the ending to 11/22/63 is not devastating but instead poignant, bittersweet, and leaves the reader wistful. I read every page with pure anticipation and even read the afterword and wrap up by the author because I was so enthralled by the overall story.  11/22/63 is the type of novel that made me a rabid Stephen king fan decades ago and restored my trust and faith in the outstanding storyteller that King can be.
0439023513|1.0|As it frequently happens with sequels, a bad turned into worse and then subsequently into worst.  While Hunger Games was readable, Catching Fire was quite bad, Mockingjay is absolute and utter manure.  While there had been thousands of terrible books clearly written with a Hollywood movie in mind, this is definitely one of the worst.  The story is awful, the plot is weak, and the characters are implausible. I read through it with a feeling of profound disgust, while hoping for something in the end to actually make it worth the time wasted on this piece of \\"literature\\".  Unfortunately, the end was even more revolting than the rest of the book.  In short, this book is not worth the paper it was printed on and is definitely not worth your time.  I certainly feel that I would never pick this book up again and would highly recommend that you don't waste your time on it.
0439023521|5.0|This is the BEST book I've ever read. Its so amazing, i dont think i could live without it. The characters are Katniss and Peeta and writen by Katniss's viewpoint the whole time. Though the main characters are Katniss and Peeta, Katniss offen goes back to the times spent with Gale. I read the whloe series twice. (I hate rereading books) What happens is North America is pretty much destoryed and rose from the ashes is 12 districts (13 one got ruined, not telling you any more about it)Also theres the Capital who makes them fight in a dealth torament.I wish i could tell you all the details and how Peeta............ PLEASE read this book, you get hooked after the second chapter. Don't stop after the first chapter beacuse...well....it kinda stinks in the first chapter. But after that you get obessed and start to talk about and get your friends to read it finally make your parents get mad beacuse you talk about it to much. I LOVE THIS BOOK

0062011847|3.0|I am a long time reader of Pratchett and I really enjoyed this book.  It was not a great one like \\"Hat full of sky\\", \\"Guards Guards\\", or the \\"Hogfather\\", but it was enjoyable and worth reading.  This is an fun book about Commander Vimes and his \\"Busman's Honeymoon.\\"  The Commander and family go off to relax and spend some time on the family's country estate and instead they find prejudice, oppression and murder.  Though not as bright and snappy as some of his early books I like this turn towards topical humanitarian subjects.  In this book unlike early works instead of making fun of fantasy, science and popculture he takes a stab at racial and ethnic prejudice.  He exposes the the ridiculousness, pettiness, and ignorance behind discworlders prejudice against goblins and the darker side of that prejudice, cruelty, and dehumanization. In this sense dehumanization meaning severe cruelty towards thinking creatures.  Despite this he does a super job talking about, justice, police work and learning about other peoples.  It may not have the bubbly satire of fantasy and science fiction it has instead taken a turn towards politics, and intercultural racial and ethic understanding.  Still just as clever and tongue in cheek as ever.
0307716511|2.0|Based on the description, I really thought this would be a book I would enjoy. It started out okay, but I found the constant and random dialogue with the sister distracting and annoying. I started and stopped reading it several times, each time hoping that it would get better.  I may have found the book more enjoyable if each chapter started with dialogue to the sister that would tie in to the chapter. The book had a decent enough plot, but trying to stay connected to it with all the possible suspects and misleading clues, not to mention the long and drawn out dialogue, was a pain, and I breathed a sigh of relief when I finally got to the seemingly endless end.  This was not a page turner for me, and I did not like it.

B0067QPVD2|1.0|John Carpenter's The Thing is, and will forever remain, an undisputed masterpiece in the horror genre. Now the thing to do is ask yourself what made it such a monumental film. It was an ultra suspenseful who-dunnit on par with Hitchcock for starters set in a claustrophobic research station house in Antarctica. To make matters worse an alien life form is discovered that absorbs and imitates all life forms on a cellular level in order to hide and spread. The trust factor is unbearably low and the stress level is unbearably high! The writing, directing, acting, cinematography were superior to most films since and mad props go out to Rob Bottin whose practical creature FX were both innovative and unique... and terrifying! Bottin's FX work was and remains light years ahead of its time even back in 1982. Digital FX are still trumped by what was accomplished in this film.  The first time I heard there was going to be a prequel I immediately asked, \\"why?\\" How in the world does some no-name first time director get a project like this to begin with and secondly making a prequel to a film that masterful is just a bad idea. Carpenter's film gave a very startling and unsettling glimpse into the aftermath of an outbreak of this... thing at the Norwegian encampment at the beginning of his film. It was ambiguous and downright disturbing and it should have been left at that. However, you know Hollywood can't resist a quick buck despite how flimsy the effort at earning it may be.  So here's the deal - I walked into this film with literally NO expectations and I got what I paid for. The director seems to have made a film if for no other reason than to explain why there was an axe in the door at the Norwegian encampment and why there was a man with his wrists and throat slit frozen in his chair. Answers that were far more satisfactory with each individual viewer providing for themselves based on what ensues in that original film. And do you know what the best part about this sequel isdespite the director's attempt to provide continuity between the films? He failed to do so and it still leaves me shaking my head.  Right off the bat the film loses momentum because we already could guess what happened at the Norwegian encampment from Carpenter's film. From the start it was like watching Anakin Skywalker become Darth Vader... there was really no point to it. Secondly, the acting in this film is as Hollywood and cookie cutter as it gets. The characters are one dimensional and the film races past any and all substance simply to show the monsters. Now the monsters in this film don't hold a candle to what Bottin accomplished in the original. Now what I mean by this is that the thing can be anything it needs to be to defend itself and escape when threatened or attacked. That made the moments of the original film, when you did see the creatures, so shocking and violent. The creatures in this film simply show themselves for the sake of showing themselves and aren't necessarily threatened at all when the seamless CGI morphing begins. In the originals bodies would convulse and erupt into grandiose sculptures of the macabre. Don't look for that in this film because you're not going to get it. So there's another factor of a good, suspenseful and frightening film removed.  Don't get me wrong, the first alien attack in this film was pretty cool despite that it broke the concept of the being needing to be alone and in close proximity with its host in order to digest and re-form. But that's all I can give it. This film, at best, is just another creature feature... but what could we really expect? And the film's finale was truly... painful to sit through because it's just so silly. I wasn't surprised when I saw the film, not in the least. The best thing about this film is that it made me want to go home and watch the Carpenter film which is far more satisfying!
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I bought my kindle fire mainly for reading and did not know I could have apps.  this one is very good and revolutionized my use of my kindle fire.  I have always been very schedule impaired but this program had me in the right places at the right time.  its really empowering.  I like the day week month agenda views, ability to use when off line for sync later, the ability to schedule future repeat meetings, the choice of alerts.  its well worth the price.  the only reason I don't give it a 5 star is there is no attached checklist function that I like to see in my organizer.

1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House is one of my favorite books of all time. It gives us a raw glimpse of life during the times of slavery. You will find yourself attached to many of the characters, each distinct and powerful in their own right. You will feel as though you are right there - picturing the opulent coldness of the Southern mansion vs. the plain, sparse quarters of the slaves which exude warmth, family and love. You will feel the love of Lavinia's adopted family just as she does. This book is filled with many should haves, could haves...you'll find yourself saying \\"oh, why didn't she just...\\". It is a sometimes disturbing account of the utterly unbelievable mistreatment of human beings during slavery, but throughout it, the strength of the love of a family shines through. You'll find yourself wishing you knew some of these people. I chose this for my book group and every member absolutely loved it. My only disappointment is that Kathleen Grissom doesn't have any other books out! I look forward to her next one.

I had to force myself to slow down, similar to a chocoholic deliberately NOT eating the most amazing chocolate bar in one sitting. The imagery of this book is magical, described by the author is such a way that the reader is a specator behind the scenes of the circus. Romance, adventure, fantasy, tragedy...this book combines it all for a delicious read!
1451627289|5.0|You know you've experienced a great book when you regret that you're coming to the end of the story.  I've said before that King showed us what he was still capable of when he released Under The Dome.  It was a return, I believe, from years of producing novels that mostly failed to measure up to his earliest accomplishments.  I've never expected him to repeat The Stand (his finest in my opinion) but I wanted another epic novel that pulls you in, grabs your attention and then keeps it from the first to the last page.  King has achieved that goal with this novel.  Who hasn't imagined how things might be different if we could go back in time and change the past. But King adds an interesting twist: imagine if you could go back in time and, in only minutes measured on today's clock, live an hour, a day, a year or an entire lifetime as you are now but starting more than 50 years ago?  And, if you could, what would be the consequences to your life, to the life of anyone you encountered or to life itself?  And while the Kennedy assassination is the ultimate destination on the journey, King offers the reader much more including a wonderful look at American life in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A simpler time, yes, but without all the modern conveniences and medical advances that we take for granted today.  And along the way he introduces us to some very memorable characters as well as a few that the ardent King fan will remember from other novels.  I hesitate to offer any more details for fear of spoiling the story.  So I'll just say that this is King's best effort in many, many years!
B005K0HDGE|1.0|This was the worst book that I have ever read!  I knew the ending a quarter into this slow moving book.

King used the word so many times that I got infuriated when I saw it wanted to slam my Kindle against the wall!

B001ARYYPY|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  I watch it at least one time every year much as with the Grapes of Wrath. Not at all alike but dam good storytelling.  PG&E does a lot of good for the Country. But sometimes with Companies and Governments  some group of idiots and Jerks will put profit above safty and could care less who is hurt. In some cases even famleys.  Who ever was in Charge of the pumping stations at PG&E should go to prison personaly. But like the Government the personel are sometimes  protected and the whole company pays. As it should.  I would love to see a simalar Movie about Al Gore and the MTBE contamination in the State of CA because of his Greed. All Gore tried to tell us all that MTB in the Gasoline would be a good thing even though UCB tested it and showed that it not only would not help but would harm the state. And it has and folks are being contmitated and there are deaths not unlike the PG&E case. It is not the oil companys fault like Barbara Boxer wanted to say and sue them for the contamination. The oil companys made it very clear and fought to keep this crap out of the fule we need. Al Gore MADE the State Add this stuff to the fule. And it is still in the fuel. Who Wins. Al Gore Does. Just like a few folks at PG&E. They could have used many many non toxic substances as anti oxidents in the pumping station cooling water. Just as al gore could have used something other than MTBE. A nasty substance made from Natural Gas. And guess what. Al's family owns or at the time owned stock on the plants that made the stuff.  He also at about the same time made the Federal government sell the Navy Oil Wells and resever oil to Ocidental petro;ium for a few cents on the $. You and I paid for these wells and Al gore is making $ on them.  This Movie helps remind me of all the kinds of things folks will do to others to make some $ and it is discuting. Give them some power and watch out. They will change into persons who lie and cheat.  Get the Movie. It is a true story. Just as is the Grapes of Wrath.  Jim

B000JQU4TW|5.0|I started out disliking this book: too much silliness, not enough serious message.  However, as time progressed, it turned out that the silliness (often shown in people's favorite quotes) is froth, and the body underneath is substantial: good, evil, innocence, and corruption.  Wilde is a sublime genius at meshing the two levels in one work.

B006C45CFG|4.0|The worst thing about this movie turned out to be the title.  When I first heard of it, I hated it.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of CGI, simply because 90% of it is cartoony and unconvicing to say the least.  This movie has its share, and some is decent, and the rest is baloony and exaggerated in terms of realism.  It seems as if they could get that right by now.  It's one reason why even though I have a 3-D capable 65\\" TV, there has never been anything, including Avatar that I wanted to watch on it, although Avatar has some decent effects, I can't stand the grunt-millitary babble.<br /><br />The story turned out to be far more interesting and complex than I expected and the character development was good, overall.  The little kid made no sense.  Why do they insert little kids for no good reason where they are totally out of place!<br /><br />It actually parallels one of the more interesting ancient alien theories, in terms of another civilization using the inhabitants of Earth to mine gold.  The actual theory involves humans reengineered in paleolithic times into their current form with the specific purpose of supplying an alien society.  They were taught at least, higher mathmatics and engineering, which enabled them to build the wonders of the ancient world.  Remember, human cranial capacity has tripled in far less time than evolution would usually account for, and there is no good explanation for that fact.  The theory continues that what was given was taken away, or that humans simply devolved after they left, over the period of about 2,000 years, sinking into a mire of religious dogma and warring over silly causes and greed...a pattern that continues.  Remember, this isn't my theory.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie deserves a better title, and would have been more appealing with a name that didn't call to mind some silly 1950s B-Grade Sci-Fi excuse for entertainment.  This was no Plan 9 From Outer Space, although it certainly wasn't Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, Contact or even Mars Attacks.  It was still a good, well-acted movie.<br /><br />Earlier, I rated Super 8, and gave it a bad review, ending with my trepidation over watching this.  What a pleasant surprise!was still a good, well-acted movie.  Earlier, I rated Super 8, and gave it a bad review, ending with my trepidation over watching this.  What a pleasant surprise!
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Defective disk.  Froze and stopped playing about 10 minutes in.  Then was able to play if I skipped past the bad spot, so about 15 minutes is unviewable.  Also had trouble with my BluRay player playing it at all.  It took like 8 tries to start and I have a fully updated firmware Samsung player.  I also read reviews how this release has so much copyright DRM protection that many players won't play it at all.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this cover! It is just as beautiful as it appeared online. I was worried, given others reviews that it didn't fit the kindle Fire, which is what I have, but it was a perfect fit! Snug, and protected. The cover closed all of the way, and the only \\"negative\\" comment that is true is the magnetic closure doesn't hold they cover closed, but I don't find it to be a problem. I will probably do as one user did, and spray paint it so that the city names stand out, but this is just due to personal taste.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Besides having one app to rule them all (integrated text and audio with features to include live content from your local church and more) this is the future of God's word!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|First off, this is a review of the movie, NOT the contents of this edition, partly because Amazon attaches the same review to all versions of the same movie that it offers (so this review will also show on the Instant option, etc. - not just the DVD), and partly because other reviewers have already stated the contents of this DVD set in any case.<br /><br />Like the prior HP movies, this one does have to cut quite a bit from the book, but I think they did an EXCELLENT job of selecting the plot items that most directly relate to the overall direction of the series. And in the series, Book 6 is when it all becomes clear just what a stunning series this is, IMHO. Things turn distinctly dark in book/movie 5, with an internal battle going on between those that believe Voldemort has returned and those that don't, but now in book/movie 6 it is all out war, and this movie reflects the dark, conflicted feelings this triggers in everyone. Coupled with the increasing complexities of adolescent life - romances and break-ups etc. - this movie is much more grown-up.<br /><br />I think the main things that need to be conveyed in this film are - Harry's conflicted feelings about being the 'chosen one', Dumbledore's ongoing quest to get to the bottom of what Voldemort is trying to do, and his acceptance that he must include Harry in this, the complexity of Snape's role, and the shifting of feelings amongst Hermione, Ron, Jenny and Harry. These are what drive the series, and they are all conveyed brilliantly, in a movie that never fails to entertain, even with its much darker visuals and tone. So although there's a fair amount of the book left out, what is essential is there, and that is what good book adaptation are all about.
B005DA63EY|5.0|I received the DVD in a prompt manner and the DVD was in good conditon as advertized. I would buy from this seller again.

B00542USJW|5.0|I must admit that this review (and the purchase) is almost entirely fueled by nostalgia, as I grew up loving this movie like everyone else my age who knows whats up. The blu ray looks great, in my opinion, and the film isn't as dated as I thought it would be. The jokes and characters are as good as ever and I will definitely be watching this one again and again. Like I said, perhaps not the greatest buy unless you are already a fan of the movie. The lack of special features is something that would normally cause me to not buy a blu ray, but for ten dollars this one was well-worth it!
B0044XV3R8|2.0|First off, reviews should be for the item NOT the seller.  That's what the resolution center is for.<br /><br />Second: yes, there are 3 movies here, but half is on ONE disk and half is on the 2nd disk!  NOT ONE MOVIE PER DISK!  That is why I got it.  To give a copy to family members w/children.  VERY disappointed.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|Even though I didn't find the basic premise interesting enough to see this one in theaters, I eventually gave it a shot. I am quite glad I finally watched it, because it ended up being one of the most unique and beautiful films I have ever seen. I never would have thought such a strange concept (a pre-teen assassin) could involve such human situations and that along with gorgeous cinematography and a fantastic Chemical Brothers score made this one my favorite film of 2011. The blu ray is also full of good features and has excellent video and audio quality. One of my must-haves of 2011, for sure!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Prior to purchasing this cover, I kept my Kindle it what is called a sleeve.  This cover not only protects the Kindle but it makes it look more like a book.  The cover makes the Kindle easier to access without making it viewable to all.  I love it!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I wasn't the biggest Ryan Gosling fan before I saw Drive, but this one really turned me. The dark and subtle performance Gosling delivers, paired with the fantastic direction and great soundtrack/score made this one of my favorite films of 2011. My pre-ordered blu ray is arriving tomorrow and I look forward to further reviewing the item.
B003UMW68O|5.0|I bought this Blu-Ray version as a gift for my wife. She had wanted this for a long time. This version didn't dissapoint her at all. Watching it in HD, it is just beautiful, with excellent sound. There's also extras included, but we haven't had time to watch them yet.
B003ELMR9E|4.0|I try not to write reviews on films themselves, as that has been done for just about every film again and again. I like to focus on whether or not the blu ray/dvd is actually worth it and this one definitely is. It looks and sounds great and it may not be Nolan's best (4th best, in my opinion, next to both Batman films and The Prestige) but the blu ray is packed with great special features and at less-than 10 dollars, it is a must-have for a Nolan fan (or a Pacino fan, as is performance is fantastic).
B0063IH60K|5.0|it.works great for kindle. fire.  I recommend. this to all.  card lovers its better then keeping up with all the cards
B0000DBJA7|5.0|After their nearly-perfect debut album IS THIS IT, the Strokes had to really come out swinging to make an impression with their follow-up. In my opinion, they couldn't have done it any better. While I, myself, find it to be equal with their first album, there are many who believe that it is even better than their first.<br />This vinyl version that I received from Amazon was rather bare-bones, but it was only 11 dollars which is a steal for a vinyl album of any kind, let alone one by such a great band. Sounds great.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The author's personal belief of the alleged facts of this historical and tragic event obviously influence the ending.  We can all pick and choose which experts and testimony to believe, none of which are overwhelmingly convincing.  As usual for King, the book is extremely well written and totally engaging.

B003TJR2HS|4.0|This is a great extender for my Bose speaker to my iPhone.  The only reason I gave it a four star is that you do have to be careful getting the phone seated onto the extender, it does wiggle a little.  I was thrilled to see that it not only allows the speaker to work, but it charges as well.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|not sure why all the bad reviews.. this game is really good for someone who gets sick of games fast. there are a bunch of different games and the fact that you have to unlock them is what makes it more fun.. some of the games get frustrating but its good to have a challange everyonce in a while. I highly recommend this game it is a great time killer.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Being the owner of a few Apple products, one can now better understand the person behind it. A fascinating story of a man obsessed with perfection and the desire to provide cutting edge technology. In the same breath a man who would drive his people rentlessely to achieve what seemed at that time to be his own objectives and ambition. A good read and thought provoking. A lot to learn both good and bad.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I LOVED the 4th installment of the Underworld Series.  It was non-stop action and kept me completely engaged the whole time.<br /><br />There was a \\"cleansing\\" where the government killed all the Vampires and Lycans.  Of course, they never did get them all.  Now it appears that the Lycans have been holding up somewhere and reproducing (yuk--there's a mental picture that will burn your eyes right out of their sockets).  This time, a 12-year old girl shows up on the scene, and Selene just cannot let her get thrown to the wolves, so to speak.  Everybody wants the little girl, but don't let anybody fool you.  This is no \\"let's play doll house\\" kid!<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale does a wonderful job and is in her prime fighting the remaining Lycans.  There is lots of action, chasing, blood and guts, heads lopping off, etc.  Selene is tough and MEAN!  This was thoroughly enjoyable.  Although I usually do not watch bloody stuff like this, I am hooked on Underworld and will definitely buy the DVD when it becomes available.
030788743X|5.0|Get ready to get your geek on. Well, technically I should say, get ready to get your 80's geek on. I will preface my review with you must be nerd to read this book, or at least willing to embrace your inner nerd.  Additionally, a love or deep appreciation for the 80's is required. If you are not nerd, you will likely loose interest as the entire book is drenched in all things gaming, tech, and 1980's pop culture. That said, this book is an epic ride through a virtual world with a not so average hero as your guide.<br /><br />Wade Watts lives in a trailer park with his aunt, who sees Wade as more of a food stamp source than an actual family member. His unfortunate life situation drives him to spend most of his time inside the OASIS, a virtual world, that's best described as a combination of a virtual reality video game and the internet. Inside the OASIS, a user can play video games, hang out in a virtual chat room, and even attend school. One of the many things driving people to spend time in the virtual world is the OASIS wide `Easter egg' hunt set up by James Halliday, the creator of the OASIS. Halliday set up the ultimate video game that calls back to all of his favorite 80's video game, movies, and music, and the winner will receive his entire fortune.<br /><br />Wade, also known as Wade3 and Parzival in the OASIS, is one of a millions of people hunting the for Copper Key to unlock the first of three gates in Halliday's game. That is, he was one of the millions until he found the Copper Key.<br /><br />Ready Player One has been categorized in the Young Adult genre, however, I kind of feel like this book would go over the heads of most young adults these days. I mean no offense to them in the slightest. I'm in my late twenties and I didn't get many of the things referenced in this book, so I would imagine a teenager might miss a context. That is, unless they have an unhealthy obsession with the 80's. I feel more adults would enjoy this book than teenagers. In fact, I think it's already extremely popular among the 30-40 somethings. That said, the author does a pretty thorough job of explaining the many 80's facts dropped in this story, so it's not too difficult to keep up.<br /><br />Referencing everything from Billy Idol to Rush, anime to School House Rock, Atari to the Apple 1, and 16 Candles to Monty Python's The Holy Grail, Cline crams it all in. There were so many 80's facts that I began to I feel like I was prepping to be on an 80's edition of  Jeopardy.  I know more about the 80's than I ever cared to know. And I have to admit it feels kinda good.  To give you a little taste, Ernie Cline posted his personal soundtrack/mix-tape for Ready Player One on his blog.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Ready Player One. I can truly say that I haven't read or heard of anything like it before.  It's original, clever, witty, and engaging. It's a trip through 80's nostalgia and it's tons of fun.  I highly recommend this book to nerds, 80's fans, and anyone looking for something completely different.ly popular among the 30-40 somethings.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|If you are looking for every Potter movie on Blu Ray and nothing more this is for you.  The packaging is adequate and the movies play beautifully.  There are no frills or special features.  For about $10 a movie one should not expect any either.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I just got the Blu-ray version and watch it in HD with my wife using my PS3 and my stereo. Well worth it the whole time! Adele got emotion at the end. Lot of fun conversation and not boring at all. Be aware of mature language however and not for younger children at time.

0307959856|1.0|As a long time P.D James fan AND a Jane Austen enthusiast, I was so excited when this new book was announced. What a bitter disappointment! It was dull, repetitive of basic Austen plot facts, and really.....it was BORING. I hope this author sticks to what she knows best.
0439023521|1.0|As a suspense writer, I'm used to gory, graphic detail, horrific scenes and depictions of evil with which some readers might not feel comfortable. But when I began reading the Hunger Games, maybe my role in life as a mother came to the forefront. I would never want my children or grandchildren to read this book. Yet my children gave it to me as a present, and say they loved it. Such desperation and despair, such horrifying choices and brutal solutions are not what I would want any child to absorb, even by reading fiction. Possibly this is a compliment to the writer, that the story was so vividly real to me that I was unable to finish it.
