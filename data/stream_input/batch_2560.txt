B00CX1TPF0|1.0|Do not pay for the HD version. It is awful! Throughout the whole movie, it stalls and waits for minutes before beginning again.<br />Then it jumps slightly ahead. It does this every few minutes, not just once or twice. Ruined the entire movie.
B00004YA66|5.0|I like both Jim Caviezel and  Dennis Quaid. The connection between father and son was a great relationship.  When I hear about the Northern Lights I think about this movie.
B009EDZ5RW|5.0|I liked it and this is my review. Why do we need to add a review just to rate them by stars ? Waste of time for me.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man is another action  packed novel.  Flynn's knowledge of covert affairs definitely adds to the plot. Kept my interest unitl the end.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|All the Cut the Rope games are cute and offer a great level of challenge for players of all age, but it's Pudding Monsters that I love.  The puzzles are simple, great for small children and at times for logic-challenged adults.  There is no time so there's no pressure to finish the puzzle.  Great to show kids to try multiple times to get different results.  Love it and you will too.<br /><br />Can't wait to see what Zepto Labs will up come with next.
B00D7NWTSI|1.0|The first Iron Man movie was a pleasant surprise to me, most of the movie tried to be realistic in the context of the kind of superhero that Iron Man is, this is something that i guess we all owe to the last Batman trilogy. Unfortunately this third Iron Man movie broke with that new standard and depicts situations on which i was like \\"no way, that's silly!\\".<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT, where can I start? Let's be realistic, the superpowers that Killian and his sidekicks develop from just an injection are plain ridiculous (FIREBREATHING? REALLY???), COMMON!! they could have come with something smarter than that! Now the whole smart-suit-parts-that-seek-for-Tony thing is also over the roof. I also hated that in order to try to give a spectacular twist to the movie they wasted Ben Kingsley's \\"Mandarin\\" character, he could have been a super sinister Joker-like villain... sometimes simpler is better, I am actually surprised that such an excellent actor as Kingsley agreed to that degrading roll. How about a deeper development of Iron Patriot's character with interaction between him and Iron Man? maybe some conflict between them, that could have worked. And, what happened with the Iron Man suit's strength? it seemed like Tony Stark in a move to cut costs outsourced the manufacturing of the armour to China, as easy as the armour was destroyed in several parts of the movie even me myself could have defeated Iron Man just with a can opener. It is also unfortunate that the suits are already autonomous and do not need an actual human inside of them, with this what's the point on Tony Stark risking his life inside an armour? he could retire to Bali and control his suit army from a beach bench with a pina colada in one hand, they took away the human component to Iron Man and that breaks with the essence of Iron Man.<br /><br />Beneath the good things were the great special effects and of course Robert Downey's excellent Tony Stark characterization. Unfortunately since the first Iron Man movie was such a good movie the studio knows that we are going to see the new ones no matter if the plot is garbage.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game the best game ever I haven't got PC version yet hoping too. I showed it to my friend he loves it. Survival craft is cool too.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|I have to be honest and say that other than the names of the characters there wasn't much resemblance to the book at all. I realize that there has to be a certain &#34;movie freedom or artistic license&#34; involved but Mr. Tolkien must be turning over in his grave. Characters and sub-plots introduced just to &#34;flesh out&#34; the material as a trilogy, you gotta' be kidding! Another point was the humor, in the first three movies the humor was quite well done, the humor in &#34;The Hobbit&#34; is so off base it's almost criminal. Just awful. I was quite disappointed overall, the only thing about the movie that was well done was the &#34;filming&#34; itself. I'd heard nothing but bad about  filming &#34;The Hobbit&#34; in 48 fps... it was just a crisp and clean movie to watch, it was just too bad that the movie itself could not live up to the transfer itself!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! Pinterest at my fingers tips. Easy to find everything and easy to use. Recommend to everyone that enjoys crafting.
B001MM28JG|5.0|&#34;Galaxy Quest&#34; is just a fun Movie to watch! You can tell that the actors were just having a great time filming it. The transfer and audio was excellent and the extras were  quite well done also.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This was my first purchase with Amazon coins.  I am learning a lot about Amazon, and the many features attached.  I have already put the calendar to good use.  Thanks.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Best tracks: My God Is The Sun, I Appear Missing, I Sat By The Ocean, and If I Had A Tail. Read more at our blog: http://graveoutbreak.blogspot.com/2013/06/queens-of-stone-age-like-clockwork-2013.html
B0090KZDSK|5.0|What a great read, but so so sad I have to wait another unexpected few months for the epic finale which I though was \\"entwined with you\\" but on the other hand. Seriously exited that there's more to the story. Can't wait. Big thumbs up to Sylvia for not giving everything away and keeping her readers intrigued.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I would love this but i havw had alot of problems with t not working and some days not going off in the morning so although i like it, i cant rely on it to wake me, i alwaus need another alarm as back up
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app tells u what the weather is going 2 be and it is usually right. It is just like the weather channel on tv or the weather o  the computer it tells u what u need to know.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I think this games is amazing..makes you think its simple but fun and lo e tge graphics, best of all its free too! The advets are not intrusive to the game so i really am impressed by this game
B0086700CM|4.0|You have lots of fun with this app. You run away from a giant gorilla and u have to dodge  a lot of things collect coins but be careful you don't wanna die get the highest score have fun!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Lobe this app, its great to download and playback later and forusic usefull so ill download a video or song and use it as my ala clock in the morning. Its really easy to use
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely addictive game. The updates are later than on my iphone but I still love this game. My three year old princess loves the game just as much. I'd like to see a New Orleans version with streetcars.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I like this app not only for the weathet but to tell me the time in various countries too, as it will tell me the current time and temperature in sydney and the uk etc so makes scrolling across to view each place easy easyand each place has its own page
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Wonderful awesome Rod Stewart is wonderful to listen to, whether it be singing and being interviewed.<br />So far my cousin has collected his records both of us his cd's etc<br />Shipping was fast.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|I watched the whole thing, don't get me wrong. It will keep your attention yet it was sort of unfinished, could have had more development etc Something is missing when you done watching it. Rent it.
B006FTCH2E|3.0|Aside from getting a lot of astrophysics wrong (size of the guy's telescope and when the planet was first noticed for examples) the movie seemed disjointed, fragmentary. If its purpose was to raise questions about life, or relationships, or reality, the questions were only suggested, not asked. And certainly not discussed. Might be a good movie to stimulate discussion in a college-level communications class. For all that, I had been curious about the movie for some time, it kept my attention to the end, and I enjoyed it.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I still think David Tennent is my favorite and best Doc Who, but Matt Smith picks up and keep the series going!
B002KLOPF8|5.0|Loved this movie! If you're looking for a great war movie, then this is it. Classic. Kubrick knew what he was doing when he made this movie.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Great character development!  Absorbing story line!  Locke and Jean form a series enduring bond of friendship that weathers all sorts of mayhem!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I LOVE Diner Dash. This is a fun installment of the franchise. Eventually you have to pay for the extra levels but that's with most apps. But it you loved Diner Dash like me, you will not be disappointed.
1401937519|5.0|I read this book in one day, just couldn't put it down. Well written, paints a beautiful background picture. Inspiring.
B004TI5N38|2.0|Since I am a real Army CID Special Agent, I have to suspend disbelief when reading Lee Child's \\"Reacher\\" series. David Baldacci makes a bit more effort to include accurate details about this Reacher clone's CID activities, but those he gets right are few and far between. But hey, if a novel is well-written and entertaining, I can get past the inaccuracies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as many other reviewers have opined, John Puller is a slightly more refined version of Jack Reacher. It's clearly a case of criminal impersonation. The plot of \\"Zero Day\\" is implausible, the cast of characters are two-dimensional, and the ending was as thrilling as watching most Seattle Mariners baseball games...in other words, ho-hum and predictable.
B00B2166BS|4.0|The Nexus 10 pogo cable is a great upgrade for a charging cable. I have noticed a decrease in time required to charge the tablet. Given that it has quite a large battery inside (9,000 mAh), it will take quite a while to reach a full charge, regardless. Using this cable, it seemingly takes about an hour, or so, less time to charge.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Plugs in easily with the magnets.<br />Works even without taking it out of the leather case.<br />Charges faster vs stock cable.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Cord could be about a foot longer.<br />Price - $20 for a cable? Price we pay for very little suppliers competing.
B00992CF6W|1.0|all my friends have the new update but me with the kindle fire. But other than that minecraft is fun and addicting.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This text is deep and brings your soul into communication with Tolle's. It has aided me in my continued search for meaning and purpose for my life. It is difficult to discuss with just anyone, as they have to be &#34;ready&#34; to receive the message. It is spiritual but not dogmatic. It lends itself to several re-readings. Excellent!
B000SL1TKQ|4.0|LOVE the movie Starman with Jeff Bridges. However, I screwed up and bought Region 2 version that does not play on my USA device!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I've had this book a while but only since early news of book two coming out. So I waited to read it until I had both to read. I finished this in two days despite my 5 kids running around.<br />I was filled with different emotions while reading and even forgetting reality at times taking these emotions out on my husband as if he were Travis.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Overall the show is pretty good. Some funny parts and a few of the characters will surprise you. The only gripe I have is that a lot of the &#34;side story&#34; is very boring simply because it's been done over and over again.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|My grandson introduced me to this movie. I love, love, love, it.  But I love the Batman shark movie. So maybe you cannot go by my review on this one. Sandy
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Le Carre's insight into today's geo-politics is illuminating and should be a cautionary tale for all of us. Through a skillfully woven plot and fascinating characters, we learn about the power that British and American governments have ceded to private interests and contractors.<br /><br />The writer has at least five characters, all different and charismatic, who want to do the right thing for their country and their consciences. I hated to see the book end, and will continue to imagine the next step in their lives.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. LeCarre, for warning us about the greed and lust for power that will have dangerous consequences, unless someone like the book's Toby, Kit, or Jed characters will say, &#34;enough&#34;.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Waited too long for this book but I must say did not disappoint and definitely my favourite one so far. I love Gideon and Eva they are perfect for each other and I totally get lost in their story. I can not wait till book nr 4 & 5 comes out
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It has all the basic functions. I even like that on longer calculations, it shows the last sequence in a shadow type so you don't forget how you got the most recent number. And it's free of course!
B002436WFI|4.0|I remember seeing this a while back and decided to buy and rewatch it.  Despite being a bit cheesy with some out-dated CGI in areas... the movies storyline is very cool and is a fun watch for anyone who likes comedy.  Has many big named stars, and is set in a fun and interesting world.
B0079LJZG8|5.0|If you require thrills, kills, gadgets and a romance to keep your attention, stay away.  If you like movies so clandestine that the message and motives stay oblique until the 3rd or 4th time you watch it, you will love TTSS.  This is LeCarre's Cold War masterpiece put to film in a faithful adaption, even if not all the details from the book are included.  Oldman is nothing less than outstanding while Firth and Hurt are intriguing.  This is not a movie for kids and I am not sure you can fully appreciate it without reading the book, but if you like movies that require you to think and pick up on subtle clues, TTSS is one of a kind.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is so much better than the movie! Great for pre teens and older! I can't wait to continue the series!
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|You might be confused with my ratings, but that is for a reason. This product is more expensive on here, then at a local store. The figure is good. If you have the dark knight rises movie masters it has the same articulation, which is great. Just don't buy on Amazon unless they change the price. Usual is 15.99 UPDATED price is correct now, but does need change for other figures
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It's essentially TF2 for your tablet and lots of fun. So if you like team fortress you're probably gonna love this too.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|this game started off so much fun and I had every thing unlocked and then it reset my game in the middle of a round back to level. I know campletly dislike this game.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I have no problem with using this cord and I think it's amazing how something so small to do such big thing with.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Highly recommended, though not quite up to LOTR standards (which are vey high IMO).  So far, not too fond of the steps taken to stretch this short book into three feature-length films, but still way better than the average movie fare...
B000001ES4|5.0|This music is so peaceful and  it just opens my heart to good things..thanks My husband and I put this on every night to fall asleep to...also the Dream Catcher is in my car and my grand daughter loves it and she is 7 ...after a rough day at school.

193700788X|3.0|This book was a Swan Song for the long running Sookie Stackhouse series.  I wasn't sure what to expect going into this book.  I have deliberately avoided reading other people's thoughts so that I could enjoy this with no preconceived notions going in.  Yes, I am well aware of the irony that I'm writing up a review of my thoughts and impressions for others when I wouldn't read other reviews first. Haha!  And with that statement,  I am left with some reservations about exactly what i wish to put into a review so I don't destroy someone else's reading experience.<br /><br />First and foremost for those of you who have been living under a rock or are late to the PNR/UF genres, do not read this series out of order and definitely stop here if you are not caught up on the series.  These have to be read in order.<br /><br />Secondly, my summary is going to be shorter and admittedly rather vague for your protection against spoilers as will be my comments.  Some of you are wondering if that is possible for me?  We shall see.<br /><br />This story picks up right after the big blow up with the fae conspiracy and the show down for the wolves out on Alcide's property.  Well it picks up after a prologue that reveals that there is trouble stirring on the horizon for Sookie as two different groups of enemies are plotting to take her out for their own revealed and unrevealed reasons.<br />Sookie has saved Sam's life by using the Cluvial Dor wish and this has ramifications aplenty in her personal life and from a new enemy who as arisen for her (like she needs one more of those, right?).  Sookie is shocked by the change in Sam after his death to life experience, but accepts that he needs some time to wrap his mind around it all.  Sookie needs some time too after learning what she did about her fae relations and Eric so she waits.<br />But soon she is pulled out of her depression when an old enemy surfaces, dies, and Sookie gets pinned for the murder.  Lots of familiar old faces start turning up after that and things start moving.<br /><br />Now as to my impressions.  Early on, the tone of this book struck me as passive and mellow. I was okay with that at first because it makes sense that there might be a sense of let down and exhaustion after everything that happened at the end of the last book.  The trouble is that the distant feeling and the passiveness continued for me.  The story never got crisp and tight.  I never felt connected with Sookie's emotions.  She was like the eye of storm.<br />I'm going to put this out there at least.  Even beyond the tone of the story, the plot (aka Sookie's choices) is never going to make everyone happy.  I am not one of the ones disappointed by that so much as by the fact that I just wanted it to be more challenging, raw and intense like other books in the series.  I didn't hate the gentle meandering through Sookie's little Southern rural happenings and friends, but I've been spoiled by having that along with the mysterious happenings and the life and death action through the other books.  Gotta say that one of the enemies in this one was a big shocker and I didn't see that coming.  The fact that this is a final book finished with me feeling like things were still left unfinished in some ways.<br /><br />That is my take (or what I'm willing to say without spoilers) on the final story.  Fans of the series should definitely read this final edition.  It will have a bittersweet feel maybe even frustrating at times.  I will miss the Sookie Stackhouse world and will probably end up re-reading the series at some point.urning up after that and things start moving.<br /><br />Now as to my impressions.

B009A87X80|5.0|very good CD. shows the range and depth of her talent!!! sky was the limit for her.I will regret not being able to see her live.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you need something to keep your wife busy and out of your way purchase this now.  My problem with it and the original shows are that they are not in true digitally surround sound and you can't fine tune the center channel to increase the dialogue.  I have difficulty normally with television dialogue but this show is especially difficult due to the accents no matter how often i watch it and sometime have to give in and use captions.  Beware, however, extremely addictive leaving one in withdrawal awaiting the next season.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Where is the update on the kindle fire 0&middot;7&middot;0 ? I would really like to know! Please help me thank you!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Seems listless at times and too predictable which of course is expected from historical novels.  Slow reading for me.  Much preferred his Pillars series and the suspense and brutally realistic situations of earlier works such as Eye of the Needle.  I have read all his books and will I am sure read the third installment of this saga as well.
B00992CF6W|4.0|When is the update gonna come out CAUSE my cousin has it and has it and he has an iPod
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|A wonderful first leg of his journey! I am really looking forward to the next 2 movies in the Hobbit trilogy!
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Looked to be a promising program but the only pdf file it will list and read is its' own \\"Getting Started\\" file, which is brief and not very helpful.  The program's folder view did not help me find any of my many pdf files though I clicked on every possible folder and file.  Too much time wasted on trying to get this app to work.  Guess I'll be going back to Kindle's native pdf reader.
B004GYY714|4.0|enjoy listening to different things at different times at different times of the day and night and being on a mobile devices just adds to the enjoyment.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good little sim city game, immersive and well thought out.  Really enjoying playing so far.  Graphics are nicely done and you receive a feeling that what you do with the options matters.

B009JZWO3I|5.0|I loved it. Sad to see the season end but looking forward to next season. As far as amazon the picture quality was good and I had no problems with the amazon video player.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I get very frustrated with this game, but my son and my 5 year old grandson seem to enjoy it.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I am a true fan of Jeffery Archer, and was totaly surprised that his latest book did not complete the Clifton Chronicles. A real Cliff Hanger as this book ended. This must mean we can look forward to a 4th in this series? I do hope so.<br />I have read almost every book written by the author.
0553801473|4.0|I didn't think this book was a great as the others in the series but it was still worth the money that I paid for it. Can't wait for the next book to come out and you really can't skip a book in the series if you want the next one to make sense.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love this book, and the second one too!  Now Deborah needs to come out with the third. It is long past time!!!  Wonderful read.  The characters are fabulous and I have been anxiously awaiting the third book since I first read the other two a year ago.  I definitely recommend this series to anyone who likes science, witches, history, vampires or just an entertaining read that draws you in and entices your imagination.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Author has a sense of humor, excellent format and the material is easy to read and understand. The &#34;I Am&#34; movie reference was on target because of the material showcased in the movie script i.e., Heartmath.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|first science fiction I loved.<br />Believable.<br />Could relate to the characters.<br />Wanted more and more of the story.<br />Glad I was able to buy more.

B00CVCG87O|5.0|Being that TesseracT as gone through 2 singers since their last full album, this album is super awesome from back to front.  I really liked when Elliot was in the band, but Ashe does an awesome job.  If you liked the first album or the EP, you will love this one.  Musically its a little less heavy than One, but not any less great.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Intricate plot that keeps you guessing. Corruption abounds in police, in politics, and on Wall Street. Exciting plot line. Walberg and Jones are great!
B002S45V32|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD MOVIES. I WATCH IT ALL THE TIME. I WANT HER CAR IN Pretty Pearly pink

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|That was intense.....I.can't wait for the next book.<br />Gideon and Eva THAT IS ONE mind blowing story.  Loved it!!!!<br />More please.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|I waited to receive the physical album instead of downloading it from Amazon's \\"cloud\\" when I preordered this album.  There's something about holding a new CD, cracking open the seal...  The artwork for ...Like Clockwork is less than I expected.  The image that has been splattered everywhere--Facebook, QotSA's website, Amazon, iTunes--is what you get.  A few credit lines, no lyrics, nothing special.  Maybe I'm too old-fashioned, maybe my expectations were raised when another of my favorite bands put out their last CD and the artwork was so unique (Tool's last submission in 2006, 10,000 Days).  I dunno.<br /><br />In the meantime, I read the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere and expected to be blown away.  So far an average of 4.5 stars?  Someone claiming it's the greatest album of the century (at least so far, I imagine).<br /><br />I'm on the 5th or 6th listen-through, and there is no doubt it's a great album.  Different from their previous work, of which I've been a fan since Songs for the Deaf.  But there's no real stand-outs.  Other reviewers have called this characteristic \\"consistency.\\"  I got struck by an odd metaphor; if much of their previous music is like taking shots, this is a smooth vodka cocktail.  Both will do the job but the experience is different.  I rather like this album, but I understand the inevitably of 2-star reviews.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|A great classic then, and now.  Action packed with turns, twists, suspense and humor.  Everyone should see this landmark film.
0345803485|2.0|The girl in this book, Ana, repeatedly poops and farts in her pants.  This happens on nearly every other page.  It was arousing until about half way through the book, then I started to get bored.  As this time the male character started pooping a lot, and it was good for about 20 pages.  Once your stupid erejection... Wait, is that word spelled right?... Erejection... Okay yeah it's spelled right.  Wait, spelt .... Spelt?  Should you use the word \\"spelt\\" when you've spelled something?  Or should you use the word \\"spelled\\" when you've spelt something?  Ugh... I think I just crapped my pants....
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you have some time on your hands, and I seam to find lots of time lately, you will have fun with this game. It's a free app so go for it. I stay connected with family in England and chat with lots of nice people
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I strongly suggest reading this book. It is very suspenseful and makes you want to keep reading. I am currently planning on buying the third book because i finished the first and second books within a matter of days.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|This has always been one of my all time favorite musicals.  You can't beat Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and<br />Debbie Reynolds. There is lots of singing and dancing.  Leaves you with a big smile on your face.

B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|If you pay attention to the movie you will be thoroughly entertained.  If you can't stay focused, it's a waste of time.  Fantastic cinematography.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|this really should be a movie classic.  Jeff Bridges is so funny in this movie.  can watch it anytime I want to!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fast paced and many levels, with the opportunity to reach 3 stars before proceeding or take a 1 star, move on then go back. Another winner from iTreeGamer.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl has gone through a lot of sh...tuff. This book takes you on her emotional journey, making the hardships and victories she goes through in her life and on the trail almost too real. She writes with so much honesty and conviction that it is a hard book to put down. She takes the simplest encounters and events and turns them into something you actually want to read. I would highly recommend the book for anyone, especially young women searching for purpose and amateur outdoor enthusiasts.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I love this season of criminal mind is amazing I love the finally was one of the best I had seen recently the only thing will make it even better will be if the bring emely back
B004AYCWY4|5.0|This book, together with Christopher Hitchens'  Portable Atheist, should be mandatory reading for believers of all religions.<br /><br />&#34;We may all have come into existence five minutes ago, provided with ready-made memories, with holes in our socks and hair that needed cutting.&#34;  (Bertrand Russell)  Quite so Mr Russell!<br /><br />Richard Dawkins gives us an elegantly written, and comprehensive account of evolution. AND, why it works. 'The Greatest Show on Earth' is packed with wonder, and is an awe-inspiring contribution to man's understanding of natural science
B0026OE2NY|5.0|This film i find very interesting and beautiful. It shows the state of our planet and why we ALL need to due more for it.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Love Rod Stewart...this CD more than met my expectations.  Great variety of music makes it easy listening for all ages.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Could not put it down.  Balsamic has created another riveting thriller.  Cannot wait to start on the next book.  You can actually picture this happening.
B009LFVV6M|5.0|I received it way earlier than expected it got here just in time for my girlfriends birthday and she absolutely loves it . It's a great little set for notebook fans would definitely recommend it but I will warn all the boyfriends and husbands be prepared for the hundreds of times you will be forced to watch it ha :)
0061245097|4.0|I was very happy with the way Jeaniene Frost continued the story of Cat. Although we fast forward 4 years, it is a fitting jump ahead to see where she is and how she's dealt with the life she chose in Halfway to the Grave.
B009AMANBA|1.0|Got this movie because of all the hype.  And that was all it was.  Personally thought it was a terrible movie and can tell you now to save you money
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|i am really disappointed that this previously announced trilogy has been turned into a 5 book series &  can see I'm not the only one, there was so many sex scenes in this book that soon they all started to blend together, now don't get me wrong i'm all for hot steamy sex just feel between the 3books that some of it could have been cut out in order to keep to the original 3 books, i love eva & gideon but i'm undecided as to whether to continue with the series as at almost $12 a book its not cheap, the book itself was ok but my disappointment at the end of the book has overshadowed, this seems to be happening more & more with authors turning their books into trilogies, whatever happened to buying a book, enjoying it & the book coming to its conclusion
B000SGSU58|5.0|It's pricey  but can't find it anywhere (anymore) in my hometown where I was able to buy it, I'll continue to purchase it here.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awesome. Minecraft pe has zombies,creepers,spiders,and skeletons. I have the update 0.6.1. The update has clouds and signs and armour.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I decided to read this book on account that there may be something special about it since they decided to spend millions on hiring fabulous actors to play the parts... I enjoyed it, much more so than the movie, which I know is a common occurrence. I thought the movie was great and quirky but the book was much more moving. I recommend!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app did every thing it said it could do. Mostly it helped me when my power was low and how much more time I could play bloons tower defense 5. Thank you for this app .
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Bought these for my niece as a birthday gift & she is gonna love it! I can't wait, great price for all movies!
B00992CF6W|5.0|really awesome game.my whole family loves it.do what ever you what in it.you can even kill yourself.what it needs is a update. Have been wanting for a long time and looking if it would update.it only cam out to Apple things.I would say get it.
B0026127Y8|5.0|One of the best action thrillers available. A must see movie, that could not be bested by its sequel. Top notch acting by all parties involved.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The book kept my interest and I did not want to put it down. Just breaks my heart that children had to suffer like this...
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Good acting, storyline, plot and twists.  I hate writing reviews and wish Amazon would let me just say I loved the movie and its worth the time and money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a pretty cool little game I  recommend for all ages. Not challenging but challenging enough to keep your interest .almost like I have a real horse.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This game sucks you have to have Wi-Fi on to play it which sucks when you want your kid to play the game on the road or in the car
B0000C9JCM|4.0|Pachelbel's greatest hit. If you don't mind listening to the same tune in an endless loop, you'll enjoy this CD. 15 different renditions, some in the classical mode and some vocals. I must admit I was drawn to this firstly by the CD cover art by Mutts illustrator Patrick McDonnell. I liked Pachelbel's Canon in D, but only so many times.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I am so glad i was able to purchase this great app here online for a cheap price. I will definitely be keeping it in my collection.
B004UQ1G0I|1.0|One thing is certain, this guy can play and play very well.  Whoever decided what would be on this CD should find a new job.  The selections are great for budding pianists to improve their technique, but not for listeners.  Up and down the scales we go, over and over again.  What a waste.  Not everything Chopin wrote is worth listening to.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book off of a recommendation from one of my patients and I'm very glad I decided to pick it up. This story had me hooked. I just had to keep reading it and find out all of Jacobs secrets. Excellent writing style kept me entertained and engaged. well done.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not usually my type of book but it was interesting all the way through.  First person, past tense told from two main protagonists--good choice channeling the wife's voice through her dairy. I didn't guess that it would end the way it did but I was satisfied with the ending. My first by author and looking forward to the next. 4.5 stars
B009NY43NY|5.0|I read it as slowly as possible, I'm going to miss the books so much!  Wish the series would go on forever!
0811875555|5.0|It was in great, tip-top condition upon arrival, everything I had asked and paid for!  Definitely a worthy purchase for me.
B00AWJYJVA|2.0|Having been an avid Le Carre fan for many years, and having read all his books, it is a shame to see the great man produce such a shallow and confusing work. It is a simple book in many ways, and it clearly has a message about state power and the delgation of authority to unelected players. But this is just not the standard that Le Carre set in his early work and it is a shame to see a once-great author slide towards the twighlight of his career. If further books are contemplated, I do hope he abandons his aim to be contemporary and returns to the characters we came to love so much.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Was exactly as ordered, no hidden flaws or any such things.  Was a very simple and trustworthy product for certain.
B004V6U7F2|5.0|Pretty good music and sound track. It's what I was looking for I play it when I'm taking a shower.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I bought all four seasons because i couldnt work out when they were being shown on  Foxtel.  i really enjoy each session and i have watched many of them over and over.
B0035TMUTM|4.0|Hmm... I like enigma and this CD has some of the songs special the first one on a techno version and it's not what I wanted... so make sure to listen to the entire CD before you purchase
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great  game it's very unique and great gameplay um and my favorite class in th his game is the blades I think easy and fun  to play
B002N1AEN2|5.0|XX is not the usual disc of an emerging band. Xx is a fantastic music experience, is a mental journey is pure energy that invades your soul! This disc has changed my point of view about \\"listening and seeing \\" music!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Good and useful app. Shows what you need to see and gives useful estimates for how long your will last.
B000OCXIDK|2.0|I did not like this book. I found it boring. I did not like it when she was given the pearl erring at the end.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I think that epic the game is a vary good game that teaches kids to tame care of their enviornment. It teaches them to take care of the places that they live in.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|I bought The DVD earlier and wanted to take advantage of my new HDTV with the Blu-ray edition.<br /><br />If you like the Marvel characters, you need to see them in Blu-ray and HD
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love being able to share ideas, recipes and so many things with others and see what they are interested in and what we have in common. Love having my favorite things all in one place. I love it!
0375507256|4.0|2 reasons to read: Entertaining stories (and they have just a thread connecting them throughout &#34;time&#34;....) and the author's astounding ability to write in different styles and create &#34;language&#34; from culture.  The first-person accounts combined with an immersion in the languages makes the reader immediately engaged in the lives of the characters. Nice philosophical questions about slavery, cycle, and selfishness.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book was Kick Ass!  Nalini Singh is a genius. I won't spoil it, but who expected Ghost to be who he is?  I loved it. It had everything - political thriller, psychological thriller, military suspense, and of course the paranormal romance.  I hope it's not the end of the series.
B00632HWOG|5.0|The set up is really nice and easy on the eyes. I love be able to go directly to my emails its so much simpler to use.
1452113432|5.0|Beautiful to look at, simple recipes, divine, the book is worth every penny! I recommend it to everyone! Rachel has the magic touch and makes French cooking affordable and doable!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of match three games, but the odd combination of the match three interface with dungeon crawling, the great visuals and music, and the RPG elements of buffing your character to keep up with the ever-increasing challenges of the dungeon makes this hard to put down game my favorite of the mobile games I've ever played.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|A much lesser The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien (ok, TTTC was real and gripping, so it's not a terribly fair comparison). The middle bogged down for me when he tried to provide a scientific basis for the plague but dodged it anyway. And yes, as others have noted, there are too few stories from women.<br /><br />Walking Dead is far superior for the genre.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Lots of suspense funny<br />If you don't like long books you better change your mind!!!!!!!!<br />can't wait to read the next book
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game. Has an easy touch, you don't have to fight it like some other games. Real good for a freebie!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love this show. It is an attention grabbing, exciting, and hilarious show. Whether you are a fan of the original series or just starting out, it is a must see series.

B001M1ETTO|5.0|I first came upon the Art of Noise at a party many years ago. It was an impressive party in no small part due to the good selection of music and an interesting and eclectic environment and conversation primed by the ambient electronic dubbing genius of the Art of Noise. The parties are long gone but the genius is not, the thoughtful sounds of the Art of Noise is like going to an art gallery for your aural senses.
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|Best tv show ever . The cast the story was so good . Thank u for great ride. Wow can't say enough
B00AB7HESI|4.0|On level 12-9 it literally would not let me complete the level. I made sure I was solving it right but to no avail. I payed 99 cents for the extra levels and not being able to compete it is frustrating.
B002CVQAX6|5.0|Good story. Good twist. Good time.  I had seen it on cable and decided to add it to my collection.
B000SEVVLK|3.0|The story was a drag. However I could see it as a movie and TV serial that could be more interesting .<br />However in all fairness will plow through to the end. It has potential in another media.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|with a hint of laughter, a dash of romance and a big dose of supernatural surprises. The story continues in a small town with big surprises and even bigger characters.  I found this second book in the series answering a few more questions than the first.  It was also a bit slower and while the writers blended  .  well in the first book not so in this book.  At any rate I'm ready to start reading the next book.
B001BANK32|5.0|I could never watch the movie or read the book in the past, but now I can't put it down.  Was spurred to try it with his sequal coming soon.  Love Stephen King.
B00BUT5I84|4.0|30 Seconds to Mars has this method where they try to make each album completely different from the last. They throw everything they knew out and play with something else. This album was no different. But it still holds all of the greatness that is 30 Seconds.<br />I'll admit, it worried me in the beginning. After hearing the last two albums (I still haven't gotten around to getting the first one) especially \\"This Is War\\" it was hard to get into this one. It may be that it's just too much of a change from the last, but after a couple of listen threw's, it grew on me really well and I had a hard time putting on any other album for a couple of weeks.<br />City of Angels, Conquistador, and Up in the Air happen to catch me the hardest. Northern lights seems lazily done though.<br />I think we all just got use to what seemed like near perfection with the last two albums, especially after This is War, that this one seems too out of place.<br />This is definitely one of those albums you have to walk into with a very open mind and not expecting anything you know them for. It's a fantabulous album. Maybe just a little too much of a change to take in all at the same time.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Watched it with my teenager and we both really had a good laugh.  Baraba Streisand was priceless!
B008M721MS|2.0|I downloaded it and it was great for a couple months then it started not letting me sign in so it wasn't that great for me
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. Any where I'm at I can always get an update on the weather in my area.
0425263924|1.0|Really disappointed. The promised trilogy was not delivered. I plan to wait until Book 4 sells used for 1¢. Possible title of next volume: Cashing In On You.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I just wanted a simple dictionary app with no Adds. This delivers that and with a few more extras which I find interesting and fun. So I access it often and enjoy it's features. I do have a voracious appetite for Quotes,word a day vocabulary builders, History. This hits the spot.
B002P79KAC|5.0|I am addicted to this show and these characters! I laugh during every episode. It is such a cohesive ensemble. You must add this to your watch list for a good dose of humor!
B003F1WM2K|4.0|this autobiography about Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe was and enjoyable and informative read. I enjoyed the book very much.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend. I bought it & before reading it, i was seeing it in coffee tables at fellow ladies homes. Like a message to their husbands, which was hilarious. I dove in, had a hard time putting it down, but the ending was just meh for me. I don't know what i was looking for though, so it was worth the read.
0385535147|5.0|love it, so many twists and turns, just when I thought I knew where it was going, it changed paths.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It has plenty of plot twists, and an unexpected ending. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|This is a great way to start of their career. Here's To The good Times is awesome. Every song. Dayum, Baby is my favorite, I've been listening up HTTGT every since I bought it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have been a hardcore sookie fan for years and I agree with everyone that all good things must come to an end.  Where I disagree is all the exclamations of character assassination and major letdown of the ending. This series is 13 books long. Are you the same person you were 13 years ago? So why would our Bill, Sookie, Eric and other friends in Bon Temps not grow and change? If you want predictable stagnant characters, perhaps y'all should stick to \\"Days of Our  Lives.\\" Charlaine Harris created the best possible ending for a regular ol' southerm gal with hope of good things to come. Read this novel and move on,  just like Sookie would.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this endless game. My cousin had the DS version and I loved to play all the different levels. I looked into this one and bought it right away. Best game ever! There are so many creatures and things you can make. Thank you to the developer!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me reading and in suspense.  When I wasn't reading all I did was thinking about what would happen next.  Very fast paced and would read again.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Good ending to the series. I believe Mr Jordan would have been pleased. Brandon Sanderson has become my favorite author. Read Way of Kings. RIP Robert Jordan.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|The movie itself tells only half the story so that was a bit of a let down, but it is a Peter Jackson film so the scenes were well done. I just wish there was a way to cache the film on my PS3 so that I could enjoy the HD quality I paid for. There were times when the video quality was worse than sd (by far). Come on Amazon, you can definitely do better!
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I fell in love with the books and I have to say I was very excited about watching this movie. It followed \\"maybe\\" 20% (if that)of the story line of the book. If I hadn't read the books before watching the movie I might have a different opinion, but they completely butchered the book.
B00BEXB18M|2.0|i understand that bands change over time, and perhaps mustaine and company were trying to slow it down a bit and do something new for this album.  but there is little point is doing something new if you're going to do it badly.  this album is more \\"rock and roll\\" than \\"heavy metal\\" but even for a mainstream rock album it is pretty lame.  i listen to lots of mainstream hard rock in addition to heavy metal and thrash, bands like five finger death punch and sevendust, and this new megadeth album pales in comparison to even that sort of music.  there is just no energy at all to this album, no intensity, and the few decent songs are not as good as anything on even the subpar album endgame.  and while megadeth has never had brilliant lyrics and many people dislike mustaine's vocals, this album is worse than usual in both departments.  the lyrics are pretty dreadful at times, and dave really sounds bad this time around.  listen to his voice on the title track, he sounds awful, and that was supposedly the best take.  but surprisingly, the music is pretty lame and predictable as well, which is what kills the album the most.  there are a few good guitar solos and some nice riffs i guess, but its not consistent, and anything on the album united abominations completely blows this album away.<br /><br />some of the songs, like super collider, burn, off the edge, and especially dance in the rain, are just terrible.  honestly, if it wasn't for mustaine's extremely recognizable vocals, i would never have even thought they were megadeth songs.  they sound like a local bar band doing a mix between ac/dc and mid-90s van halen, and doing it badly.<br /><br />there are a few decent tracks.  kingmaker, built for war, and cold sweat (which is a cover, so they get no credit for that) are okay.  and the song the blackest crow is pretty cool and a nice change of pace and might actually be the best song on the album, which is funny because it would fit right on the album risk, which everyonehates.  personally i think the album super collider fits right in with the albums th1rt3en and world needs a hero as the band's worst.  but even those albums (and this one) are not completely without merit.  but all in all it's a very disappointing album coming from a legendary metal band like megadeth.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game Rocks...I have almost 100 cool creatures and hope the creators give me more land and new animals to add...maybe another huge ice chunk can collide with this one...adding space and a whole new slew of needy creatures...yes satisfy me!!!

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I paid the extra $.99 to get the full app; well worth it. The basic warning is, if you change the volume on your Kindle, remember to reset your alarm volume (forgot once, but won't again :) ). I like that you can have multiple alarm settings and can pick the days you want the alarm to go off. It has snooze options & if you have music downloaded, you can pick that as an alarm option also. It also provides weather in your area and has a few selections for how you want your clock to look. I have not been disappointed in this. It's a very good app.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read this book 5 days but would have finished sooner if I wasn't working. I love this story especially the steamy sex scenes.
B00CTSVE3S|5.0|There are all kinds of reasons why I might watch a certain movie. It may be the director, the actors, the subject matter, or because of a review or recommendation. What first made me want to see Philadelphia was the casting of Tom Hanks. But now, after broadening my film knowledge in recent years, I wanted to pay closer attention to Denzel Washington's performance, and Jonathan Demme's directorial choices.<br /><br />Demme has been responsible for one of the best thrillers ever made (The Silence of the Lambs), one of the best concert films (Stop Making Sense), as well as quirky comedies like Something Wild. Philadelphia isn't like any of those movies in terms of feel or genre; it's a serious drama, with an important message.<br /><br />The story begins with lawyers Andrew Beckett (Hanks) and Joe Miller (Washington) battling each other in court. Beckett wins the case, and is promoted by his firm. He is entrusted with the task of representing one of the firm's most important clients. He's young, successful, and appears set to excel in his field. Miller is exposed as a TV celebrity and opportunist, who is more concerned with winning money for his clients than being ethical.<br /><br />Beckett is homosexual and contracts AIDS. He develops lesions all over his body, and some of them are visible. One of the firm's partners notices and fears that Beckett may have AIDS. Soon after, Beckett is fired.<br /><br />Do you remember when you first heard about AIDS? I remember it as a time of great panic. Nobody was immune from the disease, and we learned that it could be passed on by having a blood transfusion or unprotected sex. Imagine being a nurse and having a needle accidentally break your skin, and wondering if you would contract the disease. But, despite the fact that everyone was at risk, AIDS was primarily considered a disease which affected the gay community.<br /><br />Should someone be fired for having a life-threatening disease? Does it matter whether their current performance is exceptional, even though it will almost certainly deteriorate in the future? This story is about Beckett's fight to sue his former firm for wrongful dismissal. After trying to enlist the help of nine other lawyers, he eventual turns to Miller. We discover that Miller is severely homophobic, and his ignorance of AIDS makes him fear Beckett's very presence. The story educates both the audience and Miller during it's two-hour journey. Although we know much more about AIDS now, it was important to hear stories like this when the disease was relatively new on the scene.<br /><br />Miller's initial instinct was to get as far away from Beckett as he could. In fact, some people will never see Philadelphia for similar reasons. Homophobia is not as common as it used to be, but it still exists. Another reason that the film won't have a large audience is the debilitating nature of the disease. It's uncomfortable to see somebody become ill, knowing that they might well die. I understand the decision to avoid that kind of subject matter, but entertainment comes in many forms. The reason I enjoy Philadelphia is the strength of the central performances from Hanks and Washington.<br /><br />The second half of the film focuses on the courtroom battle between Miller, representing Beckett, and the firm which ultimately fired Beckett. If you enjoy courtroom dramas, Philadelphia does well with that aspect of the story. Demme makes some interesting choices, occasionally making the actors speak directly into the camera. It has the effect of placing us in the position of the judge or the witness giving evidence, and grabs our attention.<br /><br />Hanks was at his peak in the 90s and early 2000s, and this Oscar-winning performance is one of his best. Washington has been great for 20 years, and his performance should not be missed either.<br /><br />Philadelphia also won an Oscar for best song (Bruce Springsteen), and closes with another nominee (Neil Young). The music fits themood perfectly.<br /><br />If you enjoy good acting, serious drama, or stories that really matter, Philadelphia is worth your time. Some say that it is dated and overly-manipulative, but sometimes it's good to manipulate the audience when the message is important enough to warrant it. This is one of those times.<br /><br />The North American Blu-ray release is from Twilight Time, and is limited to 3,000 copies. The picture quality is pleasing and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track also does the job. It's available from Amazon, or directly from Screen Archives Entertainment, and comes with a small booklet.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5mood perfectly.<br /><br />If you enjoy good acting, serious drama, or stories that really matter, Philadelphia is worth your time.

B006WXHJNU|5.0|I never was one to watch the Hulk movies, but after this one, I am placing it on my new top 10 superhero movies list. Plus, blu-ray is the way  to go, I don't think the DVD version would do this movie justice... Go HDMI all the way!
B004J09ONG|5.0|This family oriented movie is inspirational and a joy to watch.  We especially enjoyed the wildlife scenes and the tenderness of the lioness in the movie.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I wasn't much of a marvel fan. But I absolutely loved this movie. And amazon got it to me real fast. Two days, and it was here. Same for Thor. Couldn't be happier.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Fast shipping & a fun exciting movie, my husband loved it! Its like watching a action packed video game, great gift for men.
B00000I8UK|5.0|I enjoy this CD very much, but it is not because of Eric Dolphy. I enjoy it because Bobby Hutcherson & Freddie Hubbard do the heavy lifting that makes the difference. I am in no way being critical of the brilliant Eric Dolphy. It is simply that Bobby Hutcherson & Freddie Hubbard hold this CD up. and prevent it from being somewhat ordinary. When Mr. Dolphy picks up his flute, and jams it with Freddie Hubbard, it is truly magical. I do not know if Mr Dolphy planned it that way, Freddie Hubbard, infused with Mr Hutcherson make this a magic ride. The piano playing is not noted on my disc, it does sound like it is Bill Evans, but I am not sure. I can take this CD apart piece by piece, but it did not achieve that reviews it did on its own. Bottom line, is that I gave it four stars because I wanted more Dolphy, especially on flute. Why quibble, it is very good, Because Freddie Hubbard is in top form.OK, you got me 5 stars!!!. I am listening to it as I am writing this, and it is in many top 25 lists, So who are we to argue with this kind of brilliance, just enjoy it (over & over & over again) and you will play this many times !!
0684857219|5.0|the most effective detailed book about bodybuilding. Easy to understand. It's a must-have tool to every one interested in the mentally and physically rewarding sport of bodybuilding.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love the game.  Great brain exercise.  Fun and challenging enough if you do not use the hints. Only issue was it was to short for me.  Needs to have more puzzles per game.  About twice as many for the price.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I haven't completed reading this but so far I'm intrigued as to how the main character thinks. Other than his obsession with Niki, I can follow his thought process. I'm pleased with my purchase.
B0093FNZT6|4.0|Thought provoking .....interesting, insightful makes one wonder..brings to mind the the quote &#34;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&#34;
B008Q0C248|2.0|This is probably one of the worst interpretation of Hamlet that I have seen,  Hard to take Hamlet seriously in this - he is portrayed as a somewhat spoiled brat in the beginning - so had to really identify with him.  And adding &#34;thee&#34;s and &#34;thou&#34;s to the script does not help this be more authentic - in fact makes the dialog sound false. Too bad - taking a great play and making a hash of it.
B00932DCS8|5.0|It captivates from the beginning to end!  Great flick!  It's worth spending the time.  There are enough twists and turns and actions to keep the audience interested.
B008Q0CO0U|4.0|I really did enjoy this move - it is a taught thriller with some really good twists to it.  And Mark Wahlberg is a great fit for the central character/
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was extremely disappointed. Mostly sex and very little story.  I was expecting much better. I will certainly reconsider before I spend the next $10.
0066620996|5.0|Excellent book. A must read on the business of business. How to be successful and how not to be successful. An inside look on how to make a plan work.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Hollywood at it's best. The acting was superb and very balanced drama to action. Plus, the good guys win. Would definitely watch again.
0394401522|5.0|I love the book. It is full of a lot of French recipes and more importantly, techniques. It is a treasure to own and pass down. I love Julia Child.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|The third book in this trilogy is amazing. Robert Langdon is once again a character that we all wish we could have a mind like. The story line is one that keeps you thinking. Because it takes place in Our nations capitol its even better.. As we can use our imagination and where he is going, looking at , etc. Because its home.  GOOD READ
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|I would like to order this blu-ray but why is the price sooo high ?  I watched the DVD the other night and really wanted the blu-ray from Amazon (after all I am a prime member) but for this price of almost 60 dollars?????
B005VPRFSY|5.0|great product.  Couldn't find it in the stores and it was just what my grandson wanted.  Glad I checked with you.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Wife and I love watching these.  We started with Season 2 on Netflix and when we realized we liked it we found Season 1 on Amazon instant and starting watching from the beginning.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book is the first of a three part story.  While it is a sequel to Ender's Game, the story is quite different, but just as much a page turner.  Orson Scott Card does a materful job of introducing so many new characters that draw on so many emotions.
B0086700CM|2.0|The graphics are fun and the idea looks good. I love have a game or two on my kindle but this one was too fast and frustrating for me. When you keep playing the game and can't get past the first level after a month tells me it is not for me. My son loves it so it is still on my kindle for him.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved it from the first page. Love the characters and the story. These books are like my comfort food, but reading. Enjoy it!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I cannot open it on my KindleFire. It download but would not  allow me to operate it. It is a waste<br />of my time.  Definately not good.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|Downloaded this free app of the day and everytime I open the application, it crashes. I was really looking forward to this game. Will make another attempt at installing on another device. Perhaps it isnt compatable with my phone.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Best tv series ever.  CD's are as advertised.  I almost have a complete set now.  Thanks Can't wait for season 6.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is great it's challenging and fun and is a awesome shooter. Even though I wish it had more stuff to do it makes up for it with its addictive gameplay p
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved the characters! I want to read more.<br />Very engaging, kind of hard to get past so few people keeping secrets for 100's of years, but even with that, I enjoyed the character development, the relationships, and the wanting to read more about their lives. Everything I want from a novel series.<br />Thank You Mr Howey
1885167776|2.0|If you think \\"The ONE Thing\\" is an acronym, you are wrong. It is indeed \\"One Thing\\" and many little others. Considering that this book took 4 years, research and Gary Keller's tremendous (and oft-repeated) teaching experience to create it is surprisingly short on originality and substance.<br /><br />It starts out with \\"Six Lies\\", their \\"truthiness\\" soundly defeated under the heavy blows of (recycled) research. Then moves on to the \\"Truth\\", the focusing question. There is a big-picture and a small-focus question. This then turned into a habit, promptly focused onto seven areas of life. Surprisingly then we have to look for others to set up a benchmark and follow trending. Then we move from icebergs to dominoes, to arrive to \\"The Three Commitments\\" and to \\"The Four Thieves\\". Then there will be success.<br /><br />I feel that most of us promptly will run into the following problem. Not being the chairman of the board of a multimillion dollar company, we will have a hard time to create a four hour-a-day blocked time segment to pursue our ONE Thing. Then of course we have other areas of our lives with their own little ONE things.<br /><br />The book is a pretty little thing, well designed with cute graphics, colored quotes, great feel...yet it just feels amiss. Somehow it feels as the brainchild of a very succesful businessman, who is unable to truly relate to others in other profession in other stages of their careers. It is also somewhat contradictory. The author himself admits that he went through stages of different life/career philosophies as he built his own business. He then lost his way to find THE truth that eventually allowed him to find peace and balance (excuse me, balancing). That is, if I build an empire, with blood, sweat and tears (and luck; do not forget THAT real estate boom that ended with a BANG!) once I am on the top, it is easy to look back with a hindsight bias. There is precious little proof that following his own book's advice he would be where he is right now. I would go as far as to offer a reward to the readers; follow this advice, succeed, then I can use your story as proof that this and only this system rewarded you with success. ONE thing somehow implies over-specializing and this, just like in investment increases risk exponentionally. No Bill Gates, no Steve Jobs, no Mark Zuckerberg got to be known pursuing ONE Thing.<br /><br />I think Gary Keller will do much better if he writes an autobiography instead of trying to be a self-help guru. He obviously has a truly fascinating life story to tell, but unfortunately not much wisdom to teach.<br /><br />UPDATE 06/17/13: I took off one additional star for the following reason; the core tenet of the book is a little too similar to an advice that could be read in Brian Tracy's \\"Eat That Frog!\\".he is right now.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|This didn't get a lot of buzz when it came out, I'm assuming there was some other comic book explosion movie around the same time, and it got made invisible. Very quotable, very funny, and caused a whole girl scout troop to sing, mashup and learn the cup flipping trick.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|From the ads I was expecting something more lighthearted. This is very well acted, but pretty dark - both leads are very damaged folks and their inability to function normally, while key to the plot - sometimes gets a lot more attention than the story.  The characters are revealed, but they do not develop.  That being said, they are very interesting people in a tough situation making the best of what life has handed them, and their struggle is very well presented.  So, watch it and expect it to be good, but don't expect it to be cute or heartwarming or anything the ads for this movie indicated.
B000ICZCZS|5.0|This is why I still like Hugh Grant, and how I started reading Nicholas Hornby. It doesn't pretend that any of the characters are easy, even the one who is completely determined to keep his life uncomplicated. And I've known a lot of mum's like Marcus' and that character is all at once frustrating and stupid, but well-meaning and overwhelmed. Great movie.
B005ELQVGW|2.0|I tried to like this album but in the end, it just didn't move me at all, almost as if it is too analytical with a lacking of feeling or something.<br /><br />Disappointed to say the least.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This film takes you on a visual journey that is so beautiful it takes your breath away. If you love nature and art, immerse yourself in this film for a few hours. The spiritual symbolism in the film is interesting and moving. This is not an action packed film with a griping story line- it is a thought provoking journey that invites you to look within.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait to see what happens next! Started watching after series had begun, so love being able to catch up.  Love Downton Abbey!  A classic!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome and looking forward to do the eod and wizard of oz and wizard of oz series for kindle fire in the job of representatives from a great way of life of
B007THA4FI|4.0|Thought it started a bit slow - lots of characters and took a while to know them. But then, as I got to know the towns and the people, it became much more interesting. Wanting to see connection, wanting them to care and care for each other. To set aside the struggle for power to really see their neighbors.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|It will keep you guessing to the very end. so if you like the first two and dont want hard line answers to the end. then this book is for you
B003W5C0VW|5.0|The Stones were so good back in the early 70s, nothing could beat them.<br />Someone commented on the fact that you don't see any shots of the audience!! Who cares?
B00992CF6W|3.0|The game is great, I use it to build a world perfect for my in my free time but I will only give it 3 stars until,amazon decides to update it  o the new 0.7.1 version that was already released in early May.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I used this gadget for the first time yesterday while on a day trip to New York City. Two of us found that our phone percentage was down to 30%, so when we sat down to dinner, I brought this out for us to charge our phones while eating. In the hour that we sat there, My phone was up to 81% and hers to 78%. Not a full charge, no, but enough for us to continue to use the phones for the next couple of hours of our trip without completely draining down to zero.<br /><br />It is a bit on the heavy side, so I am not sure I would bring it with me unless I was carrying a bag of some sort - i don't carry a big pocketbook, but I did have a camera bag yesterday so I stored the pack in there.<br /><br />I would highly recommend getting this.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I dont have a BA in history but i do w it. I was sceptical on this series..its fantastic. Anyone who says otherwise...you have to take the amount of education they have. I watch it over and again...best HBO had to offer

B008Y73940|5.0|I love this movie it the best one I've watched today. I feel like I should watch it two or three more times tonight.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|All of the characters in this book are great!  Loved the story.  It was one of those difficult to put down reads
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|First off, I watched the movie before delving into the book series.<br /><br />The actors were great in their given characters, though I wish the movie had more time to dissect the castors. I am happy with the easy ebb and flow of the story.  Costumes were great, cinematography was beautiful. Watching the movie convinced me to start reading the series.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I felt like I really learned about the Pacific Coast trail and what it's like to hike it.  Way to go Cheryl!
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I love this app considering that I'm just starting working out again after having a child (currently 8 months old) and I love all the videos and descriptions for the workouts. I've always just gone to the gym or worked out by myself and I love the videos more because I feel like I'm accomplishing more rather than just doing whatever. It feels like an actual routine. I just feel like I should be more sore or something the next day, but maybe not.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|PLEASE STOP reviewing movies on the Blu-ray/DVD pages.  Their has to be lots of better places to review movies.  Let these pages be for the Blu-ray/DVD reviews.  I want to know whether the movie converted correctly, what kind of added features are included etc.  I'll make up my own mind on whether I like the movie or not! ATM there are hundreds of reviews of something that hasn't even been released yet.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Way better than the 1st. Other weaphone app does'nt update the new weapons any more. This one eventually will update more weapons. Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in ww2. :)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was so excited to get to the 3rd book.  It felt a tad overdone with a few too many \\"pod\\" type adventures. But still I was sad to come to the end. I had heard many were disappointed in the end.  Not me, war is disturbing and costly. No less disturbing in this book.  Nicely done Collins!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game whenever I have some down time. I love that I'm not required to sit and watch the ads that pop up. It also gives the option on whether you want a winning deal (easy) or a random deal (harder than easy) lol.
B00AK57N00|1.0|I just think that its really really stupid and you should not pay a penny for this game its not fun
B0079XPUOW|5.0|One of my students suggested this book to me because he knows my love of science fiction, and my sense of humor. This novel is a cross between the world of Roddenberry and the humor of Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchet. A very enjoyable read.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|I thought it was a funny movie. Arnold was great as well as Johnny and the other cast. Have fun watching it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Crazy amazing book. I have never read a book that has been written in such a way I absolutely loved it !!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I even think that its better than temple run very fun and entertainin<br />g for me and my sons
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is wonderful! My sisters and I love playing it because it is very cute, has good graphics, and there has been no problems at all. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys soothing music and watching your plants grow.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Does provide needed info. Tells you exactly how much time remains. So do not get surprised especially when reading.have time to bookmark.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun and so realistic.... you can do side games and even competitions!! It's just like taking care of a real horse! You have to keep everything clean and feed and bath your horse... I recommend it!!
B0071MV540|4.0|Good comedy and lots of great acting as well.  A good movie to rent or purchase.  My rating is B+
B007IXWL2C|4.0|While the interactions between Christian and Ana become a bit formulaic after a while, it is good to have the story threads come to closure.<br />I really am interested to see how these books are treated as a movie.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I enjoyed it but it's not a movie I would see again.  I love Liam Neeson, he's a fantastic actor but The Grey did not hold up to TAKEN which I absolutely loved.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This is an amazing show. I look forward to watching it every week. Amazons instant video is the way to go. It's like a mini movie every time I watch. Very satisfied.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|A little too bland for me and just not enough action.  It was a good movie just not a great one, in my opinion.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Seem like I would want to take a picture of something other than myself.  Would not have downloaded it if I had realized that's all it was.
B007Q476KU|3.0|I guess there was so much initial hype on this movie I expected much much more.  It was too long and for me ... boring much of the movie.  Does not match up to movies like Secretariat, Sea Biscuit, or Black Beauty or National Velvet.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|This is is a beautifully written, magical book. Let Erin Morgenstern delight and surprise you from the very first page to the last.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I bought a new TV that did not have any RCA hookups. This allowed me to keep using my old sound bar via the optical output on my new TV. I haven't noticed any problems with the audio, everything sounds just as great as I expected.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This is a lovely, gentle movie that reflects love in such a realistic way.  I love the very rich dialogue, the dry sense of humor, the beauty of the scenery.  I love the movie and recommend it wholeheartedly.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|If I hear even just a whisper about a good contemporary book on Twitter that I haven't read, I know that I'm going to read it. ELEANOR & PARK not only had whispers, but full discussions, yells, and exclamations, meaning I not only knew I would read it, but that I would read it SOON.<br /><br />I ordered the book, it came a few days later, and it sat on my side table for one day before I couldn't stand it anymore and picked it up. Fortunately the day I read it I didn't have work because I stayed curled up on my couch fully engulfed in the lives of Eleanor and Park, loving every minute of it.<br /><br />I didn't read the synopsis at all before I read the book, so I had no idea what to expect. It actually ended up being a more serious book than I thought it would be, because Eleanor's life is less than ideal. And while Park had some really great moments, it's Eleanor who I connected with, and yearned for, and wished for. My heart ached for her family situation, and then it got warmed by the little things Park would do for her, especially in the beginning as they got to know each other. On top of that, the banter and the writing of Rainbow Rowell had me laughing out loud at several points, showing that the author is a master of balancing both the humor and the more serious aspects of life.<br /><br />I tried to read the ending slowly because I didn't want the book to end, but there's a series of events at the end that had me flying from page to page, where I soon found myself reading the last sentence. I am completely happy with the way Rowell ended the book, and for awhile I was scared that I wouldn't like what she had come up with because the rest of the book was so great for me.<br /><br />The recommendations all over the Internet for ELEANOR & PARK are completely warranted.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful cabinet with intricate doors, drawers, buttons, etc. with clues. This game is interesting, challenging both to look at and to play.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I finally read THIRTEEN REASONS WHY.<br /><br />When I was browsing books for my next read, THIRTEEN REASONS WHY just felt right. And I have been waiting for this feeling. I've had this book on my shelf for years, knowing I would most likely love it and that it is a staple of the YA contemporary community. But even worse than not reading a book is not reading a book at the right time. So I waited.<br /><br />And I loved it.<br /><br />For those who haven't read it, this book is the story of a girl who committed suicide. Before killing herself, she recorded cassette tapes journaling her thoughts and the events and people who brought her to that point. Her plan was to have each person on the tapes listen, and then pass them on to the next person. For the entire book, we are in the head of Clay as he listens to the tapes.<br /><br />It took me a few scenes to get used to the alternating voices in the chapters, since it changes from the recorded tape to Clay's thoughts. It's clearly laid out with italics, but I had to reread a few sentences to make sure I got the full impact of the tape versus Clay.<br /><br />It's no secret that a book about suicide is emotional, and Jay Asher pulls together the thoughts of teenagers through these tapes (and their stories) and Clay's interactions and thoughts about these same events. Your heart breaks more and more the farther Clay gets in the tapes, because it starts to become clear that it's not just one event that led Hannah to her decision, but all of them as a combination. And all of the events show the true colors of the individuals she describes, which makes me feel horrified with humanity.<br /><br />I'm glad that I finally read THIRTEEN REASONS WHY.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The visual aspect of this app is very easy to read making sure that even techno numpties, like me, can have no excuse for the device to be running out of charge. It installed without a hitch and I use it most days. Well worth having.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a wonderful mind game,keeps you on your toes. My Wife and I play it together and have a great time figuring out the cludes and finding the hidden objects. There is a little help with hints but if you persist you will be entertained and have fun.The graphics are outstanding,and the music sets the mood.Five Stars from me and recommend this game to those who like a challenge.
B00BY9GQHM|3.0|I wish the app description would have been clearer on how heavy this is on HOGs.  I don't mind HOGs but I want them intermingled with other puzzles.  Porbably a great game for those who are into HOGs but not for me.

B000QXDED6|3.0|I do not accept consistency with reality as a necessity in a film. For those interested in a brief but decent review of expert opinion on the subject of reality in 300, see the article on the film (Wiki, subject, 300 Film). Just one point, familiar to those of us who were around for all of the ruling days of Hitler. This is made very clear in 300, so it requires nothing beyond what is enunciated in the film. Query: What would/should you think of a society that makes as its primary educational goal  the training of each male child in the arts of combat beyond all other learning and commitment to achievement in War beyond all other achievements to mark success in life.<br />Enough of that. What about the movie itself. It certainly gave us a colorful, action filled, balletic vision of hand to hand combat. It didn't happen to be accurate but we have put that issue aside. My lack of satisfaction with it in purely cinemagraphic terms was the absence of the kind of tension, the constant uncertainty as to outcome, both individual and collective, that marks the best combat scenes on film. It was Superman (supermen) against a group of ferocious looking completely untrained equivalents of office clerks. It did not ring true (not true in the sense of what really went on in hand to hand combat, but true in the cinemagraphic sense-how can you be a HERO, if you are fighting the equivalent of the kids who had never held a gun whom Hitler sent to face the Russian Army as it approached Berlin). I liked the acrobatic techniques but never felt for a moment that these could be real people fighting  a real battle.<br />What there was of non-combat related scenes were conventional and non-involving. One felt that, well, that give us a brief shot of the wife and brief shot of the nasty traitor; oh, and to be sure that we know how bad the guy was, he persuades the Queen to have sex with him to get his support in a vote. Not enough?  we see the Persian gold pouring out his tunic (neat trickthat) when she deals with him later.<br />What would I recommend: if you like choreographed, colorful display (by one party to hand to hand combat), and splashy camera work painting a portrait of  war, this should suit you. If you are going to think about what you are seeing, you might want to look elsewhere.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My kindle is my best friend for reading books, so easy to sample any book and then purchase it if you want to read!
B00CATSONE|2.0|The book was primarily an invocation to success.  The biographical part was short and not very informative.  The author's philosophy was stated repeatedly and was the primary motif of the book.  It was not what I wanted.
006072675X|5.0|It appears to me that Paulo explores feminine sexuality through the lens of it being a unification with God.  it is interesting to observe a man exploring a woman's sexuality in such a spiritual light.  This is unique and I wish more male authors would do the same.  Female sexuality is deeply rooted in the spiritual, and when that gets taken away, covered up, robbed, hidden, etc, so much pain, perversion, and suffering results.  Paulo explores that as well, in such an eloquent and creative manner.<br /><br />-Rivka Edery, M.S.W., L.C.S.W.<br />Author of:  &#34;Hear Me Sing: Book I&#34; (2016)<br />“Trauma and Transformation: A 12-Step Guide” (2013)
B000001FKY|5.0|Grew up with them - so happy to have the CD again!!  True classic rock at its very best - buy it!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|A very detailed and insightful look at the search for Osama Bin Laden.  The suspense builds as you see the obstacles the CIA analyst must overcome in order to locate him.  The account of the climactic raid is riveting.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is so much fun! The characters are reasonably well developed and the actors have fabulous rapport with each other. The special effects looks really crisp on the Blu-Ray, although I've never seen it on DVD for comparison.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Exceptional novel! The characters come to life so that you truly care about their future.  I have enjoyed all three of mr. Hosseini's novels
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I bought this on sale for less than $10 and think its definitely worth the price. I haven't seen this movie on DVD before but on blu-ray it looks great!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Only used it once or twice, so far, but can see it will be very handy.  There seems to be a variety of settings for it, which keeps things organized by color, and there is a calendar included, archive, trash can, and Themes setting.  There is even a search feature.  I will definitely be using this one almost daily.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|I've been slowly upgrading my DVD collection to Blu-Ray when I find good deals. I've been a little apprehensive about films from the 70's and 80's on Blu-Ray because sometime the special effects look way to fake and you can see make up on actor's faces etc.<br />Blade Runner looks so good though! It could have been made in the last decade. I was astounded by how much tiny set detail was visible on Blu-Ray. Also the Final Cut is fabulous, Ridley Scott added new backgrounds and better CG effects here and there without altering the movie too much. Plus the new &#34;unicorn dream sequence&#34; is different from the Director's Cut version and that was exciting.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Very inspiring book. Going threw some tough times and this is helping to not dwell on the tough times and focus on how to get threw it!
B004RE29PO|5.0|I've been slowly upgrading my DVD collection to Blu-Ray when I find good deals. I've been a little apprehensive about films from the 70's and 80's on Blu-Ray because sometime the special effects look way to fake and you can see make up on actor's faces etc. Overall I think that Aliens looks great! It;s really neat being able to see all of the set details that were all blurred out on the original VHS version. Plus there is so much detail in the darker scenes, like in the caves, that could be only barely made out on the DVD (with all the lights out) I will continue to bulk up my Aliens blu-ray collection as long as Amazon keeps offering sweet deals!
1452113432|5.0|Rachel makes me appreciate my small studio kitchen and teaches us how we can still make great meals in our little 2x4.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I saw this in the theatre in 3D and loved it! I was a little afraid that it wouldn't translate well to a smaller 2D viewing screen, but the Blu-Ray does not disappoint! The special effects looks every bit as nice as I remembered seeing on the big screen. Also I thought this film made a great addition to the Alien franchise, I hope there will be many more to come.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was amazing up to the very end. What a mind rape. Smh. Why did he end it this way?
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I like what they did throughout the season for the most part. It's strange to have a show where the main characters die. So that is always shocking, especially when one develops favorites. The writers do a wonderful job stringing out arcs throughout several episodes. They do a wonderful job showing both the good and bad of humanity. And seeing the effects of the pressure on the characters is well done. The ending of the season is rewarding, yet sets up a lot of new elements for the 4th season.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Theres a lot James has to say in this book that I've heard before, but for some reason, this time it resonated with me. His transparency is refreshing (no toothy motivational speaker hype here) and his language casual. I read the whole thing in two sittings, and it would have been one if I didn't have a family function to attend.<br /><br />The principles he outlined are actionable, nd in no way require perfection. Particularly profound is his assertion that life is better when sentences are punctuated by question marks, something children do. As adults, everything has a period, and the sense of joy, adventure, authenticity - gone. He calls this constant bewilderment, and I've no trouble adopting it as I walked the streets of Hollywood this morning. They make bewilderment easy here!<br /><br />Easily one of the best books I've ever read. Thanks James!
B00AZRBLHO|2.0|If I could, then I would give this book two different star ratings. The first rating would be for project management and information technology mavens ... and it would be five stars.<br /><br />The second rating would be for general audiences, and it would be zero stars.  This reads like an MBA program case study.<br /><br />I recommend this book only for the first group.  I do not recommend it for general audiences.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is a musical genius. This entire album is a joy !!!<br />She is rare talent that is a long time coming, and hopefully<br />will continue on even longer.
B004XKVPG6|5.0|Must we catch the serial killer? It is his ruthlessness and morbid creativity that provide this film the dual passion of viewers' lamenting just how sick the killer must be, while simultaneously waiting for the next depraved crime. The movie goes on like this for about one-hour and then we shift gears and cheer for the detectives who are now in hot pursuit of this fiend. The final section of the story offers a horrible twist that we suspect is coming but we wished it didn't, no matter how imaginative the killer proves to be. Great acting throughout, good pace to the story. A masterpiece thriller and detective story.
B0012FCIIE|5.0|An amazing CD. One of my favorite Wilco CDs for sure. If you like Wilco and/or are just getting started listening to them this is a must buy
B0037QGS0K|5.0|Think of this film as a symphonic masterpiece that builds a crescendo towards the end and then stops with no discernible ending. Viewers will enjoy the phenomenal acting by Moore, Seyfried, and Neesen, and will be titillated by the ups and downs of the storyline. We're not exactly sure just what Neesen is doing or what Seyfried will discover, but we know that Moore is determined to dig up the truth even if she has to cross a few lines to get it. Moore is at the top of her field in subtle facial expressions which convey the complexity of emotions she goes through, and may have gone too far in searching for the truth. Whatever, the three main characters must interact with each other under various definitions of what is really going on at the surface, below the surface, and at the primordial animal level of human existence. But this freight train of emotions runs out of steam at the end, leaving viewers wondering: is that the most interesting way of closing the book, of writing the finale for this great symphony? Oh, well, I can't deny it was a great symphony up to almost the end! I recommend it with 5 stars.
B00ASVX1BQ|5.0|She really conveys such depth in such lovely sounds.<br />Nightwish did us a favor setting her free to reach her full potential.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I think its great if all you want to do is watch and collect things and a tiny bite more.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Very fun game. Installed it and starting playing...had to pull mylsef away. Does remind me of Mario bros and Corey but still unique.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have the complete series of &#34;Sookie Stackhouse Novels&#34; The ending was good and I wish there were more books coming out. I would recommend this book to everyone.  I would like to say more but I do not want to give away the plot, characters, or ending. Mrs Harris is a good author . I have her series on &#34;Harper Connely&#34; and wish she would continue this series also.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun for what it is. Could be explained in the help sections bit more. And sometimes you can't load an allies base. But it does get fun.
1878424319|5.0|This book teaches one how to live a life with self-confidence and the freedom to be be the best person they can be for themselves and others.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son is 10 years old and a HUGE fan of Minecraft so was delighted to get his hands on Lego MInecraft.  This item is micro so expect it to be small!  My son really enjoyed making it and would like Lego to produce more characters and other buildings :)<br />The price i thought was a little expensive but if you are a true Minecraft fan then it is a must have purchase.
B004CA2HVE|2.0|This is a sick song. Really enjoy Kanye, Jay, and especially Niki. But the sound quality is trash. Sounds like a 48 kbit file. Cannot believe Amazon has this on here.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 3 year old grandson always sees the rest of the family on our Kindles & wanted to do something also, so we taught him how to play Fruit Ninja. We now go in to try to beat his scores.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This has been one of my favorite games so far.  The only issue I have is that the pretty colors go away TOO fast.  Is there any way you can make them show for just a few seconds?  If it is possible &amp; you did make the colors stay (briefly) I'm sure there would be some wet blanket that would complain about it not moving on fast enough.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Much better than any other escape game I've come across on kindle. The puzzles were great, but there weren't a lot of clues. Still I got through pretty quickly, mAybe more chapters in the next one. Cant wait for the next!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series has been totally amazing, but I can't get over this ending!!!!!!  WHY?????? Can't wait for the next one!!
B00881VLCE|2.0|When I first ordered the game, I loved it because I could download every kind of beautiful pictures to solve them, and I loved the sidebar where the puzzle pieces were lined up, not scattered everywhere. However, after the first day, the game never opened again, so I had to return it.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I understand the movie I just really found it hard to follow due to it jumping all over the place. Do not buy or rent wait for free on cable or satellite.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|My children love it, never have any problems with it. The graphics are sharp, the colors are vivid, and it is perfect for travelling. If you need, you can buy additional levels.
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|not worth owning, border line rentable, if I was to have choose again I would wait till it came out on cable.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My children (10 and 11, boy and girl) love this game, and argue over whose turn it is. Perfect for travelling or long drives in the car, this game will keep them entertained. Additional levels are available for purchase. We have never experienced any technical glitches.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Wasn't sure about this at first but got totally hooked. The graphics are very good, it moves quickly (I have little patience for slow loading) and all the bonuses make it fun and challenging. Recommend this game!
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Love  it, love it, love it....Awesome game.  They need th o have many more like this.  Great story, terrific puzzle games, and hidden scenes.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I could not stop reading this book.  I was unaware of the plight of over 200,000 children during this period from the early 1900's to 1929,  The author has done a great deal of research and has incorporated two stories of abandoned children-one from the earlier years and one in our own day who is a foster child being tossed from one home to another in search of what all children deserve and which we take for granted-a loving and protective family.  I was thoroughly moved and emotionally absorbed in this story and heartily recommend reading this book.  The author tells a story with beautiful phrasing and with language that is fitting for each character.  The two main characters tug at your heart and make you want to meet them in person and say how much you admire their strength and bravery. This story is not meant to sadden you as much as to uplift you and give you insight as to what the human spirit is capable of overcoming.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I liked the older versions of Die Hard better than this movie. Too much with the swearing and seems like every other scene is someone getting beat up or cars crashing. Where&#34;s the plot?
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie was fantastic!  I love that it wasn't your typical gory, flesh-eating zombie movie.  There was a great story line and love how it resolved (don't want to spoil it for those of you still wanting to watch it).  The soundtrack is awesome and the humor in the movie isn't corny, it's very &#34;human&#34; and relatable.  I could watch this over and over.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|you'd think it might bore you but it rocks a lot. getting the puddingss aligned isn't as easy as one might think
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an awesome game that any one can enjoy at any time day or night ......... it is great entertainment for my wife and mother
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What I like about the game is that you can unlock new people and cool boards. I like the mystery boxes.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I did not know how to play. I struggled through many games before I caught on. How does one have time to chat???
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|As someone who's passion is to read, I was captured by the first 2 books in this series.  I waited in anticipation for the 3rd book and purchased it on pre-order the day it was available.  There didn't seem to be any added value to this particular book.  It seemed as if Sylvia Day was up against a quick deadline and turned around a terrible piece of work.  She should not try to focus on so many projects at a time, but rather give the time and dedication it takes to making a quality piece of work, rather than worrying about quantity.  So many of us who appreciated her work are left not wanting to pick up another one of her books or even continue with her through this series.  She needs to do something quickly to fix the bigger problem with her work.  What a shame, and for the consumer, what a waste of money.  Refunds all around please.
B00AK57N00|5.0|I glad amazon Appstore has this game. I played on its/i touch and it is great.it a simple concept but very addicting game.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Very funny and entertaining.<br />My 3+ year old loves it and I must admit I find myself watching it even if he's asleep.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The first two books were great, but Entwined with You was \\"A BIG LETDOWN.\\" The book repeated info from the other books and it didn't get to the things readers wanted to know. It's bad enough that I started reading  her works, enjoyed them, only to find that the ones I have read are not finished or release dates pushed back, i.e., the Dream Guardians Series and Renegade Angels Series. Just feels like Ms. Day is in it for the extra cash and stringing loyal readers along. Plus she apparently doesn't respect her readers since the book was released late from original release date earlier this year. I hear she's planning on stringing us along with two more books in this series. If she is smart she will just finish this story. My advise, don't buy it new, you will be able to get it cheap from discount book store or on garage sale tables real soon.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|I enjoy watching livestreams often, but I wish the app had more features like being able to watch past broadcasts from people you follow and half the time chat doesn't load or the stream freezes up. I wish the app was more like the website for people who don't have computers to watch the streams.
B008BU75IQ|1.0|I hated the ending. No, it didn't end it just stopped. Real disappointing unless we can expect a fellow up story.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|While I was reading this, i really felt a different sort of pull towards this book than i did with the first two- and that there wasnt one.  I remember reading the first two books and you couldnt pull me away from them, i had such an unbelieveable urge to read just that next paragraph..next page..next chapter..next book and then go to bed...but this one- i was completely comfortable putting it down and going to bed after a few chapters with the 'eh ill read it tomorrow' feeling.  WHAT?!?!?!?!?<br /><br />Throughout this whole thing, i was constantly making faces and thinking things like...'wtf? did brett really just say he cant wait to be INSIDE her again- and she not react at all?????????????\\"<br /><br />i mean if i read the next one or even the after that it will be by the sole factor that i fell in love with gideon and eva in the first two, and would feel like i let them down if i didnt, even if the the author seems to be going waaaaay off track .  (anyone who doesnt really read their books wont understand the logic of letting down fictional characters lol)
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|My heart broke learning about the real 2004 Thailand tsunami and so I was hesitant to watch this movie at first.  I always enjoy Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor so I eventually chose to watch it...and was very glad I did.  Each actor played a wonderful character who was easy to connect with.  The cinematography was effective and each scene was meaningful.  The production was very well thought out.  I recommend this movie to all and consider it as my favorite movie I watched this year.
B008J4L3E6|4.0|as expected, an entertaining mystery from an author who never fails to maintain interest to the  last page, a great book to read curled up in a comfy chair in the winter sun.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|This game is definitely easy on the eyes! I thought I might get bored with the LBP (Little Big Planet) style side scrolling, but I was so wrong. All the things I disliked about LBP type games- like forced adhoc and online multiplayer, in game purchases with real money, and overdone physics reactors are pleasantly non existent in this game. I can raise my stats without begging friends or going online to play with strangers.<br /><br />I also like the \\"pipe\\" traveling Mario style throwbacks. There are no double jump turtles (yet), but I'm only on level 3. I somewhat hope it doesn't come to that though... the LBP reference with the \\"stage\\" and fireworks at the end made me cringe a little.<br /><br />The replayability factor is alive and well thanks to 4 game modes. You'll need to beat several levels before you can unlock 2 of them... but the fact that they exist to expand your gameplay deserves some kudos. The only modes I've unlocked are story mode (Main Adventure) and the pumpkin mode (Punkin' Time). Differences you'll notice are that story mode has checkpoint save points that allow you to continue from whereever their locations are after you die, and the pumpkin round has none; meaning that if you die, you'll have to start over from the beginning. I also couldn't go back the same way I came through the transport pipes on the pumpkin rounds (but that could of been some sort of fluke since I only played one of those levels). Other modes are \\"Drag 'N Dash\\" which requires that you beat chapter 1, and \\"Heartbreak Shakedown\\" that requires you beat all of story mode.<br /><br />Moments that may frustrate you:<br />-Missing a double jump off a cardboard bird to a tiny hidden platform above it. The birds will not reappear unless you die, and you'll miss your one chance of reaching pipes that bring you to the clouds in order to collect additional silver buttons. You'll have to reset the level if you activated a checkpoint after killing a bird... but if you're a score perfectionist, you won't have a choice.<br />-Trying to exit the game, as there are no buttons on the main screen, and hitting back/return will only bring you to the game mode selection screen. (-1 star until fixed)<br /><br />Neat extras: you get one free costume top with a pumpkin on it if you go to the customize character menu. It will say it costs 0 gold buttons, so just select and equip it. The most expensive item in the store is worth 100 gold buttons, which is about 25 perfect story mode levels (I think).<br /><br />Technical details: The controls for the game are very responsive, and all the animation sequences are incredibly fluid. The color scheme is good with a nice pinch of whimsical fun- looks great on hd devices, and isn't an eyesore. Many hd games try to overcompensate with bright colors to simulate hd quality; this is not one of them.<br /><br />This game is worth downloading, especially as faotd! It's one of the few faotd that's worth paying for- so give it a try.<br /><br />.....................................<br />***EDIT (6/13/2013) ***<br />.....................................<br />App level/mode \\"Drag 'N Dash\\" (with running dinosaur) crashes/breaks down after bridge double jump. The dinosaur double jumps over bridge, lands on platform and dies because there isn't another platform after that.

B007UQRW62|5.0|This incredible movie deserves a great gif set like this one..<br />I really recommend.  Great gift for all the fans!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|While the movie was technically done well and the acting was good and we needed to be reminded of how brutal Slavery is/was ...I did not think it was as extraordinary as the pre-Oscar hype and Oscar Awards indicated it would be.
B00B7ERH04|3.0|I thought this would be an easy thing to operate....But its NOT.  Haven't yet figured out how to point and shoot.  By the time I turn it on, figure out where the flash button is on the screen and finally take the picture...I have missed alot.  Most of the pictures have turned out great, but it is really difficult.  Wish there was an instruction booklet to figure it out.
B000KZHQAM|5.0|I love the storyline of the Animatrix. It explains a whole lot at the beginning of how it all started.
B008VBYN80|5.0|It's really fun and cool, it's free too!!! This game is addicting and fun. You get to build your kingdom and army!!!!!
B004FGFQBS|5.0|I love this movie. I've seen this movie enough times to know the lines the actors speak when the lines come up. The few extra scenes don't really add much more to the movie or story. If your a real fan of this movie it may be worth picking it up.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|While I honestly feel disappointed,I can't wait...please release book 4.....Soon!  I really hope their  isn't a  book  5 !  Don't keep<br />me waiting...
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It is Lots of fun. I like that you can change it up by playing the different versions: arcade, classic, etc......
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Have tried to read all of Grisham's books.  I am a retired attorney so books written by members of my profession are always a treat. He picks topics that are so interesting; keeps you wanting to turn those pages always trying to foresee what is coming.  Character development is special.<br />Now that I have my Kindle, I will catch up on some of the books I may have missed by this talented and informative author.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|This is my favorite watch I have ever purchased. I never take it off. I wear it 24/7. I even shower with it on. It hasnt let me down yet. Very accurate. Wears well. The jeweler I took it to to have it sized was very impressed witht he watch he said it had a very good movement and should be a really good watch. And after nearly a year it has been. I highly recommend this watch and seller
1781162646|5.0|The King puts a lot of himself into his books, and this book reveals his depth and sensitivity! It is one of his many truly great stories. So touching, so fully immersive. You get to live with a great young man through a wonderful and tragic summer full of mystery, adventure, heart break, and wonder. I so so enjoyed the ride, and am refreshed in spirit for it.<br /><br />This is less a tale of terror and more a coming of age story. There is terror, and mystery. But more so there's poignant lessons of a young man struggling to grow into adult hood. And the deeply beautiful story of his friendship with a dying boy.<br /><br />If you love Stephen King, you have to read this.<br />If you don't love Stephen King, you still have to read this.<br /><br />I'm so going to miss *this* man (the King) when he's gone. Thank you, Mr. King.

B00AFPTSI0|5.0|I appreciated the way Adam Grant wove the biographies of the subjects with the theories he presented.  However, I found some of the illustrations redundant and boring.  I got the point, but found the extra verbiage a distraction to the main point.  I would recommend this book to 'Givers'' who are tired of being doormats for 'Takers'.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|These were funny, insightful, and a good reminder that cats everywhere are driving people crazy (although not intentionally).  Although it seems to be from a lack of understanding on the human side.  :)
B005H9B44A|4.0|I'm a fan of some Marvel characters but I don't like all of the new movies and reboots so I initially skipped watching Thor until now. I came in with low expectations but it turned out to be a very solid movie. It had a good balance of acting \\"serious\\" but still giving some comedic moments that felt natural and not forced. Considering the material it could have come off cheesy and awkward but for the most part it all came together very well. If you're actually reading reviews to decide if you're going to watch this, go ahead and give it a view. You may end up surprised like me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very pleased with this version. It is easy to navigate and easy to read.<br />I would recommend it. Great product.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|TuneIn Radio Pro - I installed this on my Kindle Fire in case we needed to listen to local radio during emergencies.  Sometimes the tv is off the air, but not the radio or electricity in certain parts of the town. This is useful also, if you want to listen to various radio stations for entertainment.
B009346RSS|5.0|If you are really into audio and you bought a new pair of decent speakers, such as studio monitors, for any use, especially with a computer, you owe it to yourself to purchase one of these. Putting this DAC between your computer and your speakers will result in much higher quality audio. You will hear many more details in your music and you will hear everything at a higher quailty. Higher end speakers, anything that wasn't a no name brand purchased at big lots or another bargain section, are capable of playing better quality audio than your computer can feed them, this product will not make your audio sound as good as it ever could but for only $28 it is a huge upgrade.<br /><br />I myself was skeptical about purchasing one of these as just about every reviewer was using these just as a way to hook a new T.V. to older sound systems. I purchased a set of Yamaha HS50m studio monitors to listen to my music on and I had them hooked directly to the computer through my headphone jack, since I was waiting for this DAC and the mini toslink cable to come. I hooked this DAC into my computer using a mini toslink to toslink, Apple iMac only has mini toslink, and then I used a HOSA dual quarter inch to RCA to go from DAC to my speakers. I instantly noticed a huge improvement in my sound quality. Having listened to songs just as We're Gonna Make This Day (Feat. Massif), and Overnight by the Zac Brown Band as well as Southern Comfort Zone, Beat This Summer, Pressing On A Bruise by Brad Paisley and finally Lullaby by Nickelback, I noticed a huge difference in amount of quality and detail as opposed to juat using the studio monitors. This product is well worth the $28 dollars you will spend on it.<br /><br />Only one downside, which is with any system that utilizes toslink, you lose the ability to control the volume with your computer, you can still control it in each application or on the speakers themselves. This DAC doesn't have a volume for output. It is only a minor issue in myopinion and the trade off is well worth what you will gain.
B006JD48NM|4.0|Senna is a 2010 documentary about the life and untimely death of Brazilian racecar driver Ayrton Senna. The film focuses on his Formula One career, from his debut in the 1984 Brazilian Grand Prix to his death at age 34 in the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994, with particular emphasis on his rivalry with fellow racer Alain Prost. As a compilation of archival racing footage and home video clips, the film is an example of Direct Cinema (Observational Mode). There is no voice-of-God narration, and the filmmakers are not seen or heard on camera. Yet while the film is comprised of actual footage, the filmmaker's editorial touch is evident in the way he uses the footage to tell the story.<br /><br />The editor's influence is felt in such things as the way film clips are organized, the use of slow motion, shots that zoom in or flash back, and diegetic sound that is either brought to the foreground or muted to allow voiceovers to be emphasized. The melancholy music that accompanies even the opening credits of Senna portends the tragic ending to the life of this world-champion racer. It is an ending that racecar fans viewing the film already know, and the tension of knowing what is to come is palpable throughout the film. The soundtrack, at times melancholy and mournful, at other times tense and suspenseful, serves to contextualize events that would otherwise be exciting but not necessarily tragic. We know what is going to happen, and the soundtrack conveys the drama and tension that accompany that knowledge.<br /><br />The soundtrack is the only non-diegetic sound in the film. All other sounds are diegetic, or intrinsic, to the scene - crowds cheering, people talking, airplanes flying overhead, and particularly the Formula One engines themselves, which emit a high-pitched howling sound unique to this type of racecar. It is a sound that builds excitement among the spectators, but contextually in this film, the engines sometimes sound like someone screaming and give a sense of foreboding. In one scene just before a crash, the soundtrack becomes a literary element, with dramatic crescendos and a slow drumbeat in the background sounding like a heartbeat.<br /><br />Editorial choices are felt in the choices of footage that show zooming in, panning out, holding a shot, or giving us a bird's eye view. While all of these techniques were part of the original footage, the filmmaker made intentional choices about which segments to cull from the thousands of hours of original footage. He included bird's eye views of racetracks, which communicate power and omniscience. We, the viewers, know what is to come, and it gives us an uneasy feeling. It is a sense of power that we don't want.<br /><br />The filmmaker uses many close-up shots of Senna's face, which creates intimacy with the subject; we come to know this man and care about him. There are numerous extreme close-ups while he is seated in his car with only the top half of his face exposed through his helmet. These shots are so close we can practically count his freckles. The camera lingers there and gives us a chance to imagine what he is feeling. The close-ups also convey intensity; we see the anxiety on Senna's face after computerized improvements were banned from the cars, and we see animosity in the face of Alain Prost, as the rivalry between the two drivers escalates. The filmmaker seems to have chosen the shots intentionally to play up the contention between the two drivers and to cast Prost in a negative light. The viewer wonders how many shots of a smiling Prost were left on the cutting table.<br /><br />The onboard camera of a racecar traveling over 200 miles per hour gives the viewers a thrilling ride. We are at eye-level, seeing the road from the driver's perspective. Low-angle shots are used to record the winners accepting their trophies on the podium. We look up to them, they are our heroes. Slow motion is used for footage of Senna walking off the track at the end of a race, perhaps toshow contrast or even to convey an emotional letdown after the breakneck speeds of the race. Slow motion is also used for the signing of autographs; Senna was beloved by his fans, and he gave back to them with unhurried attention.<br /><br />We see Senna's fatal crash after a long-stretch of onboard camera footage from his car. We are racing with him. The climactic moment of the fatal crash sneaks up on us, as it would have on the driver. The scene is absent of gratuitous emotional pulls, such as a crescendo of music or dramatic cutaways to alarmed faces. The crash was unexpected, and the filmmaker allows it to be play out in a natural way. It is somehow more heartbreaking suddenly to see Senna's still figure slumped in the seat. The footage shows emergency personnel working on him; then it cuts away to the crew members viewing the scene on a television screen. This has the effect of creating emotional distance from the raw sight of the carnage.<br /><br />At the end of the documentary, the filmmaker uses cross-cutting to good effect at Senna's funeral; the camera alternates rapidly from mourners walking by the casket to scenes of Senna interacting with them in life. The effect is to give a sense of the life - and death - of this individual. This is a compelling film with mesmerizing footage and an engaging back story. By his selection of footage, the director has chosen camera shots that portray the subject as a gifted racer, a popular hero, and a humble man. Though not unbiased, he has given us a rich portrayal of these aspects of Ayrton Senna in the format of an engrossing documentary film.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|If you like his other books, this will not disappoint.  Amazing detail. Brings Kabul to life. Great back and forth between time periods, Afghanistan and modern Afghans' San Jose life.  One weak section raced perfunctorily thru Paris's life.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I liked the story and the truths that this movie told about our humanity. Humans are not always focused on the doom and gloom, but it takes a while for the movie to get you there (over 2 hours) and if you don't commit 95-100% of your attention to the timeline and details; you might find yourself saying, &#34;what am I watching?&#34; At least, that's what my wife said about half way through before she stopped watching it.
141970642X|5.0|If you loved the Wimpy Kid movies odds are you will like this book.  It shows you everything that went into making the three Wimpy Kid movies, and gives you a behind the scenes look.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|this game is an Awesome game I would have given it all 5 stars but you have to purchase the full verison to unlock the rest of the necklace and hair pieces and the dresses but besides that its a good game :) ..^_^
0810983915|4.0|This fourth Diary of a Wimpy Kid book contains stories from Greg's not-so-amazing Summer.  This was my favorite book so far elevated by the new locations the characters visited throughout the story.
1439102732|2.0|When I first purchased Sing You Home, I was delighted with the concept of a music CD to accompany the book.  I am a die hard Picoult fan and love how she writes from multiple viewpoints and how she stretches my thinking.<br /><br />As of this writing, I have just finished the third chapter.  I know I will finish the book, but I'm pretty sure I won't listen to any more of the CD tracks because the singing is so bad I can't concentrate on the lyrics.  Personally I would have been better off with printed lyrics at the beginning of each chapter....or a different artist to perform them.<br /><br />When I bought the book I was not aware of the theme/tone of the book or that it was a pro-gay instrument.  Had I known, I might not have purchased it as that clashes with my personal beliefs of what God intended a family to be.  Since I AM three chapters in I will probably finish reading it and must say that the depiction of Max's salvation and baptism in the Holy<br />Spirit is beautiful and accurate.  I hope to discover that Christianity continues to be presented in such a positive light.
0810970686|3.0|In this third book in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, Greg continues to have funny adventures shown through the cartoon-like illustrations and stories written in his journal.  The books keep getting better the more you get to know the characters.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love to turn on when resting, naptime or bedtime.  The sounds of rain, thunder, wind, birds and others are soothing.
0810994739|3.0|A sequel to Diary of a Wimpy Kid, this book is more about Greg's relationship with his brother, Rodrick.  The illustrations are great, as always, and the story funny.  I liked this book even more than the first!
B000059GEI|5.0|Really a great entertaining movie. Great story line. Everyone is at their best. Fascinating to watch. Not too often<br />a movie comes along with such talented people in one film. It's a Gem and should be treasured.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|At times the story seemed a bit &#34;hurky-jerky&#34; to me.  The author has us whisked away hither and yon and at the end even invoke time travel.  Still the story kept my attention and I enjoyed the characters enough for this to be fun.
B00008973A|3.0|A wonderful insight of what it means to audition and how each actor relates to trying-out. It's handled very well.<br />However, seeing it on the stage live had a more dramatic emotional affect.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|The graphics are quite amazing the missions are kinda hard to me but I just go around but very fun for kids
B00280LYIM|5.0|Rick Riordan has made another great book also reading his other series The Heroes of Olympus. A TRULY GREAT BOOKS.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazing a little hard cause of the controlls but how is it pocket edition the kindle couldn't fit in my pocket
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I've loved all three books, felt every emotion possible,held my breath with anticipation!  The story of Gideon and Eva had me imaging there could really be that strong of a bond between two people. Only reason I didn't give it a five star is because I wanted it to be longer. Im not ready for the story of Gideon & Eva to end. Keep it going Sylvia :)
B000M53GM2|5.0|I couldn't find this DVD for rent anywhere despite it being Pierce Brosnan's finest performance as 007!  Classic context, Tina Turner's killer theme-song, and loaded with cheesy jokes - it's impossible not to love Goldeneye.  Rated MB for must buy.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Oh, Drew.  I LOVE that this book made me laugh and swoooon all at the same time.  He is an arrogant, man whore who while being all of those things is just the right amount of charming and sexy so he can get anything he wants....and he knows it.  He is definitely the type of person that any woman would have a hard time resisting in real life.<br /><br />I absolutely adore Kate.  She is definitely what all of us women should aspire to be like.  She's confident, business savvy, she goes after what she wants and does it with grace...yet she has her faults just like all of us.<br /><br />Not only are the two main characters in this book amazing, the minor characters are just as fun as well.  I absolutely adore the fact that this is written from Drew's POV.  Definitely a refreshing change of pace!
B005CRQ2IU|4.0|Did not realize or had forgotten this was a graphic novel when started to read.  However found the story intriguing and thought provoking. Who does good and who is good are questions asked.  The multiple story lines all seemed to be asking the same questions.
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|A classic that we just revisited with our two children.  This movie is still as relevant today in 2013 as it was back in 1984.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Loved the entire cd. He has a style that is old yet new. This cd was so enjoyable I highly recommend it.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I thought the season wrapped up the series well! It left me guessing until the last episode!  Even knowing who gossip girl was (I read it online) they still made the way they revealed it a surprise.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|In addition to having beautiful graphics and an intriguing story line, this game is both challenging and satisfying. Even after successfully completing all levels, I find myself going back to the beginning and replaying the whole game while trying to improve on my previous times. After several times through, it still has not become boring by any means.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Secret of the Wings was requested by our 5 1/2 year old granddaughter.  I understand she has watched it many times over.  Thanks Disney for a good Childrens DVD.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I would've wrote a review sooner, but since I d/l Jewel Star, I've been to busy addictively/obsessively playing this game!  LOL<br />This game has so many levels and different challenges of playing, you have to be a maniac to bore from this game easily.<br />Definitely recommend this game.
1609613937|5.0|Plant base (Vegan) for a couple years and this book is my starch bible.  John McDougall is brilliant, he makes healthy eating easy, no counting calories, measuring portions.  Just eat!  The Starch Solution explains why starch foods such as potatoes that most of us grew up eating are good for us.<br /><br />Many diet books on the market for us to try but you are exhausted after reading them.  I can't figure out where to begin and feel hungry before I start.  Simple, recognizable foods,  as it use to be works best.  McDougall has done his homework and personally I agree 110% with his thinking,  Foods in a package with preservatives are not making us healthy.<br /><br />Starch Solution book takes the stress out of eating!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie is extremely funny. If you have a warped sense of humor and enjoy silly scenarios in movies, you will enjoy this one.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Although I must admit I had a hard time getting into the book, after a few chapters I couldn't put it down!!! It was a wonderful story! I highly recommend it.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|It was a good read. I dislike all the commentary from Tanya.. I feel it was distracting, and not needed  RIP Chris Kyle  You did everything you could your death was sad to happen the way it did.  You served your country and its vets. Let peace be with you.
0307951529|5.0|I loved this book, it is filled with great information about starting a micro business. There are many practical examples of businesses that started with basically nothing and are doing well today. I learned so much from this book. A must-have for any entrepreneur.
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|Tells the story beautifully of a girl trying to escape her miserable childhood and make a life for herself - through her love and understanding of flowers.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|The guy can do no wrong. The title track, Unstoppable Momentum, is another Joe classic! I'm completely perplexed by the reviews stating that there are no standout tracks on this album. The title track alone stands up to some of Joe's strongest efforts. The soul is there, the emotion, and of course, the virtuoso guitar playing; all typical Satch! Can't Go Back is a very strong follow-up to the awesome opener. Another favorite of mine is Lies And Truths; a solid, rocking anchor that one expects on a Satriani album. I will admit that Three Sheets To The Wind is a bit silly with the horns and all, but it's tolerable. Soon after comes A Door Into Summer, which is just a quintessential Satch track. This one definitely hearkens back to classic Satch from The Extremist era. It could easily be the sequel to Summer Song. Immediately following is another standout track Shine On American Dreamer. This is another Satriani track that contains all the elements that make his music great. I wish I could articulate why Satriani's music is so phenomenal, but alas, it's impossible; you either feel it or you don't. Apparently, there are a few closed minded folks who don't. I really enjoy the tandem of Jumpin In and Jumpin Out, especially the latter. Both tracks are really rocking. Next up is The Weight of the World; a nice departure for Joe in which the keyboards play a prominent role. This track is proof that Joe is trying to keep things fresh after all these years. And finally, we have A Celebration, in which the music perfectly conveys the title. I should not forget I'll Put A Stone On You Cairn. This may be Joe's most beautiful short track. This is simply another exceptional album from Joe; I'm not surprised.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I have given this album to several friends who have played it for days on end.  And if you love the movies, most of these may be familiar to you.  Go on, take a chance.  Yo Yo and Ennio.  How could you go wrong?
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Finished this and added to my favorites list of books. Just absolutely excellent storytelling. Very relevant if you're in your early 20s :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day is an amazing writer!!! Loved this series. Book 3 has great sex scenes!!  Gideon and Eva fought for their relationship which was so worth it!!
B0017KP93U|5.0|Everyone in our family loves it. Even my husband who generally doesn't like rock much. Can't get tired of it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice and big, easy to use, even has guides showing you how. Works well and fills the screen so you know how big it is. Great for tips and dividing the check when the waitress didn't hear you say separate orders.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am really enjoying Pinterest!  It give you lots of good ideas about home decorating, gardening, travel and lots of other things.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I check into Facebook more often now than I did when it was only on my main computer. I'm a tech and when I'm home working on my main computer I don't find time to do Facebook. Now I do, anyplace I'm at. I just need to what people have left on  it, I don't do games on Facebook.
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|I always loved this type of movie and this is a good one its time. So I say 5 star
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Beautifully written and in the end not only do we get a good look at portions of our judicial system at work/or not we see another case of what Mother's will ultimately do for their children.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic movements by the horses.  It's easy to navigate to complete the tasks you are given.  Fun side games, too!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love Vince Flynn. He spins a great novel!  Do you people think that I have nothing bettter to do than wright a minimun of words.<br />you should be lucky people respond at all!!
B00AG297GK|3.0|It was a much needed funny, there was some dumb sexual parts that are unnecessary like in most movies. For the most it was funny and a good late night movie to fall asleep to with some humor for good dreams
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book gives insight into the positions of the various countries involved in World War II and its aftermath.  Very educational!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Very good app I enjoy using it is good in crossword puzzles  and many more apps .I would recommend t h is apps to others
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Omnibus (Wool 1-5) started out like a science fiction story from the early 1960's.  I almost put it down after the first chapter.  I am so glad I didn't, because this is a very unique and engaging story.  Without giving too much of the story away, it is about a large community (thousands) of people living in a very large underground bunker, or Silo.<br /><br />Hugh Howey provides details of the people and the culture within a story that quickly becomes a page-turner.  For much of the story, we follow one particular person who is someone that most of us will identify with and admire.  Simply a great read.  Five stars.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love this app. It can do almost everything. I don't need to do anything anymore. It's awesome really awesome.
B007STXHTM|3.0|I baught the new housing cause I snorkel an dive at the reef alot.i have another camera but since I baught the gopro I been trying to employ it.the new housing is better for underwater but there is still a slight fisheye effect an I think my olympus takes better quality pics/movies.if you have a gopro an want to change the fisheye out this isnt bad for the money.you wont erradicate it but its much better.it is an upgrade but I kinda exspected more.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it is a easy. way for me to wake up for thing's I have to do and school and other things so it is helpful
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|It was fun once it was loaded but it is a huge file and really slowed down my Kindle.  Too intense.
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|Schwarzenegger starts off looking like he hasn't acted in a long time but gets better when the mood starts to get heavy. Not great but not bad. The supporting cast does well.<br />Worth seeing if you don't spend to much.
0425263924|1.0|a fourth Crossfire Novel?  Now I know Im bored  Too much of the same thing. The sex was great but too much of anything becomes very dull. You tell such a good story but I don\\"t want to take 4 or 5 books to know the end.
B009JCL58G|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, Cloud Atlas Sextet is the lead character in the film. The movie wouldn't have been the same without the soundtrack.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this movie it lacked a story, I watched this movie because a relative said...oh my god this movie is great....please I almost jumped over the nearest precipice, I wish I didn't waste my money
B0013FBS20|5.0|This is a unique story. Scientists think they find a viral cure for cancer, and like other viruses it can jump from person to person (aside from the few with immunity). The unintended side effects are the people it does not kill outright turn into vampires. Smith's character is alone (aside from his dog) in New York City, trying to find a cure for the virus.<br /><br />Smith does a great job playing a guy who is clearly going crazy from being by himself for three years, yet, is brilliant in his moments of lucidity when he works on the cure. It is one of the better acting jobs he has done in his career. The reason I like the alternate version is that it fleshes out the story of whether the vampires are becoming sentient beings vs just mindless killing machines. It really goes deeper into the ethical dilemma of whether it is right to &#34;cure&#34; them. It is a question that the film does not really answer in either version, but it does make you think.<br /><br />Apparently the movie diverges a lot from the source books, which upset a lot of fans. If that is something that would take away from your enjoyment of the movie, then you should probably skip this. If however you are a fan of Will Smith the sci-fi kind of dramas and stories (especially ones that do make you think some) and can let the movie stand on its own, you will probably find this enjoyable. My only real gripe with the film is the fact that they made the vampires CGI. I do not think that there was a big need to do so, and the film could have been even more effective if you put real actors in that role.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|One star for ease of use; one star for changeable texture packs; and one star for overall performance.  But a spinoff of Minecraft that was below par due to lack of updates, and because only one player can play a saveable game. Our family of four were left in the lurch and in distress, since they had to pick up where the last player left off.  If you want the real deal, its $24.99 for Minecraft.
B000TXNDUW|1.0|Everyone says how radical this film was. Well, maybe. But it's boring. Boring. Boring. Unless you're interested in the history of film. Then, maybe, you'll find it interesting.
B003QSLDTA|5.0|I read the original Freaky Friday by Mary Rodgers back in the day.  This was an interesting modern twist to the original story.  Jamie Lee Curtis's character was hilarious; so was Lindsay Lohan's, albeit superficial.  But the whole family loved the overall plot.
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|It's kinda silly, that I still laugh when I watch this. This is crass humor and if you are looking for plot, you are not going to get it. It is funny and so wrong at the same time, that's why I love it
B001D0BLTA|5.0|I am in love I mean love love love love with the 80's and 90's movies they are just the best things.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|How they achieved this on such a low budget, I'll never know. It starts as something of a comedy, then takes a darker turn. After this, it ramps up the tension and just when you think it can't get any worse, it hits you with one of the most astounding final half hours of a film I've ever seen. I immediately went back and watched the last half hour again, something I'd never done before. Excellent movie.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|If you are too young to know why Paul Newman and Robert Redford are legends, this movie will give you a taste of their combined talent.  The ultimate buddy movie.
B008M721MS|3.0|Pro<br />- connectivity to family and friends<br />-easy webcam communication<br />-free<br /><br />Con<br />-constant crashing<br />-will not rotate<br />-constantly asks to redownload

B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great app. very fun. but as an update to subway surfers can you put them in Paris.  mm really hoping that FUN RUN can be aapart the app community. And minecraft cost HAS to go down. thnx
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This author is a surgeon.  If heaven is as he describes it, it must be a truly wondrous place. A great read.
1451626088|4.0|Enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  The characters were so well crafted, and while they have all been in the other books of the Cousins War series, in this each one really comes to life, and seen from a whole new point of view.  Anne is captivating, an intriguing young woman facing the turmoil of dangerous times.  If you are a fan of Philippa Gregory, do not miss this one!
B0031KE9C6|5.0|Highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a good mystery/comedy/drama all rolled into one.  My only regret is that I just discovered this show recently!
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|This is to cool. I am so happy I won't have to transfer files to my kindle anymore. It was so easy to setup the install process is quite easy. I do recommend if you buy this player that you install the server software first. The url is given to you in the description. Have that all setup, or your kindle will not see it until it is setup. After that, buy it thru the app store versus on amazon, I have the best luck installing apps via purchase on the app store in my kindle than I do when I buy them right in my desktop browser. Once the server sees your files, you will see them wherever you install the player. Thanks so much for this awesome player. I LOVE IT. It has played every format I've thrown at it as well, just fine on my kindle fire HD.
B003VVAE4W|5.0|Highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a good mystery/comedy/drama all rolled into one.  My only regret is that I just discovered this show recently!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Very good book to read the more you read the better it got keeps you guessing at what would happen next
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea is at his best on this collection of wonderful songs. I recommend it to anyone who loves this fantastic singer.
B001JU4S44|2.0|Shallow all the way through.  There is no character development.  There is no plot development.  There is no conflict development.  Even the action is short and at the end.  To sum the movie up, it's an hour and a half of set up time without actually setting anything up for half an hour of Tom Cruise showing off his moves.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael is in great form here.  I find the assortment of songs a little erratic and I'm not sure that one flows into the next seamlessly.  Nevertheless, they are all sung wonderfully and the arrangements are really appropriate to the styles.
B003PDQEBS|5.0|An absolutely beautiful movie. Colin Firth's performance is stunning and truly shines out in this film.  I recommend you watch it more than once.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|Most of the songs on this disc are lovely.  Very melodic, not too loud, nothing to harsh my mellow.  That's what I enjoy about Dido's music.  So I'm driving along enjoying it in my car, when I am suddenly jolted out of my state of relaxation with a rap break in the middle of &#34;Let us Move On&#34;.  This is not performed by Dido, but by Kendrick Lamar, a hip hop artist.  Talk about an unexpected turn.  It makes no musical sense in my opinion.  I find it so jarring and out of place that I immediately switch to the next song every time I get to that section.  I may even burn a copy of this cd and omit that track.  Too bad, cause I actually liked the rest of the song.  What was she thinking????
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|why can't i just give four stars?  Anyway I liked it, entertaining, funny, and action packed.  A. S. still has it.  I'm alex cervantes and I manage uberfuzz.com
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|This series badly needed to be finished, and so it is at long last.  Even though I'm not head over heels in love with this final installment, it's a solid effort and in my opinion worth reading if you've stuck with the series for this long.  Brandon Sanderson did the best he could with the limitations of the project, and overall I enjoyed his take on the end of the series that Robert Jordan started.<br /><br />I'm not overly enamored of the very end, but apparently it is the ending that Robert Jordan envisioned.  I'm also not thrilled with the way some story lines were wrapped up, but no author can please everyone.  I can't say more without getting into spoilers, and I don't want to do that because I really think if you've made it this far, you should do yourself a favor and read this book!  If, on the other hand, you gave up on the series many books ago, you probably would do just as well to forget it.  That's what it comes down to.  That's why I gave it 3 stars.  I liked it overall and it's good to have an end to a series that's been dragged out for so long, but it's not the be-all-end-all I would have expected based on how enthralled I was when I first read \\"Eye of the World.\\"<br /><br />I don't want to leave the impression that there was nothing satisfying in this book.  There were three things that happened in this book that emotionally affected me and that I will always remember, so that is something.
B00942X8PY|4.0|This is a good brain game it is kind of calming in a way. I've killed all the easy levels except 6-23 and 6-26. Help anyone?

1603427244|5.0|This is a fun book, and the presentation is excellent:  photographs, diagrams, applications.  I can't imagine getting &#34;stuck&#34; with this book in my library.  And it's spiral binding is a big plus, too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Every once in awhile a great game comes along and this is one of them.<br /><br />So much fun!<br /><br />The training should be shorter..too much otherwise this game is fun.
B00003CXIY|5.0|this movie is so funny. If you're an American Pie, Harold and Kumar kind of person then this is for you. It has dark funny humor, is inappropriate at times but really goes into the lives of goofy teens/young adults. Definite must see :)
B005HSL626|3.0|Well the reason I put three stars is because every time I finish the game a ad comes up and the bad things is I have to exit out of the game and 're enter  I wouldn't recommend it to young kids cause they could press the ad but otherwise it's fun
B005BGBPBG|5.0|The first time I watched this movie it was with my best friend and I was a little worried because I'm not usually too big a fan of chick flicks but something about this one is just so cute! It arrived quickly and in the condition described!
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Not so bad as many negative reviews said. I'm really enjoy this album. It's still sound Megadeth to me. 5 stars.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Really fun game. It's worth your time. it's not going to be your play any where. But still. Awesome game
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My wife and I love this show.  You will NOT be disappointed.  The acting, action, and drama is outstanding.  Makes me want to get Showtime.
B00B8PRDHE|1.0|I don't know about the music, but the product does BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK!!!  AFTER NUMEROUS EFFORTS, IT STILL DOESN'T!  WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF RETURNING THE DARNED THING.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Got this as a gift for my brother and he loves it and it works great.  I would recommend it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I loved Grabatron but Hungry Shark Evolution just knocks grabatron out ...Im a marine in the army and this is very fun to play when im bored or on the beach!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|So glad he finally has some new songs,  Love this cd, and would recommend it for any Rod Stewart fan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awesome and all, but unfortunately for those who spent 6.99 on an app with a kindle 2nd generation such as I are unable to play Wi-Fi games with other people or even just simply update the app. You know what would be awesome? If we could fix this problem.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I have loved superman since I was a little girl..  He has always been my hero.  And when they came out with Smallville I became addictive..  I have the entire series.. And wish that they would come out with more..  But I guess they have to stop somewhere.  Thank you Tom Welling for dong this one.....
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|I, like most people first discovered the dynamic duo \\"Capital Cities\\" upon hearing their mega hit \\"Safe and Sound\\". At first I thought it was an okay poppy song. Then a second listen got me hooked and I wanted to hear more from them! They have this infectious sound and spark to their music. This is their time to shine and I hope they shine bright! I waited and waited for this debut album perfectly titled \\"In a Tidal Wave of Mystery\\" to finally be released. I just knew this duo would make it big. I hoped that the album would have more awesome tracks beyond \\"Safe and Sound\\" and I was glad to find out it did! Here is a track by track breakdown of the album.<br /><br />1. Safe and Sound: The ultimate summer anthem of 2013, and hopefully years to come. This is such an awesome feelgood indie dance pop song. It's perfect. The synths, the vocals, the corny but great lyrics, and who could forget those infectious trumpets during the chorus? This song was destined to be a hit. The entire song is amazing and catchy, but my favorite part is this little segment between 1:15 and 1:30 in the song. I will never ever get tired of this tune!<br />2. Patience Gets Us Nowhere Fast: Nice upbeat synthpop song. The vocals are almost as infectious as \\"Safe and Sound\\". The chorus will make you sing along. The song has an 80s vibe to it. That seems to be happening a lot with recent music and I love it! The bridge around the halfway mark is simple but magical!<br />3. Kangaroo Court: I really like this song. It has this \\"Passion Pit\\" type thing going for it. The verses and chorus will get stuck in your head. There is a nice trumpet solo. I'm starting to love this duo and their soon to be iconic trumpet moments in their music. Though I like the version they have on the album, there is a version of the song called the \\"Shook remix\\" that I personally think is better. To each his own. Still a good catchy song and great song for going out clubbing.<br />4. I Sold My Bed, Not My Stereo: There is a strong \\"Daft Punk\\" thing going on with this song. This sounds like it could've literally been released on Daft Punks album \\"Discover\\"! The chorus is perfect. There is a bridge, that just makes me wanna get up and move to the music. There is a slight trumpet solo that is again magical. This song could be a hit if released as a single! Another great song I could never get tired of!<br />5. Center Stage: This song sort of reminds me of the Hall & Oates song \\"I Can't Go For That\\" and some Maroon 5 during the chorus. There is even a slight Daft Punk vibe going on again with a robotic background vocal during the chorus! This song is nice and funky. Like the lyrics state, this song is a 'good time'.<br />6. Farrah Fawcett Hair feat. Andre 3000: I like this song. The samples are awesome. The vocals have this slight Passion Pit thing going on again. At first the spoken word parts of the song were annoying, but they grew on me with each listen and now I love it. Andre 3000 provides some nice guest vocals bringing back slight memories of the funky \\"Outkast\\". It's a great catchy party song! Like the song states again, this song is \\"Good s***\\".<br />7. Chartreuse. Nice catchy song full of synths. I might like this song more with repeated listens. Their is a really nice bridge with a trumpet solo AGAIN and how could I not love that though? So far this album is consistently awesome. This song is a good song to listen to while driving around a city at night.<br />8. Origami: There is another Daft Punk type sample here. I love the funky guitars during the verse. Their is a soaring trumpet you can faintly hear during the chorus that is just sexy! The bridge is just breathtakingly delicious! The infectious bridge continues in the background during the final chorus. A great feelgood party song! Definitely one of my favorite tracks!  If I was in charge, this song would be released as a single.  It has \\"Hit\\" written all over it!<br />9. Lazy Lies: There is a Beach Boys and Beatles thing going for this song. This is a very beautiful song that is slower so you can rest from all of the party music that preceded it. The instruments that play after the chorus are the things you hear in dreams!<br />10. Tell Me How To Live: Great song for the clubs! There is also something about the vocals that make a good road song too. The chorus is a synth rocker! There is a tasty Mexican style guitar solo in there as well. I can see the crowd clapping along to this song!<br />11. Chasing You feat. Soseh: Great infectious love song with perfect 80s style synths. The chorus and verses with background vocals from Soseh are just sexy! I can see this being a hit like the Gotye song \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" even though the vocals aren't as powerful. Soseh sings a verse alone and her voice channels that of a young Madonna! Corny, but awesome track!<br />12. Love Away: A playful and infectious song. This like a synth version of a happy Beatles song! There is something about the beeps in the song that give it a space vibe. This seriously reminds me of the song \\"Love is Greed\\" from Passion Pit, in a great way! 2 minutes into the song things start to build up into a rocking guitar solo! Nice catchy song to end a great debut album that will leave you thirsty for more.<br /><br />So this album is a great debut album and shows that there is more to this musical duo than their hit song \\"Safe and Sound\\". In fact, that was the song I listened to the least, and I LOVE that song. That is how great this album is. It's also best to listen to this with good headphones or in a car with a nice sound system! The replay value of this entire album is unbelievable. There is no track I would skip. We all have different opinions and some will disagree, but I'm pretty confident that this duo will make it big. I really hope they don't become a one hit wonder. I hope they stay in the spot light with more hits throughout the years! They can be compared to \\"Hall and Oates\\" from the 80s. Though the sound isn't really that similar, I hope \\"Capital Cities\\" has a successful and memorable career like H&O! I would love to see them live since I've heard they throw amazing concerts! This is a classic album. Worth a purchase. Great album to dance to or work out to. I will definitely have this album along with \\"Daft Punks\\" and \\"Fitz and the Tantrums\\" new albums on replay for the summer. Perfect summer and beach album. Now excuse me while I listen to the album again and again!
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|It has been a long time good movie.  I have enjoyed this movie as a young women and now I still enjoy it once in a while...
B008KP6ENE|3.0|I like it but my only problem is going to home page I had to shut down my Kindle<br />In order to go to home page
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|sort of a transcedency between qotsa and them crooked vultures. both excellent, i fell in love with qotsa first, name songs for the deaf at the top of my personal list, with rated r and era vulgaris in second somewhere. to put it into perspective i first heard of Qotsa at a nin concert back in 05. i do not have a rocker mentality, but Qotsa is spectacular.<br />this is a darker album for the most part, which is what i like most about it, a very raw sound while maintaining a higher level of complexity in a lot of ways, there is only one song i can't listen to but it was worth twice what it cost.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Best match3 game. For the money, that is. Good graphics. Plays well on kindle fire hd. Recommend for all age groups. Addicting.
B003D0ZNM4|5.0|Arvo Part has produced some of the most beautfiul music i have ever heard, i am not musically inclined. all i really know is that this is a clean series of productions of some of the most baeutiful music i have ever heard. one of the best purchases i have ever made
159463176X|2.0|Whew! A total disappointment. I kept thinking of giving up, but I felt \\"obligated\\" to finish due to the author's reputation.  I kept thinking it wiould, it HAS to get better. (It DIDN'T)<br />It doesn't help that I'm listening to the audio version, and the voice actors are doing a poor job -- purely monotonic recitations of the words.<br />I found the construction of the book VERY confusing and disjointed -- each chapter begins in a different time period -- sometimes the present, sometimes the past. Each chapter begins with new characters and/or established characters who have aged so much, it's difficult to recognize them as the same character.  There's no seeming connection to the previous chapters making it VERY difficult to figure out where the author is going, and why, until the end of the chapter.<br />Where's the story -- a brother and sister are separated as young children and reconnect after 50 yrs when the brother has dementia, so there is NO reconnection. In between, extraneous BORING characters are woven into the story with the slimmest of relationship to the main characters. There's NO drama!<br />I've read both the \\"Kite Runner\\" (more than once) and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" and thoroughly enjoyed those books. It seems, though, that the author has fallen into a \\"rut,\\" in which his storylines are totally manipulative. He sets up all these heart-wrenching scenes to elicit empathy from the reader, e.g. a father has to give a child up for adoption due to poverty, a dog is mistreated, a child dies from lack of heat in the house, a child is disfigured by a crazed uncle etc.<br />I listen to audiobooks while I exercise and/or while in transit to/from work, and usually, with most books, I can't wait to get back to listening, but with this book, I kept thinking \\"Ugh! I have to continue listening to \\"THAT\\" some more?<br />Bottom line: VERY disappointing.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's a fun game, but I wish that you could use the coins you earn to purchase Bingo Credits. I have over 100,000 coins, but not enough Bingo Credits to play the game. The coins can be used to play the slots, but for me that's a little boring.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is a great book.  It is like a 21 century IT version of the Goal.  I don't work in IT but I think many of the lean and agile ideas can benefit any business. The thing that makes the book uplifting, however, is also what makes it a bit implausible. Like in Goldrat's books, once the characters come to logically understand the mistakes they have been making, they all make the right decisions to correct themsevles and everything turns out great in the end. My personal experience with real people is saddly different.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not at all as extreme as I was expecting from what I heard. Yes the sex scenes are beyond fantastic but under all of that it is a very sweet love story, especially for those with kinkier inclinations. A heart wrenching ending...I haven't stopped crying.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Action and &#34;Sherlock Holmes detective type&#34; smarts displayed. Tom Cruise did his usual professional acting job. The part could have used a &#34;larger actor&#34; for the imposing book role but would not have gotten better acting than Cruise performed.
B008220C38|4.0|It is beautiful, lavish, elegant, sensual and erotic.  It has all the elements of an epic love story - temptation, deceit, romance, suspicion, regret and death.  A very different, but entertaining adaptation of Tolstoy's epic novel.
B002ZG983M|5.0|When a after market movie does better than the main stream movies like IRON MAN! Nicolas Cage was just more convincing and has better feel for direction! Cast Cage as the Ironman!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app was just what I wanted and more. When staying in a hotel room, the outside/hall noises keep me awake. But using the Relax Melodies app gives me the option of a gazillion soft sounds to cover up the comings and goings of other guests. Bonus: My puppy loves it too as it drowns out the TV and allows her to nap without interruption.
B00CLNVYPE|4.0|We love Whoopi Goldberg and Maggie smith, and together they are a riot. This is a fast paced, ultimately feel-good movie about a lounge singer with a heart of gold. Not the best film technically, but a joy.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Best album from JT period. You can listen to this whole album straight without stopping it once. This was a gift for my mother, and she is now considering going to his concert! Purchasing this album for my mother allowed me to get the free MP3 version from Amazon's app! Winning!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Reminds me of Myst series but abbreviated...can't wait for the next installment.  Puzzles are not extremely challenging but they do make you think a bit.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|At first when I started this book as a sample I read a couple pages and thought it was going to be another stupid teen drama book, so I deleted the sample.  A few months later after I kept seeing it in the Bestsellers, I caved and tried again.  After getting through the first part of the teen love drama, it got good.  This book ended up have a turn I did not expect.  I was sobbing near the end and I hardly ever cry when ready a book.  The passion in this story is crazy good.  Definitely worth reading.
B000MVIAUY|5.0|Some of the best episodes of this 8-season series (renewed for its 9th this fall)  belongs to Season 2: the funny he said/she said &#34;Tall Tales&#34;, the touching &#34;What Is and What Should Never Be&#34;, the mocking &#34;Hollywood Babylon&#34;, and the disastrous showdown with Azazel in the final two episodes.  The quality of the writing and acting in this season definitely established Supernatural as a long-run series.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love this series. Couldn't stop watching the episodes. Almost better on Amazon so you don't have to wait a week for the next episode
B007UQRW62|5.0|This is a fun box set. It is worth the price? It just depends what the price is. I got it when it was on a amazon special one day price that was greatly reduced from retail. I would say if you could get it for $40 (or less) then it is well worth it. There is very nice hard bound book with the set along with a collectors umbrella that is fun. If you enjoy these special packaged sets then it is a great package blu ray boxed set, but again at the right price.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Mr. King is still a bit wordy, but the book is a great story. You get caught up meshing history with reality. Loved it!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great app that does what is suppose to do. There have not been any problems. I do not have to worry about getting my other one out when I have to do something.
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a beautifully woven story about suffering, human brutality, desperation, love, and redemption. I'm so happy that it ended on a positive note, & thankful that through the experience of being an orphan, many of these children, though now without plenty of hardships, thrived and transformed themselves into happy, balanced adults.<br /><br />Can you imagine in our day of plenty, that there are still thousands of children, out of agency desperation, are being placed in unfit homes!  This book inspires you to want to do something about it.<br /><br />Beth
B008XG1X18|5.0|My only negative thing to say about Pinterest is that it can be addictive.  It is my go to place for ideas.  The app works easily.  Easy to work with and get around.  No learning curve required!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book in one afternoon.  It is humorous and sit urging at the same time.  Great summer read.
B008602KQI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I have read the books and I was interested to see if the movie was able to capture the intensity of the books. Good job!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It have a lot of fun playing this game. In order to advance you may have to spend a little money from time to time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game. I played it for hours. I got stuck on levels 6 and 7 but I figure it out
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love the earlier seasons of vampire diaries. They packed so much drama into each season. I just hope they can continue. This series is great if you like vampires, witches and werewolves
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game. It's so much fun... I would play this game everyday I come from school and also asking my friends for help when I needed.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The case is working out for standing the Kindle and watching shows. Also very convenient to carry around and keep Kindle protected.
B00144VBBS|5.0|The CDs are in good condition.  I've already played them several times. The CDs has many of his famous hits and they play without any interruptions
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome.You can fight monsters,build,and craft stuff. Sorry,but there's no Endermen . It's still the awesomest game ever!
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits highlights the clever nature of high end attorneys and their devil may care attitude. The main two main characters yield and wheel a shared Jurist Doctorate at clients spraying collaterally damage in the process of winning at all costs.  Billable hours never seem to be portrayed as they are in real life but the acting and the writing place this show heads and tails above most.  This one gives Netflix's House of Cards a run for it's money.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|When I can rent it from the library.....there is no way that I will pay $30.00 to own it.  I paid to watch the pilot and really liked the show.  I will however, admit that I picked up on some of the humor a little late.  but found it very funny when it did catch up to me.<br />Just waiting for the Library copy of the whole first season
B000ID37T0|1.0|Video quality was very bad. It kept hanging up every 5 minutes. I would have rented from iTunes for a dollars more and it would have Been a better option.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Interesting but sometimes times time consuming. A lot of the cooler vehicles r specialty purchases. Why is land so expensive to purchase.
B005HSL626|1.0|This app doesn't work well. I play it about 2 times and it closes out or freezes or some other crap. I have had to re-download this millions of times. Needs new update. :(
0307730697|5.0|A friend loaned me this book to read.  Once I began, I couldn't put it down, and after reading it, I purchased five of these books and gave them to friends.  This book is very inspirational and is a great tool to share Christ Jesus with any unbeliever/friend.  I can't recommend this book enough!!!<br /><br />The following quote from this book summarizes its theme and the life of Adam Brown, &#34;Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, 'Wow..what a ride.'&#34;
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This was a very fun game don't listen to anyone else who says otherwise. I do wish that I could earn pearls though.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Im Shocked how great this entire album is, Queens came out of nowhere with this amazing collection. Glad to hear Dave came back for the recording.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Was a surprise how much I enjoyed the movie.  Had to see it after I saw the Avengers to see if the character was correct
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition  has to update to v0&middot;7&middot;1 so we can have bucket and cake and eggs and what ever I missed this is why we need the update.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Great movie, I love this types of animated movies.  A must see if you also like them.  Sit back and enjoy
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|This band has always been on my top 5 favorite bands since I started getting into music. They've always stayed away from any trendy play style and kept their music original. The band has changed vocalists in the past but changing singers has never been seen as a problem to me because I've seen it as a step forward musically no matter the vocalist. This is easily one of Killswitch's best pieces of work. Taking elements of their older albums and throwing in a new tone of sound, this is some of the finest work by Killswitch Engage. Definitely pick this album up!
B00942G4UA|2.0|Filled with Half-truths,  Reminds me of the anti-Walmart theme movies..<br />This is a union rallying call movie.. Of course this is in MHO.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|Soilwork has changed up its music style in various ways over the years, but it never changed my love for the band. I approached this album with an open mind and I completely adored it! From the great mixtures and flavors of multiple subgenres of metal in the very first song &#34;Spectrum of Eternity&#34; to the powerful and emotionally stirring songs like &#34;The Windswept Mercy&#34; & &#34;Antidotes In Passing&#34;, this is an album for every metal fan to definitely not miss out on!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I don't leave my house without checking this app. It gives you clear and acurate data that is easy to understand.
B00AZM7IQC|3.0|My fault for watching it on the big screen,was disappointed with the movie. Needed 3d glasses but it lacked the effects of the movies. More a good blue ray the 3d.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|If you love pictionary then you will love this game. It's really fun and the app is great. You just sign in with facebook and all your friends can play too.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Very good effects. Well worth buying to watch.good documentation and stunning scenery. Love the water droplets that come out in the beginning .
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I think that this is best Twitter app ever! I can easily check on all who I follow and posting is just as easy.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love the tail and the language, beautiful. Collin Perth at his best roll and the scenes are excellent. I saw it few times and enjoy it every time.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|All my friends had told me about Angry Birds, but I never played it until I downloaded this one. I love it so much and I think the Rio theme just makes it even more enjoyable.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|The story is good and Emma is playing very well, but the play of &#34;Nightly&#34; is less convincing. The total is good plus.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I will only ever beat the computer on this app, the easy level is good enough to make total beginners feel confident. I like that there are other levels as well to keep you challenged.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Such a fun great for little kids and older kids it is though to get it and it's great if you love horse to.
B0063IH60K|5.0|You can change the cards and background. It has other customizable features as well. I love playing solitaire on this app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an AWESOME game! My friends and I play it a lot together. You can create really cool houses in Minecraft and a lot more. Even though it costs $6.99, it's TOTALLY worth it.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I actually only used this app once. It works really well I just liked my phone alarm better after I compared them.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Enjoyed this book, liked the new hero, has a bad job, but has a conscience, fast readlooking forward to the next book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Once you start playing you just can't stop. The levels are just so fun and it really makes you think.
B000V63C4Y|5.0|Is this the same music that was on the old Brasil 66 album.  (It was an album because it was 1966.)  It sounds it.  And brings back lots of great memories.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I never used the app, because it didn't do what I thought it would do. It doesn't help you download Youtube videos nor does it let you watch youtube videos. I really don't know why there is even an app like this, because it has no funtionality. It may be that I was just using it wrong, so it may for someone else.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|This is another convoluted story trying to top those that have come before. I found it slow and ultimately pointless. The worst: the writers SHOW you stuff that happened and then later suggest that none of that ever happened. The highlight: is Rooney Mara's chameleon like performance. For me overall: not worth the time spent.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I think that this app makes Ebay so easy. I can quickly check all my selld and just as easily bid on my favorite items.
B008JFUPBC|5.0|Whenever Shyamalan has a new film playing in the theaters the critics and the majority of their followers get ready to hammer the film-maker and his work. And what's even more repulsive is that they focus on the film-maker and intentionally they pay less attention on the film itself.  It's been an interesting year in films so far. - On and off, it's been impressive; I have some favorites of my own and few, sadly, that are not falling in the \\"favorites\\" category. - Shyamalan's After Earth, despite some of its weaknesses, falls in a charming manner in the `favorites' category. It's a surprise and can also be called a beautiful work in its own right. In other words, After Earth has managed to stay in my list and I can proudly say that it's a good film with an interesting plot. There are few reasons I believe After Earth is a good film; actually a better picture than some of the blockbusters of this year. I would like to put the spotlight on the originality and also on Shyamalan's method a little bit. Shyamalan still, audaciously, steps forward as an artist with a sense of originality, whereas some film-makers don't. I consider his methods smart as much as daring. And it boggles the mind as some don't see it. Shyamalan's work in Hollywood is against the current paradigm. - Some of the contemporary film-makers, yes, they're talented, but what they seek is to jump right on the opportunity to take on reboots and sequels so they can get their names labeled forever on a famous franchise. And when it comes to Shyamalan, he likes to stay in the corner, and from time to time, he throws a new spear right at a system that many are so used to. After Earth, interestingly puts its spiritual journey within the science fiction genre. Shyamalan still, as an old-fashioned auteur, manages to create a sense of tension. The atmosphere that we find Kitai (Jaden Smith) and his father Cypher Raige (Will Smith) turns the skin cold. Shyamalan injects that one famous sense, which is known as fear, through his eerie long shots. Often, in silence, we see the character on the screen introducing through their expression, of course, wordlessly, paranoia. And we, as audience, sense the impact of being hopeless. But, Kitai as a newbie manages to beat the odds. On screen and off screen, we hear Cypher guiding his son through a world that is no longer accepting mankind. It takes faith to make a Shyamalan type of film. To see and feel the senses of his characters; Cypher as a protective father understands the reality of the situation that he is in. He has no choice, but to guide his son through a world that is full of danger, where possibility of death is certain. After Earth manages to pull itself out with the help of its characters, dialogues, and Shyamalan's techniques and most importantly with the help of its unique atmosphere. The film, like I said, comes with some obvious weaknesses as well. And one of them is its opening shot, which I think has been executed in a rush manner. It gives audiences no choice to feel captivated with the world that Gary White has written. Though, the film emotionally grabs you once both Cypher and Kitai's ship crash lands on Earth. - One of the other weaknesses of the film is its 100 minute duration on the screen. I think what's necessary is that all film-makers before filming should find a pace. This brings to mind again that Shyamalan as a director does pretty well when he works on his own product. When it comes to pacing, and looking back at Shyamalan's previous films, I don't find any issues with the pacing of any of his films or with the opening shots. They are always engaging: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, Lady in the Water and The Happening.  He understands his own methods; he is the mechanic of his own workshop. Like many other fans, I'm looking forward to his next film; a screenplay that he's currently working on, which I think is going to be a low budget film. That sounds interesting to me. Even with some of its weaknesses and not so impressive CGI, After Earth still, in my book, manages to pull itself up in the list. After Earth can be pronounced as a good film and what saves it is Shyamalan himself. It's always interesting to view his work and in After Earth, we do see his methods of film-making. The techniques that he's so much in love with are all quite visible and understandable if seen a little more closely. .For those who like a simple story done with style, then check this out. I could watch this movie just with music, it is breathtaking to watch.  This movie had humor,suspense,action, a great father and son dynamic. The hate this movie is getting is ubsurd. I am glad I am one of the %12 on rotten tomatoes. At least give it view and make up your own mind.  I have seen it twice in the theaters and I am buying it on blu-ray
B009AMANBA|5.0|Excellent film , Very well played by Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. The film keeps your attention despite its length and wordiness. I really enjoed it.
0765348276|5.0|After reading just about all the major sci-fi works available I have been desperate for new good storylines. This fits the bill by having a believable storyline and good action. I recommend!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I thought it was a very good movie. It is well worth the time to watch it. It makes you keep wondering after the movie is over as to what was real and what Pi was imagining.
B001I45UFC|5.0|There continue to be things that you pick up as an adult, even after repeated readings. I did not pick up quite as many \\"new\\" things this time through. However, it was interesting to realize how the picture of Aslan changes in the books. In LWW, Aslan sometimes walks like a man and this picture changes somewhat as we go through the Narnia books. The entire portrayal of the talking animals is at a beginning stage (yet another reason to read LWW first).<br /><br />The book sets the stage for all of the Christian themes to follow.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I would actually give it a 3.5 stars but I can't give it quite 4 stars. It is somewhere between a comedy, a drama and a chick flick. It is well worth the time to watch it.
1781162646|3.0|Thank you Mr King for making me go out of my way to find a Ebook copy on the file share website Tueble . Now I have the Ebook which was free . Oh and Amazon advertises on there too . How funny .  Now I am an honest person and purchased the paperback at Walmart . Which I will donate to someone while I enjoy the Ebook .  Where there's a will , there's a way . Happy reading ...
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very good movie. What makes it good is knowing that it is for the most part a true story. However, I don't think that is is good enough for an Academy Award.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|The powerjolt SE works as advertised to charge my iphone 5. It does everything I need to charge my phone on the way to work!
B000JF02SG|4.0|each character has individual behaviors which interact with each other very well on most occasions. DiNozzo Is a clown and one of the most annoying individuals on TV. It is Mind boggling how the Director perceived tony had the qualities to lead. He is the team bully. he makes negative and intrusive comments to all his team, including Gibbs. I do enjoy the show the writers need to give Tony DiNozzo a nemesis.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|This is one of the worst big budget movies I've ever seen. And I thought Die Hard 4 was bad. It's Citizen Kane compared to this.<br /><br />Starts off okay, then delves into an orgy of suckitude. I can't believe the studio's audacity to call this a Die Hard movie. One of Bruce Willis' worst movies. Stick with the first three.<br /><br />Good lord, this was terrible.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Movie was great!  It was good to read the book first and then to see the movie as then you could visualize what he was talking about.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app works extremely well from my Kindle to my HP printer from wherever I may be. Definitely worth getting.
B008BM0IUG|4.0|I really liked this book. It contains a timely and comprehensive review of the Higgs mechanism. My favorite part was a telling of the experimental discovery of antimatter. I also liked the account of the building of the LHC, the sad cancellation of the SSC, and a nice expose on he great Lyn Evans.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I've read the other reviews, mostly because when I got to the ending...I was like SHE DID NOT JUST DO THIS TO US!!!!  Like so many other readers, I was excited for book 3 to come out. I even went back and re-read the other 2 books (again) two days ago to refresh my memory because I buy & read so many books. This series was my favorite and I loved Gideon, Eva & Cary...but now I am just left very dissatisfied & betrayed.  I am extremely disappointed in Silvia Day for putting the money grab ahead of her readers' enjoyment & recognition for following her series when we have so many options available to us.
B002NN5F7A|3.0|This one was a bit of a disappointment for me, but probably because I had heard so much about what an amazing movie it was and the expectations were too high.  Interesting characters.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I chose this rating because it is Blake Shelton who never disappoints his fans.<br /><br />Yes I would recommend this to everyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A great game that lasts a long time but should be longer. Really enjoyable. One of the best apps out there.
0770437400|4.0|I am giving this book 4 stars only because I thought it was going to be a bigger book. Not in content, but in actual size. My vision kinda suck so the print might be a little hard to read.<br /><br />I haven't dove into the book yet, but I'm sure it's awesome. I love zombie apocalypse stuff.<br /><br />But just know the book is on the small size before you buy it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The graphics are so clear and the colors are bright . It makes it so easy to get caught up in the story line. I find myself not wanting to put  the game down.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I like anything weird and strange. This was a plus in my eyes. I didn't know there was a book it was based around. I may have to buy/download it
B004UID2LC|1.0|It doesn't do what I want.<br /><br />It only downloads other peoples stuff.<br />It is a stinking waste of time.<br />So is this.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app! It's fantastic! It's really easy to use and there are tons of possible sound combinations that you can even save to a &quot;Favorotes&quot; list if you want to. It even has  binuaral beats to help you fall asleep. You can set a timer so the app will turn off on its own. I would recommend this app, especially for people who have trouble sleeping.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a wonderful app. No unnecessary bells and whistles. It keeps me up to speed on the status of my Kindle.Easy to use.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I knew nothing of Ian Fleming, other than being the author of James Bond, but I do now and it has become demonstrably clear as to where he got his ideas from for his famous hero. It's also clear that the author has done his research for this book, so much so that I've learned much about World War II, and what it meant to be alive in that period.<br /><br />\\"Operation Armada\\" was a great read, always entertaining and kept me gripped like a good war-time/adventure/spy story should. The dialogue was great, snappy and authentic, the story had a bit of everything; action, drama, the love interest, and you'd be forgiven for thinking Ian Fleming may have had a hand in writing this himself.<br /><br />Could this be made into a James Bond style film? Possibly. I imagine as the Bond fan that this author clearly is, he's had half an eye on the telephone ever since publishing, expecting a producer to call with big ideas on how to translate the story to the screen. Even if that never happens, it's still very much worth a read. Recommended. 5/5.
B00CTESTA8|5.0|My favorite show. I watched the entire season in 1 day. The characters have a way of pulling at your heart. &#60;3
1451626088|5.0|About the only bad thing I can say about this book is that since the story is so complex, you may want to get most or all of the series then read them back to back. It gets hard to keep track of the players. But beyond that, the series is a good one and well worth a read.
B000005AYM|5.0|ERYKAH DELIVERS LIKE THE PRO SHE IS!....BRINGING THE FIRE TO HEAT YOUR SOUL AND THE BEATS TO KEEP YOU ROCKIN ALL NIGHT LONG....
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Indulge yourself in the fun of a soap. The characters are great, the settings lovely and the costumes something to behold. But behind the glamour, is a family drama, both upstairs with the blood relations, and downstairs with those joined by loyalty to the family they serve. Social commentary and drama serves as a foil for the family drama. There are characters you will love to hate and characters you'll cry for when they're gone.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|That pretty much sums it up.  It's a fun little resource gathering game allowing you to upgrade buildings, and build up bonuses.  There is also a fun little story that goes along with it, and the bonus levels are a nice little added challenge.<br /><br />I've beaten this game twice now, and it's still fun to try to beat your past score.  It's not too hard to get the entire castle built, but it is still challenging enough to be fun.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|As the series goes on, it diverges more and more from the books, and this is a good thing. It's complex, with rich characters and no one is safe. It does deserve its R rating though, so keep the kiddies out of the room unless you like explaining the facts of life or dealing with nightmares after bloody scenes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love spending time playing this game. It is very addicting and I haven't had any problems with the game. I play it on a kindle fire HD
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I liked Angry Birds Friends, I would recommend this game to family and friends. I play  the game a few times a week.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am new to Pinterest and have found it to be an incredible tool for almost anything you need.  As thousands of people are on this site, you can only imagine the vast ideas and creativity and fun.
068484267X|3.0|An okay book, did not hold my interest. I did pass it along to a friends. I do like to read memoirs
B005X5XIL0|5.0|I would gladly have suffered the cold and the rain to be present at this concert.It is wonderful.Each guest is a compliment for Andrea.This is just a feel good musical performance.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love Angry Birds Free. One of mine best games. I would receommends to family and friends. Great game to play
B009GED3HS|5.0|I thought I would be tired of the constant twists and turns as Ted looks for a mate.  But, the show has kept me intrigued and entertained.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is a great game and its free. Keeps my niece entertained on car rides and my sister plays it along with her.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This is a great game and i really enjoy playing it. It's also challenging which makes it sort of addictive but one thing i don't like is that once you complete an objective there is another one immediately there so you always have 4 or 5 missions to complete.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Thought the book was well written and supported by studies and research that make  their arguments even more valid than I previously thought
B00632HWOG|4.0|I do not have anything to compare this knife with as it is the first ceramic knife I have owned.  The manufacturer is well known that is why I chose it, the knife cuts quite well, I have no complaints .  I am most likely to buy another one when the need comes up.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Seriously so much fun so far. I would rate it higher, but I have not been playing it that long. Fun, colorful, and interesting.
1594746168|2.0|My rating: 2.5 of 5 stars<br />A copy of The Resurrectionist was provided to me by Quirk Books for review purposes.<br /><br />'I have butchered many men. All are innocent and equaled when they are on the table. All are exquisite and grotesque.'<br /><br />Dr. Spencer Black is a controversial surgeon in the late 1870's who has developed a fascination with the deformities of the human body. It's a gruesome and at times shocking tale of the lengths the good doctor would go to in order to continue his research.<br /><br />This story definitely had potential to fascinate, especially regarding the aspects that Black believed deformities were actually 'evidence of a genetic code that was not completely eradicated'. The idea that mythological creatures were ancestors of humankind is really quite intriguing but unfortunately failed to stir any lasting interest. It all read like a Wiki page: informative yet dry and oftentimes tedious. I think it would have been much more interesting if written as an actual short story or novella rather than a biography.<br /><br />The best part of this book was the amazing artwork included in Black's magnum opus: The Codex Extinct Animalia, a Gray's Anatomy for mythological beasts. The artwork was incredibly detailed and Reading this book as an ebook would hardly do it justice considering this is very much a coffee-table type book. It's also a book that could be read through quickly (considering the text amounts to approximately 65 pages) but considering the style of writing it may be more interesting to read small bits at a time.<br /><br />Overall I found The Resurrectionist to be a macabre tale that will likely interest fans of Frankenstein and Dr. Moreau. The artwork is truly the most interesting part of this book and is worth checking out for that alone.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I for one love this movie because the character of Bane has always been one of my favorite Batman villains. Chris Nolan wrote a real world Bane . The story is dense and full of depth and as usual Nolan brings it all to a not so conventional ending. Great movie
B000WQWPKA|4.0|Since everyone else has already provided their summaries of the storyline, their opinions on the acting and everything else, I will, as I always do, only focus upon the quality of the transfer of this film to Blu Ray.<br /><br />I do own the Standard Def DVD 5 Star Collection of Independence Day but this is not a side by side comparison of the video/audio quality of the two.  That said, I bought Independence Day on Blu Ray for $7.99 in Walmart's bargain bin.  How bad could things be for such an inexpensive cost.  Well, that depends upon  your expectations.<br /><br />The Standard Def 5 Star Collection had both  the theatrical release and the extended version along with a ton of cool extras like alternate endings and alternate scenes which I always enjoy far more than endless commentaries and performers telling the camera how great every other performer or director was.<br /><br />The Blu Ray has only the theatrical version , a useless Ultra Violet download which will not go into iTunes, a silly game where you find objects during the course of the film and it brings you to additional scenes, more commentaries, a trivia track and trailers.  Not impressed with these extras at all.  This is also the first time I have mentioned the extras in a film before I ever got to the film's review in the first place.<br />Okay, here we go...the Theatrical Release of Independence Day on Blu Ray<br />  VIDEO.....The transfer is really very clean with good contrast, realistic lighting and skin tones.  Though much of the color grading produces a softer effect unlike the color popping you might find in a Transformers movie, the color reproduction is very good.  I saw no artifacting whatsoever nor stair stepping in any part of the film.  The standard def version was pretty clean and watchable so I do not see a massive difference between the two.  4 stars on the Video.<br />  AUDIO...The lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 is the star with great audio steering and panning for both the front and rear sound stages.  The audio levels are very good and there is a fine balance of volume between the dialogue, foley audio and soundtrack; no need to play roller coaster with your remote's volume control.  The lossless audio creates a very transient bounce of audio as it moves around the sound stage and your LFE channel will definitely get many opportunities to work out.  5 Stars on Audio<br /><br />The question remains, should you wait until there is a remastering of the film and the extended version also put on Blu Ray or settle for an excellent transfer of just the theatrical release without any of the extras that came with the 5 star collection.  There is a part of me that wishes I had waited but then I might have found myself waiting forever for that to happen and it hasn't happened yet.  Only you can make that decision and I have decided to keep both the Standard Def and the Blu Ray in my collection.  When they come out with the extended version on blu ray, I would probably buy that and then give away the SD copies.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.ound stages.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A unique look at a marriage that has weathered much disappointment but nonetheless each of these two people still manage to find some hope.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved the continuation of Gideon and Eva's story but found that the author did not find a good way to stop the story before the next book comes out, I was very disappointed!
B00006JSS8|5.0|It's Stevie Wonder.  A great collection of the master's music, what else do you need to know.  I love it.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Very well written!! Even with the few minor errors depicted from history. Now I see why Daniel Day Lewis won:)
B0031RS4V6|5.0|Had two copies of this book in my Lee Child collection but gave both away to other's downloaded  this to my kindle to read  again.  Great read as always!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Kathy is an amazing writer with an astounding ability to create believable characters and plots.  However, she just may have had a few too many characters in this book making it difficult to remember individual significance.  But, with that said, this book was very still very good but not quite as gripping as her previous novels. As a plus, Kathy has a way of incorporating unexpected education on topics to the readers; I found myself sharing the information about diamond mines with others. She's an all around teriffic writer.
B008D30K7E|4.0|Very enjoyable read, keeps  you going to see what happens next.  Reality needs to be suspended but good flow to the story.
B001QC6QRC|5.0|The grandkids watched it from beginning to end and loved it. They were laughing and enjoying the show beginning to end.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|great app I really love it. It helps me.now how low and full my kindle is. Also it tells me about how many minutes left.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Really enjoy these books, was disappointed with the ending. It just stopped. I don't particularly want to wait for yet another book. When it just stopped. That annoyed me
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I don't like reading books a lot but I could not put this one down for a second. Looking forward to reading his new book.
B005SAYRA6|4.0|We enjoyed this movie. It is a good selection for people who are fans of fast cars and chase scenes.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|This book is essential for anyone interested in improving their body. Regardless of your age or your current health status, the knowledge in this book is priceless.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Interesting puzzle game. Trying to figure out which ropes to cut and when can be quite challenging. Lots of fun for all ages.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw Les Mis on Broadway 20 yrs. ago.  This production did the story justice.  Hugh Jackman was superb! As was Anne Hathaway.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Awesome game- tried 77 entries and he guessed 75 of them. Great game I would highly recommend it.He knows everything - lol
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think it could be better I have it on my ipod and love it.the reason i don't like this is because it gets updates later than IOS does but other than that it is great.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I'm so sad that Smash has been canceled. I LOVED the first season, I feel like they made too many changes in the second season to try an cater to critics and viewer complaints, but I still enjoyed the show.......wish they would have given the show some more time............would love to see a special or movie sometime in the future.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I enjoyed this book and the humor it presented. It was a easy enjoyable read for the summer<br />It presented moment of laughing out loud
B00821OX98|5.0|I really enjoy the show; good story, good acting, good drama, decent action here and there.  The picture quality on Amazon is superb.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is great, but man is it addictive! I've played it on my old android phone, new iphone and ipad. Love it!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is really a fun app. I keep getting friends to try to stump it.really enjoyable app.it really is amazing
B006T5C5PS|4.0|A description of how to eat properly and how they will effect your life and ways to overcome illness in your life
B004RKXN44|5.0|I opened and finished in two sitting s after work, before bedtime. I was traveling through the woods and I could smell the trees, feel the emotions of the characters. The writing captures you and takes you into the story. I was there, just amazing and magical.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I LOVED the first two books.  I was anxiously awaiting this one's release, but have mixed feelings on how to review it.  In one sense, the story moves quite quickly with Eva and Gideon, but in other areas it feels like it is dragging.<br /><br />I know a lot of the reviews complain about the ending, but if you think about the end of the first one, there were issues unresolved with Cary, as well as Eva and Gideon.  The second one ended better, leading us into this book.  But, the ending here has more than just a few issues unresolved.  I cannot elaborate, because it would not be appropriate to list spoilers.  The one thing I will ask is why attitude change with Mrs. Vidal?<br /><br />While I may not feel that this book is \\"over the top,\\" I am anxious to see what happens next with book 4.  Hoping for some closure and all issues resolved.<br /><br />Still loving the characters, but wishing things were written a little tighter.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game.<br />My seven yr old loves this game very much.  Glade they made it the details are good also.
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|This film was and is a complete atrocity. I can not describe how disappointed I am in the writers and director. No one was creative enough to think of their own movie, so they decided to make a reboot. Horrible idea. This is a disgrace to the original two films featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger; the lead role can never live up to him. Don't waste your time watching this; it's a complete waste of time.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The game is fantastic, but I can only imagine how better it would be if there were more guns featured in this app, despite the number of guns I still think every buddy should still get it. :)
B00498YZFK|3.0|Jennifer is such a diverse, talented actress. The movie itself was a bit odd.  I'm not sure I would watch again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I loved this game I played it for ever before I got everything but then it got a little boring
B000GT6L9Y|5.0|A great movie. Kids loved it, but some where scared if the aliens. Over all, we all enjoyed the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks the house. It never lets you get bored, and even if you do, they update it every once in a while. I think this game is great. The only problem is that it is complicated to get the updates on the kindle fire HD. Otherwise, it is a great game.
1416550550|4.0|This book was enjoyable. A mystery that keeps you reading and guessing until the end. I will definitely be reading more books by Morton!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is highly recommended for high score-chasers and people who don't get easily frustrated by unexpectedly difficult levels. It's got significantly more content than the original Angry Birds Free and is much more creative with the themes for each episode.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I saw this film in the theater and knew I would want to see it again and again. The cast is wonderful and the story  a coming of age plot only with folks over 60.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I watch a lot of drama shows, and what that always captivates me are the characters. In that respect Sherlock does not disappoint. Sherlock Holmes, in Sherlock,  is a great reflection of the<br />Holmes depicted in the novels. All in all I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of dramas.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo game but don't like the changes. The having to pay real money for stuff stinks. Please put it back the way it was.
B004P12SSW|3.0|Cheesy with not so awesome story line but great dancing and singing. Great chick flick plus Cher is in it and 2 hot guys
0316174483|5.0|I saw this book at school and just had to order myself one. Just love it! I know I will use it a lot.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Acting was quite good.Story about a woman's depression was bleak for half the film, and then blam! a shocking twist and the ending was startling. It was a slow build toward the unexpected... in that regard it was a success.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|In this book, James Altucher gives both practical advice and advice bordering on the philosophical about how to be financially successful, happy, and fulfilled. I don't know yet if his advice will benefit me. I have just finished the book, and I have not had a chance to try any of his ideas. Consequently, my rating for this book is just a wild guess.<br /><br />Altucher's advice is particularly aimed at entrepreneurs, but it is general enough to apply to anyone. Much of his advice is unconventional: Don't go to college; only do things you enjoy; help your competitors. Altucher gives concrete suggestions about achieving success in business, but at the same time he seems to feel that success springs from cultivating a proper frame of mind. He explains what he calls his \\"Daily Practice,\\" intended to promote physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health.<br /><br />His writing style is entertaining. Here are two brief examples:<br /><br />\\"Ninety-nine percent of the people on the street will lick the flavor right off your Life Saver if you let them.\\"<br /><br />\\"The best ideas are when you take two older ideas that have nothing to do with each other, make them have sex with each other, and then build a business around the bastard, ugly child that results. The child who was so ugly nobody else wanted to touch it. Look at Facebook: combine the Internet with stalking. Amazing!\\"<br /><br />If you are not sure whether you want to read this book, check out the author's blog. Amazon won't let me state the URL, but it's easy to find.

B000024C7W|3.0|Some folks say this album is of the most important or best record Stevie Wonder has ever released. I am sure the man himself would be the first to disagree.<br /><br />This album is great though. Send One Your Love, Black Orchid and Outside My Window are great and beautiful compositions.<br /><br />But, in my opinion, no breakthrough happens here.<br /><br />Stevie Wonder albums Talking Book, Songs in the Key of Life and Innervisions are more important than this, more consistent, and fun!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I cannot wait for the next CD from this team, I also look forward to their tour coming to Boston in the fall. Loved the first CD and this second did not disappoint,
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Wonderful series - I love the ability to pause and stop whenever desired when watching this series.  I love the characters and the story moves well.  Can hardly wait until the next season.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This movie is the worst movie I ever watched. I watched all two plus hours and it never got any better. Do not waste your time or m
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Cast, story, locales. There is nothing about this movie that misses. Once in a while, I enjoy seeing a movie that just lets me relax & enjoy it. From start to finish, I loved this movie. I watch it any time it is on & also purchased the DVD. Not one sour note in the cast.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very good and fun for the family but i keep trying to login to fb and its not doing it
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod Stewat has surpassed his previous recording with this one. The songs are original and the instrumentation is excellent. He has put a lot of thought into the lyrics and sings them passionately
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This was a great action movie. It is funny with a good storyline but too much gore for 5 stars.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Arrived very fast! Liked the great price compared to other venues' listings. We also ordered Season 1 & are in the process of watching that now
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book never a dull moment! Keeps you hooked the whole time I can't wait to read the next books in the series
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I liked this product more than I expected. it tells you more than your battery level. it shows you what drains your battery on average the most, internal temperature, voltage things that I don't understand, and a lot more. it also tells me how to save battery, and it even predicts how much time I have left before my battery runs out. its actually helpful. :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever i loved at so much i got addicted to this i always play the game best ever
B0012HEB32|4.0|I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE TERMINATOR APOCALYPSE MUCH BETTER THAN THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE CUZ I MEAN REALLY HOW HARD IS IT TO KILL A ZOMBIE? THEY CAN BARELY WALK AND SOME OF THEM CANT, ITS SO POPULAR BUT I THINK ITS OKAY BUT THINK ABOUT IT... HOW HARD IS IT TO KILL JUST ONE TERMINATOR? EXACTLY, NOT TO MENTION ITS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN ANYWAY!
0865479410|5.0|What's is life all about? Don't know, still looking. Still reading and so far I think Oliver Burkeman may be on to something significant. (Within a few pages he had me thinking about white bears; no matter how hard I tried could not stop thinking about white bears; I'm thinking about white bears right now.)
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. Its awesome to play and beat my friends high score. I really enjoy it. Really really enjoy it.
0307744434|5.0|I had this book on my shelf for months, and I finally decided to read it. So glad I did. It is beautifully written with interesting characters, and it does indeed have a magical feel to it. As children, a man and a woman with gifts for illusions and manipulation were pitted against each other by their caretakers to engage in a long-lasting game. Over time they learn the truth and finally understand what winning the 'competition' will ultimately mean. Of course, they fall in love with each other in the process, and although normally a romance novel would send me running in the opposite direction, the love story in 'The Night Circus' is anchored by plenty of action and intrigue. The mushiness is kept to a minimum.<br /><br />This book is definitely worth stepping outside of your usual genre to read.
B008G3N71W|5.0|Wow what a story this is amazing, it's about a girl learning about life how to live great book I recommend this to all.
B006C67NP6|4.0|Fantastic app and invaluable for musicians. Not all of the available charts are 100% accurate... Though if they were, this app would make it far too easy to be a lazy in our profession!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Easy to play yet hard to master, Hill Climb Racing is a ton of fun with great replay value! I'm glad I downloaded it. It's hard to put down!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Love this game when I'm waiting somewhere and have to kill a few minutes. Easy enough to resume and great satisfaction from skillful eradication of those darn pigs!
1616550414|5.0|This book is a must for any Zelda fan.  A great read, the only problem I have with it is that it is a bit heavy on the Skyward Sword.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Have this program on my Samsung Galaxy tablet and it seems to accurately reflect the current battery status in incremental numbers.
B003HARV4S|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, it comes in a flimsily case but it's of little concern.
0062082353|5.0|American Sniper is an overall great book! It shows what being a Navy SEAL is like, what it takes and what it means to be not only a Navy SEAL or even a Sniper, but what it means to be an American Soldier. Chris Kyle is not just a soldier and family man, but he is a legend and an icon to the American People. May his memory live on and may he not be forgotten. A fine autobiography, my personal recommendation to all readers out there.
B000L212HC|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie of all time, I've never heard anyone have anything bad to say about it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use and I can use Kindle functionality on my off brand Android tablet. I highly recommend this app.
B004LROUW2|4.0|Murakami is definitely in his groove with 1Q84, and while it's an excellent story with a great way of tying in the dual narrative, seasoned Murakami readers will not really find anything new. Perhaps it would work better as an introduction to the author, because while it is surreal, it definitely is not as bizarre as some of his earlier works.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|We are a family that reads a lot together and really enjoyed this tale of persistence in the face of adversity.  Who know how rich the lives of rabbits were?
B00004Y6NK|5.0|It's difficult to pin down Eric Clapton. And that's the way he's always wanted it. Bluesbreakers, Yardbirds, Cream, the White Album's WMGGW's, Blind Faith, Delaney and Bonnie, as Harrison's ATMP backup band and Derek and the Dominos. That was just the first eight years of his career!! For most of that time the Stones, the Beatles and the the Who were intact and playing their catalogs. By comparison EC was a gypsy.<br /><br />Imagine you had all this talent and were open to all styles: old, new, undiscovered and you wanted to explore every bit of it. That's Clapton. In his early career he was truly a restless soul traveling through styles, searching for tone, but never wandering from the core he began with - the blues. He wanted to join The Band. He hooked up with Delaney and Bonnie as a side man. Everything was game for EC. Along the way fans have had moments of doubt regarding some of his choices, but as time passes many of us look back, listen again and realize \\"this dude's been way ahead of us\\".<br /><br />The problem a lot of folks have had with Clapton is that all his diversity created so many ECs to choose from. For Clapton and for any such accomplished artist everyone wants you to play the stuff they like. In his case folks want him to play from the Cream or Derek and the Dominos or his early solo or his blues, etc. catalogs. All the while, it's what about what he likes and wants to bring us that counts.<br /><br />I've seen Clapton several times and been to three of his four Crossroads Guitar Festivals. At Crossroads you get to see all his career diversity and interests on display. He invites all genres of guitarists from blues, to jazz to experimental, to progressive to ethic to rock. Old masters and young, new talent and everything in between. He is to be commended for his fierce dedication to archiving, preserving and forwarding the message, heart and soul of the blues. He's respected by the old guard, his contemporaries and young bucks alike. The guy would be a freaking world heritage site if there was such a thing for people. I guess being the only three time inductee to the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame may be the equivalent.<br /><br />All this brings me to this album, August. It's just one piece of the Clapton mosaic and a fine one. Reflective of its time and, as always, providing his master touch. I've always liked it and find it hard to believe that some folks would give it a one or two star rating. At the same time, those folks may be locked into one of the many Clapton eras and prefer that particular style. To each his or her own. I marvel at ECs career and where it's taken him and where he's taken us. Each album gives a glimpse of what interested him at the time as he continually searched and experimented with tone and style. He is Clapton the Chameleon indeed.
B0044RUSZM|3.0|The description did not give any dimensions and I had hoped my small printer would fit under the stand.  It does, but I must take it out to print because it is not wide enough for the paper support to open.  Otherwise, a very nice product.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I had my doubts about watching this series, but I'm glad that I finally did! I'm ready for season 2 to be on Amazon prime so Ican watch it!! But hearing that the show was canceled for a third season is really depressing
B003B02O0A|5.0|I could not put this book down,the further i got into this book the faster i read it.<br />I judge the books i read by the emotions i have in the end of the book...some times i smile some times i cry,the end of this book was very emotional<br />for me...i cried....<br />I enjoy all of the books i've read from John Grisham,he is an exceptional writer,I read the innocent man not to long ago which happened to be his only (non fiction book) and<br />thought that it was one of his best writings....but after reading a time to kill which i believe to be his first book...i do believe it to be his best by far...<br />carry on John you are an exceptional writer...thanks so much for the memories....<br />P.N.
1594746036|4.0|Great for teens (careful, there's some violence and \\"language\\"), and a good read for adults, too.  \\"Peculiar\\" is putting it mildly.  And I don't mean that in a bad way, either.  This is a strange, unique book.  The other reviewers have already given great plot rundowns, so I won't bother.  Just know that \\"...Peculiar Children\\" is full of twists and turns, lively, memorable characters, and some REALLY cool pictures.  Not \\"scary\\", but certainly spooky.  Not \\"funny\\", but certainly amusing.  I liked this book a lot.  I'm guessing the next one will be even better.  My only worry is this:  How badly will Hollywood screw this one up?
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I love the game BUT...too many glitches. mostly in purchasing gold stars. I pay for them and they don't always load. second.  it does not allow allies or enemy bases to load consistently which takes out a critical part of the game. you get hearts from allies to build units and you cant invade enemy base after you win a battle thus not being able to capture money making battles a drain on your resources.
B002SHD9E2|4.0|the music is wonderful and the romance was good kids enjoyed it  would rent or buy again. The film quality was good.
B001F12J48|1.0|BUYER BEWARE..!!!<br />This movie came with the old 'red & blue' glasses..I should have read ALL the reviews..My fault. What a piece of crap...Save your hard earned cash.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|This is not my favorite of the franchise, but it moves us along nicely to Thor, Capt. America and eventually the Avengers.<br />It definitely has its moments, Jon Favreau makes us laugh as Happy, scary Mickey Rourke makes a nice villian, and as always with Marvel the action is hot.
B000059T1V|4.0|Yet it wasn't his best either!!!  For a 1960's Live, it's not bad.  But for current day full bodied sound, it's lacking something.  Still it is pure Muddy Waters!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best hero, good and bad attributes, for boy s or girls. Great story and characters.  Thanks for this series and others.  I can't wait for the movies.
B000002O3I|4.0|This is 24 of Howlin' good FUNNN!!!  Very close to being a Best Of album & I think you will enjoy!!!
1603580557|5.0|A great mind, a tragedy she died so young. Best advice for reading and \\"getting it\\": Read from beginning to end, slowly. Skip no steps. Accelerate a little by reading the box summaries, take good notes, then apply whatever you have learned to a real (small) system.  Nothing too grandiose. Best way to learn and test yourself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a really fun game to play if your board or if you just want to play a really fun game!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|This one was kind of slow in spots.  Look exciting in the preliminaries, but I think they took the best scenes of the movie.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I really like this game because it is really fun and it is really cool I like when they died
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|This was a good takeoff of the earlier version of this movie.  Good OLD Arnold does need to retire. It was entertaining late at night when I was too tired to read and everyone was asleep.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|This is the 2nd amazon prime hd movie that I watched on my ps3. the dark scenes of the movie are so dark that you can not see what is going on.<br />I enjoyed the movie though. It is ashamed the picture quality was so poor
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|How many different ways can you kill somebody.  The twists and turns were cute,  but John needs to hang it up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much I can play it all day when I first got it I was addicted to it  .the game is totally worth it (6.99)  the best game ever and eved
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I needed tis one to help complete my collection of other Harry Potter movies. I really like them. They give a bit of magic, tragedy, comedy, and some life lessons. Thank you.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This book was not at all what I had expected. But it turned out to be a breath of fresh air where literally all zombie books tell the same tale. Kudos to Max Brooks for thinking outside of the box on this one.
0783233477|5.0|I had this movie on VHS, but since the tape deteriorated, I had to replace it with the disc. I love this move that much that I just could not be without  it.  This is, if possible, has a 10,000 thhumbs up for viewing.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love I spy and this is better because you have missions and you fight people it reminds Md of the Sims.
B005COO1X6|5.0|You can never be so sure of what you will find from Stephen King and there is always something more compelling than the last. I so enjoy his short stories more than his novels. They are more gripping and more enticing. It goes to show you what the master of suspense can treacly do.  This short story was no exception it caught from the beginning of a young imagination and held me through until the end. It was an amazing analogy of what life can be and how weird things can get when you least expect them.
B0055PMURG|5.0|We chose this movie because of it's values for our kids.  They love it!  It has great lessons in it as well.  They are 7 and 8, so we watched with them the first couple of times, so we could talk through some of the topics (the shark attack, the girls &#34;sneaking out at night&#34;, etc)  Overall, incredible story of resilience, courage and faith!
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Even though there are multiple rave comments on this browser vs silk, I am unable to get this app to even show up on my Kindle Fire HD. I'm disappointed because I find silk to be a BIG disappointment as a browser and I believe Amazon should address this issue. So I guess it's not the fault of the app but of Amazon???
B00B2166BS|5.0|Not much to describe; it's a pogo cable and it's literally a snap to use.  It clicks into place and spares you having to use the usb to charge it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I have been playing this games for a few days and so far I haven't had to spend any real money. I do wish that there could be multiple profiles so that my kids could play too. The wait time to build things is starting to become a bother. All in all I have enjoyed the time I have spent playing. A good time killer.
1400052173|5.0|The book is in wonderful condition.  I am glad I found it on used hard cover books. Looking forward to reading it.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for!!<br />Portuguese subtitles, sound options in portuguese, best sound quality, 3D images, etc.<br /><br />No more comments at all.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Rarely lapsing from the world he has created, Patrick Rothfuss weaves a page-turning novel that is so much more than a placeholder between the first and third books of the series.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Found it to be both entertaining not only the equine but the emotional side of both the family and the people in the industry.<br /><br />I was 21 when Secretariat won the triple crown. It was wonderful to go back to that time and get a real feel of what was behind the scenes.
6305388458|1.0|This movie is incredible but if you are planning on buying it do not go the cheaper route and get the first version released on handmade films. The picture and sound quality are awful, seriously awful to the point of not clearly telling who is who during some scenes (unless your a python freak wink wink nudge nudge say no more!) and having to turn up your tv all the way and quickly turn it down during the music. Many older films on early dvd releases follow this trend but generally i like it (aside from the audio). A poor transfer of an older film sometimes gives it such an authentic feel, but it is NOT the case with this dvd. If you want a good copy that still isnt restored to all hell go for the 2 disc immaculate edition, its worth it. Looks clear but you can see still see the actual film film, ahhh I LOVE IT. If you want attemped perfection go for blu ray but personally, meh. When i only had the handmade film version every person new to python didnt even want to give it a chance it looked so bad
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As always, Sylvia Day does not disappoint in the third book of the crossfire series. I couldn't stop reading and was at the edge of my seat the entire time!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I didn't understand what all the hype was about when this book first came out.  Now I know. I don't think I have blushed so much reading a book.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Very much enjoyed this movie. It brought captain America to life and showed the basis for his character. It is a must see if you wish to truly understand his Avenger character.
0920668372|5.0|I read this book to my children when they were younger and am now getting it for my grandchildren It is timeless.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|GRRM is a genius-- a passionate, incredible, EVIL genius.  I'm on constant pin and needles.  The Kindle version is flawless.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This movie is a modern approach to dealing with the sensitive topic of coming out.  The dynamics are real.  The movie is well acted, directed, and the story is relatable.  Compliments to all involved.  Also, it's a movie for straight and gay audiences.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|I got this app from the free app of the day promo, and I'm glad I didn't pay money for it. I was at least expecting a widget. All this app does is put a shiny UI on the data that is already available from the android settings menu. Not worth the space on my device. Uninstalled.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|A wonderful game based on a truly epic movie. Great to pass time if you're bored. It most definitely deserves 5 stars.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Cloud Atlas is a twist and turn story that to get what is happening you have to be paying attention.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is the greatest dictionary ever I love it so much I can look up all sorts of word awesome
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I liked this movie although I think that a bit more could of been done with it.  It isn't high action or of the type of Zombie movie you may be use to, it has it's own flavor so to speak. If you get wrapped up in the technicalities you can pull out some movie goofs but the story is done well.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I think every women should read it, even if not planning a career or considering herself feminist. and every man should read it to better understand what we are going through
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's easy to read on my kindle android when I don't have my kindle with me. thanks for saving me android phone !
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This was the best book ever since delirium I loved it and I'm excited for the next one that I know will be awesome
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This story reminded me that love the moment you are in and not to worry about the next. Loved it.
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|This movie is not good at all. It is nothing like the other DIE HARD movies. Terrible script, too many would-be-death accidents but they walked away like nothing, and the acting was just awful.<br /><br />He keeps complaining about being on vacation but just joins his son like a dog on a leash.<br /><br />If you like action movies and don't care about the storyline then this would be a good choice. But if you like to watch and actually enjoy a movie DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY or TIME.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fortunately I read the trilogy before seeing the movie, which just made me feel all the more happy at the end of it. The movie is not at all able to do justice to the fantastic wordplay that has been used in the book. The words come alive and its as you are part of the game when you are reading the book....the sadness, the tragedy everything just seems so much more intense in the book. Though the movie has just been based on the first part, I have no interest in watching the sequels too because I am content with the image that I have. The trilogy is a keeper and something you can go back to...like a never ending story, you start again and you are a part of it all over again. Hats off to Collins for making the Hunger Games come alive. Looking forward to more beautiful books from her.
B001W9EUC2|5.0|I ended up buying a second, different version of this after being strongly turned off by the English-only dubbed version:  it sounded like a bunch of country-club members discussing their lawns.<br /><br />The original language version (Cantonese/Mandarin/Japanese, with English subtitles) conveys the passion of the actors that is missing in the English dubbed version and communicates the passion of the film, making it a very involving and touching experience.<br /><br />Original language version:  very highly recommended.<br />English dubbed version:  forget about it.
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|Every time I pick up a book of Albom, I'm not able to concentrate on anything else unless I am done with it. I just feel he has the ability to touch your deepest thoughts with his words. The way he tells the story of Dor it makes you wonder if that's really what happened, it doesn't seem like fiction anymore. When I first started reading I thought it would be about Dor making amends but the fact that he only shares what he has been through makes a lot of difference. You can almost feel the regret he has about being the Time Keeper! Every book of Albom makes you appreciative of your own life and its people...doesn't it?
B00979CS50|5.0|They are still growing and still relevant. Ramada Inn and Walk Like a Giant are worth the price by themselves.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Overall a great book really went nuts for what the next book will bring but definitely worth the read in my opinion!
B0027MJU00|5.0|One of the best and most unusual mysteries I have read in years. Flynn is always good but this is a must read if you love mysteries. Arkansas traveler
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun to play but hard for an older person like me, but still like to play! It's challenging<br />But still fun!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Although the movie takes some liberties with how the event was published in the book, it is still a really good movie. Interesting how they pulled this off.
B004GYY714|3.0|I don't know why but sometimes this app just shuts down. I might delete it and then download it again.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Compared to the other entries in the series of films, this one was so so. There wasn't enough action nor good one liners that I have come to expect. Maybe they will do better next time.
B009NFH3EE|5.0|I reread this anytime I feel like revisiting Mr. Scrooge and need to feel hopeful about the human race. This means I read it often.
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|This was a gripping and entertaining look into the machinery of Wall Street and what was happening behind the scenes during the recession.  The author certainly knows his stuff and worked hard to uncover every relevant detail.  If you're interested in the politics of the economic tsunami that engulfed us all, read this book.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I had to to delete this. The ads were ok until the actual commercials started and would not go away.
B004JK61K0|5.0|Installed instantly on my Kindle Fire, took about 30 seconds to set up. It works very smoothly, my messages download so much quicker than the email app included with the Fire. I'm very happy with it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love to watch episodes of shows that I can't get on Netflix. But I need to learn how to loop them together.
B0083B3KOQ|4.0|This app works very well most of the time on my Kindle Fire. But, sometimes it hangs. This could be a problem with the device, but for whatever reason, it hangs occasionally. Most of the time it works beautifuuly, as promised.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I'm not a big reader, but I love Nicholas Sparks books. His books are the only ones I feel I can't put down, even when they take a turn I didn't want to happen. Can't wait to watch the movie now.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Great app and easy to use! Highly recommend to anybody who has to keep track of work, kids, activities on both a daily, montly level.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a gun app for building a dragon kingdom.  Neighbors are helpful but not required.  You can make it social or not.  Great for families to play together
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This time I wish I wouldn't have watched the movie first.  The movie and book were almost exactly the same..usually the book has different twists or the movie will help to explain a little more about whats going on (as in Hunger Games). Good story though.  just a tad boring after seeing the show.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|You're Iron Man and you fly around shooting robots and stuff. It works amazingly on the Kindle Fire, not to mention it's free. I'd highly recommend downloading this app for anyone who enjoys Marvel, or just Iron Man in specific! I wish I could give ten stars.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|That was a super fun game. Full of challenges and surprises. Excellent graphics too. Really quite beautiful.  Cant wait for the next one!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It's super limiting unless you buy the full version. I love this game and would buy it but my mom wouldn't want her 14 year old son playing dress up games! I wish we could do more, then it would be.  definite 5 stars! (:
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Really enjoyed the pace of the book and the fact we were kept guessing. Would recommend for an excellent holiday read
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Awesome flow even though it's from a different company. The sparkles and neon makes it leap off the page! I'd recommend it for anyone wanting a jam up game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thank you for giving me a kindle killing time waisted and I mean that in a good way!I love the first characters new dark suit. It makes me think of the matrix sorta but without all'll the crime fighting. Instead this is crime doing! This game is sheer genius! I loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft is awesome because you can build mine kill mobs and on the computer download mods to make your game more awesome. Also I like how they made a multiplayer mode so you can chat and hang out with your friends.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The book was good but I was very disappointed in how the book ended.  I waited a while for this book to come out only to find out the story is not complete.  How long will we have to wait until the next one?
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This show is awesome. One of the best shows out today. The walking dead from space!!! Great action!!! A plus!!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use ebay often. This ebay provides fast and easy access. It is a great app for shopping or accessing your account.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Occasionally able to guess with ease future aspects of the book, but this just validates the accuracy of such in depth research into such a wide range of material.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|great app! was not disappointed.  love these types of games that have many hidden objects features. will play again and again.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|True skill and attention needed for this game.  Lots of challenges ahead for the viewer and game player.  A must have for all ages.
B00BSBY38A|2.0|This film has convinced me that movie critics are in collusion with film makers to keep the industry profitable. Life of Pi is highly overrated.<br /><br />A writer interviews the syncretistic main character who has a fascinating life story to tell. However, beyond that, there seems to be no point to this film. Life of Pi teases the viewer with the promise of a profound spiritual insight, but that never happens.<br /><br />Oddly, the talented actor G&eacute;rard Depardieu cast as a surly chef on the doomed freighter and appears for less than 30 seconds in the film. Looks like Depardieu’s best work ended up on the proverbial cutting room floor.<br /><br />Cinematographically, this is a beautiful film. I can’t argue with that.<br />Unfortunately the digital animations of the zoo animals were not quite realistic enough for me.<br /><br />My recommendation is: don’t waste your money. If you do, mute the TV until the last 5 minutes, which is the only part worth watching.
B005HSL626|5.0|A fun, exciting and most challenging game.  Lots of fun and great for the skilled.  You have to be quick though and has an observant eye!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is one of the best games I've downloaded. You can explore, steal cars, beat up people, and do all kinds of missions.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great fun and you are able to choose your own level of difficulty.  The pictures are also really nice. Enjoy!
B004259BMM|5.0|have been a fan for years and years! won a chance to meet him and have lunch with him and a private concert and it was an amazing afternoon!!!
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|I will need to watch again in order to fully understand.  A little fast paced.  Good acting and realistic locales.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Nesbo has a knack for scientific detail, combined with a skill for creating blood-pounding suspense, that defies imitation. The &#34;can't put it down&#34; cliche, as with all cliches, has roots in real experience.  He weaves a web tightly, but with enough holes that Hole himself might plausibly slip through. Nesbo has accomplished this trick in novel after novel.  And, without risking a spoiler, this one ends with equal uncertainty. I always seem to reach the end of Nesbo's novels with a richly conflicting sense of relief, thrall, disappointment and expectation.  Relief that it's over.  Thrall enduring from the adrenaline rush. Disappointment that it's over. And a hopeful expectation that Harry Hole will make it through to the next novel.<br /><br />Nesbo understands addiction. His novels are proof, because they've become a kind of drug, a kind of high that you don't want to end. This is one of the very few cases where, consistently, as soon as I've finished the last pages, I re-read and savor the last chapter.  And almost without fail, within an hour I'm on the web looking for Nesbo's next novel. It's hopeless. And I kind of like it that way....
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|A feel good movie,  well acted.  I rarely can watch a movie more than once but this one rates. with me.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. Very hard to stop playing ... \\"just one more level.\\" I enjoy the gameplay -- very challenging -- but what really makes this game for me are the lovely images and the relaxing, almost hypnotic music. The game is relaxing in the earlier stages, but when it gets really hard there is no more relaxing!<br /><br />I got the Android app after enjoying the PC game, which I prefer because I can play on a larger screen. I love that I can play the game away from home, though, and I accept that there's always a tradeoff when you get a mobile version of a game you view on a computer monitor or TV.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|A Fascinating story, particularly liked the ending which made it real and not a myth. Refreshing in todays troubling  world
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I'm happy w/ the case. I like that it has a zipper which provides more protection against the environment. It's easy to throw into your bag and take anywhere w/out worrying something will get in between the case. For the price, great product.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|This was a gift for my husband of 62 years...he loves the music and thinks the interaction between the two stars is superb.  The remake leaves a great deal to be desired, in our opinions.
B001EO748M|5.0|Awesome!<br />Great acting and amazing costumes!  The discs were like new and no skips.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers does an excellent job portraying the King.
0399226907|5.0|This is a book all children seem to love.  They especially like being able to poke little fingers through the holes in the book that mark the Hungry Pillar's path through his meals.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Maybe my favorite so far.<br />This would be as good as a way to start the series if you are not wanting to read them in order..
072325804X|5.0|These are time-honored stories with wonderful illustrations, the perfect gift for my newest great-grandson.  Every child should hear about Peter Rabbit and his misadventures.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This is a must read.  It's one of those books that you simply can't put down, it's a keeper, there is a plethora of useful information.  This book has validated my &#34;knowing&#34;.  I highly recommend this book for those who are seekers of their &#34;knowingness&#34;.  Through out my life I will refer to this book over & over. This is definitely a 10 star rating.
0694003611|5.0|There's something about this book that appeals to adults and children alike.  I first read it to my first grandson who is now in his<br />thirties with a little doll of his own to enjoy it with him.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I thought the series was fun and entertaining.  It had interesting characters that developed and grew with the developing story.  Villains and Heros along with some in betweens.  I am excited for the next book in the series and glad to see that Ms. Rice is continuing the saga.  An easy read but very filled with twists and turns!
B003M5AXN4|4.0|With all the candy in this movie, it steals the kids attention during get togethers.<br />For fans of the Wachowskis, add this because the supplemental features are not all geared for the children.
B002HL3PN4|5.0|We watched this movie again after some many years and loved it all over again.  Makes some of us feel much older, though, even those who were the same age as the principal actors in their first of many films.  Truly a wonderful production and sets the bar very high for the rest to come.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|I am typically hesitant to pay full price for Disney films, but this one is so chock full of extras that it is worth every penny...<br />It's a wonderful addition to the family collection, animation and/or film buffs.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|This is an excellent movie on many levels...Humans coming together serendipitously able to see beyond the physical to the spirit that joins the two of them. They bring out the best in each other effortlessly. A must-own movie! I will watch it over and over.<br />That is is set in Paris heightens the enjoyment!
B008Q00I2Q|5.0|Very interesting story.  The acting was very good and drew you into the drama.<br />A story that will bring your own opinion as to the reality.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Spoilers*<br /><br />Not the typical zombie gore fest, so if that is what you are looking for, I would move on. If you look at the film as a metaphor for how technology is robbing us of our human connections and thus making us &#34;zombies&#34; attached at the fingertips to whatever device is in front of us, then this film works on a different level than the typical horror film. The movie is actually sweet, and has references to Romeo and Juliet (Just look at the character's names) and the message of the film did make me happy (spoiler*-love and human interaction are the cure). It was enjoyable to watch and the soundtrack is great.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you've read the other two books in this series you know you need to read this one. But just so you know crazy exes, extreme jealousy, and hot hot. . . make for one intense satisfying ride. Let's just say that I'm now on the hunt for a real life Gideon. This is me crossing my fingers.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Great job of taking a wonderful old series into the next generation. Strong story line, talented actors, clever directing. And best of all, beautiful scenery and costumes. Cannot wait for next season!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|great app I love playing it and its addicting. but it keeps asking u 2 rate this app. so I finally just rated it because it was so annoying.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I really liked it.  The music stuck in my head and I've been buying songs off the album.  Anna Kendrick has a great voice.  A fun movie that makes you feel good at the end.  Vivienne B.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|This CD is the best unexpected musical surprise of the last decade.  An Album of new material from one of the greatest pop vocalists of all time sounding at her very best despite the years gone by.  The one who made heartbreak real on ABBA's Classics SOS and The Winner Takes It All has returned with a collection of songs that are mature, heartrending, and beautiful.<br /><br />While songs such as Dance the Pain Away and Back on Your Radio might be particularly dance or radio friendly, it's the ballads that demand repetitive playing of this collection.<br /><br />The standout cut is I Should Have Followed You Home--the duet recorded between Agnetha and Take That's Gary Barlow.  The song is about timing and regret and lost opportunity.  The music is beautiful, and these two great pop voices blend together perfectly with Agnetha's clear emotional tones and Barlow's warm ones.  It's a guaranteed top ten hit anywhere it would be released.  But this is not the best song on the collection:  I Was a Flower, Perfume in the Breeze, Past Forever, Bubble and When You Really Loved Someone vie for those honors.<br /><br />Perfume in the Breeze and I Was a Flower especially make use of stunning vocals that have not been diminished with age, hooks, and the raw emotional melancholy Faltskog is known for.  In recent interviews Faltskog has said that she views conveying the meaning of the lyrics she sings as the most important job as a singer.  To her, it's like acting.  However, that the subject matter of these songs could very easily be somewhat autobiographical gives them the emotional depth that Faltskog is best remembered for when she sang of her divorce on The Winner Takes It All.  On I Was A Flower, Faltskog reflects on what remains after a relationship ends and the notes she hits sends chills up and down your spine and all over your skin.  On Perfume in the Breeze, she wistfully longs to recapture the heat of a relationship while invoking memories of a beach vacation and how the feelings of love and time and place are evoked with a whiff of sea air.  Melodically, the song is very beautiful and deceptive of its darker theme, much like ABBA's best.<br /><br />Listening to this set is very much listening to a long lost friend returning at the height of her vocal prowess.  The melody, the hooks, the key changes the melancholy.  It's very easy to close your eyes and imagine that this is not a solo recording at all, but rather an ABBA recording as it very much sounds like what ABBA might sound like today if they were still recording together.<br /><br />This collection has standout tracks, but the whole set grows on you and ingrains itself in your psyche with repeated listenings.  I very strongly recommend it.
B0063M22QO|2.0|The game works, but for some reason does not rotate as you  move or re-orient the kindle. This is the only thing I have ever seen on my kindle that is upside down.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I enjoy the battles and seeing how far I can advance.  The only thing I don't like is the chat section. They can be disrespectful.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Amazing book! Well written story of life in Afghanistan during the late 20th century.  Loved the characters, the story and the history!!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Excellent beginning of a great epic.  The story line is fast moving.  I cannot wait until the next book comes out
B004PGNB1K|5.0|It was really good I loved every single word. Although am confused because it says there is another 100 pages but ends before that
B00CW665VI|5.0|Wonderfully created, very hilarious...Emma Chase is one amazing writer. Loved that male POV, helps understand more the male species. Awesome book!
B005MW8CUG|5.0|I LOVE this album.  I had to have the new set!  Billy Corgan is so under rated as a guitar player/songwriter!  Beautiful album and great B-sides.  I plan to buy all albums Gish through the Aeroplane Flies High box set!
B007ZZKXWS|1.0|This has to be the worst film I have ever viewed. Story plot stupid acting is a joke, and the plot drags on put me to sleep.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|MY GRANDDAUGHTERS PLAY IT THEY HAVE LOTS OF FUN THEY LAUGH N GIGGLE WHEN THEY PLAY IT ONE PLAYS WHILE ONE WATCHES
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Ok here is the deal. This game has one word to describe it... AWESOME! I love it and I am 12. I  recognize everything mentioned in &quot; Fun Paperwork? Yes!&quot; As mentioned I am 12. I am pretty much old school (blame my best friend). I highly recommend this app for both kids and adults. It works great on my kindle fire and if you do not get this for the Free App then it is definatly worth paying for.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|My wife and I were stuck to this show since it started, kinda sad its over but amazing ending, very good show
B009NY43NY|4.0|I loved this series because I looked the relationship between Eric and Sookie.  I was disappointed in the last two books because they didn't have enough of a story line between them.  I understand that they were basically &#34;breaking up&#34; but everyone knows there is lots of drama during a breakup.  I thought it was good job of wrapping up all the loose ends of the story and did leave you wonder if Sookie and Sam ever did get together.  I look forward to reading other Charlaine Harris books.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is a game that I  love. It reminds me of the movie where a family bough a zoo. LOVE IT
B000W07EKW|5.0|I recently bought this collection for my husband for his birthday today.  It was opened three two weeks ago, because I knew how much he wanted this set.  I also totally enjoyed watching the movies again, one after the other.  Much better than waiting years inbetween 1 and 3.  Matt Damon is so good in this role, and very nice to look at.  Great set--I highly recommend!
B000002AH9|5.0|I new about Billie Holiday's beautiful voice, but I never had one of her c.d.'s<br />What a  surprise when  an American Idol contestant  performed  one  of  her  songs. I just had to have her music<br />in my car.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|I have seen this movie three times since it came out.  I recently read a book about Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera and I had to go back and see the movie again.  I was surprised to see how accurate the script was to their lives.  The casting was perfect also.  This movie is colorful, exciting and extremely artistic.  I highly recommend it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game it's entertaining . This game is pretty fun. Running your own city is fun.keeps me wanting to play more.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|love this game.  play it over and over.  never gets tiring.  fun trying to beat your old scores or to see how many people you get angry
1781162646|3.0|Stephen King's &#34;Joyland&#34; is a very easy read and the the perfect beach book. At 283 pages, it's perfectly paced and 'chaptered' to be manageable for vacation.<br />King makes being an author look easy, which it is not. He's so prolific, he's almost easy to dismiss. King is very good at writing characters that are familiar, friendly, and feel like your favorite t shirt.<br />The main character, Dev Jones, is just like that. He's a nice kiddo, young man, somewhat sad, and just starting his life at Joyland. This is Dev's &#34;coming of age&#34; story.<br />This isn't King's best work, but it is a perfectly fine way to spend an afternoon with a familiar friend.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|I was thrilled to stumble upon Third Star, a heartwarming and heart wrenching story about a group of young men taking their terminally ill friend on one last adventure together.  All of the actors do an amazing job at expressing the range of emotions one feels in the realities of losing a friend.  Benedict Cumberbatch is especially compelling in the lead role, showing yet another facet of his incredible talent.  The beautiful scenery is another character in and of itself that contributes greatly to the depth and emotion of the film.  Congratulations to director, Hattie Dalton, on a such a great first feature film.  I look forward to seeing what she does in the future.
B0037471TE|5.0|Having read thousands of books, I have made a list of the 7 that I would most want to secure for posterity if books were to become extinct.  This is one of those seven.  The list includes two books of history, four books of fiction (this is one of them) and one  book of historical fiction.<br />I like most of the Ludlum novels that I've read and I've read most of them, this being the first one.  It is believable, it is action packed and the plot \\"hangs together\\".  I appreciate the fact that the hero, David Webb, alias Jason Bourne, even though he is an amnesiac searching for his identity, does not spend too much time in wrenching emotionalism, contrary to the second two Ludlum/Bourne books.  These latter two Bourne books are also much less believable.  If you have seen the butchery of this book in the film version of the story starring Matt Damon, I'd urge you to read the book and/or to get the old version of the movie starring Richard Chamberlain in the title role.  That film follows the book quite nicely.<br />To give one example of the violence done to the plot of the book by the latest film version, (spoiler here) in the book Bourne is an assassin who was \\"created\\" to kill one terrorist.  In the film version he was a paid assassin who had killed many innocent people.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Great game play, easy controls.  My kids love this game!  Very cute, great graphics.  Challenging but not impossible. Perfect for the Kindle Fire.  I might even give it a try if I can get it away from the kids....
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great app I admit this but it does not have all the updates my friends have and to me this is a great disappointment. But yes this game is worth the money unless u hate building houses all the time.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love history, especially a sexy, heroic and inspiring story like Spartacus! Much more entertaing than I could have asked for.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|If you like Tarantino films, this is definitely worth watching and adding to the collection. Over the top action, blood, guts and cruelty sprinkled with humor.<br /><br />I enjoyed it. Even my wife stayed invested for the entire (almost) 3 hour running time.<br /><br />Those viewers that bashed the film for it's violence and slavery theme must not watch much Tarantino.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I wonder what can be done next to top 'Worls Away'. Is it possible? Can't wait to see what comes next!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I know some of the Tolkien purists aren't happy with the adaption and over-the-top cinematics, but the movie is wildly entertaining.<br /><br />It even prompted my wife, who has zero interests in such genres, to want to watch the original trilogy.<br /><br />Whether you cherish the book or have never even picked on up, watch the movie and enjoy it.
B00CAJP0ZO|5.0|I really like this album.  The songs are great.  I listen to it all the time. Great party music.  It has lots of other artists as well on it.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|Obviously I didn't expect this to be your run of the mill zombie flick - the premise is fairly straight forward; however, I did expect a little more zombie than I got.<br /><br />If you are a traditionalist in the zombie genre, like myself, this movie will leave something to be desired. There were a few actions spots, but 90% of this film focuses on the relationship between the zombies and the humans (specifically the two protagonists on the cover). It was very preachy in a hipster, sociological/philosophical kind of way. If you decide to watch it, you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />Back to my point.. if you are a zombie/infection fan, you may be dismayed by the liberties the writers took. Talking, improved logic, working understanding of technology.. things of that sort that you just don't want to see in the walking dead or infected multitudes. Action sequences and scares are few and far between. And the ending and &#34;resolution&#34; leave a lot to be desired. In fact, it was borderline silly.<br /><br />To be fair, the movie (strictly watching it for what it is/intends to be) itself wasn't bad. I finished it, but I wouldn't watch it again. If you happen to have a girlfriend/wife that likes zombies and hopeless romance flicks.. this could be a winner. My wife didn't care for either viewpoint the movie tried to incorporate.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Pretty much the same thing as Downton, except it's in a house in London. I never saw the original Upstairs Downstairs as I was far too young at the time to understand or be interested in something like that. May give it try (watching the original) at some point.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I'm not a fan of the silly musical type films, but I though this one was immensely entertaining. Definitely worth renting for the next movie night with the wife, girlfriend or family.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Still trying a little too hard but still worth watching.  I like that the Bond movies seem to be moving back towards the more traditional style.
B004SRNH10|3.0|I don't know why I got this apps.  It may have been associated with something else that I was getting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it......this game  is sooo much fun and highly addictive....can't put it down no matter how much Times I bang into a train......I simply love it
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I have a 9 year old daughter that is on the fence about taking piano lessons.  We have a upright piano, but she takes more time with this app than the real instrument.
B00005QAPH|5.0|Many insightful things have been said about this film. My sincerest hope is that you will add it to the \\"film\\" you are creating: the seamless succession of images real, remembered, and imagined that is your own life. Accept it for what it is, and let it transform you.<br /><br />While I've often thought this was Fellini's greatest film visually, but preferred the humanity of Amarcord, I must now say I believe this to be his best film in all regards and without question one of the greatest ever made. I think Amarcord was Fellini's labor of love toward those who needed a more accessible version of his life story, but 8 1/2 is probably as close to the truth of how anyone experiences his or her own life as could be externalized through the medium of film.
B000A0GP18|1.0|I know l should not expect great acting in a Sandler movie, but  the acting in this movie is horrible,  even by Adam's standards. The original longest yard is a classic but this one is trash. Like most of Sandler's movies forget this one as soon as you see it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Seriously, I was SOOOOO SAAAAAADDDD to hit the last page of this book. I devoured it in a day, and I did that with the other books. I've enjoyed watching the journey to maturity and healing with both Eva and Gideon. It's been enlightening, heartbreaking, and inspiring all at once. I've loved it, and Sylvia Day, please, please, please get me the next installment quick!  And I've LOVED the side plots with Cary-Trey-(evil wench) Tatiana and the smoking hot heat with Monica and Victor. Please give Monica and Victor some life-time loving. I feel their pain!!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|***SPOILERS***<br /><br />A lot of negative reviews are posted here. The general theme of these reviews is a long and drawn out rant about how Roddenberry kept true to the science and developed his stories better.<br /><br />What a load of crap. I will admit in the first reboot, the Red Matter was pretty far-fetched. That's about it. Abrams more than makes up for it in this \\"rehash\\" of Wrath of Khan. Just like the original, there is a death. This time it's Kirk instead of Spock. Same scenario... radiation exposure, saying \\"I love you man!\\" through the glass, etc. Much better acting this time around. We all loved Shatner and we all agree he cant act, so I think it's time to quit doggin on Pine. At least he has some sort of acting skill.<br /><br />The problem people have is using Khan's superhuman blood to resurrect Kirk. Why not? They're both human after all. Obviously wouldn't work on a Vulcan in the original, but in this version, it's plausible from a scientific standpoint. Rewind 30 years back and how did Roddenberry resurrect Spock? Oh yeah, it was Genesis... the magical torpedo that terraforms an uninhabitable rock (planetoid) that is not located within the habitable zone of any nearby star. If it was it would not have been devoid of any atmosphere. That is an astrophysical fact. Period. Roddenberry took a giant dump on astrophysics in the original and Abrams spun the story slightly in order to make it scientifically plausible.<br /><br />So you folks, who are compelled to debate the science in these films, better come to the table armed with some actual knowledge. For every unbelievable aspect you try to point out in this new version, I will cite 5 examples from the Roddenberry era. It's time to give Abrams some credit and quit berating his work simply because you cant separate yourselves from the Roddenberry era for just two hours so you can enjoy an entertaining film.<br /><br />I've enjoyed all of the Star Trek films. I never could get into TOS, but the later series were pretty good. And yes, despite Genesis, I enjoyed The Wrath of Khan. Just dont try to come at me with scientific appraisals of the original films. It won't hold water.
B00D739JE0|5.0|This is the version of the album everyone should get.The 2 bonus studio tracks are better than about eight of the sings on the regular version of the album.
B00D2HTRVQ|3.0|I have gotten all of the Dr panda games for my grandson(age 3) and this one is my least favorite. The paid version just needs more things to repair. I'm glad I didn't get the free version I cant imagine how many repair jobs it would of had if this one only has a few. It'll entertain him for a few minutes but doesn't hold his interest as well as the other Dr panda games do.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|a new favorite that i just got caught up watching with this!!!  i couldn't wait for it on another venue.  now we have it to rewatch if we'd like.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|One of my favorite books. I'm not big in the teacher/student books now that I have older kids of my own. But this story is precious.  I'm forever a Colleen Hoover fan!
B00CFQMVLS|1.0|This is stock shlock. Everybody is there for the payday, but phoned in their jobs. Sorry to see a previously decent franchise take this sorry turn. Watch something else.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I downloaded this app sometime ago but never got around to playing it until last night and I've been hooked ever since! Its easy but makes you have to concentrate on searching the puzzles to find the correct items. I say if you like to puzzles and sorts you will like this, even though its not your traditional puzzle game. Not feeling the psychic stuff though....I'm a Christian ...go figure. :-)
B000FBJG04|5.0|Very Good book recommend to every young person to read what WW2 was like and respect the fighting men of that time period

B0037NVM1I|4.0|The directors cut includes more explanatory voice-over from Linda Hamilton, cut from the theatrical version, describing the story arc, but it doesn't detract because there is more action too. A great movie!

B00122LXTM|5.0|This is yet another of my favorite albums-of which there are many; packed with some of the timeless hit tunes that the Doobie Brothers are famous for. Enjoy this over and over, it's just as great each time.[[ASIN:B000E9910W The Very Best of The Doobie Brothers]]
B008EKOIN8|5.0|In his quest to get people to think about eating, Pollan delivers once again.  This complements &#34;The Omnivore's Dilemma&#34; perfectly.
B000IMKDPC|5.0|Great casting and I enjoyed the action! I ended up watching the series backwards, which made for an interesting perspective. I could see how they all flowed and how each connection was followed through in the story line.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game because it is free and fun. The first and second reason why is because you can get animal's and second reason why is because the awesome habitat.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Hopefully we won't have to wait too long for the next two books. Love Gideon and Eva and I hope they can work through their issues so they can have their happily ever after.
B006WAIUEK|3.0|My husband read it, he said not one of his best, but he did enjoy it I haven't read it and most likely won't, as we enjoy different books..
B000HZGNDG|5.0|As a long time trekkie and avid watcher, I feel that I am well versed in both the individual series and the movies. Having said this, Star Trek VI: The undiscovered country, is quite possibly my favorite of the movies. It definitely competes well with First Contact and The Wrath of Khan for best plotlines and general story.<br />Star Trek takes a vastly different ploy from the originals in that it initiates very serious undertones and a very plausible fear; a fear in which even the main characters are very much in danger at any point throughout the movie. Very gritty and surreal.<br />The story begins in which a Klingon moon is destroyed in an accident, and henceforth dooms the empire without cooperation with starfleet. This sets an excellent precedent not only for this movie and series, but for the future series and movies to come. The Klingons are well played, with excellent performances from Christopher Plummer and others. This movie also induces a classical twist, with various Shakespearean and cultural references that actually come into play in various parts of my life.<br />All in all, I would rate this in my top 5 of the star trek movies, and possibly even my #1. With the horror and dramatic effect of First Contact, and the rare epic nature of Wrath of Khan, this one definitely stands out in its own rite as a Classic Star Trek movie. I definitely recommend this film, and the series to go along with!

B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is a great app. Branium does as great job with solitaire games. It's well worth the 99 cents to dump the ads.  The ads sometimes makes the game freeze. No problems without the ads.
B000SEHJGQ|3.0|This book is an interesting take on an autobiography. Mr Bukowski shares his youth as though it's happening to someone else, specifically Henry Chinaski. The writing is blunt - you won't find any SAT-style words in this book.<br /><br />The book starts with Henry's first memory at age 3. There are a few key memories in the following years of Henry's life, but the story doesn't really start until the 3rd grade. The Great Depression shaped his childhood into something greatly depressing. I kept hoping something fortuitous would happen to Henry. Because Henry is basically fictitious, I wanted resolution to some if not all his problems. I wanted him to get a girl. I wanted him to get justice from his father.  I wanted him to become a great athlete. But most of all I wanted him to be happy and successful.<br /><br />As Henry grew older and I came to realize no happy ending was in store for him, I became disgusted by his behavior. I did not approve of violence and alcohol as resolution to problems.<br /><br />5th grade Henry was my favorite. Specifically his interpretation of President Hoover's visit to Los Angeles. The English teacher wanted everyone to attend the president's visit and write an essay on it. I believe that Henry would've gone if he had been allowed. Instead he wrote an essay about an imagined visit and it was so glorious that the teacher read it to the class.  His description of the motorcade, the President catering to the crowd, and the band playing patriotic and upbeat music was simply marvelous. Even at this young age, Henry becomes drunk on his own words. His violent streak also started to bud as he observes one kid looking as though Henry punched him in the face.<br /><br />I found Henry's journey into adulthood fascinating. As disgusted as I was with his behavior, I just kept reading.
B0095P29EG|5.0|This is a great family movie. It is very clean and a great story. We Can't wait for the sequel to be released!

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome. It's my favorite game. I think it should be everyone's favorite game. The only thing I'm complaining about is that on my kindle fire I get updates really late. Please fix that!
B0031RS44S|5.0|Once again just couldn't put this book down, the only thing that has now ruined me for any future REACHER stories is that Lee sold his soul when he let Tom CRUISE play REACHER, what a joke, CRUISE is a squirt and nothing like the REACHER character, every time I think of my favourite character now, CRUISE comes to mind and spoils it for me, Shame Mr CHILD<br />Cheers<br />James
B005U9REFA|4.0|Just as trippy as I remembered it from my childhood! Our 8yr old was entranced and thought it was awesome. We are so tired of all the CGI kids movies & love digging up older ones that all of us can enjoy.

B00881VLCE|1.0|I am very disgusted with my new kindle fire and amazons service.  none of your free apps work.  however all other apps that I paid for do work.  SO WHY IS THAT?<br />Also I discovered when I buy a game such as DEAL OR NO DEAl, IT IS ONLY GOOD FOR ONE day AND IF YOU WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN, YOU HAVE TO PAY AGAIN.<br /><br />I also have not been able to get on any other websites.  just crap.<br /><br />NOT HAPPY AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND AMAZON FIRE TO ANYONE.<br />Linda Rowe
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Even after so many books Nalini Singh still adds winners to the series and this is one of the best.  I have been curious about the Ghost for many books and now and this not only answers that question, but continues the wonderful story she has built up throughout the books.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful in this one and their love is not only beautiful, but clearly part of a huge turning point in the overall series.  Excellent book!
B00785P2QC|4.0|How I like the game, with all the goals, buildings, and happiness, the money flow comes a little slower than I expected. Other than that, it is a good game!
B002U3CCF6|4.0|Wow. I read Gillian's latest book (Gone Girl) and enjoyed it so much have read this, her first book. It's a page turner extraordinaire and she has some pretty mean females in them, most of them not likeable or redeemable at all. Clever girl.
B0067TQQI8|1.0|The first charger I purchased did not have a functioning display so I Was not able to determine the capacity left in the charger. The customer service rep was very Timely in responding to my questions and she sent me a new one for replacement. Sadly the replacement was worse than the first one in many ways. The charging cord was defective and the capacity was not near 8400 mAh. And the display was not functioning either. Colossal disappointment. I am currently in search of a new battery.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this story and can't wait to get some of the questions answered and problems resolved!  Can't wait for book 4!

B00BEXB18M|2.0|Like \\"Risk\\", this disc is a hodge-podge of songs without any real direction. This is a boring effort with only a few memorable tracks. The lyrics try too hard to be profound and the music is juvenile.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|That was a terrible way to lead on your readers Sylvia.  This was supposed to be a trilogy and to extend it when we have already been waiting on it is messed up.  Such a disappointment!!!  The way you just cut us off......not cool.  I will not be reading anymore from you Sylvia Day.  You have lost my respect.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  It 's more fun than using cards.  I think anyone who tries this game will love it.<br /><br />?
B002G1YPH0|5.0|still building the pc, but this is not a part i'm worried about.<br /><br />anyhting from the 212 series will be a great cooler for the price.<br /><br />only thing i'm concerned about is applying thermal paste, as there is no real directions included<br /><br />I found it a little hard to install, but i believe i have it correct now, my cpu temps are at around 28-30c in an air conditioned room.  it will be able to rotate slightlywith some force after its installed, but a quick google search says this is normal for this product
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|very very fun but gets harder the longer the rollercoaster but u hav to be smart to play the game
B006TVQTHW|4.0|This case is of quality design.<br /><br />Pros:Tons of space<br />  lots of hard drive bays<br />  removable filters, front and psu<br />  Enough spaces for cable management<br />  solid aluminum with minimal plastic<br />  elevated rudder feet<br /><br />cons: one of the ssd's has to be installed before the motherboard. i love that this ssd is tucked on the backside of the case, but hate that you have to remove the motherboard to install it.<br />  my case had a small black streak in the paint that just didn't match the rest. more cosmetic than anything so i don't really care about it.<br /><br />still building this PC so i will get return later once it's complete and update
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Looking at how frail we are as teenagers and yet how we grow past that and into the reality of adults is a theme that began with time , but will seem new to each generation until the end of time. Everyone who has ever felt as if they have walked in Charlie\\"s steps should be able to identify with his story and meet the ending with a smile. Great read.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I'm not a big baseball fan, but I wanted to read this book for statistical analysis. After reading this book, I finally have an appreciation of baseball, especially the way Billy Bean runs it. I could care less about someone who looks the part, I want a player who is actually consistent and takes a minute to have a strategy. I'm far from being a nerd, I just think that there should be some type of science behind sports, not over priced underwear models.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|ok I kinda like Fake book but this is a good and grand and epic and epikly bane. (bain) ahppe. I hope this revew helpd IT tOok me kinda a long time 2 thinc about it and wat I gon say. byee :B
B004JMSIRC|4.0|The Blu-ray copy is great, i just wish there were more bonus features. The movie itself was great, Robert Downey Jr. is frigin epic.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Filmed in the picturesque lands of Spain and Morocco, this is a film about the epic battles for control of the holyland between the Christians and Muslims.  Saladin, legendary muslim commander and field marshal seeks to displace the Christians from  Jerusalem, but has made  peace with the Christian king.<br /><br />Balian, a french blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) travels with his father, Godfrey (Liam Neeson) to try to erase his sins in this world. He is befriended by the king and then battles with members of the Knights Templar who would make war upon Saladin.  He becomes involved with the kings sister, the beautiful Sybilla (Natalie Cox) and ultimately takes command of the Christian forces there after the king perishes from leprosy, and the new king and Templar leader is captured.<br /><br />Balian successfully defends Jerusalem, but then surrenders it to save the people.  Sybilla and Balian return to France to start a new life.  Balian's directions to the Holy Land are: \\"Go  to where men speak Italian, then go on to where thay speak something else.\\"<br /><br />Though the story is a fiction, the events did, in fact, happen.  Saladin did displace the Christians from the Holy Land and King Richard the Lionheart tried to get it back.<br /><br />Bloom is excellent in the role of Balian, though not the womanizer he was in the movie, Troy.  I really love this film.  The picture quality in the CD was very good, however, the sound seemed somewhat difficult.  Perhaps it was the way the actors speak.  The movie is long at 144 minutes, but there is so much action, you never seem to get bored or lose focus.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes biblical history or action adventure.  It is a first class production.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is just freaking epic. I am ecstatic about how well Marvel is doing with their movies, bringing their comic book characters to life. The movies place a very good balance of drama versus comedy which i very much enjoy.
B00003CX95|5.0|After more than 1100 reviews, what remains to be said?  Braveheart is certainly one of my all time favorite movies and not just because it was good.  But because it was very good.<br /><br />William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is a true character out of history.  Some claim that the movie is not historically accurate, however, it's still just a movie and does not claim to be historically accurate.  All the acting is terrific, even the villians.  Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) is particularly a vicious and evil man.  I'm still trying to decide who is more beautiful, Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceac) or the lovely Murron (Catherine McCormack).  At this point, I'll call it a draw.  Mel is terrific as William Walace.  It is rumored that he spent some of his own money while filming the production.<br /><br />At 177 minutes, the movie is long, but there is so much action and so many interesting facets and sub plots, one is never bored.  The battle scenes are very brutal, but heck, it was the Middle Ages, and that's how they waged war.  It wasn't pretty.  But there was quite a lot of humor in many of the scenes to lighten the mood.<br /><br />What makes the film especially poignant to me is that some of my ancestors were from that part of the world and lived in that time period.  Certainly some of them were involved in the fighting, though their names were lost to history.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes English history and action adventure films.<br /><br />Five stars does not do it justice.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|I'm a huge Disney fan and all, like I'm really really into Disney stuff. I love collecting these 4/5 disc collectors edition packages. And for me, Wreck-it Ralph was just okay. it wasn't the best but it was still definitely Disney quality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game very very very much because it is for adults but not only them it's also fun for teens and kids.it's a very entertain game.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|We wasted our time waiting for this film to get some substance to it . The film seems to be all about the artistic visual camera work. It lacks any ability for connection to the characters or storyline. Also very empty and depressing. Sorry I rented it.
B00BQ1D7X4|1.0|Seriously, when does the madness end with the brickwalling/clipping of the cd/digital formats? It has become obvious that the labels don't care about the digital format, but are catering to those \\"on-the-go\\" listeners by only focusing on overall volume...any way they can get it. An average dynamic range of 5db SUCKS. Even worse than the last overly-loud AIC offering. Yet the vinyl is 11 db of average dynamic range. Probably sounds killer.<br /><br />More importantly yet, they STILL think the loudest song sells the best. Only worried about 5 minutes of instant gratification listening...aimed at today's fast-food mentality society. Not the bleeding ears that result from trying to jam out one complete release...for those who have the attention span listen to a whole album.<br /><br />With the capabilities of digital, there is no reason that the vinyl version should have twice the dynamics. Isn't that the whole reason we got away from vinyl? Ignorant fools.<br /><br />I'm not gonna go run out and buy a turntable and fork out more money for vinyl just because the ignorant record labels choose to not give us the dynamics that should be in the digital format. It's idiotic to give them even MORE money. They are not doing the job right. The vinyl copies are blowing the digital copies away in audio quality...and it should not be that way.<br /><br />A band's hard artwork turned to unlistenable TRASH via ignorance. SS,DD.<br /><br />http://dr.loudness-war.info/index.php?search_artist=alice+in+chains&search_album=
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Similar in filming to the Lord of the Rings - it brings you the story of Bilbo - the start of the Lord of the Rings story. But it starts the day of his birthday party, so it flows back with memories. It has Frodo talking to Bilbo while he is working on his book and takes you back from there.
B005544TRQ|3.0|I like the idea of the underdog getting that one lucky break.  After watching just a few episodes I got bored with the story.  This probably would have been better if it were a movie.  i honestly can't see it lasting too long as a TV show because there are only so many story lines available.  i thought that the actors did a great job, it was the writers and the plot that I found to be boring.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Another good Die Hard movie (unlike Die Hard 3) Die Hard 4 had daughter lucy - this has son Jack. Enjoyable action packed movie

B00571F26Y|3.0|This book was informative, I think there is some truth to it but question the extremity of it in some areas.  I do think the information specific to wheat has a grain of truth and have limited my wheat consumption.
B00005UKE0|5.0|I knew I wanted this CD because I used to have the vinyl LP's long, long ago.  It was a 3-record set back then.  With the compression rate of the CD, more music can fit onto the discs.  So this is a 2-CD set, with all the music of the original.<br /><br />I love this music more now than I did 40 years ago.  (With age comes wisdom!)  The songs were written while George was a Beatle.  He had quite a compilation of songs stored up, on his own.  After the Beatles broke up, he put this album together.  It features lots of excellent musicians: Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, for instance.<br /><br />The songs offer up his glorious spirituality .  That comes through loud and clear.  I didn't realize this 40 years ago!  (You can read the lyrics and think he's speaking of a woman.)  The songs vary in their style, rhythm.  Some are lyrical, some quiet and thoughtful, some full and rock-and-roll-y, it's quite a spectrum.<br /><br />The boxed set includes 2 CDs, each in it's own printed jacket, and a little book with the lyrics to all the songs.<br /><br />I treasure it.
B004IJY4L0|5.0|This really got me into electronica. Musical, fun, and intense. I like metal so seeing the fusion with In Flames blew me away! Worth every penny.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is very clearly written and Anita is able to somehow put in words experiences which in principle words can not describe. It is as if fresh air laden with oxygen flows through the book. I can highly recommend it as very good reading and education of what life really is about. Success!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|One of her best books. I like the way the story flowed and progressed to the end. Loved the book.
B004JHYRYU|1.0|the plot was so so but the book drags on forever and for the most part is not very interesting. I read most of it and finally gave up
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|First of all, when did this trilogy turn into a 4-5 book deal? Second, I really don't feel like anything happened in this book! No climax, in fact nothing exciting happened!  I was really anticipating this book and I feel let down.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I wanted to like this book, but in the end it fell flat and underwhelmed me. As an avid reader, I love a good series. I read too quickly to read stand alone books. Hence, I read tons of series. The truth is--this is a filler book. It went nowhere and gave us nothing as a reader. All it did was string me along for a book 4. Don't insult my intelligence Ms. Day! I can spot a filler book when I see one! I wish I had not spent the money, and I am throwing in the towel after this installment. The story has never been great, and now I have lost interest. Unless you are a total devotee to this series-skip this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is pretty awesome for pe but it should have different skins and servers.It is really really cool and awesome.
B002SKZBQS|3.0|It was just not up to Steven King's usual fare... Story seemed to drag out with no excitement. You expected the ending, but then when you got there, it was lackluster...  Also, rather darker than most of his work.. lacking his black humor.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|its an awesome game, but there are too many adds, and the lives just arent worth it. i recommend the game if you are willing to look past that.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This app has made it so easy to do things like Quicken on my tablet - it basically enhanced the usefulness of my new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 by 10 fold. Very easy to install and use.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Very cool and dependable......it was a free app.  Takes the guess work out of battery life.  I recommend it to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the my horse game . But it is slow sometimes otherwise I love the game and always enjoy playing games with my horses I love trying my best in the competitions. I would recommend it to people who like animals.
B003QZ5222|5.0|In my opinion he did his best work in early years. This was a cheep way to replace the old scratched cd ' and records of the early years at a good price.
B0050Q3TDY|4.0|All types of jazz. From sax to piano to anything inbetween.<br />I use it on my kindle fire while reading a book. :) very content.<br /><br />Does sometimes stop if connection isn't strong but it picks right back up and is not a constant issue.<br />Will never delete this app
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Now i can listen to my old record collection and put it in digital form at the same time. Good sound quality and easy to use.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Save your money for an apple product.  It takes forever for Amazon to update the game.  It's REALLY fun, but you cant play with your friends if they have updated theirs already.  Sorry Amazon, but it takes WAY too long for you to update the game.
B00979CS50|4.0|Not his best but has been on the cd player since arriving in the mail. Love the long song about monsters walking on the earth.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft for the Kendal needs an update but it is a great game it is very life like and you can build almost anything. You can build anything in your imagination if anything is is the best game and there nothing bad about this game.
B005SDDB9Q|4.0|I have all his vidio and music except for a few bootleg tapes. Like and collect anything he puts out .

B000PGTPE6|3.0|Its ok but not the rock and roll i expect out of bruce. Listen once in a while and interesting. Afterall do we fans expect him not to want to do something new once in a while.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is really fun and super awesome! It's a lot like Mario Bros but I love that game too!!!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A lovely story.  I won't write a review of the story here, I am not a critic.  All I will say is that the movie starts a little slow, but stick with it and you will be justly rewarded.  A wonderful tale.

B008TT7CXW|5.0|If you have ever had the issues with storing all of the different format mini, micro, and really small flash memory cards, this storage case is for you.  I carry mine with me all the time and have about 250GB of digital material with me all the time.  Great product.
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|I rented this movie for our movie night and after it let me purchase it it kept saying there was an error so we had to just watch a movie we already had. I don't want to waste money on something we don't even get to watch so we will stick with Netflix.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I won't try to describe the story at all - I am not a critic, and you can find all of the reviews you want online.  I suspect 99.9% of them are positive.  I know I can't and any superlatives that have not already been used elsewhere.  My comments follow below.<br /><br />This is the third season of another spectacular BBC production.  My wife an I should move to England I suppose.  Why doesn't anyone on the US deliver this kind of consistent, high quality, engaging dramatic material?  Hallmark comes close, but the volume of their output pales in comparison to the BBC.  Some of the US cable networks also produce great mini-events like this, but in general this kind of superior quality epic is ONLY available from the BBC.<br /><br />Just get the first and second  seasons, along with this, and prepare for hours of non-stop, can't stop watching entertainment.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|I ratr this a 2 because it seems to take a long time to charge. I should have bought the original charger again.
B00004TWZF|5.0|I saw this movie shortly after its release in the US, and I was so impressed, but I did not buy too many VHS tapes back then.  When I finally remembered how great this movie was, I was so happy to find it again.  Nice memories.  Great film.  The original director's cut is a must have.  The movie would have done better in the US had the US Studio not cut the film up so much. Soundtrack is GREAT too..
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I didn't expect to enjoy this movie that I'd pre-judges as a \\"cowboy, shoot 'em up, MAN'S movie\\", but I really did!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The end of the 2nd book read please read the “conclusion\\" of Gideon & Eva's story. Umm... didn't get that. It read as if it was a really bad porn script for some chapters. Where did all this \\"Angel\\" & \\"Ace\\" business come about?  The story was choppy and leaves the reader hanging onto too many sub plots. This is not what I wanted as a loyal fan of the Crossfire novels. I can guarantee you that since its no longer a trilogy I cannot equally compare it to its “Grey“ competitor. I will faithfully wait for the others but only expect 99 cent quality writing. This story is getting really expensive with an anticipated price tag of 50 dollars for just kindle readers. I have never been this fired up over such a disappointing book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Almost all of this book is about Gideon and Eva.  very little about the side stories, as other reviewers  would have you think.  If you love hearing about the continuing story of their relationship, you will love this book.  The author was not \\"reaching\\" to come up with more storyline.  Everything in this is new and fresh.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|loved the book but have liked all of Nicholas sparks books. He is such a good author of romance and will keep reading them!!!!!!
B000002GBB|5.0|This was a replacement for an old album that can not go on any more. When John Curulewski was replaced by Tommy Shaw, it seemed that Styx got bigger and bigger. And this release just showed how much. Even though Dennis DeYoung was the leader of Styx, all the hits from this release (Sing For The Day, Blue Collar Man(Long Nights) and Renegade) were all written by Tommy Shaw. Add this to your collection if you are a Styx fan. One of their best.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I thought this movie was going to be really stupid. Although it's not the most thought provoking movie ever made, I thought it was cute and actually enjoyable. I was worth renting.
B0094LZY2A|5.0|This is a must see  movie for the kids. They'll absolutely love it and become enthralled. Ranks right up there with movies like The Wizard of Oz.
B00AK57N00|3.0|Fun enough and the game looks nice, however even with wind and gravity it gets boring pretty quickly.  Fine for a small distraction for a few minutes at a time.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game keeps you busy, for sure.  But I agree with some of the other reviews: the notices are really aggravating sine they pop up constantly, especially the garage!  Others do also.  And, as one review said to actually complete everthing its gonna cost you some bucks out of your pocket!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|if you do not know who Rodriguez is and you are a music lover, you need to watch the the documentary on this artist, &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34;.  I hear he is actually doing concerts in Detroit, his home town.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of the best coming of age books I've read in a while. It's so honest and raw. The letter format in which the book is written kind of creates this one sided conversation. I read the whole book in half a day. I couldn't put it down. I definitely recommend it. Now, on to the movie!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app and Pinterest in general so much! I waste so much time on it and it's a great way to organize ideas or find inspiration! The app itself works great on my Kindle Fire.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|just started getting in to it and its finished they should of gone further plenty of oppertunity to of made lots more eppisodes
B009NY43NY|4.0|I will miss this series but it seems as though Charlaine Harris has had enough.  Not many &#34;OMG&#34; moments in this one, the story was a little rushed and it felt as though it was a &#34;let's get this over already&#34;.  With that said, it was still a fun read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I LOVE THE APP SO MUCH THAT I NAMED MY CAT &quot;ICE AGE VILLAGE&quot; MY PARENTS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS CREEPY AND WEIRD
B00D6M86RS|5.0|I am happy to see this game .it is just like the ps 3 game . Awesome well worth the money .Ruth
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoy this app and it is so much fun. Although it can be fun it is also challenging. Would definitely recommend this to people.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Really enjoying the content; kind of unique in its approach. Working on my Asus tf300, but Samsung Galaxy S3 users, please be warned that cannot create objects, which is core object of the game, therefore avoid purchasing until developer rectifies.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|0When I saw it was free I thought it was ganna be boaring but it's actualy kinda cool:) iv had lots of fun playing when I'm board on my kindle and it's not hard to play
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is fantastic!  I got it as a free app of the day, but would gladly have paid for it. The controls are simple, but the gameplay remains interesting.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Just do it come on android did so u should 0.7.1 I am a big fan of minecraft it is my favorite game on here for the like

B00992CF6W|4.0|I thought it would come with villages but you have to build it on your own. That SUCK$!!!!!!<br />But it is still fun.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Captivating from beginning to end! Better than the first one! Much more suspense and lingering questions after nearly every page.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It took awhile to download/ find the app. And I like the other one I had better....but that's just me.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Not at all the expected quality. James Bond has an image that has been carefully cared for during many decades. This is one of the least accomplished
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|It's A FunnY, Love Story, And A View Of How Zombies Live There Everyday Life, Try It You Will Like It,

B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is awesome but they need to get more guns to make this better. Overall it is beast and I recommend it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not quite as good as the first season but still very good! Authentic to the time period and changing attitudes that continued after WWI
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun and entertaining. Consistent updating and changes make for never ending challenges. Love the change of locations and constantly different missions. Always New things to try and win or achieve. Love it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like the app because you basicly get to do different challenges,  get fun prizes,  and get to different levels.
B0045XICB2|2.0|I just wanted to see what the hype was over the Twilight saga and after watching all of them, I still do not know what the big hype was. These films were very boring and made vampires look ridiculous.
B00007FOMP|3.0|At first I thought the CD was blank because it would not play in my car or truck CD player so I sent it back for a new one. This did the same thing so I tried it in my computer and it plays. For some reason it won't play in my vehicles so. I can not give it a full 5 stars. Music is awesome though.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Photos are my specialty. Especially when they have inspirational quotes associated with them. Love the kitty photos as well. Still reviewing more photos
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel held my interest by building suspense about Jacob.  I liked the fact that it was told through the eyes of Jacob's father.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I love Bon Jovi and almost everything he sings. His past two albums were okay but I have to say I was really impressed with this new one. It was like having the &#34;o;d&#34; Bon Jovi back and not the &#34;country singer&#34; Bon Jovi :)
B009R659L8|3.0|I have read better novels by this author.  This one seemed too predictable.  But, if you're a fan of Mary Higgins Clark, then you will probably enjoy it.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This cd is great to listen to on a road trip or on the weekend. I have enjoyed the cd
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I would even give it ten if I could. Well worth it.  Congratulations to the developer. No hype to sell and that is appreciated very much .<br />  .
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Kudos to Mr. Howey for writing this complex and fascinating construct of a future gone wrong and the indomitable human spirit that overcame it all. The Silo Saga is a unique piece of literature replete with believable characters both good and evil. I loved the determination of Juliette, who figured out so many things and was able to overcome the stacked deck to bring a hope filled future to the silo dwellers.<br /><br />I want more and would gladly pay \\"big author\\" prices to follow the saga further. Well done!
B003U2QHB6|3.0|I watched \\"Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure\\" with my 3 boys and they loved it so we were hopeful for a repeat.  \\"Bogus Journey\\" wasn't quite as funny, but was still good and relatively clean.  Good movie for middle school aged kids.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think this app is awsome because you can do what ever you want and it is almost like the competer version. But the update did not come out yet for me atlest.
0694003611|5.0|My wife loved this from her childhood and loves reading it to our son. Board book is good quality has stood up to his drooling so far!
B00009R86L|5.0|... and I do so with the utter comfort of this well-designed shoulder pad! Ergonomic and sensible for my netbook case, which includes all the gear for historical research in libraries and elsewhere, portable scanner, cameras, etc., Doesn't slip nor ride down the shoulder, detachable for use on my other bags. I tried others and this is the best out there.
0671449028|4.0|My little one loves this we read it most nights.  We have many books by sanra boynton this one is great also love 1 2 3
B00D2CYV9E|5.0|When I heard that Michael Douglas and Matt Damon were to carry the lead roles in this story, I was VERY dubious.  They are both sensational actors but I'm just so used to Michael Douglas doing films where he gets into trouble with crazy women.  Behind the Candelabra is quite a leap but he and Mr. Damon carry it off beautifully.  I was simply astounded.  The film seemed pretty close to real life from what I remember of Liberace and the music throughout just heightened this refreshing experience.  I would rate this as one of the films of the year and would even say it it's one of the best performances by both lead gentlemen.  The supporting cast was also great and all comes together to create a magnificent viewing experience.  If you're turned off by a story of gay relationships, get over it and settle down to watch Behind the Candelabra.  It's tastefully and artistically a masterpiece.
B0063IH60K|5.0|would definitely recommend! Fun game as always. Great App! Like that it has hints in case you are really stuck. LOL.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|it's easy to play!! how ever I dont like it not really pausing when u need it to pause. still play it though..
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Allows you to easily post, create events and everything. Its a must have for any page creator or admin. There are no problems or anything negative. It works perfectly for my page
0393312836|5.0|I happen to have gotten it in 3 days and it came in better condition then described. The book still holds up too, even if it was written quite a while ago. The themes of good and evil and control are still rightfully intact the rightly controversial story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm 16 years old and I have grown up with ice age and really love how well this game made the movie come alive
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's a necessary evil. It doesn't update very quickly, is very skippy, and freezes frequently. I wish they made multiple apps so I could try others.
0307352153|3.0|I bought this book because I am introverted, and I wanted to see I can identify with what Ms. Cain says.  I am close to halfway through the book; and, so far, I can't as she is talking about famous people and companies accomplishing things such as inventions and procedures.  I thought this book would be more personal than it is.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Forecasts are always accurate. App is easy to navigate. Prefer using it over getting weather updates from local news stations.
B006O6F932|2.0|This is way too much money for what it is, looks cool but is very cheaply made and falls apart easily.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|This app attempts to measure the battery life and display a time of usage remaining. The time it displays in NOT anywhere near accurate. It tells the battery life percentage in a notification bar, but I can already see that in the status bar. Makes the app mostly useless. I'm glad I didn't pay for this app, I got it on the day it was featured as free. It's now uninstalled for good.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Try this series to keep you laughing & crying until it returns.  You won't be sorry.  It's easy to fall in love with the characters.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire and it's been a lot of fun.  I have no complaints and no regrets. Fun for the whole family.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I love the game itself but the game freezes and I have to restart my kindle to fix it.  Very frustrating!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|All the G5 games are entertaining and fun to play. The graphics are great so you can actually see the hidden objects to find them.
630587493X|5.0|This is Good movie really child oriented and my kids love it. I grew up watching it as we'll. happy watching
098478280X|3.0|I started reading this book in order to learn something I don't already know about interviewing (from a position of interviewee) as well as to find interesting questions to ask on an interview (as interviewer).  If you look at the rating of this book, you'd think that it has everything you need to know in order to successfully pass an interview to any of the top tech companies.  However as I progressed through the book, it became apparent that this is a book for somebody who probably never had a single technical interview before and who's not very versed in computer science and programming topics.  The theoretical material in the book is rather weak.  It fills only a third of the book.  The rest two third of the book is filled with solutions to problems.  So 170 pages is devoted to the actual material.  Sorting and searching, for example, takes only 5-6 pages in this book.  Clearly no enough to describe the breadth and the depth of this topic usually required for a technical interview.  I was also disappointed to find very few interesting problems.  Most of the problems are straighforward.  So in my opinion, reading this book alone is not enough to prepare you for an interview.  It's a good first step, but I suggest to work through a couple of other interview books that cover the material more extensively.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Good Eye and mind coordination. Lots of fun to play. I like the game selection. Very very interesting to play .
0385537689|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I couldn't put it down and I finished reading it in two days. Fifty Shades Darker was definitely worth purchasing. It kept me on edge through the entire book. I found myself wanting to know more . Great book for anybody who likes romantic drama, but you must read Fifty Shades of Grey first.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Yann Martel is not just a writer, but an artist. Words cannot truly describe how i felt about this book. It was beautiful. Disturbing. Tragic. Amazing. There are many words that could be used to describe this book, but no matter how hard you try words will never bring this book justice. I will always remember this story. It is not one you will forget. Ever.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Come join me and solve mysteries. You will enjoy it :) This game is very awesome. Its fun for all kids to. Join the fun!
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  I didn't see it when it was all the rage.  I thought the story touched on some pretty major social problems that are pertinent in todays society (not just in the past or the future).  And like many of those people in the movie that didn't seem to &#34;get it&#34;, I'm sure there are many in today's society that don't get it, that don't see that this is a caricature of today's society and various social attitudes.  Anyway it was a well thought out story.  I didn't read the book, so I can't say I know how the two compare, but I am now interested in reading the book.  The acting was well done and I felt that the cinematography was also good.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|God I love these books, being a child that saw a lot of abuse thus story hits home. Ty Sylvia Day
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|\\"Forrest Gump\\" is rightly acknowledged as a superior film, brilliant in every way, maybe even flawless.  But it has been seriously overexposed on television, and so I feel no need to have it in my collection.
B002S0KBUY|3.0|One cannot quite take in that a parent exists who is like this mother, who knowingly has a child in order to save another but at the same time subjecting the one to real trauma in her life.  Very mixed feelings about this book and I wonder if I would like to read any other books by Jodi Picoult, who obviously has a legal background and looks at life from that angle.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|This was a good movie. Had a good plot. Good love story. Found it to keep your interest through the whole movie. I liked it. I would recommend it to a friend.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|When I was halfway through this book, I didn;t want to read any more of the shocking way in which the Church treated vunerable children but fortunately I kept reading and was happy I did so as the ending was unexpected but still left me with questions as to what was to happen to this person in later life.  Sad but so real.
B000002KHB|5.0|This has always been Deep Purples Best album and ranks with Led Zepplin ZZ Top Black Sabbeth ETc. I like it but this survey shouldn't require a certain amount of words you are lucky I finished it. I am not in grade school where certain amount of words are required for a report at 66 years old I believe I can make a report on something as simple as this very concise but if you wish to waste my time then I will keep adding words long enough to waste yours<br />Thank You
B005OYKI1I|5.0|OK, so I love testosterone flics!! It's great when I have<br />the house to myself -- every other year or so.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|I thought it was unusual finding Adrien Brody in this sci-fi movie, and after watching it, I was certain he'd been miscast. His was the only familiar face; I think this was a Canadian production.  His character (Clive) and his girlfriend (Elsa), who is played pretty well by actress Sarah Polley are genetic engineers involved in splicing DNA. I don't remember the movie actually saying why they were doing this, but they manage to create two living creatures that resemble a moving armfull of humongously lumpy loaf of bread, one male and the other female.  Elsa spills it to the CEO about being able to harvest proteins from these creatures that will lead to cures for many previously incurable diseases.  This is a drug company they work for with a name I assume is an acronym, NERD. Secretly, Clive and Elsa are also working on creating some life form whose genetic structure doesn't take hold until Elsa quietly slips a sample of her own DNA into the mix. It works, and the little lump starts growing. Meanwhile the two main creatures, named Ginger and Fred have grown, bonded and all seems well, but it's not really noticed that Ginger is slowly turning into a male. During a company presentation of Ginger and Fred to a room filled with a lot of important people I assume, unbeknownst to anyone, Ginger has become completely male.  When the partition between the two is removed, a sharp fang extends out of their &#34;mouths&#34; and the two duke it out.  Instead of the audience seeing Fred and Ginger get it on (I guess), they use their fangs to rip each other to pieces.  Blood splashes everywhere and the violence of the fight causes the big glass case they're in to tip over toward the audience. The glass shatters and those who didn't have sense enough to get up and leave, which is all of them, are showered with blood and broken glass.<br /><br />Clive and Elsa are obviously in major trouble for the fiasco.  But their own little experiment, spurred on by Elsa has produced a fast growing sort of human child with no hair, eyes on each side of her head, and instead of normal legs, she has chicken legs from the knees down.  I knew the legs were CG, but I couldn't figure out the eyes. They looked like normal human eyes and she had to turn her head one way or the other to see.  She also has a tail with a long, sharp hook which was initially kept covered up.  Clive's younger brother who also works at the drug company, is very nosey and very curious as to what Clive and Elsa are doing. He breaks into their lab, and is knocked down by Dren, which is Nerd spelled backwards. The younger brother whose name I don't recall tells Clive that Dren has to go because they have to vacate the premises, and only work in their regular lab.  As they argue about where to go, whose fault everything is, Elsa is comforting Dren (Delphine Chaneac) who is now fully grown.  She still owns the farm where she grew up, so Dren is taken there and housed in the barn. Dren shows remarkable intelligence, but is bored having to stay inside all the time.  She breaks through the glass on the roof, and as Elsa and Clive beg her to come down, Dren has moved to the edge of the roof and nearly falls off, but suddenly sprouts wings. The next time she gets out is after a fight with Elsa, who has been showing little patience with Dren's escapades. While Elsa is on the floor, Dren covers her and with her hooked tail, removes the chain around Elsa's neck that has the key.  It's a sunny day and when Dren steps out, she's all smiles at being free at last.  Elsa sneaks up behind her with a shovel, and clobbers her on the head, knocking her unconscious.<br /><br />When Clive comes home and walks into the barn, he sees Dren stretched out naked on a table with her arms and feet tied down.  On the end of her tail is a bloody bandage; Elsa has cut it off because of the danger it poses. Clive wants to know what's going on, and Elsa, no longer the loving mother figure, tells him that Dren has become too dangerous. She leaves the barn, and Clive covers Dren up, who's obviously in pain and comforts her.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the ending, other than to say these scientists have a bad habit of not watching what they're doing, and they don't seem to learn from their mistakes. I don't know if I'd recommend this movie.  I liked it, but sometimes I'm very easy to please. After seeing Dren as a toddler, I wanted to see the extras included in the DVD.  As suspected, whenever the grown Dren was on screen, she was wearing blue screen stockings that extended over her knees. Blue and green screen are used whenever CG is involved. But nothing was ever said about the child who played Dren as a toddler.  If anyone knows, please tell me.o dangerous.

B009R659L8|5.0|There has never been a Mary Higgins Clark book that I did not like and this one did not disappoint.  As always a page turner.
B00CF2UVT6|5.0|So funny. Very British. A lot like Wallace and grommet but cuter and funnier. Also love Timmy time and hope to see I in prime soon too.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|Splendid little piece of kit based on initial impressions. Very well made, good accessories including screen protector/cables. I wanted this to play backing tracks from my netbook through my PA system- transformed the sound quality into something more like Hi Fi and a great deal through Amazon Warehouse.<br /><br />I should imagine it will be ust as impressive when used in its portable capacity to bring a decent set of earphones to life- look forward to trying this.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|&#34;A&#34; is an excellent album. Agnetha's voice is as beautiful as ever, and all of the songs are great. Highlights include the opening track &#34;The One Who Loves You Now&#34;, &#34;When You Really Love Someone&#34;, &#34;I Should've Followed You Home&#34; (with Gary Barlow), &#34;I Was A Flower&#34;, and the up-tempo &#34;Dance Your Pain Away&#34;. This album is a must-have for all Agnetha fans!
B000IZ4R1U|4.0|It's still as good as when it came out the first time.  I will watch it again tonight; she is a good actress.
B004Q3SGWG|2.0|I won't take the time to write a super organized review, but I disliked this movie so I want to share a few of my thoughts. This is not a serious, or even believable, survival movie. It feels like more of a Hollywood movie aimed at teenage girls. Its attempts at humor fail miserably. The music does the same and often does not match the scenario at all. The character uses a video camera to \\"vlog\\" during the movie. Need I say more? I had to laugh out loud at the way the dude is portrayed as a supposed \\"expert\\" in the outdoors. For various reasons, that simply was unbelievable. They also didn't show how he got his backpack off with one arm stuck under a rock. Sure, it's a doable task. But one second it was on, and literally 5 seconds later, it's magically off. There were several other similar little things that were missed. All these factors combine to make the movie feel like what it is - a half-hearted attempt to make a quick buck off an amazing story. If you are looking for a dramatic, believable survival movie, go elsewhere. If that's not what you are looking for, maybe you might like it. I forced myself to sit through about an hour before I closed it out and came here to write a rage review. Later skaters.
0143119680|5.0|After reading some negative reviews I was terrified to even crack open this book that I have left sitting on my night stand for a few months untouched. I was sad to have read such negative reviews once I started reading the book and realized quickly it was a read that I would not easily be able to put down. Absolutely loved this novel and am now reading the second book in the trilogy. Cast the negative reviews aside and give this book a chance, you will not be sorry.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This brings back memories of me playing at the arcade. The game is the same and a lot of fun.:-)
B004SIIBGU|5.0|ebay is a very nice place to shop. I would recommend everyone to check it out. They have some great deals.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Cool game the power ups are great the characters are strange and normal its fun since its an adventure I'll give this game 4 stars
B00A88FLI0|5.0|I bought this lego for my son 7th birthday and he totally low it!!!!<br />He spent a the afternoon building he had a lot of fun with it!
B00BD05PEW|5.0|This is the most realistic looking model I've ever seen. I know no one has ever seen one before but detail on these models is amazing. The only thing I dislike is now I want the whole set and I can't buy them all at one time.
B00138J234|5.0|This is the album where the Clash began to really stretch their musical chops.  Elements from many different styles were incorporated into their songs.<br /><br />At one point, Rolling Stone had marked this as THE greatest album of the 80s.  While I don't know if I'd go that far, since it was released in the UK in December 1979 and the US in January 1980, it pretty much signaled the change of music from one decade to the next.<br /><br />This is a must-have album, and not just for its historical significance.  The songs still hold up today, 30 years later.
015601386X|5.0|I was not at all let down when I received this book (in perfect condition, too). I don't have a large German vocabulary, so I'm spending my time translating the book (on the sixth page so far) which has definitely helped (though if you're planning on doing this, don't think it will help with your grammar, because it will probably just leave you more confused). I recommend this book if you're in or are stating a German 2 class. You will still need a dictionary I'm sure, but it should be an easy enough read. The story is cute too. I'm barely in the book and I'm already hooked.
0399157565|5.0|I read everything Patricia Cornwell writes.  She is such a fantastic writer.  I would recommend her books to everyone. Can't wait for more.

B00COHAUD4|5.0|Great movie. I was very pleased with my selection and would recommend this to anyone wishing to purchase or rent a movie, well worth the money.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I got this on a day it was free, but I would have gladly paid for this amazing game! I don't usually write reviews, but this deserves it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game. I actually got hooked on this one before moving onto xbox and computer. And I actually think you should. If you want to become skillful at the other versions,  I suggest you try this form first. the other versions are a bit more challenging,  so that explains it.There are only a few cons,  including that in creative mode there are no animals and you cannot spawn any,  so a zoo is out of the question. I have also have had trouble with this app crashing and freezing. If this happens to you,  turn off your device immidiately and let it cool off! Overall,  this game is one of the best apps on my kindlefire,  but on the nexus it is much better. AWESOME GAME!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for when I just want to relax. It is great for kids and is low in stress. I highly recommend this game.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I always love to see her perform. This has so many of the great videos on it.  A must have if your a fan. Miss you girl!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Really enjoy this app. Like the way the tiles change from puzzle to puzzle, makes you pay close attention and not become boring.
B004LUS390|5.0|Love this app for crating some really cool art. Takes a lot of practice to learn how to work the app the way you want. The tools are really cool! I like SB Mobile better! Surf the web and watch videos of people making pictures on their phones with this app!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I think it was a pretty good game. The only thing I think it needs is more than 6 people. in this game you can cut,style,wash,dry,accessories,curl,straighten, and mid curl
B005R32L66|5.0|If you have friends or family to talk to nice app for the phone works well. A must have if you like to see who you are speaking with.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|I was so excited with the continuing of Eva and Gideon's love story. I could not wait to get into Entwined with you to know what is their fate as a couple. Writer you are dragging this story. Frustrating your readers. Too much sex in the beginning of the book. Wanted the end result of Nathans killing and more detail on how Gideon is freed or not so free from what he did. So they eloped. Why did you not kill the story there and bring the book to an end. A second wedding and secrecy to the first does kill the anticipation. And how long until the next book? Maybe I expected way to much as the first two books are great. Sorry but this book has me reeling in dissappointment.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Love this app for crating some really cool art. Takes a lot of practice to learn how to work the app the way you want. The tools are really cool!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's very fun and easy-to-use and  a great game<br />I'm proud to have brought this for me it is really cool awesome and information on horses  and intreging

B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this movie, it was long and boring. It was very predictable and was not scary at all, it you are looking for a scary movie this is not the movie for you
B0000DJE9R|5.0|This is my second CD I burned up the other one playing it so much. A must have if a MJ fan. Miss you man!
B000LB7G00|4.0|The device is heavy, which can be an issue, but this is apparently for stability. I wanted the Laptop version, which I assume is a bit lighter, but this was not available to Australian purchasers. (Why???)<br />Do not compare this with a regular mouse - it serves a different purpose. Use the mouse for working functions, and this device for moving the 3D image around.<br />Functionally the unit works fine, though it takes a little getting used to separating the rotate and pan functions.<br />Overall, a good product.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|l love this crazy game. I never get bored with it. I like all the versions.  Keep them coming. Thanks.

B0084I9QIW|5.0|He is young here but always so nice to see him do his thing. He is so deeply missed and loved. For the MJ fans always a must have anything you can get of him.
B00AK57N00|5.0|Interesting, unique and playful app that doesn't demand much from the player in terms of inputs (helpful on mobile device), but offers many opportunities to experiment and have fun.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|First off, I am not a teenager.  I'm a 35 year old mother of two young boys.  And I loved this series!  I read all 3 books in less than two weeks.  Many didn't like this last book, but I thought it was the perfect conclusion.  It definitely wasn't my favorite out of the three books, but it was still riveting.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A very inspiring read -- I have recommended this to all my working female friends!<br /><br />I loved how candid Sheryl Sandberg was in sharing her life experience and at the same time reaffirming her views with documented research.  I could totally relate in so many levels and found all advice to be very applicable in shaping my career.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Great album with a great theme. Purchased after my  husband saw the show and he was thrilled to get it and has been listening to it quite a bit since. He mentioned one of the best parts about it is that the theme of the album translates through every song. Great band!
B009178OQA|4.0|The Jiro master shushi film looks delicious. It makes me want to try eating quality shushi from the shushi bar and observe how the sushi chef working.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I loved the first two crossfire series but the third one after waitng for months was just streched so long with so many familiar coppied sentences from first two book,it didnt end just stoped with you on the air thinking what happened to them, to their marriage, she coppies el james but atleast her last book was fenamenal and had a nice ending with a good massage but silvya im sorry im done with you, finished, first thing comes to your mind is that silvya day did bussiness and got your money for nothing,
B008846CAC|1.0|For the e-book version, the answers to all the practice problems are not displayed at all. There are only big fat blank spaces beside the problem numbers instead of the correct choices.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Title says it all, best show on TV.  Also a fan of shows like House, Office, Elementary, Grays, Scandal, etc.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|We have so much fun playing this game. It's crazy how often it guesses the correct person in less than 20 questions. Often we are amazed because we think the questions are not that specific and it seems they could apply to many others, too.  After playing the game in one restaurant, we had people in the table next to us ask us which app we were using because it looked like we were having a lot of fun and they wanted to download the app, too!  You will enjoy this game!
