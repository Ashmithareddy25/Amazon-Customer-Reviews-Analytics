0679809015|5.0|Small chunky book with lift-the-flaps that my kid loved from maybe 18 mos to 2 years.  Small size makes it more sturdy.
B0061S0A64|5.0|this app does lack on instructions. Another than that, it is fun to play. I'm tone death and I had fun.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Great game:). Would love more levels. Makes you think without making it impossible. It's keeps you in your ties by forcing you to constantly be thinking one step ahead. Loved it!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Fishdom is like having a cyber fish tank on your Kindle Fire.  I love this game.  I first found it for my Desktop, so I just did a search and found it was available for my Kindle Fire, too!  Yippee!  Enjoy playing Fishdom and learn about a variety of different tropical fish!
B00DAXXO98|5.0|As far as I'm concerned Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of our time. The story line is intriguing, the support actors are great, it's set in a city I'm familiar with and I'm sure some of the situations, instances of &#34;corruption and one hand washes the other&#34; mentality may not be too too far from the &#34;truth&#34;.
B00DSOG0QS|4.0|I found this book very entertaining. You've got to read this book, honestly. I really can't wait for the second book!  I'll be waiting anxiously.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have no regrets at all getting this app.  In fact it is my favorite game on my Kindle Fire.  In my opinion you would not ever regret getting this game.  This is also a gentle sounding game and perfect for doctor waiting rooms.  Hahaha!  Yup - I really love it!
B002APS61I|5.0|This movie was well made, well shot, and well told.  Keira Knightley's performance was exceptional.  The score was also amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh that's too fancy for me. This game is fun because you can jump high in a bouncy shoe thing and use rainbow jetpacks
B005ZUR724|1.0|I purchased this game about a month ago due to a friend showing me its awesomeness. And I won't lie, the game is beast especially for the price. However, I understand that the devs probably don't have enough man power to prevent the servers from being hacked and/or glitched on. Mainly, I am referring to the 3-going on 4 day recent invasion of hackers duplicating gold. Don't get it mixed up, if they want to cheat that's on them. I just want to play the game, but by them cheating they prohibit not only me but the entire server from doing anything for more than 5 minutes before the servers are ''synchronizing&#34;. This has been the rhythm of the game for 4 days just about, and it is quite the headache. I understand the game is only $7, but I just want to play and it seems that you can't even do that anymore without constant disconnects, numerous times within a half hour interval. PLEASE fix this issue, otherwise I feel a lot of Gameloft's customer base might start drifting away, and to be honest, for good reason.
B00DHNB5CY|1.0|God this movie was awful. And I LOVED the originals and Army of Darkness. This feels like gore porn for poorly adjusted teenagers. No subtlety, no campy humor, NO character development of any kind... I'm getting pissed again just thinking about this hulking mound of s*** movie. It s***s all over the legacy of its namesake.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've been following this game since 1992. I still have cards from the first Generation and I am a big fan of playing it on line. Just wish that it wasn't a demo version. I don't like to be teased.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very good. Enjoying this very much. Would tell my friend and relatives to get this app. Very clear and easy to use.
B007FY9ZWI|4.0|This music player is like so many others my only problem is that like others for tablets and phones they leave a lot of music from your collection by the way side.
0061950726|5.0|Review originally published on my blog westmetromommy.blogspot.com<br />4.75 Stars<br /><br />I simply could not put this book down!<br /><br />I had heard about the orphan trains first when I saw a documentary on The American Experience.  Then, when I heard about this book, I knew I had to read it.  I knew going in that it was about a girl on the orphan trains.  However, I was not aware of the parallel story with Molly, the foster child.  While I would have enjoyed this book if it were only about Vivian, I think the addition of Molly's story is what really gives it teeth.<br /><br />I loved the writing style of this book. It was poetic without being too sophisticated for the subject matter.  Baker Kline also does an excellent job of creating two truly memorable characters in Vivian and Molly.  Both characters spend the bulk of the book in similar situations, but they escape the trap of melding into each other.<br /><br />Parts of this book were very hard for me to read--not because it was badly written, but because it was so well written.  The pain inflicted on these two girls is so astutely expressed that the reader can't help but feel it.<br /><br />One touch I really liked was the introduction of two other works of literature: Jane Eyre and Anne of Green Gables.  The introduction of two famous literary orphans was a nice detail in this book.<br /><br />There only two minor things that are keeping me from giving this review 5 stars.  For one thing, I was so engrossed in this story that I wish it was a bit longer, but I realize that is just my feeling.  The other thing--and this is very petty on my part--but I kept wondering how Molly, a foster child in a less than generous placement, would have both a cell phone (I believe it was a smart phone, but I may be remembering that incorrectly) and a laptop.  I know, it is a small detail, but it sort of nagged at me.<br /><br />Every once in a while a book comes along that just invades your soul.  For me, Orphan Train was one of those books and it is one that I will be recommending to just about everyone I know.s one of those books and it is one that I will be recommending to just about everyone I know.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|The only reason im rating this app is to get coins but other than that great game its just that theres ads witch really stinks
B003H9LIUC|5.0|I loved it when I first saw it in the theater. The person I was with wasn't excited about seeing it and of course they laughed even harder than I did..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a fun interactive that all agreed can enjoy . To me this is a fun virtual way to experience having your on horse
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This book drew me in and kept me reading until i was too tired to stay awake. Some of the scenes were a bit  over the top for my taste, but I heartily recommend this book to those who can enjoy a good fantasy even if that's not their main thing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I luv this game so much! A friend of mine actually let me play his phone with this game on it when I saw him playing it in art. that's how I found the game and loved it ever since!!!!
B004UPANAI|2.0|Was looking forward to the movie when it came out.  Was pretty disappointed.  I merely bought it to suffice my X-men Collection nothing more.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Seiko Men's automatic wind watch. Very sturdy, I wanted a military grade watch and that's exactly what it is.BUT the auto wind system sucks. I can wear it all day, take it off at night and by the next morning it has stoped.It simply dose not wind enough. Winding by hand doesn't help
B005NFVZTM|2.0|Movie is entertaining but I didn't really get into it.  It was enjoyable at parts.  But I have never really been a fan of prequels and the time-line becomes very weird if they are trying to make all the movies work.
1885167776|5.0|I originally heard about \\"The One Thing\\" on \\"The Ray Edwards Show\\" Podcast and immediately knew it resonated with our own work and where I was at as a speaker, author, and consultant juggling many hats.<br /><br />In just a few short months, this book has quickly joined the elite canon of time management and productivity books that must be on the shelf of every purposeful leader who wants to leverage his or her focus, influence and calling.<br /><br />\\"The One Thing\\" has been transformational for me, personally, and for those in my mastermind group. If you know is \\"game time,\\" this book is just what the doctor ordered. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />--Dr. Bill Dyment, co-author of \\"Fire Your Excuses\\"
B000ID1J0E|5.0|it is a funny movie about drugs and wildness so if you are in to that type of thing it is highly recommended
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Informative - ever wonder why some companies are no longer around? They're leader set up a dependent culture v.s. an interdependent culture with survivability goals.<br />Practical - because the Great companies' analysis indicates duplicateable concepts and steps which are universal in any field by aspiring Level 5 leaders.<br />Encouraging - Some of the toughest decisions made by Level 5 leaders are being made by leaders aspiring to attain the Level 5 mentality. These aspiring leaders can take heart knowing they are progressive and following in foot steps of the elite on a path not many choose because it is not for the faint of heart but rather for the strongest with selflessness unmatched by the typical.<br />On-going - any leader can listen, take note and begin to achieve. Then review and continue achievements.<br />I'm lovin' it! I'm learning to be a hedgehog among other traits necessary to be a better leader on the path to level 5.
B0057B8PT0|5.0|I'm a HUGE Olly Murs fan and I couldn't get this Cd in America, so I bought it here and I was EXTREMELY pleased. I am very picky when it comes to the condition of the cd and it's case. I was really worried to buy it online, but I couldn't get it anywhere else. I was very happy with my buy and will probably buy here again.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Highly recommend this quick read into the works and life of Tesla, but, more importantly, what Tesla' s life-path has to teach you.
B00CABLXU8|5.0|The shipping came on time, the cd had absolutely NO scratches(I cannot stand it when they have scratches or are broken). It was a great buy!
B000HX499S|5.0|a great girls movie to watch no matter how old it is, always nice to watch in whatever mood im in.
B00BZ5RTOY|3.0|Bought the album because I loved the songs 'trick don't kill my vibe' and 'swimming pools'. It's not a bad album but it has to grow on me.
B0068RQ85K|5.0|I saw this on a YouTube video for how to coil wire and for such a small price, I thought why not?  Well you can have loads of fun with this.  It's easy to use and although it does one simple thing, it does it well.  I was quickly able to learn how to use and within minutes had produced some cool looking coils.  By following some instructions on YouTube I was able to put coils on top of coils and made some fun earrings in a few minutes.  I recommend you practice using artistic wire until you get the hang of it.  Coiling eats up wire super fast so if you use silver or gold filled you will yourself with a small compact item that took up a lot of wire to make.  I recommend going to Auntie's Beads and looking at the video links she has on YouTube for some great instructions on how to use the gizmo.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun im sure everyone will like it and its good for the entire family a must have for everyone
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book has truly opened our eyes to see how our spouse needs a specific love language.  The first two years of our marriage has been challenging and I'm so thankful that this book was put into our lives.  Our &#34;love tanks&#34; will never be the same from this point on! If you are newly married or if you are one that has been married for thirty five or more years, this book will refresh your vision on how you look at love.  Love is a choice that we make every day. Once you learn your spouses love language and you express that to them, your relationship will never be the same. Thank you Dr. Chapman for writing an honest and down to earth book that every couple could relate to.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Kik is a awesome texting app the only thing I don't like is that u can't send videos otherwise it is a awesome app
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|AWESOME ... for people who likes to watch scary stories<br />Like season one too and I can't wait until the third one come out
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy this app very much.  Use in to help pass the time during long drives and when I'm bored and need something to do.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|What can I say about Game of Thrones? Exciting, different, frustrating, creative, edgy....the writing is first rate, the costumes are incredible. The actors amazing. The storyline...wow, what a story!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|when I don't have my laptop with me.  It allows me to check up on the latest with my friends
B00B7Y0206|4.0|its works good and loads fast its good for being free and i liked it so i think its a good app
B005K0HDGE|4.0|unusual premise for a novel.  Good Stephen King.  It reminds me of his earlier novels which I really enjoyed over the years.
0375842209|5.0|I'm not a sappy person, but this book made me laugh and cry at many points. I usually wish there was a sequel to a book but this one was just right. perfect if I must say...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is  one of the best games ever there's an update every month which i think is awesome ! Also its a good game for kids and it excersises thumbs lol
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game!  I got it for free, but easily would have paid for it!  And the update rocks.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is a fantastic series.  The only problem is that it ended too soon.  I love each and every character and the acting is really good.<br /> I just love to watch and read about this period in time  and wish there were more like it.  Because of the T.V. series I have ordered the books and can't wait for them to arrive.
B004IS0PZ0|3.0|I wished I would have gone up one size over what I normally wear.  After wearing these the first couple of times, I got a blister from the canvas material on one of my feet.  It could have just been that this pair had a flaw, or it could have been caused by the fit.  Anyway, a bandaid made it toulerable.  Don't get me wrong, my foot wasn't crammed into them.  They were fine length wise, but I think going a size bigger would have worked better for me so I recommend you consider that when purchasing.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|After playing the original game for a few years, I purchased the new version with the hope it would be as entertaining. Much to my pleasure I find that I enjoy the new version just as much as I do the other.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|I will not work on a kindle fire64 gb<br />After I downloaded it it did not showed up I called Amazon talked to a tec and they told me it will not work on a kindle<br />Why did they put in on line?
0060930349|2.0|The further I read in the book, the more I realized that Johnson's history of (some) American people was a glossing over of facts in order to create a fictionalized history of his imagination.  An ultra-conservative, often reactionary, faux-libertarian view of these United States.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great escape from the current movie trends of vampires, foul mouthed so called comedies, and borderline  and sometimes &#34;in your face&#34; vulgarity served on a regular basis!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game, wish there was more in the free version, but a fun way to spend some time when I can.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you're tired of violence and blood and in your face moral-less t.v. shows, and want to view an unfolding, well told story that invokes a range of emotions, then Downton Abby is the show to watch. Not only are the stories well told, I love, love, love the costumes.
1594746036|3.0|This book is about children who all have supernatural powers and are stuck in a time loop where they repeat the same day over and over.  Really?  When a story is so far out there it is a waste of time for me to read it.  I give it 3 star because it is written well but this type of fantasy story isn't for me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to the (all too soon) end. I can't wait for the next installment.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|I tried this and I feel great --- I'm not saying you have to eat like this the rest of your life but if you periodically go on this diet it will help you. If you choose to change your life style and adhere to this way of eating all the better.
B0053O89XI|5.0|At some point a comedy this basic could just become cookie-cutter...with recycled material from older seasons or new ideas that just seem phoned in. The Big Bang Theory hasn't yet reached that point. Another 24 episodes of nerd-tastic greatness. Includes the show's 100th Episode as well as the hilarious wedding of Howard and Bernadette.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Read all of the books, more than once, and found that I did not have the Half Blood Prince DVD.  Now I do.  All of the series are very exciting and well worth watching more than once.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I can spend hours playing this and never get bored or tired.My biggest problem with this game is putting it down.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Clean, family movie with great humor. A must own movie that is great for family night or even a date night with the spouse :)
B000OLROWC|4.0|The first time I watched The Karate Kid was as a shy 10 year old. Needless to say, this movie is one of the most touching and enthralling stories of friendship and courage.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Great movie and effects.i was very surprised how good this movie was.pretty cool to see a second stringer blow most of the big namers out quality wise.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|An enjoyable love story about how love can conquer even the most challenged and dysfunctional families and relationships. Worth the time.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is pretty entertaining, I'd recommend it to anyone looking to kill some time while exercising his/her baincells!!! Definitively a good purchase.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Fun game and yeah its like diablo. But how can you update? Because in my friends ew2, there are two characters to choose from.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I recommend this movie to everyone.  I think you will enjoy it as much as I did.  It is well worth the price.
B008PNBU30|5.0|Highly recommend this CD.  I like every single song on here.  Very glad that I bought this album.  You should buy it also.
B004UID2LC|4.0|The thing you have to remember is that it works well with the factory setting version of YouTube. The updated version gives this app problems
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing it is so fun to play when you are 10 years old I love  the rainbow unicorn it is white and rainbow it is so cool
B00821OX98|4.0|It might not be the best show ever, but it catches you with the feelings from time to time. Decent
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I watch this movie over and over again. I can't explain why but I have others I do the same with. I watch other movies also but there are some I just come back to and The Lincoln Lawyer is one of them.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works great on my Samsung galaxy tab 3. The adds are not very invasive.  I'm very happy with this app.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Love this movie, it was hilarious!! I would recommend it to all my friends. Is a must watch movie. Lol
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|If you haven't seen the Avengers, where have you been?<br />Joss Whedon (my hero) has done an incredible job with Stan Lee, of grouping together super hero's that work enjoy working  solo.<br />They are ultimately united by the death of one man, and  together they save Manhattan (of course) and the world.  As always, the characters are straight from the comic, with idiosyncrasy's true fans will appreciate.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|graphics are cool-puzzles are very challenging, I would recommend to friends and family, thank goodness the game is free or I would not play it
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really loved this book. It takes on such a realistic aspect of a Zombie apocalypse, that I sometimes had to tell myself that this didnt happen. It is very informative, and makes the whole scenario make sense.<br />There were parts of it that were less exciting than others, some of the military chapters for example. But as a whole it's great.<br />I like the fact that there is no 'main character'. It is just a collection of interviews with people who survived the war.<br />I highly recommend this book to any zombie-fan!
0802473156|5.0|This book will improve how you communicate with your spouse.Speak their language and  open the door to understanding respecting and loving your spouse
B001N3GUIE|5.0|It's what I consider to be the grand-daddy of modern Sci-Fi.  Great special effects for the time and plausible plot.  My only disappointment was the inevitable destruction of the planet.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Great game till I got to level 23 now it won,t load and keeps on saying server is not responding and you can't turn it off.
0307887448|5.0|This is one of those books I just happened to stumble upon in the Amazon top sci-fi list and picked up because the summary seemed interesting...but holy **** I had no idea how incredibly epic this book would actually be!  From start to finish I couldn't put it down, i mean this book has everything I could ever dream of wanting all in one package.  Its got 80's pop culture from VR gaming, 8-bit gaming, 80's classic rock, 80's sci-fi film to anime, romance, and even the BTTF Delorean!  This book def has a permanent spot on my top ten of all time.  As a software engineer and have always been a computer geek and Cline just hit all the right spots from start to finish and even made me tear up at times with the endless references to 80's pop culture as well as classic themes in computer science and gaming.  Get this book now and start studying the Almanac...before the Sixers get their hands it...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this app it's so much fun and so easy to play even my baby cousin who's 2 loves this game. The only bad part is the loading it takes a few minutes but the game is definatley AWESOME glad it's free if it wasn't I would still buy it totally worth 5 stars
B004HWYTP4|3.0|While Red was full of A-list stars and action, it some how missed the mark on being a really great action comedy. A confusing plot and a couple of lulls throughout the movie left it a little flat!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is very fun and is amazing I like the game a lot it is so interesting my sister likes it to
B00DSY8D36|1.0|I bought this Android App because I have worked with the iOS version a lot (on my iPhone). It wasn't quite as good as Good Reader (which I use on my iPad and has Dropbox SYNC!) but the iOS version is one of the better PDF annotating apps for iOS. And I have tried many PDF apps on both platforms before.<br />Since they advertise  \\"PDF Max is the 5-star rated, full-featured PDF reader used by millions of iPhone/iPad users world-wide and now available for Android\\"  I was happy to get at least that much PDF functionality for my Android device and went ahead and bought it.<br /><br />BUT BOY, WAS I DISSAPPOINTED!<br /><br />A lot of things that made it great on iOS are simply not there or don't work properrly:<br /><br />- NO TABS for multiple open documents!<br />- Poor file browser which quits when you try to open a document that is located deeply within your folder structure<br />- Slow rendering of certain PDFs (in comparison to the iOS app BUT ALSO IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER ANDROID APPS such as Adobe Reader, RepligoPDF Reader, ezPDF Reader Foxit Mobile PDF etc...<br />- When you select the freehand annotating tool and set its opacity to anything other than 100% it seems to work but after saving it it will be back to 100% and therefore cover any text / element you really wanted to be visible<br />- No step-by-step undo button during highlighting and other annotating tools<br />- Undo button on freehand annotating tool doesn't work most of the time.<br />- Frequent crashes of the app when working with larger size PDFs<br />- Problem locating the annotations correctly created by other PDF application such as EZ PDF.<br />- Lack the ability to adjust font size for typed notes.<br /><br />For anyone that has professionally used the iOS version (or the all time best GoodReader app) this app is unacceptable!<br />It is so not comparable that I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK and if the app would have been advertised in such a way on the Apple App store they would have reimbursed me!<br />Again, even if they advertise it this way, THE ANDROID VERSION IS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE iOS VERSION!<br />In my opinion it is simply NOT READY FOR PROFESSIONAL USE !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I know you should play this game because it is the best of all time of my favorite and I think you should play this game
B0077SGMXM|4.0|The game's not very complex but it will keep you entertained. The physics can be frustrating at times. Worthwhile overall.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|His guitar is part of him, well worn and explored, showing on it's face the travels of creativity and mastery of this artist. Outstanding!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|The second-season really gets you into the story-line. Try to get these as inexpensively as you can, the seasons aren't very long, but they are compelling drama.
B004CS7R70|5.0|Ordered on July 22nd and received on aug 1st. Very fast shipment. The glasses seem good. I guess will write more once my dad uses them more and gives me more feedback.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Season One does a good job of completely pulling you into the story-line. Starts out a little slow, but wow-- check out everyone smoking & drinking everywhere! Great Period story-telling & presentation. The episode count per season is a little slim these days, but definitely worth it on-sale.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|Such a great movie, one of my favorite animated movies. I actually bought the dvd just to watch it some more.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is really good .also it is really fun .the game is also fun. It is the best thing I ever played

B002YCVWXQ|5.0|Not as gory as some of his work, but certainly as funny. Easy to recommend to his fans. Great casting.
B004S5FW1U|5.0|Fantastic book - couldn't put it down, made me cry, think and laugh out loud frequently - thoroughly recommend it!!
B003B96AOW|5.0|Awesome, bigger and more detailed than what I expected! Glad I bought it!<br />Absolutely worth it every penny!<br /><br />Recommend it!
B005NK69ZC|4.0|this book was just what I expected it to be - an interesting and funny read, definitely recommend this book
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I just couldn't book this book down. It was simply delightful. Funny, whimsical and just an all round good read. Well done Graeme. Look forward to reading more by you.
B00499NHLC|3.0|Bland comes to mind, if you like Dr. Who over Star Trek then you'll like Sherlock over Elementary. I prefer a Robert Downey Jr or anyone over these characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is the best horse game ever i love it. If you are looking for a horse game this it it. You take care of a horse just like you would in real life.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|What better way to get information about formatting for Kindle than from Amazon! Straight from the horse's mouth. Feel more confident about getting it right with this information. Thanks
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If my granddaughter likes it, so do I.  It makes you think, and the further you go, the harder it is
B0064X7FVE|3.0|There is too much junk around it,'re: earning prizes. I want clear weather and long term forecast.<br /> I liked it initially until all this other material blocked my view. I do not want a game, just clear and simple weather.<br />The warnings text to me, I have appreciated.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just enough steps to keep you interested. Not so many that it's frustrating. A fun way to pass the time.
B008JEJN8Y|5.0|Hi ho hi ho it's off to work I go, in my comfortable crocs, ain't wearin' no socks, hi ho hi ho.  I wear them to work then change into my work boots.  After work it is nice to put my tired feet into a shoe that fits well and is super comfy.  Nice feel and good look.
0385347774|4.0|The book is well organized and a tightly-plotted novel.<br />This book's psychological description of its main characters is outstanding.<br />It is an amazing story.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Call me twisted, but this is by far my favorite book by Flynn. I have read all three of her novels and this one took me to a dark place I was craving to go. The ending is as happy an ending as I think you will get from Flynn. I love the way she weaves her tales. I will admit this book is not for everyone, but it was perfect for me.
1401322786|5.0|This book will keep your attention. It is a quick read and a fun escape and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a very challenging and clever game. I really enjoyed this and look forward to more games like this!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Total high school drama! I finished the first two season's in 2 weeks.  I'm looking forward to watching the third season!
B00CFA225Y|5.0|its good for a few watching, the ending wasnt very needed but they (hollywood) needs the big cgi battle at the end. they didnt stray to far from what i remember. all in all good stuff
B00946WM6Q|5.0|The movie is action packed. Beautifully filmed in beautiful locations in many parts of the world. Well directed and acted.
B008469DGY|5.0|Once you get the hang of this game you will be able to challenge your self and have fun for hours. The graphics are great and the game is easy to play! Love it!
B0031RS4V6|4.0|great read,  but not quite up to the standard of all the others,<br /> there seemed to be something missing ,  still love Jack.
B000B8L6LI|5.0|If you don't want to free hand on bench stones, this kit is for you. I would recommend however buying the 5 piece set, as the black extra coarse and yellow ceramic stone are essential to this kit. This will give you a semi polished edge, but stropping is a must for that mirror shaving sharp finish. This 3 piece kit puts a wicked edge on my kershaw leek. This kit is a must have for a quick touch up.<br /><br />One thing that should be mentioned is that it is not as easy to find the  existing angle on your knifes edge. you will likely have to crate a new one, or fiddle around a tiny bit.<br /><br />All in all, this kit will keep your knives sharp and ready for anything.<br /><br />One tip, don't use the included honing oil, use water, because if you run out of the oil you wont be able to use water as a back up, it will just bead up and slide off. USE WATER!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Amazing book,  lot of reading but worth the effort<br /><br />Very interesting from a historical point of view<br /><br /> very informative and ingrossing
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is super realistic and not only that, it's great how the game itself is free! It's fun to play if you really love horses. If you can't afford a real horse, you can always get this game and have your very own virtual horse.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|this is something that you have to see and hear for yourself. I remember when i first heard about it i was skeptical. it's just something that you have to see and hear for yourself. the shipping was great..
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|very good game,contains a lot of elements that you usually don't find in the other games. is worth the fee.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|Halle berry does a great job in bringing this story to life. I don't think that any other actress could have done it better. Robert downey jr and what's his name...Charles Dutton i believe did good and so did the other guy(can't think of his name) This movie will keep you interested. Penelope cruz was great too, and the shipping was fast as well. I watch this movie all the time now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game!!!!fun and very addicting...I love this game...if you have not played this game you should....it really makes you think.
B001VLBDD0|4.0|I seen the first movie when I was pretty young, and it seemed like a long time before the sequel came out after the original. It was a great movie. It's too bad that Edward furlong didn't really have an acting career after this movie. He played the part well. I have all the terminator movies except for salvation. I really didn't liked that movie. It was such a shame too being that all the others before were good movies. the shipping on this movie was fast, so that was a plus. overall  I give it four stars; very rarely do I give five star reviews. I ordered this movie to complete my set, with the exception of salvation of course. I had it on vhs but all the others i owned were on dvd.
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|With a new story line and amazing amounts of jaw dropping gore this may be the best horror remake of all time.
B000HT386M|4.0|Adam Sandler movies that i liked but didn't like a whole lot. Of course I love Kate and walkin, they always do a good job. It's just of course not realistic, but it is funny. shipping was fine. It got here fast.
B00BG4UWPC|4.0|Although not as good as Phoenix's previous album (no surprise; hard to follow up a great album like that) it still is a great album nonetheless.  More melancholy than Wolfgang, it still has the same energy in the lyrics and drums.  Track 7 was my favorite on the album.
B00000IQC8|5.0|when i first heard about this movie and knew that it was in black and white i was like, &#34;i'll never watch this.&#34; but after the first time i was hooked on clerks and on Jason mewes...lol  this movie is a one of a kind and a definite must have for a dvd collection. It shipped fast too.
B003I55BIA|1.0|Please don't waste your time or money, even though it is on sale for Kindle. It is so predictable, it's obnoxious!
B003Q6D25K|3.0|when the first one came out and i saw it i was like wow, this sucks. I watched it again and it kinda grew on me. So of course when the second one came out i wanted to see that as well. now after the third one came out i started losing interest. also as well with the fourth. i think that they should have stopped with the second movie. shipping was fast and overall satisfied.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an amazing app and I truly love it it's fun for the whole family I recommend this app highly
0439023491|5.0|This book was truly amazing. I immediately bought all three books in the series to finish them in one week! This book is TOTALLY awesome and I've seen the movie after reading the book... the movie doesn't do the book justice in my opinion. Thank you AMAZON!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love this book so much. It's full of magic and wonder and it's so beautifully written. Do yourself a favor and read it!
B00BOX0K0M|4.0|I also got the red filter for diving and snorkeling.  The polarizer filter does work well and when I reviewed the footage it was not too dark.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Am excited for more rooms. Tricky and challenging way to have fun. I can feel myself getting better with each room- yet I am always challenged
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|App works well.  The large buttons make data entry easy. If you &#34;need&#34; a calculator on your tablet this one will do nicely.
B005LW5J9O|3.0|The excessive detail is confusing and I don't know how accurate it is over generations of early history.<br /><br />If I hadn't read this for a book club, I would not have finished this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The first time in the game it was not the easiest game but it was not a bad thing because I was good at games for a good amount of time.
1250012570|5.0|This is a great story about two characters experiencing first love while dealing with teenage challenges of just fitting in as we'll as challenges at home.  To classify it as YA is limiting the readers.  I think it is an enjoyable read for all age groups, especially those that can relate to the 80'.  I think it is an adorable read.  I laughed and I cried and was sad to see it end.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Even when I'm stuck in a level is entertained and fun. I expense hours solving it but I am thinking of record and publish the solution.<br />Thanks Amazon.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved it! What a great way to watch the show on my time schedule. I would suggest to my friends.
B0045HCJGC|3.0|what can I say other than an OK movie, it is what it is...... What do you expect from a movie you have scene...
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I love this series.  It is the best series I have ever watched. I do recommend this to all who love watching it on hbo, or have read the books.  This show sticks real closely to the writings in the books.  I love it.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|It's the first  purchase I made on my kindle. Go big or go home. And this game is bo Jackson go big! I can't say still that you won't find a more complete authentic game yet besides ff series, enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My kids absolutely love this app. They have been working together to figure it out. They are under 10 yrs old.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a great game challengeing but not so much as to feel impossible... great graphics fun game.... no downsides... if you love puzzels here you go
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|it is incredible how they come up with the words. it really gets you thinking and it feels good when you figure out a word
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I think it's good most the time and it's better then using the internet but it doesn't load some videos and it pauses alot so it can be really annoying sometimes.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Folk...soft rock...a touch of blues...with a touch of humor.  Richard Thompson is always interesting and enjpyable to listen to.  Why haven't more people discovered his talents?
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Thnx, guys! It is better then &#34;This is us&#34;, really! I'm proud U! Welcome to Ukraine on tour! See ya
B003NWS5AO|4.0|As always, Robert Plant's projects are interesting.  The song choices were something that is not heard every day.Nice for a change of pace.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|The cat is super awesome and the game is spooky and sinister. I love the look of this game and the multiple playing options.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|This movie was just ok. Great story line. The lead male actor just didn't get the job done. Could have been a lot better
B007PF7MGS|5.0|This book hits home for me. A nice addition to my 80-10-10 routine. My body feels great and that's what it's all about!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of my favorite shows. I can't wait till the new season starts. It's interesting to see the changes in the way people used to live as compaired to now. Life may have been a lot harder then but it was so much more ellegant. It amazes me how much staff they needed to run the household.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|My brother bought me this when I was 12 or 13.  I liked it then and it still sounds great.  Every track is classic.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works good. Easy to see. It is what it is. Does a good job at being a time passing game
B005LAII44|5.0|The First GI Joe was OK.  I even pulled it out again and watched before this arrived and the sequel has awesome fighting/action = raw, non-stop action!!  And the story itself is pretty good as I was not expecting a lot, I'm very pleased with this movie.  It is a lot of fun.  Once again, Bruce is KING!!
B005GRF2UK|4.0|Excellent production with great lead players better than  the other versions I've seen.  Heroine was good choice, not too beautiful
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|works great. love that it does not lose my calculations if I make a mistake along the way. Best calc app I have tried so far
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app the onley photo app you will need :) its really one of my all time favorite apps!! i love it
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love Spider Solitaire..so relaxing and fun! And it was free too. A great way to spend a few minutes!
B0076HNMU0|5.0|If you haven't seen Twin Peaks you are missing out on a lot of fun. Mystery, comedy, and weirdness combine, to make this one of the best things to come out of the early 90's.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I read every book that Philippa Gregory writes. This one does not disappoint. I stayed up two nights until 3am.
1451695195|4.0|This is an interesting book but a bit convoluted for me.  Still it is a good read.  I might recommend it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A great book to read and escape.. The ending left me like HUH? Otherwise i liked the twists and darkness that Gillian Flynn put on this story.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is a good mind game to play and helps you to remember stuff when you text your friends this
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Though the target age group for this book is for children of elementary age, as an adult, I LOVED IT.  I reminded me of how difficult it is to be a kid and that adults, still may act like children when it comes to certain things.  I want my kids to read this book and really believe that it would be a great book for teachers to require as a class assignment.  Teachers can read this book to the kids OR assign it for homework.  It would be an opportunity for a discussion on bullying!  It's an easy read, as the narrators are the children who are mostly in the 5th grade.  You get the perspectives from peers and family members, and of course, from August, the main character.  READ IT!  :)
6305064490|5.0|I had an old VHS and wanted the DVD so ordered this one from Amazon and could not be happier. WONDERFUL clarity and product. Thoroughly enjoy the film in any condition but I feel I am seeing it again in its original splendor here.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I needed something to read during vacation that would last more than one or two days so I chose  this book.  I'm not a big zombie fan but the movie was out and people were talking about it.  The format the book is written in, a series of interviews, took a little getting used to at first.  As I read further into the book I began to see the story these interviews were telling.  The way that story used real world events intertwined with the story was really amazing making the reader feel this really happened.  I don't know if I was not ready for the book to end or it ended abruptly.  Overall great reading....will make you stop and look around when you hear a noise.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I have several versions of angry birds and I like all of them.  This one is no exception.  My grandson loves the angry birds games too.  He enjoys Angry Birds Friends as much as I do
140006922X|1.0|Zealot is a written by a man who is hiding his true motivations for doing a book on Jesus.  Jesus is a revolutionary  for men's souls and their relationship to God. Aslan through many connections is a revolutionary bent on transforming and destroying the U.S. and western culture. All with the help of George Soros and other groups who hate American society. If you follow his associations and influences you will find if full of Code Pink, Tides Grp, Soros funded groups.  The left has attacked our families, our economic system, our schools/history, and with this book and other publications, our primary religion.  Yes, like it or not, we are still a Christian nation. They need to attack Christianity so they can \\"fundamentally transform\\" American society. Obama and company are in full agreement these attacks.  Obama is out this week attacking capitalism, saying it has never worked and has never been \\"fair\\". Surprise? I would be upset, except, I knew that this kind of attack was coming. It was just the next thing. Look at all of the reviewers who have given this such great praise.  Is it any wonder that the NY Times and other statist newspapers/media are happy with this? Christianity has always been attacked and this book is mostly a rehash of the same old stuff.  The main twist is now this comes from,(so he says) an ex-follower (now his a muslim) of Christianity and a simple professor of religion.  It is still a bunch of half truths written by, funded by groups that do not believe in the U.S. Constitution, capitalism or the survival of American as we have know it. It is garbage.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|what can I say its Pink Floyd the cd and the movie are freaking awesome ive always loved it always will
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Too many cliches. writing is mediocre. Ken ollet would do well to tay away from the woman's point of view re. feelings, especially as they relate to sexuality.
B00CLD65X0|3.0|Of course we love watching Downtown Abbey, but so far this season seems to be lacking. I have to remind myself that it’s set in the roaring twenties because everything seems to be so archaic. Maybe that's just the English, but I would hope they would have been a bit more progressive. So far, it’s just a little boring.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|It was worth while reading for the story. Roberts' take on life in India was interesting.  Roberts' characters are somewhat tedious and inconsistant.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great idea, now can get my music on all my devices in one place. Easy to use. My kids love it to.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It finished the story and brought everything to a close. The first two were much better written and it seems that this last book in the series was like the author was finally able to put this project to bed and work on something else. It kind of drones on and on about Ana's happiness and Grey's happiness and everybody's just so freaking happy. Made me want to barf a few times...I'm glad it's done, happy I read it, now I need to move on. Sexy as Hell, don't get me wrong! But, again, I'm glad it's finished.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love this app it's saved me from time and money, it's downloaded my favorite music and videos, but on the fifth month I've used it, it wouldn't let me download music videos I hope they reed this and get a chance to fix it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I rented this not knowing what to expect. EVERYONE I knew loved it so it must be good right....:-) It really is. It is a very sweet movie, which I wasn't expecting at all. I don't want to give the story away so I am not going to say much just that it is about a villain that surprises himself and others with his &#34;heart.&#34; :-) Get it, you'll love it!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I really did not read it.It takes to long for me,to read.I never read that much.If I really read it I would not like it.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I had been wanting to see this for a little while and ended up renting it last weekend. It was such a great movie. Lots of really good messages, and insights. I would definitely recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed following this series however the ending became very disjointed and lacked any sense of flow for me. Regardless, I will read this series MANY times over. Just a fantastic read!!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is very fun for children beetween 4 and up. I recommend it for 4 and up because there are too many downloadable things. That's one bad reason not to download this app.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|I'm glad I bought these I had watched them for years but didn't own them these turned out to be of great quality and I saw things I hadn't before. I would definitely recommend these to others.
B006ID01OS|4.0|I've not finish the book, but the sample given taught me a lot about how to set the strategy for a company.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is amazing I couldn't ask for more my sister and daughter love it .it also never freezes I can play it all day long!!!!!
B00B19GKI0|5.0|great movie,good acting,great actioN!we watched this every few years,always great to kick back and watch K.Russel in action... as well as a few other very well known actors,E.Borgnine, and Steve Bucemi .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|For a parent of a son who loves the Despicable Me movies, this game has been a great way to continue the minions' hijinks at home!  The graphics are incredible for a free game, and my son nearly loses his breath laughing while playing.  Can be a bit frustrating to younger users while they are learning, but overall a wonderful and addictive game.
B00005O3VD|5.0|I watched this movie back when I was a kid.  Loved it so much that I knew I had to buy it.  The DVD is perfect.
B00DU16OJM|5.0|Each time I've listened to this collection it gets better. It is a wonderful addition to my growing list of Guy Clark albums and my 14000+ iTunes library!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|im a johnhy depp fan anyways but this movie was alot better than i expected it to be. i like tim burton and johnny depp in it was a added bonus :)
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|It's been a couple of decades since I purchased a new CD and rushed home to play it beginning to end and loved every song.  The hits just keep on coming.  The music is exceptional - these folks actually PLAY instruments! - but more about that later.  The LYRICS are fantastic leaving vivid images of Airline Stewardess' in some ancient spiritual ritual blessing the plane, and sitting alone on the side of a hill in Los Angeles with the person you want to spend the end of the world with, wondering how to tell them.  LORD have mercy, this was not some guitar toting debutante or some angry frat boy - these were meaty big shouldered lyrics written by a man with a heart the size of Texas. Brutally intense.  I'm in love and just when the words leave me reeling the harmonies and the music swoops in to rock me like a child.  OMG is that a slide guitar...More!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I know about this movie beforehead.  As i started becoming a Amazon Prime member using the free movies.  I learned the hard way that I didnt notice this movie didn't have the &#34;CC&#34; coded when i clicked this to watch.  So I found the correct section to view all movies that have the &#34;CC&#34; coded.  I wish Amazon web developers be more clearer and be more end user friendly in designing the web page options or features to show 'CC' or closed captioned&#34; code upfront.
0399162097|4.0|As a few other reviews have stated, the \\"big reveal\\" in this book is spoiled on the front of the Amazon page and in other reviews.  However, that's not really what it's about.  This is more a book about the memory of early life events and the repercussions of those events.  The narrator starts the story over a decade past this pivotal moment with a certain understanding of what happened.  However, instead of just leading us readers along and revealing that moment at her pace to the reader, she is also forced to re-examine her take on it, thus becoming more like us: led to an understanding that transcends the initial intent of the novel.  This is what separates this from another novelized memoir.<br /><br />Having said that, I found much of the Davis area \\"action\\" a bit trite and contrived.  Hence a mere four stars.  This makes the book a more exciting read, but it left me noticing plot devices and such.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Could be better but overall pretty good. Takes a little longer then I would like to load but it has always loaded.
B000RZIGSG|4.0|I'm not really a great fan of Musical Movies but I liked this on in the 80's when I first saw it and decided to add it to my collection of DVDs.  I still like it and don't regret buying it.
B000I5X81A|2.0|Stale, forced, painful to listen to. There's even a retitled rehash of &#34;Call Me the Breeze&#34; masquerading as an anti-war song. It seems neither artist's legacy will be enhanced by this offering.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I didn't think this movie would be as layered,  as funny or as personal as it was.  I left the movie tHeater knowing this was one of the best movies I had seen in awhile.
B00DC3DGSK|2.0|Not much to say here. This is NOT up to Mr. Guy's usual standards. The raft of &#34;guests&#34; was ill-conceived for the most part. Buddy Guy is Chicago blues, not crossover fodder, and this proves it. The Keith Urban thing was just lame.
1936608898|5.0|This book has changed the way I eat forever. Simple. It has more than a dozen pages of scientific references, they don't just preach. They have sound science on their side and take that and make a simple to understand case for changing the way you eat to not only get healthy but stay that way. It really is a must read for anyone who suffers ANY health issue or disease.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|Different from Alchemist & Pilgrimage in that you can get a lesson/message from each chapter. He covers just about every major aspect of life and advice from the &#34;Copt.&#34; Must read if you are a P.C. fan or need some guidance at challenging times of your life.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best BBC shows , love it.  Never miss an episode, recommend it to everyone.  We need more programming like this
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We should have bought this sooner! If you are having any doubts about buying a Jumperoo, take the plunge...you will be so glad that you did! I am not one of those parents that buys everything under the sun for my babies, so it was hard for me to shell out the cash for a toy that we would use for less than 6 months. Several parents recommended this to me because our little guy loves to stand, and although I wish I could, I cannot hold him all day long. He loves it, I love it, it's a winner at our house!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The toys are attached so no playing pick up all day long<br />-It makes fun sounds<br />-Three adjustable heights<br />-There are toys to look at above baby so they have plenty of visual options. The toys also adjust to accommodate for different heights<br />-The chair very smoothly swivels! Awesome, so baby can turn him/herself around to play with new toys<br />-Bright colors for visual stimulation<br />-I wouldn't call it portable, but it semi-folds up if it needs to take up less room or be moved to another location<br />-Easy assembly (It does come in several pieces, assembly is required)<br />-It stands in a neat circle, doesn't have legs at awkward angles to trip over like similar products. It takes up a full corner in our living room (32&#34; in diameter & 32&#34; tall)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-My baby boy loves it so much that sometimes I forget that he has been in there too long :) Whoops! I call it my sanity saver because this is the only &#34;toy&#34; that he has been happy to play in for more than 5 minutes.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fast and fun. I had a hard time at first but that's just me, the game was funny and so much fun to play.
B007SGM084|1.0|I was warned ahead of time that this was poorly written but had to see for myself- PLEASE don't waste 30 bucks on this trash. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are one dimensional, and the writing is awful. I hate that I wasted time and money on such drivel. Do yourself a favor and skip this series.
160059672X|5.0|What an imagination Sherry has.  I have another of her books and it seems everything she does is magical.  Anyone who loves seed beads will love this book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good fun and worth the time to download and play.  keeps you thinking and thinking  cant bet for a free game
B008JFUR10|5.0|For me, Pacific Rim is the first of its kind for the Western Culture to make.  Now yes, there are Transformers and movies such as that, but to have Mecha involving the human aspect was definitely a first!  I'm always watching the SyFy channel; but this is first one I've seen from a Western culture standpoint where the \\"robot\\" is huge and the pilot is inside it.  Being a huge Anime fan (especially Gundam Wing - which is pure Mecha), I found this movie stepping forward in the direction of more Mecha films to hopefully come from the Western culture.<br /><br />I've read countless movies' reviews, box office numbers, ratings, etc.  And despite the \\"not so great\\" box office numbers, this movie still had more positive reviews than a lot that came out around it.  Just the week before Pacific Rim came out, Despicable Me 2 was in the theatres and had huge box office numbers but the reviews were more toward \\"average to negative.\\"  That alone shows the fans and even those who didn't know what to expect, did have fun watching something different.<br /><br />One of my favorite things I enjoyed about this movie was the main Jaeger - \\"Gypsy Danger\\".  Even before I watched the interview of the different Jaegers, I thought of Gypsy Ranger as having a cowboy likeness.  Then I found out from what Guillermo del Toro had said \\"...wanted very much to feel like a classic gunslinger.  And we gave it the anatomy of a big cowboy.\\"  I did enjoy how each and every Jaeger was different in more than just their appearance.<br /><br />I've seen countless alien movies and cannot recall one that had huge aliens such as the Kaiju in this film.  I remember thinking the one Kaiju kept reminding me of a gorilla with how it moved and found out from another interview, that they did base the Kaiju off some animals with their movements and such.  It brought a sense of realistic \\"monsters\\".  Instead of a giant T-rex, you now have a giant gorilla.<br /><br />The music....if the music doesn't match the movie;I will fall out of it immediately.  In Pacific Rim, the music ROCKED!!  The pounding, I could feel pound in my heart as the scenes played out.  The trailer had a song just for Pacific Rim and I feel in love with that one just as much as I fell in love with the soundtrack.<br /><br />The last thing I want to mention is the storyline and the different emotions brought in.  There is not another Western Culture science fiction movie that I have seen that has brought out so many emotions.  At times, you have comedy relief that helps your remember to cling to the hope that the fighters will win - that there isn't hopelessness.  The characters are human and act like it!  They show emotions and cling to the past and try to figure out the future.  There are sad moments and I did cry!<br /><br />I know some of you will say this review sucks and is horrible but I don't care.  This is the first movie in my 25 years of life that I have seen more than once in theatre.  In fact, I've seen it 4x!  Recommended for about anyone.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I have always loved this movie and the 2 disk pack was a good buy.  The extra historical information on the second disk was very interesting to my kids too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am addicted! love it. wish you didn't have to spend so much money yo do everything as it limits my play by nit spending money.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I am a huge twilight fan I love all of the books including this one! It was absolutely amazing! Ya!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is such a great series.  It has been enjoyed by 4 generations of my family!  It made my niece want to know more about mythology and it made me want to brush up on my knowledge too!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Is this our future Mr. Howey? This was definitely a  page turner of a book that you don't want to put down. I love that I have more to come of this wild and amazing world. Keep the stories coming!
B00B0VI1XQ|1.0|This a way different Bonobo than I've listened to in the past. Nota very good direction to take. I hope the next effort is MUCH better.
B002DW92SE|3.0|This is not the best book Hornby has written, but it's still a Hornby story, so it's very good. Great concept
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Everyone's favorite bunch of oldies but goodies playing a lot of action scenes with humor to burn. A nice escape movie worth watching. 4 of 5 stars mostly cause these guys can still do a movie...
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I could not put it down. I really loved it. Wish it never ended.
B00081MUY0|5.0|A really powerfully clean sounding recording of Donovan's most complete statement. On a good high-fidelity stereo, or through good-quality headphones, or a honking car stereo this LP makes one a believer in the power of \\"a shoe shine, a clean windshield, and high octane gasoline\\" (kudos: Firesign Theatre). Please feel free to believe that any of the preceding are metaphors for mind-expansion through your choice of methodology. D.L. makes you believe the promises of the Dawning Aquarian Age are iron-clad statements of work and not just requests for information.<br /><br />This recording, along with Mellow Yellow, are the two volumes equivalent of a Donovan Leitch White Album. This particular title may be the high-water mark of English Psychedelia. Feel free to make a case for Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Their Satanic Majesties Request, Disreali Gears, or even the venerable Sgt. Pepper's. As Geo. Harrison, MBE wrote, It's All Too Much.<br /><br />I am ready to admit that Donovan is probably an acquired taste. The psychedelic 60s were more of an idea than reality. And that the sentiments engendered by the intersection of this poet/songwriter and the counter-cultural aspirations to be a rather heady brew. But if you are capable of enjoying a Trip along the TransLove Airways, then this is the sonically perfect recording for such an adventure.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have no words except that is AWESOME and AMAZING so go and get it now or you will be missing something
B00000612Q|4.0|If his previous recording, Every Picture Tells a Story, is a 5 Star effort, then this gem ranks 4.5-4.75 Stars. Taken as the last chapter of a whole (i.e., Rod's first four solo recordings), this is a wonderful fulfillment of a singular artist. These first four recordings show cohesion and focus, while sounding as \\"ragged and rough\\" as a set of demos. This was a great part of their power and beauty.<br /><br />Rod could be stylish and mod, while making everyone feel welcome to be at the same party with him. This is The Man before he became a caricature of \\"The Man\\". Individually, each of the first four recordings can stand alone and require none of the others for either context or contrast. So, without equivocation, I recommend this Rod Stewart, especially if you enjoy a rough-voiced swagger and an unspoken invitation to sing-along, because we are all just mates and drinking buddies at Rod's party and he guarantees that Never a Dull Moment will intrude.
B00BIR381W|5.0|This series is amazing. Every episode reveals more AND creates more mysteries . It's a never ending battle to figure out who A is.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|This is an awesome Cuusoo set.  Better than the Minecraft set in my opinion, I have it also.  I love this set but I was honestly hoping for something bigger and more grand.  I like the fact that it can be switched between all the different cars in the movies, and the mini figs are awesome.  I personall would have rather have had a little bit larger more detailed design.  Again this is an amazing set and worth the $35 asking price
B0068SLK5W|5.0|Love this book!!! I can't put it down!!! Love the cd that comes with it has been very very helpful
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|First let me say I have enjoyed almost every film Zack Snyder ever made. Sadly, this film is at the bottom of my Snyder list now.<br />WHY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH IS THE CAMERA SHAKING EVERY SECOND OF THIS MOVIE????????????!!!!!!!!!!<br />There's moments of quiet conversation going on and yet the camera is shaking like there's an earthquake! WHY?!?!? When I saw this in the theater it was all I could do to keep my lunch down. Now I officially HATE this film bc of stupid \\"shakey-cam\\". It ruined the entire experience for me. I understand using this technique if there's a reason for it... like the fight sequences. But when there's no reason for the camera to be moving IT SHOULDN'T BE MOVING!!!<br /><br />I'm not even going to get into how bad Kevin Costner is or the fact that Lawrence Fishburne is completely wasted doing virtually nothing. (Ok, I will a little: never once did I get a sense of Pa Kent's inherent goodness as a person. Call me spoiled by Smallville, but Costner basically slept thru this!)<br /><br />Long & short of it, Christopher Reeve is STILL Superman.<br />Period. End of story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I play it every day with my brother. It's the best game ever. I love it so much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so good boy I be smashing away boy I just be going I don't even pay attention to the fat man chasing me I just be running for my life yep it's really good game if some.of y'all haven't played this you should
B002YCVX5S|2.0|Has a couple good parts most of the movie drags on almost had to turn it off but, not a classic don't buy, I warned you.
B00DULWFZE|5.0|I AM A LONG TIME BACKSREET BOYS FAN,  EACH TIME THEY COME OUT WITH A NEW ALBUM  IT TAKES ME BACK TO THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THEM.. BSB FOREVER
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love Subway Surfers but there's one issue. When it updates you can't play other cities again. Please consider making it where you bundle all of the previous subway maps together and you can play the old AND new ones. I'm telling you This would be a great idea for the next update. Everyone thumbs this up if you want to play the other maps again. The same city gets boring. Also please consider a save button for non Facebook users because let's face it little kids probably don't have a Facebook. If these 2 ideas happen, It'll be 5 stars.
B00DUGCLY4|1.0|Very disappointed! The game only has maybe 20+ clues and then it's over, no choice to advance, the only option is to start over or go to more apps!?!?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Communicates with friends and relatives made easy. I also communicates with relatives in foreigh countries free of cost. Love it.
1451695195|2.0|The useful information in this book could have been covered in one chapter.  I consider most of it a detailed chronology of the physical portion of the event experienced by the author and his family.  Left me wanting.
1573226521|5.0|This book is so much better than the movie doesn't even begin to describe this book! Alex Garland is one of the great authors of our generation. Very unique plot, and just all around great read...! If you want some other movies derived from his books; two more off the top of my head are 28 days later and 28 weeks later... Worth a read! You will feel like you have been teleported from your couch or reading chair to an island paradise in the middle of the tropics of Asia...
1594481717|5.0|If you have never been exposed to right/left brain thinking you will find this book to be quite enlightening.  If you have you will appreciate the way this book provides both new knowledge and a strategy for application.
B002R27J1W|5.0|Saw it in the theater waaaaay back when and jumped out of my seat at one part, have loved it ever since. It's a collectors item for me
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I love this movie! This movie has really beautiful shots and I love the story! You need to see this movie now!
B00BXKKNFS|4.0|Good ad blocking apps. Still there is ads on some apps and website.  I am using this in my browser too
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for horse and animal lovers. Thanks game makers and designers!!!!!! I would recommend this game to play for all. I have not had a one problem with using it on my kindle fire HD.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The movie was funny and had lots of action.  It's a good movie for couples of a certain age. We enjoyed it.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Revenge of the Orgasm was a new style of poetry that I enjoyed all the way through. It has a voice, I could actually hear this man talking to me. It was sexy and intimate, I didn't want it to end. I want that voice to keep speaking to me. It was a truly wonderful experience to read this work of art. Thank you GPA.
0345529057|5.0|Was a Father's Day gift for Dad who has seen all the seasons that have aired so far. He wanted to get the more in depth version of the story. He can't put the books down and talks about them all the time. He's always pointing out the stuff in the book that isn't in the series.
B0042816YK|4.0|My wife ordered it and I watched it.  She loved it and I liked it.  The dvd came in a timely manner and was not damaged in shipping.
B003G8WI7G|5.0|I hadn't heard of Trombone Shorty until I heard him streamed live from the Newport Folk Festival a few weeks ago. After hearing the group play live I became an instant fan. Backatown is no disappointment. When playing it at work, I click along much faster. This album is getting a lot of play time with me.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was really a great book. I recommend this book to all kids and even grownups. It was funny , heartwarming , and even made me cry a little!
1563898586|4.0|Really enjoy Alan Moore's works. Having read this, LOEG, V for Vendetta and Watchmen, this is second only to Watchmen.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Fantastic political satire in which no one is spared the spear. Puppets lampoon America's attitude of superiority, Hollywood pompousness, idiot Aisian dictators, and, thank goodness, the French. The South Park team hits a home run.  Definitely NOT appropriate for children, and therefore I strongly suggest that you ONLY view the unrated version of this film.  The &#34;love&#34; scene alone is worth it!
B002EDH0FE|5.0|Actually liked the movie better than the graphic novel. And I'm sure Alan Moore's rolling in his grave somewhere. Oh, he's not dead? Well, that's good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my go to game when I need something to do. I find it a good game when I'm on hold.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Some the extra 2 bucks and get this paid version, I found the free one to not always work. This one works great though  and wakes me up without fail.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|4 year old loves working with this app.  Coloring and painting without the mess.  Can't get better than that, right?
B0000046KM|5.0|Ms. Horn is spectacular! I love her rendition of &#34;Here's to Live,&#34; and &#34;Estaté.&#34;  I first heard &#34;Estaté&#34; sung in Portuguese, but nobody sings it better than Ms. Horn in English. This is a great gift idea, but buy a copy for yourself first.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Fascinating account of the history of the first part of the twentieth century. The characters bring the events to life and give great insight to a difficult period. Recommended reading.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I think you should get this app. however the prices are too high in my opinion.<br />so I hope they update it too where the prices are lower.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I was so excited to receive this book. I could believe how quickly it came in the mail. I already started to read it and I am enjoying it very much. The book stated that it was used, but you would never know it.<br />Thank you,<br />Bonnie
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Funny movie! I think it is funnier for adults than children, not that it  is inappropriate just younger children wouldnt understand, overall good movie and child age appropriate
B00CIXMSHU|4.0|we had some issues but me and the seller has worked it all out just make sure to read the listings
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Lots of plot twists, good character development. Lots of shooting. The ending has a nice twist. looking forward to the sequel
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Love this game, but noticed that when homework is assigned and completed its not always giving me my rewards. Just finished an assignment and my rare plants need feeding again. Pearls are also hard to come by.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I really like this game because it has lots of games in it and it is fun and it is good
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|CHIMPACT is a great adventure packed full of beautiful scenery, foes & friends.  I would highly recommend.  Thumbs up and thank you for designing this fun, challenging, entertaining game.  You certainly get your money's worth!
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. Heartbreakingly sad. I have seen it many times and it moves me every time I see it.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It does what its suppose to do. But there is better TIM out there that I have used. I bought this to use on my PS3,(YLOD) which I have yet to have any problems with. So I will be buying this product again in the future because it has worked out very well for me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I would recommend this game definitely. I can't put this down the only time I can stop playing it is when my device dies.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I actually think that Don Henley's voice is getting better. The music seems so much<br />more together and the visuals on Blu-Ray are excellent. Just wondered where New York<br />Minute went to?
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|Great game you can wander around gamble beat missions and street race better than gangster Rio if you like gangster Rio and other gangster you have to get this game
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love this show.  You never know what trouble the club is going to encounter.  The show definitely keeps the thrill and suspense coming.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I found this book to be very well written with a compelling story and well-developed characters.  It's a real page turner.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have found this battery app to be very useful. It gives a good display of battery life and charging time. Every user needs something like this.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much!  The story is compelling and his writing is just beautiful.  Although I felt it veered off course a couple of times, I really enjoyed the story and it was great to learn about another culture and time.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|The second season is the best starting with the the last two episodes of season one. It was a bit ahead of its time and really has more meaning now that everyone seems to be anonymous and have avatar relationships with others. Definitely recommend checking it out. Great actors too, some new who are on established shows now and others from the Whedonverse ensemble of actors.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It is well written and well laid out. I like the way Aslan starts with a basic history lesson, something seriously lacking in any of the churches or bible studies I have been to.<br />He states outright at the beginning that there is an extensive notes section in the back, so the lack of in-text referencing (other than gospel quotes) did not concern me. He also admits that there are just as many people who could argue against his position. These things reassured me that I was not reading a piece of propaganda, but rather an engaging story of the historical Jesus of Nazareth. Not Christ Jesus, but rather the flesh and blood person. It was very refreshing to finally read something that talks more about this historical Jesus than. It has helped fill in a LOT of holes in my understanding of the bible, Judaism, early Christianity and first century Palestine, which, if I am honest was almost non-existent. I have only ever been 'fed' the Jesus as Christ, Pauline, version of the story. Aslan's book has inspired me to take a fresh look at the New Testament and to do further reading on the subject.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This story is an outstanding version of an English family with a view of the differences between the classes in the early 19th Century.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This speakerphone is easy to use.  Easy to pair up. It has excellent sound and easy control access. Recharges quickly.  The instructions were easy to follow.  I highly recommend it.
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|The only thing that got to me was all the back-and-forthing.  BUT--The map system is terrific, showing in very good detail 'where' you're looking for--there are so many places to explore I would have been lost without it, literally.<br />A hint system on-board, although a few of them are in French, and a pick-axe is called a 'peak'.  Almost another mini-puzzle, trying to translate.  I had to use an on-line walkthrough, too (nice to not be stuck forever--the next move wasn't always logical to me).<br />I enjoyed the tons of mini-games even though my finger is exhausted from all the running around.<br />Played perfectly on Kindle Fire 2nd gen.<br /><br />UPDATE: 2-27-14--I was asked where I found the walkthrough-- appunwrapper.com --has the one I think I used.  At least it's an actual walkthrough--not just a help forum. It can be hard to find walkthroughs for some game brands.  Not being able to finish a game makes me crazy!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The item was received well packaged. The mouse is working as interned and I am well pleased.<br />I will recommend this mouse for any gammer.
B0061S0A64|5.0|WOW this is a wonderful app!!! I am Soo<br />glad it was free today. it is so easy to create your own rhythm and beat!
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is ok.. I mean, it needs a little help with somethings, but it is great other than that.<br />But one thing I really don't like is how it tells us to go on Facebook to complete achievements because I don't have a Facebook and I don't feel like making one for this game. And because they shouldn't be asking for us to do that because some children might play this game, and not all children Have a Facebook account.
B0061S0A64|4.0|Before I go too far I just want to state this is a very excellent app, and was an excellent app when it was the free app of the day in April of 2012. this fun-filled Music app does everything that it says it does. Very easy to use, and has no crazy permissions.<br /><br />now that I've given all the good about the app, I would like to make a little statement about Amazon. Amazon states that it gives you a free new app everyday. Well Amazon you're slipping, this is a free app, as it was in 2012. However my Amazon friends, this is not a new app however. Please Amazon keep your word and deliver us a new free app of the day. There's over 100 new apps being developed and released every day. I'm sure that you can find one that has not already been given to us. Thank you very much just a thought.<br /><br />but as far as the application itself goes is a very good one
B004ADF7RO|5.0|great story ,  I watched this movie a long time ago...and just wanted to refresh my memory...kids from 8 to 80 will enjoy!
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Thank you Amazon, giving me hours of pleasure shopping your voluminous aisles. It's the most mobile cart without wheels to date.
B0000039QA|5.0|In the final days of this man's life, he created some amazing hip hop tracks. He managed to land them on this final album. This was a must have for my collection.
0062255657|5.0|An incredible story that stays with you long after you read it. The honesty and the emotion behind it, left me sobbing in my ocean and I will forever be moved by it's current.
B0002C4JE4|5.0|If you still collect CD's as I do, this is a must have for JT, and music lovers a like. The recording is of top quality. Great stuff!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The entire family enjoys playing this game. Simple enough for my three year to play and have fun while doing it.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Before I review this great product, I want to pitch a must see documentary. If you're a Tupac fan, you should do yourself a favor and watch \\"Tupac: Resurrection\\". This young man was quite articulate, which most people wouldn't understand outside of the hip hop world. The album, ALL Eyes On Me\\" is a pure classic, in my opinion. I could probably do without 3 or 4 songs, but that's damn good for a double-sided album.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great addition for our Star Trek fan.  They are just what we expected for old movies made into blue ray.  :)
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The characters came alive for me. I felt like I knew them personally and became a part of their world. It is so sad that so many children were treated so badly by the Catholic church. I know God must be busy with those people that did so much harm to so many.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|If we need to unwind and laugh, this series is a sure fire guarantee to help us do just that..
B009R659L8|4.0|When Kate Connelly was three years old, her mother, her Uncle Connor, and some friends were killed in a boating accident.  She still has memories of dancing with her parents on one special night, and brief flashes of inexplicable memories that occasionally haunt her.<br /><br />Bereft at the loss of his wife Susan, Douglas Connelly, Connor's twin, must go on as the head of the family business.  Now, many years later, Kate is lying in a hospital bed, in a coma, after a strange explosion at the family's furniture factory: an explosion that killed a former employee, Gus Schmidt.<br /><br />In the investigation, the questions center on who set the fire, since the business was not doing well.  What were Gus and Kate doing at the factory in the early hours of the morning?  Did one or both of them set the fire so that the Connelly family could receive the insurance money?<br /><br />Meanwhile, other story threads involve missing girls; unexpected large sums of money used to buy a home for Gus Schmidt's daughter; and secret communications between Doug Connelly, patriarch of the family, and unknown persons.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we also come to learn more about a homeless Vietnam veteran who abandoned his family forty years before.  What was he doing in a wrecked van near the factory on the night of the explosion?  Did he have something to do with the fire, or did he see something that could be helpful?<br /><br />The story was intriguing, but there were so many characters, and some of them had similar names and descriptions, leading me to often confuse them.  However, [[ASIN:B009R659L8 Daddy's Gone A Hunting]] kept me rapidly turning pages, trying to make the connections and figure out the mysterious events involving the Connelly family and the missing girls.  I was pleased that I didn't figure it all out right away, even though I did suspect where the trail was going.  Another great mystery that earns 4.5 stars.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game. Unlike some others that you have  to sit around and wait for your next mission, you can always find something to do in Jurassic Park! My 7 yr. old loves it too!
B002VPE1XE|4.0|Got this for our Cannon Powershot ([[ASIN:B005I6DVC0 B005I6DVC0]]  This thing fits perfectly, and even has a pocket that can hold a couple batteries and SD card.  At the time it was only 5$, can't beat that.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|This game is fun to play.  I like the fact you can play it, put it down and come back to the same place again.  You don't have to spend a bunch of money to win the game, which I've noticed a lot of other games seem to want you to do. You can earn powerups instead of paying for them.  Great entertainment
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We got this third season of Downton Abbey free because of having Amazon Prime. What a lot of enjoyment for my husband and I. We could not wait for each of the episodes and thanks to OWNING them!!! We didn't have to! How COOL is that?? Thanks so much, Amazon! Wish I had known about Prime a long time ago!
B008OOYALE|4.0|It would be nice if we could get some dragons for game money. I have a ridiculous amount ot game money, but still can't get the different breeds. Other than that, it's an excellent game.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good game, good graphics. Puzzles were pretty challenging. Didn't take very long to finish which was kind of a bummer.<br />Fun to play
0380002930|1.0|I'm a fanatical bunny lover and I was expecting to love this book.  Instead I hated it.  Very difficult to read.  I did not enjoy it at all.  Guess I was expecting something easy to follow and light-hearted.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|More horrible than the first one. That is 2 hours of my life I will never get back. Bad bad bad
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|What's a minon anyway? can't get it. don't like it. no thanks. don't remember enough to give a good review.
B000HZHBIM|4.0|This one is old, but still good. I'm impressed they made this at that time. The start of Star Trek movies!
B005MLP8E0|5.0|Cinematography is very well done. Excellent mystery, the acting was well done and just a really good movie. I enjoyed seeing a representation of that era
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Love the game but also the most frustrating game and you really do be addicted to it.  You will certainly have a good time playing Candy Crush
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I got this for more than 50% off and there are no anomalies. It's got perfect quality for a great deal.
B003EVWDR0|3.0|Another (Tom Cruise saves Asian people) White boy saves blue people.  Give me a break.  Better on the big screen
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|This movie was really better than I thought it would be.  It had it's &#34;cheesy&#34; moments, but not too many.
B001NLL93W|4.0|The Mortal Instruments books are for more than just young readers.  I am an aged reader and loved the interaction between the different types of characters, the impossible made possible and the what ifs.  Will be happy to see the first movie when it comes out.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great way to pass on savings to family and friends.  I use amazon all time and usually get a good deal and always find what I'm looking for.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i use this app everyday!! there is no reason not too! i have it at the palm of my hand literally and i am sharing it with all of my friends!
B005721W9O|5.0|I had no idea.  This movie is a very well-done send up of all those Star ____ (fill in the blank) TV shows and movies.  We laughed out loud, over and over.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had to read a book over summer for school and I am so glad I picked this one it was so easy to pick up a read and I hat reading but I loved this one
B00DU73T08|4.0|This movie was well-cast and mostly faithful to the book.  I would have given it five stars except they got Wanda completely wrong at the end.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It's so addicting. I love trying to beat my high scores! I love this app, I have had no problems with it, great game, fun to play!
B0096A9QXC|4.0|This game is challenging and very much fun!<br />My whole family including my 3 year old grandson love it!<br />Excellent!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This amazing app is great to use at parties or when chilling at home :3<br /> I was able to make my very own mixtapes for ppl nd they love them
0385366752|4.0|Loved everything but the ending. Book was full of suspense, twist and turns. Very entertaining! I would recommend this book to anyone
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app  is so cool I especially like how every month it changes. I have never had any problems with this app at all so I totally recommend it for whoever is thinking of buying it. I'm really surprised it didn't cost any money.
0307887448|5.0|This book was a present and I enjoyed it much more than initially I thought I would. Having grown up in the 80's I was around when Blade Runner and Monty Python's Holy Grail were first released. Computers were in their infancy and computer gaming something that had just been born. Without all the sophistication of PlayStation and XBox I was part of the generation that thought 2D graphics were way cool. If you were never much into gaming then a lot of the references to computer games in the 80's may pass you by but you will still be able to enjoy the references to the 80's pop culture. The story is well told in my opinion and if you can let your imagination move to the point where you can follow characters in a virtual world (called the Oasis) then this is something that you will probably enjoy a lot. Told from the perspective of a late teen who has a character both in the real world and the Oasis you meet a number of others characters along the way, each of whom have their own special reason for escaping everyday reality for a cyber reality. Personally I found both environments interesting in their own way.<br /><br />When the game designer who created the Oasis dies and leaves a fortune to the character who successfully completes a quest in the virtual world, the story proceeds both in and out of cyberspace and moves at a good pace. Relationships form along with way with a number of surprises in store. This is not just an adolescent book in my opinion, in fact anyone under the age of twenty will miss a fair amount but would still be able to enjoy it. There is an element of fantasy fiction, manga, pop culture and for those who really want to dive deep, a question as to the what reality really is to different people.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|Whenever I need to know the weather for the day this app does even more, it shows the weather for the whole week and the weather for throughout the day love it:). Other apps that I have tried always had glitches or viruses I'm glad I found this app totally recommend it.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I was disappointed in this movie after all the hype about it.  They talked way to much without actually doing anything.  I wouldn't watch it again.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I have always enjoyed learning about Tesla.  Such a genius that was overlooked by so many in his time.  And he seemed quite honorable in business dealings, unlike Edison and J. P. Morgan.  No telling what he might have given to the world if he had unlimited financial backing.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The movie was as advertised.  Very intense, very fast paced.  I enjoyed it, but I don't think I would watch it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever<br />Definitely the best game for me!!!!!!!<br />This is an awesome game for tablets,iPhone,iPod,kindle,and<br />more!!!
B00CU8OVIM|1.0|J.cole album is not great. The albums talks about the same thing most rappers talk about which are females. That is not talent. Viluminati (however is spelt) is a disgrace to 2 PAC. J. Cole's album is dull (period).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for horse lover's. I would totally recommend it to others. Great graphics. I love it so much.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This is why I normally avoid sequels. Plus, I didn't enjoy the mix casts...Bring back Duke! He shouldn't even have been in the movie it they weren't going to keep him past the first scene. Would have influenced my decision to buy and watch.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|The further I get away from what I've seen on TV the more difficult it is to follow whose who. I still enjoy reading them but might have more light shed when the programs catch up to the book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I'm usually very wary of reading books from the male perspective, but this one was done right. His change from womanizer to romantic was smooth, funny and realistic.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is really awesome because you get to ride the new update, the wave rider. there is also another awesome vehicle called Mr. cuddles.
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|This movie is one of the best anime movies I had seen, intrestig story that inspire the series, buy it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love it so much more love and honesty so much protection so much more cant wait for the next book.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This book is simply amazing. This book was difficult to put down. Definitely worth a read, you will not regret it.
B009NNG202|1.0|One of the most incredibly stupid movies that I have ever seen!<br />And please don't tell me that it was brilliant and that I just didn't get it.
030726999X|5.0|Someone gave me &#34;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&#34; and I was hooked. I wish Stieg Larsson were still around to write more of these Millennium stories, or anything at all. What a loss!
B001UTW7QU|2.0|I watched a few episodes of this and thought that it was well done and well acted but I just couldn't get past the unbelievably preposterous story lines.  Come on, recording the images from the retina of a dead person?!
0307949508|5.0|Someone gave me &#34;The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo&#34; and I was hooked. I wish Stieg Larsson were still around to write more of these Millennium stories, or anything at all. What a loss!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|quite fun and entertaining will keep u busy for a while. can connect to facebook and there is also in app purchases
B00BFBSV72|3.0|This game isn't all that bad, but it gets a little tiresome after playing it for a awhile. Additionally, I think it's a poor choice to make a Sonic game where all he does is jump. Anyone who knows Sonic knows that he was created as a speed runner, yet there's no running in this game. So all in all, a decent game but short lived, and sad to see Sonic's running shoes not being put to good use!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|additive game love it ive got along friends playing it. try it you cant stop . how many costumes will you get?
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I had to buy the instant video version because I just couldn't wait for the blu-ray! (the price difference didn't hurt either). I never read the book so I can't compare the two, but I really enjoyed the movie. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were both amazing! They had fantastic chemistry! It's easy to see how Jennifer won the oscar for this role. She is so versitile in her acting ability. This is a movie I'll definitely be watching again!
B005KAH7QU|4.0|I definitely recommend this film.  It is well cast, well acted, and beautifully shot.  The locations are stunning - especially the dead amusement park.  Breath-taking as it is visually, it does have a major flaw.  The story just isn't there, especially in the third act.  If that were not so, I would place it in my top ten all-time favorites.  But even so, there is much to admire.  Enough for me to shell out for a blu-ray copy.  I will be watching it repeatedly for the visual feast, and for the title character's performance.
B0000640S1|1.0|Great movie but the disc is defective. I tried it several times - It suddenly freezes near the beginning part.
0425263924|5.0|Beyond steamy and it has many twist and turns. I'm hanging on by threads waiting for the next installment of this series to come out. If you thought 50 Shades of Grey was good you haven't read nothin yet.
B0006MT314|4.0|I like this CD, I can recognize lots of songs from the show but I wished there were more songs from Bethany. She's great and is the main singer in the show...overall very good album.
B0089LOG02|5.0|good book would like to read more of her work couldnt put it down would  recommend it to my friends
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've learned of Magic The Gathering about a year - 2 years and I loved it, but I never had anyone to play with beside friends at school bit now I can play by myself. 5 out of 5 stars
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Total setup time 2.5 minutes.<br />I was blown away by how easily this thing was to setup.<br /><br />Performance: awesome.<br />Previously I was using my PS3 for streaming both YouTube and NetFlix.  I would get horrible buffering on the PS3 and always assumed it was a limitation of my wifi network.<br />The ChromeCast buffers for a second when I start a video up (if that)... and plays.... no interruption.  Just flawless. I truly was not expecting that.<br /><br />The power of this thing is really going to be demonstrated in the coming weeks and months when app developers jump on board (and they are).<br />Already Pandora, Songza, HBO Go, Hulu, RedBox Instant, Vimeo are in the works and more to come I am sure (Amazon, I am looking at you!)<br /><br />Also a popular Android Developer has already created an app that will allow you to send videos/pictures/etc that are on your phone directly to the ChromeCast (Don't listen to Gruber when he says it isn't possible... He's wrong).  The app is not released at the time of this writing, but it shouldn't be long now.<br /><br />For $35 I am definitely looking to get more of these.
B004GJYRA0|3.0|Just ok, clean flick, family type film
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have the new HTC one and I have to admit that this app is amazing! I love it so much. Flow is just epic!
B0045HCJRG|4.0|Guess I lived that era, My Dad wouldn't build us a fall out shelter so I can relate to the worries of nuclear war and not being prepared. Well presented and true to those times. Wish I had those stocks and bonds.
0316227706|5.0|This is the best book for any dog lover.  The pictures are fantastic and will make you LOL.  Who knew what dogs were doing under water!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this game everyday and I just updated it so I'm going to take down Vector, Mena, And El Macho &gt;.&lt;
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This film is under rated. The cinematography is out of this world.  The story reflects the tragedy of War.  Beautiful story.
B000FBJHZS|3.0|Long and exciting but the ending plot was easy to guess. Definitely not one of Browns best works, but entertaining nevertheless.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like that it is simple to collect coins, but even more likable is the challenge it presents. That was surprising. I figured we would get bored, but haven't yet. Good job.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I hate this app I thought would be great but I was wrong I should have listened to the other reviews but it's as slow as a snail
B00AR5AMBU|4.0|...the Rambo series. The acting isn't great, but Rambo's character has so much heart, you can help but cheer him on.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|I have been trying to get a good video player and I have not found it I guess I was wrong with this app
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|The story was less serious than expected. In fact, some of the dialogue was downright cheesy, but the effects were great, the giants sufficiently sinister, and the story entertaining.
B00DURILJ2|5.0|The trailer looked interesting so we took a chance on this one and were.pleased that we did.  Better than expected, I would watch it again.  Solid story. Great characters.
1781162646|5.0|This was Stephen King bringing his A game.  I absolutely loved this tingling tale of carnies, ghosts, rubes and a broken hearted virgin \\"wearing the fur\\".  I read this in two days and enjoyed every single second of it.  A great summer read!  You won't be disappointed.
0425252868|5.0|Adam Makos has hit one out of the park in researching and writing the story of Charlie Brown and Franz Stigler. As always, the best stories are true ones/ real history.  What we have in \\"A Higher Call\\" is the flip side of Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\"  This is the story of a moral man caught up in the evils of war. A must read.<br />Charles L. Byler<br />co-author: Tempered Steel, the biography of Colonel James Kasler
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game. Simple controls, have had no problems with gameplay. Fun time filler for fans of the movie and don't forget to poke your minion in the main menu.
B003477DVK|4.0|sweet coming of age movie, not had the potential to be a classic but tried to run too many sub texts  simultaneously check out Kevin Bacons limp, you'd swear he has a bum leg!
B00005JLEX|4.0|There is some confusion about the number of episodes that this set contains. It DOES contain all of the Season 1 and Season 2 episodes of Seinfeld, so that is not problem. The box says it contains \\"All 22 episodes from Seasons 1 & 2.\\" There are only a total of 18 episodes in Seasons 1 & 2, so I'm not sure where that number came from. There are a lot of extras though that fans will enjoy. I got this set for $9.99 here on Amazon so if you hold out you can get it for a steal.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It is a really good game because I like the dinosaurs<br />The dinosaurs look really cool<br />It is fun and AND COOL<br />CAT CAT CAT
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Watched some videos on youtube and decided that it was well worth the money! Great artist with a great vision!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have read all of the series by this author and this is my favorite  ! This book totally rocks!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I don't have any trouble with this at all. It's a great way to access my Yahoo Mail on my Kindle.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its pretty fun... it a lot like other running games ive played. id reccomend it but its not something you would wanna play 24/7
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never really was in to Zombies but after recommendations I started watching and LOVE IT!  The story line and characters ar awesome!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Really good game for puzzle lovers. So far not too hard but they do get more challenging as you go. Hope the sequel is just as fun.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I liked the way it told the story. I liked how it decried the women's lives. It was a superb story
0060574216|4.0|It was a great deal and it will read well; if my daughter will read it would be great!<br />  Thank You
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I like the bright colored tiles and designs on this game, plus I like the 3d effect.  It is another fun mahjong
B00280LYIC|5.0|It is a great easy read for kids of all ages I like the whole series of books so far
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Excellent job in collecting all these data and presenting it in an easy to read format.<br /><br />Author's conclusion that out of wedlock birth as reason for Virgin Birth claim is wrong. Local people talking among themselves that they know Jesus' family, his mother, 4 bothers and multiple sisters - that is not enough to declare him \\"Jesus bar Mary\\". His father was dead and gone long time back could be better explanation why they didn't mention Joseph. They didn't say \\"Isn't he the illegitimate child of Mary?\\" either.<br /><br />Hebrew text \\"A young woman will give birth to Messiah\\" was wrongly translated into \\"A virgin will give birth to Christ\\" in Greek. Matthew & Luke extensively studied this Greek version and wrote their gospels claiming Jesus fulfilled every prophacy - that is be source of virgin birth.<br /><br />Opponents calling Jesus \\"Illegitimate\\" appears only in John's gospel written 10-20 years after Matthew & Luke claimed virgin birth. That incident confirms people never heard of virgin birth before Matthew & Luke wrote their gospels.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It is a great easy read for kids of all ages I like the whole series of books so far

B00003W8NM|5.0|I bought this for a friend and he loved it! The packaging is great and the movie is a classic. Definitely but this for a friend
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was so well written! The story made me angry for I knew it to be possible. The author had a real understanding of this period in time. A very good read!!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Positives:<br /><br />Small, portable, lightweight.  It can easily be carried in a pocket when roving the outdoors to fish, camp, hike, or whatever.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />None so far.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is a fun game to play, but not as good Temple Run 2.  I am still learning the game play
1451695195|5.0|This book answered a lot of old questions about death. I hope others who have that same type of question would read this amazing book.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was very disappointed. I can live with the fact that Google does everything they can to hid the electric plug.  Did you also know it only works with Google Chrome, which I hate.  They make you think that with a PC you can stream almost anything--not so.  I was hoping to stream WatchESPN from my PC to my TV rather than having to put my PC near the TV and plug it in with HDMI.  Other streaming websites such the History Channel will not allow you to do 2 things with your PC as Google advertises.  That only works with the very few sites/up Google has setup such as Netflix and YouTube.  I can watch those on my Internet Ready DVD player.  They kept this quite so that other competitors would not put this on the market and they could saturate the market.  As smart TVs become cheaper, this will no longer be needed--not that it serves any usefull purpose now.  They did a lot of misleading customers in their advertising so they could sell as many as fast before people really know what they are getting.  This will end up in a drawer immediately, and one day I will throw it away when I clean out that drawer. Streaming quality is the poorest of any device I have. That was $35 wasted!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I didn't realise what I had been missing until someone gifted this to me. It's really the best performance I've ever seen ,and alerted me to Love Never Dies as well (ad inside the dvd case) which is the sequel to the phantom! Would buy again!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Not much to comment about, it does what it's supposed to, that's about all I can say about it.  It's just ok
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I love their music and clever arrangements of familiar tunes.  I hope there is a Piano Guys 3, 4, 5...
B0098C69OM|5.0|FIRST OF ALL, I WRITE IN CAPS FOR EVERYONE TO SEE EASIER.  THAT SAID, WOW, WHAT A GREAT ALBUM AND WHAT A SURPRISE THIS ALBUM WAS. CHAMBER JAZZ OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.  THE THING ABOUT PHILIP CATHERINE, HIS TONE IS ABSOLUTELY UNMISTAKABLE.  IN BLUEGRASS, THEY SAY BILL MONROE HAD THAT HIGH LONESOME SOUND.  WELL, I AM GOING TO BORROW A BIT FROM THAT.  PHILIP CATHERINE HAS THAT LONESOME, LATE-AT-NIGHT SOUND.  REALLY WONDERFUL!  I AM SO PLEASED WITH THIS ALBUM AND BTW, CHET IS IN TOP FORM.  A PERFECT COMPLIMENT TO PHILIP AND NO SINGING...JUST PLAYING.  BUY IT AND ENJOY...YOU WILL DEFINITELY DIG THIS.
B005Y8KWNS|5.0|I started with the Lite version and liked it enough that I bought the paid version. My review is of the full version, since I've not had the Lite version for two years,<br /><br />I've been using MD Scanner for over two years now, and it has now completely replaced my Plustek portable scanner. When I first downloaded the app to my EVO 4G, it did a decent job, but it often had issues with scans of yellow and pink carbon copies. When I installed to my EVO 3D, the quality increased, and now with my Galaxy Note 2, the quality is absolutely amazing. I'm assuming that the increase in performance is due primarily to the quality of my phone's camera. In the seven months I've had my Note 2, my Plustek scanner had stayed in my notebook bag.<br /><br />Using SD Scanner is as simple as taking a picture of your document. The software will create multiple page PDFs or image files that can be emailed with two clicks. You take the picture of your page, it will then display the page with a crop box on the image. To adjust the crop box, you simply press and hold on a corner of the box and move it to where you want. When done, you click the check mark and the app will process the image. If flattens and straightens the image perfectly. There are options for adjusting brightness. but I've never had to adjust the settings. The image processing is so good, that it's automatically render a perfect image the first time, and when I tried using my scanner, I had the scan the image as a JPG and then process it in Adobe Lightroom.<br /><br />With no doubt, this is one of my five most used apps. Now that I know first hand how well this app works, and see how much time and effort it saves me, I'd pay $20 or $30 for it. It's just that good.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Iron Man 3 was the best iron man movie ever! It is better than The Avengers! I can't wait to get it on DVD.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Seeing how my job prohibits cell phones on the floor I needed to get myself a watch again, for the first time in about 5 years. I've had this one for over a month and I love it.<br />The weight is very light, the canvas band is comfy and I haven't gotten a single scratch in the glass yet. This is not a 'bling' watch, this is a functional machine that works very well and looks good too.<br />The only issue I have with this watch is that it will occasionally loose 2 to 4 minutes while I am sleeping. This may be the fault of 'abuse' as it was perfect before the watch band pin popped out as I was lifting some heavy boxes and the watch dropped about 4 feet onto a concrete floor. There was no visible damage to the watch, but it never lost any time before that incident. Most nights it looses no time, and from the time I punch in to work til the time I punch out it looses no time, but maybe once a week I wake up and it's 4 minutes slow, so either I dinged some internal part with the drop that binds up only when in a certain position, or I'm being abducted by aliens while I sleep.<br />One other thing worth mentioning is that this is the first watch I've ever owned that the glow in the dark hands and dial dots actually work well enough to be usable. I'm used to ones that dim out after 5 minutes, but these things put out some serious glow and last a good half hour or more.<br />Also, there is almost no audible 'tick' to this watch witch is very nice compared to some other loud cheap watches I've owned.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Initially, I wasn't really interested in watching this movie because of the reviews of it being confusing, but I'm a big fan of Tom Hanks so I decided to give it a try.  Yes, I was one of those who got a bit lost at first and ask my hubby to explain some of the events.  It took me the first 20-30 minutes to really catch on to the characters and events in each time period.  I was so amazed by this movie that I HAD to learn more about the book and film!  I do wish that I had done so before watching the movie because that would have made it a bit easier for me to follow. Very cleverly done and I enjoyed watching the actors in multiple roles, some I had difficulty recognizing until later!  I'll be purchasing this movie so I can re-watch and also watch the \\"extras\\" which I'm certain will be just as fascinating!
B004132HZS|5.0|Talk about a brilliant series!  I wish they had made more. The episodes are very fast paced and extremely intelligent.  I love how the writers took the book and modernized the storylines.  I highly recommend!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I LOVE THIS WORKOUT BECAUSE OF THE 3-2-1 TECHNIQUE. I DO LEVEL 2 N 3 IN EACH WORKOUT N I FINISH WITH SO MUCH FUN. I NEVER GET FRUSTRATED IN THIS WORKOUT. LOVE IT. BUT TOO MUCH TALKING BY JILLIAN...LOL
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I can't get enough of this series!  The way the writers modernized 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' is pure genius.  The casting is the perfect and totally believable.  I wish this series could go on forever.
055358202X|4.0|Great series I love how he creates and writes the thoughts and experiences of each character more depth needed .
B00D2K40WY|4.0|A whole bunch of fun, definitely my favorite out of the series! Love the hair choices more than anything. Makeup fun and pretty.<br />Hint: the more you go over the makeup, the clearer it gets. (Just make sure you drop the brush before applying again)
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I really liked the puzzle aspect of this game it was really fun and interesting. I couldn't wait to see what came next. I would've given it 5 stars but the instructions on some of the games and the help on some of the rooms were inadequate or confusing. Given that it was really a fun game and I would do it again. It might be fun to have an untimed option as well. For some the mystery and the mastery of the game would be less frustrating and more relaxing without the time element. It was extremely irritating on some levels that were quite challenging to then have to start over and do them again because you ran out of time. I would recommend this game to all who enjoy a challenge.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was important that we kill OBL simply for the evil he spread in the world.  His debt for his actions is not paid by his death.  Well done, guys.
B0011ZWMVS|5.0|Happy, sad and all those emotions in between when I listen to this score. I listen to this often when I am working on a project.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Very good.  No problem with the formating like in some Kindle books.  Easy to read type size.  Drawings add to the book

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Honestly, I dunno what to say about this game because it's definitely great and its more than amazing. I'm pretty sure you will likely be addicted to this game. I love it''  and it was a great game!! :))))
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ended up reading all of the series. Loved it. Can't wait for the movie to come out. Ususally erotica isn't my cup of tea, however I wasn't able to put this book down.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I would definitely recommend this movie...I have seen it twice and would consider a third showing. Love amazon prime, cannot beat the selection.
0425263908|5.0|Better than 50 Shades! I love the plot and I was unable to put the book down! Really good read

0763644765|5.0|My 18 month old loves this book.  Fun and clear illustrations.  She get so excited when the character finally goes potty and screams for joy as the character does at the end of the book.  After reading this story to her for about month, I bought her first potty.  As soon as I brought it into the house she called out &#34;potty&#34; and ran to get her Potty book.  Highly recommend it!
0517543052|5.0|This book needs to reside in the home of everyone seeking spiritual truth. It's journey through the life of a seeker and is both a good read as well as a book you can turn to when in doubt.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|LUV THIS GAME!! It is so much fun to play. My cousins and I are addicted to this game. Can never stop playing it once I get started.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Almost all of the stars are at least a little off-type (especially Alec Baldwin, who's almost unrecognizable).  Nuke some popcorn and just go with it!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|The movie is simply amazing, I've watched it dozens of times over the years.  Amazon now streams in great quality HD using local app on my TV.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Minus one star because locks up on kindle..Might be kindle fire hd. Regardless far better then silk.Who does not mix well with Silk
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|It's a fun read for those that grew up playing video-games in the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />It has its weak spots, some plot holes and logic loops, but those aside, a breezy and fun read.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I love all of James Rollins books and this one i just as amazing as the rest!!!  He is a wonderful author who weaves amazing tales of crazy facts. Every book is a page turner and i have read all of his books multiple times.
B0094M4Q3M|5.0|One likes to think that gender equality has progressed somewhat since this film was first made, but there are still strong resonances with our current condition.  The message that empathy can combine with sticking to your principles to create real power is timeless. Worth watching ever year or so as a reminder.
0736092269|5.0|If your interested in fitness, studying exercise or anatomy this book is worth its weight in gold. Recommended to me by my teacher this has become my go to book when i need clarification on which exercise works which muscles!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The new features a are great, keep them coming, I love that I can go to different locations. There is so much stuff going on, hard to get bored.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my opinion is that this game is better than any laxitive I have ever tried.  if you are having trouble pinching off a loaf, I highly recommend giving this game a shot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its very good but lately i have been getting ads but overall it's very fun competing challenges and pushing minions
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the fact that it calculates the percentages without you having to do anything. Just hit the percentage button. :) Nice big buttons so that you don't accidentally hit buttons you don't want.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Two great actors come together for a great performance! Great story-line, witty dialogue, and plenty of action! A must see.
B002ZG974M|4.0|This is short and shows the resilience of kids.  I have given it to several new moms and they loved it.  I  think it helps them understand that babies can be raised in various conditions but are all OK if they have love!
B0029NY9YO|5.0|This was something different.  I watched it many times and even years after my purchase, I still love this film.  I know the author of the original story hates it, but if you would like to see what might have been, look here.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like it better than temple run. The different settings make the game less monotonous and there are many upgrades to work at.
0930289234|5.0|Something new and different.  You don't have to suspend much disbelief,. It's entertaining and engaging.  I have re-read it many times.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|please kyy (app developers) I wish for you to please make some updates to your app. please add on (when you click video catagory) it leads you to youtube mobile. I mean it is an app. for mobile devices. think about it. either your app needs updating or my kindle fire is not compatible with youtube mobile. (which it is. because I have watched over 100 videos on youtube mobile on this kindle.)

B005ELZKWS|3.0|A couple of the songs I don't care for, but they do sound a lot like Van Halen when Sammy and Michael were in it. I think this band has great potential. I love the guitar. Joe Satriani is such a great part of this band.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|After reading against all enemies, I was suspect about another co-written Clancy novel, but thoroughly enjoyed this one. It did not have the level of detail in a typical Clancy, but the story was great and moved along well.  Character development was good for the primary characters, but secondary could have used some work.  Bottom line is it was a great read in the style of the old Clancy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is one of the best games you can ever play. It gives you challenges and you can play with your friends on facebook. I recommend it to all ages!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a good game i cant stop playing it its so fun and addicting i dont regret getting it!!you should try it out
0073398101|5.0|I am currently working on a BS and MS in aerospace engineering as well as doing research on aerodynamics at a major company. This book is a necessity for any aerospace major or anyone else working/studying in the field. It provides fantastic introductory material as well as some advanced topics and is also a great reference in the workplace. It is well-written and easy to understand as well as actually being very interesting as far as textbooks go.<br /><br />I buy very few textbooks, I don't think that most of them are worth the money. But Fundamentals of Aerodynamics has paid for itself many times over and I really cannot emphasize enough how great this book is.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Great movie.  Very entertaining for adults and children. I would recommend it very highly. Also, love Johnny Depp in almost everything he does!
0143115014|5.0|I just loved it except for what it had to say about the type of person who  wore my most favourite  perfume Chanel 19. Not very complimentary.!!  Would love to buy this for all my perfume addict friends.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|One of the best books i have read all year. Dawkins is required reading!  Well written, even the science heavy parts made simple common sense. Loved it.

B0043JDUNS|5.0|Prefect companion to the first Iron Man movie.  Bought Movies 1 and 2 but will probably not buy the third one.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|If you are reading this you have an idea that this book is probably worth checking out.  Visions of silo based Hunger Games dance in your head. If that's so, you are in the right place.  Wool has that for you. Click &#34;Buy Now...&#34; and get reading.<br /><br />If you are here looking help with care and treatment of fine suits, sweaters and other expensive sheep based products you are out of luck.  You might learn the best tape to apply use on your finer hazard suits., but little if no high fashion advice will be gleaned from this collection of stories.  JoAnn's Fabrics might be able to help.<br /><br />Howey is redefining the world in which we read, in many ways. Read Wool and you'll see why.  You'll want to join the choir.  If you're a hopeful Indie author, Howey is the man to watch.  Hie'll teach you to sing as a part of that choir.  Heck, he'll even let you write in his world.<br /><br />Howey created Wool... And it was good. Amen.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Not a deep rocket science movie but yet it was very entertaining.  Clever plot and it worked.  Try it a you might like it as I did.
B00005K3NR|3.0|received quickly. Disappointed in the movie. Haven't seen it many years and it was nothing what I remembered it to be.
B0085X31VE|3.0|This album is pretty interesting.  You have death metal, jazz and other instrumentals.  The violin plays a pretty prominant part in a lot of songs.  Which are long.  They average almost 10 minutes each.  The heavy parts are usually decent, but ridiculously fast and long double bass drum rolls that are impressive in their show of stamina but boring as they never change tempo and they do it pretty much every time they play a heavy part.  They have groweling vocals and clean vocals together in a lot of parts.  The groweling isn't bad, I dont' really like the clean vocals.  I just don't like the guys voice, I find it irritating and whiney.  The first 4 tracks or so they don't really integrate the violin well, it's mostly just violin solos and they mostly all sound the same.  But eventually they do begin to integrate the violin better as a rhythm and it sounds much better.  It's almost like they go out of their way to create overly long songs and add boring sections to make them that way.  I do like it.  But I don't love it.  It's not the kind of music I would want to listen to all the time.  I would have to be in a relaxing kind of mood to want to listen to this.  It's not the kind of music you would want to motivate yourself.  So the drums and violin are sometimes boring and repetative, but it does improve about half way through.  They have a lot of potential.  Maybe their next album will be a masterpiece.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love it! But if you don't buy the full version you only have a.short time I got the full version so it's pretty awesome for me
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|OK bought game download error have to uninstall appstore then at downloading mb it goes to 70 out of 1.300 and freezes so in my opinion its worthless I know fun game but have problems if any one knows how to fix help me!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Fun to play and kill time at work and playing others is cool too.<br />Getting gold coins to play takes .funn<br /><br />e time if it not buying<br /> I like it. Just takes awhile
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Excellent entertainment.  A little slow at first, but well worth the wait.  The photography and special effects are so believable.<br /> Loved it!
0979019710|5.0|Great book, very practical and easy to apply and read.  The best thing is this book is all about ACTION.... it is not what you know but what you do that makes the difference.<br /><br />I found Hal via a Mixergy.com interview he did about selling knives and life.  A few week later I went to listen to the interview again as it is motivated me so much the 1st time, sadly it was only available as paid content.  I then goggled Hal to find his website.  I did my 1st miracle morning after hearing the free audio he sent me.  I then bought the book on Kindle. Today was my 3rd miracle morning and i swam 600 meters in the big blue sea as the E in my S.A.V.E.R.S. The last time i swam was 7 years ago.<br /><br />I would ask everyone to take on the 30 days challenge and just try it out.  I am just starting and already thinking about waking up at 5am tomorrow instead to the 6am.

0770437400|2.0|The book was not that great. The first 100-150 pages were interesting but then it just felt repetitive and boring. I am anxious to watch the movie though.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|whenever I feel a bit sad, I would watch this movie. It reminds me of all my favorite childhood things:)
B00123G6GQ|5.0|Billy Cobham is in a class by himself.  His nuanced style of playing is so far beyond anything else I've heard.  Not content to be creative with standard timing, his polyrythmic percussion leaves me just about breathless in anticipation of where he takes his music next.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|the title song is just the best Bond song ever.<br />The ?shanghai elevator fight scene is way too cool:)<br />I only wish Daniel Craig can look sexier. He is not. But there are many strong qualities about his character that made him qualify for a strong agent.
140006922X|2.0|\\"The bedrock of evangelical Christianity, at least as it was taught to me, is the unconditional belief that every word of the Bible is God-breathed and true, literal and inerrant.\\"<br />These words begin the author's insincere introduction wherein he claims to have converted to Christianity as youth. Yes, perhaps that is what some Evangelical churches believe but as the rather arrogant author of a pretty banal piece of work, shouldn't he be more converse in the attitude toward the Christian gospels (say the Catholic opinion) and less \\"crushed\\" than he claims he was to find that the canonized gospels were actually a Roman Catholic tradition? Perhaps he was misled since he is (was?) islamic and they view the Quran as absolute (see abrogations). Maybe the devil was living in his nose?<br /><br />It's an appalling read. Not really sure why Christians are so afraid of it. He takes small, insignificant differences and highlights them as if they are profundities of the greatest magnitude with an \\"arrogant\\" attitude of YOU MUST AGREE WITH THIS OR YOU ARE AN IDIOT.<br /><br />Let's take a single example, early on in the book. He highlights a contradiction:<br /><br />\\"I was sent solely to the lost sheep of Israel\\"; Matthew 15:24, the next, of benevolent universalism (\\"Go and make disciples of all nations\\"; Matthew 28:19);<br /><br />If you notice this contradiction lies on the word \\"solely\\" in the first passage. So two thousand years ago, when Christianity was forming in the turbulent hotbed of 1st century middle east, the word \\"solely\\" makes a profound difference among the two statements, the first allocates Christianity to just another Jewish cult, the other making it Universal among all men. The wonder of the Christian gospels isn't the minor inconsistencies among them - there are some, of course. Anyone who translates from one language to another will easily recognize this problem. The true wonder of the gospels is the amazing consistencies among them.<br /><br />A lot of the book is rehashed DaVinci code (maybe he snored through it? Or maybe he smelled some bucks?). He fails to see that his analysis is the greatest contradiction of all. He constantly throws out the source \\"Q\\" which any half-hearted Christian scholar would recognize as the alleged source book for all the books of the New Testament. If these differences were so profound or, excuse me let me use his arrogant \\"scholarly\\" attitude, were so \\"troubling\\" how come he recognizes, (and constantly repeats it in case the DaVinci Code was playing and we were asleep) that the gospels came from a single source?<br /><br />I love this line when talking about the gnostic gospels:<br />\\"these books are significant in that they demonstrate the dramatic divergence of opinion that existed over who Jesus was and what Jesus meant\\"<br /><br />Not really - it sounds like rehashed DaVinci code to me. Every religious figure of the day had many texts written about them. Heck, the Jews basically accept a large number of books that aren't even officially canonized. Is that \\"troubling\\"?<br /><br />So here's the problem and he recognizes it early. We have a single source book for the gospels, regardless of the \\"gnostic\\" gospels which help to enlighten the man that Jesus really was - so all his attempts to discredit and highlight the gaping contradictions among the books are doomed to fail. And anyone who reads the gospels will find, unlike in the Quran (written 700 years later and borrowing a bunch from those \\"other\\" gospels), which I have read, the contradictions to be at worst meaningless and are usually quite insignificant. The Old Testament is very different but we aren't discussing that book. In addition, although he does bring up the issue of some of the apostles dissension, they clearly came to a consensus that St. Paul was right and Jesus was divine. He seems to forget that St. Peter was walking a fine line in the early days of the Church with the heavily influential and much larger population of Israeli Christians while following the Pauline doctrine of Jesus's divinity in Rome.<br /><br />All in all, I think the problem isn't so much the book it's the reviews. I'm appalled at the good reviews it's gotten. If this had been written 10-15 years ago it would have relevance and I could see the acclaim. Today it's boring and, I believe, disingenuous.
B001HN6EF4|4.0|I got these for the pool and we have used them a couple of times now with no problem. They are clear and come on the ring for storage. We didn't have any issues with cards sticking either. I would recommend them if you have a pool and want to add an different element of fun besides the beach ball.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a good game for kids and adults I really like it and so does my brothers and sisters and friends
1451695195|5.0|It's a compelling, encouraging, easily read in a day.  Can change your whole outliook on life.  The stuff we endure down here on earth is just temporary... there's more to come!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Good game for all ages with plenty of levels.  Brilliant, especially for a free game,  The graphics are very clear and it is easy to play.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling raises social conscience in this work and deals with many human frailties. In retrospect these same themes are evident in the Henry Potter series if one looks below the story line which was truly engaging.  It gave me even more respect for her as a writer.  Can't wait to read her newest under her pseudonym.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is actually a nice game contrary to popular belief. It is fun, addicting, and I kinda like how there's an energy limit so it kinda forces me to do more productive things with my life so that is why I rated 5 stars
0544002318|5.0|Scott Jurek is a trail legend with some outstanding records to his name, this book takes you through his journey into running which he initially hated. It also looks at his vegan diet and expresses the benefits of it not something I could do it does add less processed food to your plate. The book is interjected by recipes and mentions other ultra running races including the 3100 mile race see: [[ASIN:B00AK1J0WS Running Beyond the Marathon: insights into the longest footrace in the world]]. The famous Badwater ultra is showcased and Jurek looks down and out for a while before conquering the beast. See also [[ASIN:1934030910 The World's Toughest Endurance Challenges]] for more on the Badwater and other crazy ultras I'm sure he has done.<br /><br />This book is a great read.
B001KQEA5E|5.0|This is such an amazing album. There's hardly a song that can be skipped and it definitely laid the framework for how a rap album should sound. Essential.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|Michael Douglas is great in this movie. This movie handles many of the pet peeves we all face in life. I especially liked the Whammy burger scene. This is a must move for a guy.
B001NZXFNK|3.0|I realize why people love this album so much, it's just not a masterpiece for me personally. Good music to relax to but I prefer music a little more in your face personally. Again I do enjoy this album but not in the right zone for my tastes.
0670026557|5.0|Awesome read. I am enjoying the content and the way the book is written. I would recommend it to others.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I've loved all of Grisham's books, but this one was superbly executed and satisfying and had the best ending since The Pelican Brief!
B003730LRY|5.0|Funny. Worth a watch. Very true to the spirit of the original. I want cousin It's car. The kids remind me of................. Me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very good book.. Plot tosses you left and right. Author really describes the story well for all parties. very good read.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This fairy tale is certainly not the happy stories we see and read every day. There is murder and an attempted drowning that will leave you feeling for the little boy whose perspective you get the story from. The Hempstocks are some of my favorite characters, and Lettie Hempstock's fierce protective nature over her friends and family made her out to be a great heroine. You do not get all of the answers, like who and what are the Hempstock women? In the end, however, maybe it is best to leave it a mystery. I enjoyed every page of this novel, and look forward to reading future work by Neil Gaiman.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|My laptop is located in the interior study room of my house and my Virgin Mobile signal is very weak there so I got this USB extension cable so I can put the air card dongle in the front room where signal strength is good.  I thought this 32 ft cable length might be a problem but is works great.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|I came here simply to give this movie  5 stars. When I started watching, I didn't know what to expect; I got far more than I'd hoped for. Beautiful, captivating, touching, memorable.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I have enjoyed David Baldacci's other series and wasn't disappointed by the first book of the King & Maxwell series. It was a quick read and hard to put down!!
B002VECM6S|4.0|Good story based on true events. Well done and well acted out. The family that helped him and set him on the path for success really deserve praise. Good job.
1607066017|5.0|If you've never heard of this series and are not sure if you should buy it... let me ask you 1 question: Do you like comics/graphic novels? If the answer is yes, then you should buy this immediately. It is one of the most well done and best comic series I have ever read. Period. I can't wait for volume 3 to come out.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|Finally watched this movie for the first time. It wasn't what I thought it would be about. It is a very cute movie, that is why I bought it.
1616551607|5.0|This is fantastic. It weighs about 25 lbs and is super high quality. Everything from the slip case to the bindings to the actual pages is the highest quality. I am very happy I purchased this and it is proudly displayed in my house!
B0061S0A64|4.0|Yet I found myself happily  making loops with the simple interface.<br />All it takes is a few quick study of the samples provided to start the ideas flowing.<br /><br />You just place the nodes and connect the notes however you like.don't like where it's going just drag a few things around.adjust the pitch and you can get anything form smooth relaxing to 8bit chiptunes.<br /><br />I only have minor complaints.The menu could be better placed on my kindle fire version and my more interface schemes would be nice.other than that prefect for the new to pro level.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|um...wow. I can't believe this game is free. way fun...I am totally addicted. not too hard but not easy either. love it!! will probably play again after I finish it!!

B002VGFZII|4.0|Liked this movie but the digital copy part was not ultra violet and couldn't down load but the blu ray was still worth it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this games because is good game<br />I like temple run 2 because it is very good games<br />I like games<br />I like temple run 2
B0060FXBNM|4.0|good buy wish it had ultra violet included with it other than that it's still one of my favorite trilogies
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is truly addicting! Collecting bananas is a blast, and the  noises that thw minions make just crack me up every time. I would like to see a change in scenery though...
B000QY9WOU|3.0|For some reason the audio on watching this was good maybe on an intro..then the audio would get muffled.<br />Cher is quite the Diva, I would have to Agree and she had earned that Title Very Well!
B005ZB91KY|5.0|I am not much into comic books, but at a friend's encouragement I watched this movie. I don't think you have to know a lot about the main character to appreciate the movie. Great plot and effects. Makes you wish real people were as selfless...
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|i love this game because its like a basic game. you just tilt your device to move your guy and you can shoot these little pelet balls at these evil monster guys. plus there different places you can try. so i deffintaly guarrantee this app to you
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I was looking for a spy thriller, found this book, and decided to give it a try. I have never read anything by Ken Follett, so I didn't know what to expect. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is fast paced and has interesting characters. I would recommend this to anyone interested in spy thrillers. Based on this book, I will likely be purchasing more Ken Follett books in the near future.
0793518326|5.0|I spilled coffee all over my other one and immediately ordered another copy.  Brimming with excellent music craft and lyrics..

B00A81MV3U|5.0|Bradley Cooper seems to never have a boring movie, great flick and must see, tear jerker if you are a mental health professional it's an interesting watch
B008JFURII|4.0|I loved this film.  Yes the plot is so thin as to almost be transparent.  Yes it is filled with car crashes, car chases, and the most heavily armed but incompetent adversaries on film.  But the CAST -- and the ACTION -- make this into an exciting romp by some very talented actors.  It is hard to overshadow Bruce Willis in any film but this cast manages that.  John Malkovich steals the show as \\"Mad\\" Marvin and does as much acting with his face as with the dialog.  Helen Mirren is clearly having the time of her life playing Victoria and she is great.  Anthony Hopkins as the mad scientist plays it to the hilt.  Byung-hun Lee as the assassin hired to kill Willis is marvelous in his incredible fight scenes plus adding some real subdued humor about his plane. Also he introduces the new Gatling gun just released by the Army and that scene alone is worth the price of admission. Oh yes -- Bruce Willis was in this film -- and yes he does a good job but it is hard to surpass this team of actors -- he keeps up because he is an excellent actor but he has stiff competition in this sequel to Red. This is a non-stop action film with a simple plot but with a team of actors at their best and having a great time in the process.  You gotta see this film
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Great movie, If you love baseball this has just enough to keep you interested plus Clint Eastwood is phenomenal as usual
B002Y3GLRC|5.0|This album has some great but not well known music on it.  If you like soft rock, bordering on classical, music and especially stuff that is not ordinary, then you will probably like this album.
B00006AW2O|4.0|Good stuff, and important piece in the collection. This gives a good insight into early Stones and the influences that made them who they are
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I have a strong bias toward reading non-fiction, but I was looking for something fun and interesting. This has gotten a lot of publicity so I decided to try it. It was one of the most entertaining and gripping things I've read in a while. I might even figure out a way to use it with my international relations students!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Brilliant, Classic Bob an important part of the collection of 45 CD's that chronicle his music across his career. Throughly enjoyable
B0061S0A64|5.0|I have spent many a time using this app. I think is one of the best music apps on the market today. I love it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|One of the best series I've seen. It can be engaging and cerebral. Suits is to Law, as House is to medicine.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Another great piece from Kamelot. Tommy Karevik's voice is great. Although its a big change considering what they have been doing lately. But still its a great album.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Received my order of (3) today. Plugged one into my TV and 5 minutes later I was watching Netflix. Wondered if I could plug it into one of my soundbar's HDMI inputs. VOILA!, works like a champ. I haven't yet figured out all of this great little gizmo's capabilities, but if my first 5 minutes with it is any indicator, I'm looking forward to a really good time exploring all it's features. BRAVO, Google... you've got a real game-changer here!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />From Google Chrome, go to your Amazon account, go to Your Prime, select your movie, click the Cast tab in the browser, and there you are. Amazon Prime on Chromecast!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This is a scary little book that stuck with me after I read it. While reading it and afterwards I got a nice little shiver of .....heebie jeebies!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|You may like it.  I do not care for it.  I tried to rate it with zero stars, but Amazon's minimum is 1.  Amazon's descriptions of applications leave much to be desired.  I have found little actual descriptions of what an application actually does without first trying it.  Perhaps there should be a trial period of a few days in which to try the product before purchase.  I have been a loyal Amazon purchaser, rather too frequently in the past.  I am going to delete this application from my device.  Will I also get credit for not using it?
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was a quick and enjoyable read. Certainly not the depth or excitement of Hunger Games or even Divergent but it kept your interest.

B00DHSK3RM|1.0|why have the largest growing game out there not getting any play on Kindle? The market is huge. What an epic fail for Amazon :(
0061191981|1.0|This book is just a compilation of stories and excerpts from Gordon Ramsay's other books. It's a total rehash job that made me mad that I wasted money on the same information I'd already read! Very disappointing.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have The Weather Channel on my Kindle and I Love it. It's so handy to have the weather at my finger tips. I go nowhere without my Kindle and I need to know what my day is going to be like. I live on the coast of California and just a few miles inland the weather can be as much as 20 degrees different. Gotta dress the part appropriately!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game pulls you in...I makes you want to keep going from level to level. I can not wait to see what comes next.
B00578FKVE|3.0|Love this series! Hope there will be more seasons to come.  Great actors! Love Amazon Prime, much better than any other service!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|A charismatic, expert pilot averts a near-disaster, and afterward deals with personal, professional hazards. I was electrified by both. I could watch it over and over just because it was so believable for me.  I applaud the story writer and the music director!
B000E1MXU0|4.0|I remembered this being a decent show back when it came out.  Flash forward over 20 years and I think it still plays well.  Visually the show was stunning then--and it looks good now.  Typical Tim Burton.  Of all his movies, I've always had the impression he's kind of a visual guy.<br /><br />The plot?  Not too bad.  With an action show, I don't need much, and this was pretty good.  If I had to nitpick, I'd say that they could of gotten to the heart of the matter a bit faster, there were some parts of it that I felt were slow.  This too reminds me of much of TB's work as well, now I think about it.<br /><br />I'm a throwback, but I still love my old PSP, so I was very pleased to find this movie on a UMD for it.  If you enjoyed the show 20 years ago or so, I think you'll enjoy it now.
1781162646|5.0|I was taken in by this story, a who-done-it.  Stephen King proves he can write a mystery with the same magic as his scary stories. I was led to care about his characters, and what happened to each of them. The images he creates are still in my mind.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|really fun I recommend it to pony fans you get to go pony and make the city it's awsome thumbs up for the game
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like this app. It's easy to use, and rather intuitively set up. The only problem I have is that it's still a bit cumbersome for me to pin things (products or photos) I find online that don't have a Pin-It button already embedded in their web page even when I have this app.
B00D0SA8I8|3.0|Used it twice and worked ok. It prom's a little late in some aera of the city, making me go in round about a block or three.
B003XMKN40|2.0|Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy etc., did'nt play some of their best songs. I like the blues, but this festival only had a couple of good blues songs.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|I like this, much more easy to view picture and movie except it drain the battery faster, need to buy a spare battery
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I gave the book one star, because this website demands a star marked.<br /><br />I've been looking around at the promotional material concerning this book an its author. That material does not mention that fact that the author is a Muslim but promotes his scholarly credentials only. If I were writing a book about Muslim, I would definitely and emphatically reveal my Christian belief up front.<br /><br />His marketing approach is and, apparently from all I've read, has been dishonest. It does not matter if he never mentions Islam in the pages of his book. Hidden agenda motivates a writer to distort and hide truth. Do you think a Muslim would write good things about Jesus? Of course not. If he had been upfront, no problem. He wasn't. That's a problem for any author.<br /><br />Richard Speights
B00AREIAI8|5.0|OHEMGEEE THIS IS SO FUN I LOVE IT SO MUCH I COULD SCREAM THIS GAME CONSUMES PRETTY MUCH MY WHOLE LIFE
B003L77FYS|5.0|I really crime-solvers shows. I really enjoy Castle. I like all the characters on the show. Especially Castle and Beckett.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I do not understand why kindle would not have more cases available for this product==maybe scratch proof, water proof, I went to many stores and for this reason would not recommend a kindle even if price is lower
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Not a very good read.  Poorly laid back story. Very simple.  I wonder if it was written for teens.  why write so many 250 page books when you could just write several larger ones.  I'm used to the wheel of time series.  800 plus pages.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I played this game about a dozen times, but now it won't load. Just hangs at a loading screen .  I can't even close it, I have to turn off my Kindle.  Uninstalled.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|These guys have really got it together! If you have never heard them before. check out their video's on YouTube, you will love their sound. I would love to just hang out with them, they seem to really enjoy what they are doing.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|First, the book is well written besides that it goes down hill from there mainly because it teaches new age philosophy that man can do no wrong and thus God loves him. Also, the book talks about becoming one with the Umm (might not have spelled it right). The book completely contradicts Alexanders &#34;Christian&#34; stance. Don't waste your time with this book. Instead, buy the book &#34;Jesus Calling&#34;.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Great puzzle game, well worth the 2 dollars if you got it. Not finished  it yet, but the puzzles are enticing.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Ordered this for a granddaughter - age 2 - she loves it.  Watches over and over .  Very happy with this purchase
140006922X|5.0|I have kept up with historical Jesus scholarship over the years, even attending the first ever 3 day seminar of (then) historical Jesus<br />scholars gathered together (panel event) at Duke University. It was fascinating, but not as much so as Aslan's book.<br /><br />For Aslan delves into context more than any I've read and if one doesn't pay close attention to the context of the times, pretty much<br />most will be missed.<br /><br />His view of Jesus is a different one, but one that makes as much or more sense (with extensive scholarship) as any of the other renowned historical Jesus scholars and writers.<br /><br />Fascinating book and I truly appreciate that it has been written. The idea that Aslan was born in Iran, raised a very \\"lukewarm\\" Muslim, yet<br />converted to Christianity after coming to the states holds zero bearing on the value and superb scholarship of this book. If anything, Aslan is able to see with both Eastern and Western eyes (something other scholars can't lay claim to) and this is critical. The fact that Aslan puts so much focus on context is the key. He knows his stuff and it shows.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I love anything that Lady Antebellum sings...have seen them in concert and they are great.  Also the Christmas Album was good.
B00633W614|5.0|very fast read..I thought the last part became a little trite but still enjoyed reading it. I'm now reading the last book.<br />thank you.<br />Sharon Cohen
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|Great movie but a bit slow by modern standards.  Excellent ending and good acting and storyline. Graphics look pretty updated.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is fun, and a nice way to waste time!! It definitely gets harder and harder as it goes on.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|If you expect an in-depth story line you will be disappointed. If you want action (car chases and explosions) this is definitely full of them. This is a good action movie!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I enjoyed the first season and anxiously await the next.  I especially liked Kevin Spacey, the cunniing Congressman, looking into the camera telling  you what is happening throughout.  Helps keep the viewer on track!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a truly unique story. Great character development. Lots of attention to details which makes it all the more gripping.
B00AEFYDV8|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies.  Matt Damon, in one of his early performances, does a great job as a caring lawyer.
6305090564|5.0|This film has spectacular special effects. If you have ever played or read H. P. Lovecraft Call of Cthulu, you will immediately see a resemblance between these creatures. The actors are great too. I espcially like the grease monkey. Another of his great charactter roles in horro films. See him in the Mummy and in Van Helsing.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|I had never heard of this before today but it looked good so I said what the heck I'll check it out and if I don't like it I'll just turn to something else. Well, it was a great movie with the perfect ending. Strongly recommend you check this out!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|so addicted. its such a fun game. I cant seam to put it down. if I could play thins all the time I would but my kindel dies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game cant stop playing it hoping to unlock more things soon then have more to do hoping to get a few friends playing
B00871C09S|5.0|My favorite movie ever it's  got everything you could want in a movie. Love, action, suspense, great music, beautiful scenes and the beautiful Grace Kelly !
B003L77GGK|5.0|First, this gets 5 stars because of speed of delivery and packaging. I happen to love this series also. I started watching season 1 because of boredom one day. Not sure how I obtained it but I had Season 1 and 2. I'm a junkie now and when I like something I don't just go half way I go nuts, so says the hubby. I don't believe in moderation. I bought the other 6 seasons, 2 at a time on a weekly basis. Again, if you are going to purchase a TV series my advice is to buy where the bargains are and Amazon, so far is that vendor.
B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|I like this movie cause it kept you on your toes..didn't know what was going to happen next..was pretty good
B004YM6JI2|5.0|First, this gets 5 stars because of speed of delivery and packaging. I happen to love this series also. I started watching season 1 because of boredom one day.

I would recommend this to anybody looking for a great deal who loves Supernatural.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is a great way to waste your family time during game nights I find the family is sometimes arguing who should go first
B000UZNRS2|5.0|David Baldacci is a great story teller, I have enjoyed every one of his books and this one is one of the best. Thank you!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app. it is so fun. you got to buy this app. and it has very little ads.
1623420148|5.0|I haven't read many books from the guys pov.  I must say I loved it!  I would most definitely read more books like this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is greater than regular temple run! very fun and enjoyable!!! what I like is that is shows things from the movie making you what to watch it even more :)#
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Another great tale by Neil Gaimen, it is typical Gaimen to be mysterious and confusing in places only to be tied together with emotional response instead of explanations. It really sucks you in and in the end you feel like you experienced what the main character went through. I would recommend reading for those who love deep fantasy based short stories.<br />This is similar to &#34;Smoke & Mirrors&#34; as they are all short stories and not really full length novels.
B008602KQI|4.0|As with almost every movie based on books, there are differences but the plot omissions and slight revisions fits well as a movie.
B003XRELGQ|3.0|Not a terrible book, but far from the best i have read. I is a confusing drawn out story about nothing in particular that keeps you hoping for something amazing to happen. I don't want to ruin the ending, but if you get halfway through and feel like it can only get better, put it down... because it doesn't. There are a few interesting and funny parts and I thought it was an incredibly easy read.
0545128285|4.0|I was kinda expecting it to be longer, considering the price, but overall, I really enjoyed this book :) Another great contribution from J.K. Rowling.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a fun game to play for 5 - 10 minutes at a time.  No in app purchases to deal with.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have a bad ass 5.1 theater setup with xbox 360 and ps3 all networked.  I currently use apps on those devices for my media streaming but I was curious.  Chromecast is a great addition to the family.  I received the device earlier today, setup was a breeze.  I've been casting youtube videos from my IPhone 5 all day with no issues.  The first video you should fire up is Tomorrowland 2011.  This device will be perfect when Google adds casting ability to the browser on the IPhone.  Then I will never leave the house.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|Excellent series, easy to play, entertaining but still challenging.  I like going back to make sure I get 3 stars and the trophy for each course.
B00157NQ7Q|5.0|My December is fantastic!! Kelly Clarkson depicts great emotion in a lot of her songs and I can relate to many. This is by far one of my favorite albums of hers.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I enjoyed jack the giant slayer for its moments of comedy at just the right time as well as the digital graphic artwork that was delightful \\"an old story with a new twist\\".
B000L53D4O|4.0|I bought this for my great niece who is 9 months old and learning to walk. She likes to play with it but she is not ready to walk behind it yet. The child needs to be quite steady on her/his feet with good balance since the walker will scoot ahead causing the child to fall forward. Probably better to use on carpet rather than wood or vinyl flooring.
014241543X|4.0|This book is the first person, out of body, narrative of a young woman who was seriously injured in a car accident. You read about her and her family and friends through flashback. You also know what is happening in real time through her out of body experience. The story is about making choices and how the hardest ones to make can bring the best rewards. There is also a teen romance between the main character and a completely endearing Adam. If I were a teenager....<br /><br />I liked the story enough to read it on one sitting. It was a quick read that can definitely stand on its own, you don't have to read the follow up, but it's good too.  This is a good YA story.  Good, engaging characters.  It's thoughtful without being overly dramatic.
B00846REIS|1.0|Horrible! No story line and unnecessarily vulgar. Trash novel compared to 50 shades. At least 50 shades made you care about the characters
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Sad, funny and enlightening.  I cried the whole last chapter.  I loved this book.  Best $3.99 I've spent in a long time.
B000W1QX0I|5.0|It's rock, progressive rock, but no soft at all.  Rousing, with very fast foot tapping beats.  Chick Corea & Stanley Clarke in the same band - awesome!
B000FVE3AC|5.0|I love the blue color dial face on this classic style heavy duty diver's watch. The all stainless steel band and case with screw-down crown are great. I like that the watch is water resistance rating to 300 meters and that it is a 21-jewel automatic movement. This is a heavy duty watch, but feels really great on your arm.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book fairly quickly - it's a story that will keep you going, you certainly always want to know what will happen next.  I try to read mainly historical fictions, so that I'm learning something as I'm reading a story, but every so often I'll reach for something like the Huger Games, or a Dan Brown (although Dan Brown does put some history into his thrillers at least).  I would put this book in that realm.  You won't get any smarter for it, but it will keep you reading until you're at the last page.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Loved it. Better than his first two books. I would recommend this in a minute.<br />Barbara and I will soon.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Great history of the band, and the personnel. DVD # 2 shows the 80's during the hiatus and again how talented and great songwriters D & G were as solo artists. Now while the presentation of Don and Glenn is very positive in the DVD as opposed to some of the presentation in Felder's book between the two the balance is great and lets face it, They are pampered egotistical and hard working creative people who arguably impacted the music business and peoples lives as much as the Beatles. i play in a Eagles tribute band (The Long Run-Colorado's tribute to the Eagles) and people are always coming up after the shows and sharing how much that music holds a place in their lives and memories. For me as well.<br />highly entertaining documentary and the concert from L.A. on the Hotel tour is great!<br />I highly recommend !!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't understand I downloaded the app and I have it but then it will disappear and I have to go to the Appstore and it says open. But if I look through my apps it is there so
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Americanah is one of the best books I read in a while.  It is a great love story as well as a book that deals with many issues immigrants deal when they are in their new homeland, legally or illegally.  It addresses many issues black people face in USA, regardless whether they are born in this country or born abroad.  I reccommend this book to anybody who is invloved in diversity education as there are many parts of the book that could be used in diversity classes.  Thooroughly enjoed it and couldn't put this book down.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Okay, the game is ok until you figure out Team Larva is not updating this game. They're only updating on iOS. To me it's not really fun of a game when you figure that out. But other then that this game is OK. I just really hate how we can't get the full update of the game.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Pretty good story, I think the authors need to point out every time the kids are naked was a little creepy.  The bigger picture though, was an interesting portrayal of leadership, and the isolation that can come with it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|The book was hard to get in the beginning but the book got slot better I really liked how you got us thinking that the sword instucter (sorry I forgot his name) was a spy for Luke.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I do not necessarily like the changes made.  I received a notice that I was asking for friends that I do not know and that is definitely not true.  Maybe someone did not recognize my married name.  Had a hard time getting back into facebook.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a great game th o play it teaches u hand eye coordination and take u to different places they have great power ups u should try this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a real page turner, couldn't get enough, I can't wait to get book three.  I also love it because I can get it with audible, and listen while I walk.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is sooo very fun! I love it! It's good for if you don't have amything to do or are on a long car ride.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|Bought this for my son so he could protect his kindle fire when we are on the road... He has a rubber case on his kindle,,, well to put his kindle in the sleeve he has to take off his rubber case---what if he drops it, it won't be protected.... Wouldn't recommend this product.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game, similar to Temple Run. Honestly, I think it is better because I like the cartooney graphics. Also, there is no need to tilt your device. Just swipe your finger. The gameplay is easy to pick up. There are lots of things to unlock, and they change it every month, adding new stuff and altering the theme of the whole game. I think I may be addicted. I can't stop playing it, because it is so much fun.
0545265355|5.0|Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer and outstanding storyteller! She writes with such clarity that I can imagine the characters in the book and feel for each of their pain. I love reading about the characters: Katnis, Peeta, Rue and Cinna. Every chapter will keep you in suspense and it is hard to put the book down!  I highly recommend reading these series, they're excellent! And I can hardly wait for the second series, &#34;Catching Fire&#34; the movie to come out towards the end of this year!
B005IS565S|5.0|I own EVERY ALBUM & On this album i love every single song and know every single word they are that good! buy it!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|I own EVERY ALBUM & On this album i love every single song and know every single word they are that good! buy it! ! ! ! !
B00CZAYNOC|2.0|Im just being completely honest here.. this album is very different than the others.. on the other albums i like each and every song on them... this album i like only 2 or three... :( very sad...<br />like someone else on here said \\"When a song on this album is good, it's great, but when a song is bad, it's horrible\\" I couldnt agree more.. its like they are becoming sell outs which one of their songs says they wont.. but the way this album is sounding they are becoming sellouts.. :(
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is a cool game but, it will be awesome if you get to unlock more characters like in the first temple run
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I watched the movies despicable me 1 and 2 and they are awesome you guys just need to see these amazing movie
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King doesn't pull any punches and he's extemely honest about his own personal issues.  I didn't expect it to be as autobiographical as it was but by sharing his personal story it helps the reader understand his journey into writing.  From the pesonal standpoint I was impressed that he gives so much credit to him wife.  They seem like a wonderful team.<br /><br />The writing suggestions were to the point and he continued to drill the most important aspects into the readers head, so to speak.  I don't enjoy horror as a genre but his advice was invaluable for the creation of any type of fiction.  I'd strongly suggest it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This is a stupendous book that tells a tale about treachery, new places, and adventure. If you are going to read this, know that you are about to enter a world of individuality!<br />-Anonymous Reader
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I only recently discovered Bruno Mars.  Being in my 60s, I don't usually listen to the Top10 radio stations.  However, when I downloaded the album, I realized I had actually heard several of the songs in various contexts.  I like it a lot...it is up-tempo without the pounding bass that seems so common these days.  Many of the songs are very lyrical, and they kind of stick in your head.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just an awesome game for my son!!!!! I would give this game 10 THUMBS. Gotta love the minions. GO MINIONS
B008D28HYS|4.0|I would rate this as a five star app if it was updated more often. I love doing the puzzles but it gets boring after doing the same puzzle time after time
B009PNQUXO|1.0|It will keep crashing, remove it.<br />Nice idea, but did not play or download anything.<br />I tried on two phones, one running ICS and othre JB, and the same..
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I went to see this show in Atlanta and I'm here to tell you that it is AWESOME.  There is not a single artist in the music industry that puts on a show like THE QUEEN.  People may complain that she charges too much for tickets but you definitely get your  moneys worth, it is non-stop visual effects from beginning to end.  Quite honestly I have never seen anything like it.  She was awarded the BIGGEST TOUR OF THE YEAR award for this show and it is just that, unbelievable...
B006LSZECO|2.0|It dragged on for too many pages, describing things that was not relevant to the story.<br />I only bought it because I belong to a mystery book club, and it was the book chosen by a few people in the club.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this twist &amp; turning game. Helps me sleep believe it or not... thanks a million.<br />I rate this game a 10 but it only goes to 5...
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a great game I really enjoy. You should try it it really great you can get a lot of points
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is definitely a mind jogger. It is good for all ages and I personally would recommend it. My sister loves the game and trying to beat me in it. Not yet small fry! ;)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great it keeps you thinking. Just when I think I won't get through to the next level, surprise I find that clue. Can't wait to see the next level.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|The DVD is fantastic. Great movie and awesome special features including a documentary, deleted scenes and audio commentary by Oliver Stone.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Better than the first book and it pist me off sometimes because Percy knew the people from the other books
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is amazing to play the game and great because it is free that is the best part about the game because people who don't have money they can get the game.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is an  awesome yet complicated game but I love the different emojis but I still think that you should not have to pay coins for upgrades such as solving the puzzle
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book keeps you wanting more.  I can not wait for the second book in this trilogy.  Thank you .
B001RTSPVY|5.0|WOW!! If I could only give it six stars, and the ending, holy moly, a doble dose of WOW!! I'm hooked and out the door to best buy for season 3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had been wanting to watch this show but never had the chance to. So glad to find it on Amazon Prime instant streaming. Love the characters, their flaws, their stories.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|it's  a challenge  but i like it alot it makes me think and that is  always  good :-) the graphics  on it aren't  bad either very clear  and nice picture
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|The game was really awesome, but it took up too much space to the point where I had to delete all of my games to keep it.
B006YC74E8|1.0|This was the most complicated thing I have ever had to use. There were so many adds and I never even found out how to edit a photo.
B00C2IPB9S|5.0|I decided to upgrade one of the greatest movies of all time the dark knight to steelbook and man im in love with the case;) the picture on the front with a building and bat logo on fire and that reads \\"welcome to a world without rules\\" bad! And the inside with bad pod, doesn't get any cooler! Definitely recommend it, only 10 bucks!
B00CH26TL8|1.0|This game was the most boring most complicated piece of crap &#34;game&#34;. If you buy it I apologize for your waste of time.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I use these on Skype meetings in a noisy office environment. Everyone on the other end was thankful when I got these - the mic reception is narrow and clear. The earpieces block a good deal of environmental noise, but not all of it. The 7.1 surround via software processing is excellent; I can't tell much difference between this virtualized 7.1 and an actual 7.1 setup. The wireless signal gets interrupted occasionally due to interference - there are numerous other sources of wifi and microwave signals in the office, and the sound and mic will cut out for a few seconds while the connection is reestablished. This can be problematic when missing important comments in a meeting. As much as I love the wireless freedom, I wish there was an option to connect a wire to increase connection reliability.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it is the best game ever!!! totally buy this!!!! and it has very little ads. you must try this app.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|really easy at first, but gets harder as you go. enjoy playing Alone or with a group. not to easy for younger children. good for terns and up.
B002NPUCRQ|4.0|It took 10 days to receive, which was sort of disappointing. Also when I got it, it had two large scratches, one on the front and one on the back of the case. But, I love the CD inside, so that's what matters. Thanks!
1612183956|4.0|Stayed up until 3AM reading this book, hours melting away. Did not see the ending coming until he started spelling it out for the reader. Half the fun was trying to come up with theories on what was going on, each of which would be proven wrong on the next page.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|Movie lived up to expectations given from the previews. It was a nice twist on the original folk tale story.
B002PLALCO|5.0|I couldn't find my original !  In withdrawal, I re discovered the one I bought, live from England.. ( great too) but just reordered my missing FUNHOUSE dvd as  I just love the cinematography ...and I was shocked with the closeups to see her ACTUALLY SINGING THROUGH her insane acrobatics. and she makes it appear effortless. There is NO ONE in the history of music like PINK  Wait till you see how sexy she is in this, how DOES she  ( almost) wear those things without splitting them out !!<br />..gorgeous, talented, exciting, humerous.. she has a lot of fun in her performances,  it shines clear through .  I excercise each morning watching this, never get sick of it,<br />and the bigger the screen you watch this on, the better.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I've read many books on near-death experiences and have enjoyed them all.  I don't need to be convinced of our spiritual body going to another realm once our physical body dies, but the stories are usually quite powerful and transformational experiences for those involved which usually engage me.  Some people disregard those stories as hallucination etc.  In the case of Anita Moorjani, there is concrete evidence of the sequence of events that believers and skeptics alike should enjoy.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Highly recommended.  Figure out you.  Look out for number 1, because no one else is.  I'd put this in the must read category.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed the Sigma Force series of novels and this one is no different. I look forward to James Rollins' next Sigma Force novel.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|For those of us who love everything Neil Gaiman does, this is a still a fresh experience, not only revealing aspects of his past, but provoking thoughtful exploration of our own.
B00AYQNOFI|5.0|I've heard from others how powerful this movie was and now I understand why.  It's message is captivating and leads one to examine &#34;how things really are&#34; in greater depth.  The impact it made without dialogue is true artistry.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I had this app awhile on my kindle but never used, yesterday I used it for the first time to wake me at 6:30, I am generally a light sleeper as long as I get proper rest. I did but, when the alarm we off it was so faint you could barely hear it and my volume was maxed. I will be deleting it, it is good for looking at the time but not for a alarm clock.
0060853980|2.0|A lot of the writing is very funny. But by the of the 300-0dd pages (it seemed like more) I was still as much aware of the plot as I was in the first page. I guess i'm not of the cultists who so much treasuredthis book.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I can't quite explain in words how much I enjoyed this movie. It's such a beautiful movie, both aesthetically and in its meaning. It's such a unique movie that it's easily gone down as one of my favorites.
1451695195|5.0|After reading the Kindle version of the book, I bought the hardcopy for my parish priest to get his opinion about the descriptions of Dr. Alexander's journey into the afterlife. His response was very positive. Those that diminish this book on scientific grounds miss the whole point that Dr. Alexander is making. The scientific method breaks down in the spiritual realm because our measurement systems are limited to 3 dimensions and to linear time. Dr. Alexander has written an enjoyable story and has examined all the possible explanations for his experience. His conclusion that there is a spirit that lives after the body is soundly supported by his methods. This book gives great hope for us because of the unconditional love of God that Dr. Alexander experienced first-hand. Love God and love one another and you have nothing to fear.
B008JFURF6|2.0|I was not a fan of the first Smurfs, 6/10 but he sequel is very disappointing because it never focuses on anything ever , I wanted to no more of the story of where Smurfette slowly becomes a naughty and develops a bond with Vexy and Hagus , but then they would focus on The family aspect and forget completely about the fact that Gargamel is popular and he shouldn't even be well like somebody should of seen him being evil by turning Patricks step dad into a duck (even though it is not that evil but just something that you should not do ) , and the movie has horrible pacing like one scene there flying on hires then there on a rolercoaster then in a sewer . Also since it is a smurfs movie , it should be really light hearted but its really dark here which is disappointing. I give this movie a 5/10
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Brittany Howard is a powerhouse of a singer, and her band i one well-oiled machine.<br /><br />Tracks 1-3 are my favorites, but the rest of the CD is pretty great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Keeps you busy for hours, fun, easy, and entertaining. If you like solitaire, you'll love this app. Love that you have many options to customize your game.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|This book starts out kind of weird... and at first you don't really feel sorry for Alex, the main character in the book. At first I wanted to shake Alex and ask him &#34;what are you thinking.&#34;  The more you read and the more you get into the book you start to realize and feel  that the things Alex is saying in the book are things that you can relate to. You start to understand his perception of happiness and freedom. Things that Alex  is willing to risk, to say &#34;I did it.&#34; Even if it means risking his life to achieve dreams and goals that most people only dream about, because they are to scared to even try. I wish the book would have ended differently... it made me sad to believe that someone so loved by many, could end up so alone and helpless.  I highly recommend this book, it will make you see things in a different perspective.
B006Z00R1Q|3.0|Okay movie.  I've seen better. Held my attention, but was a bit disjointed at times. Left me desiring something more.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|It was a privilege to be able to hear these talented performers sing the songs they helped to make famous.
0984183523|5.0|The author has comprehensively developed practical, logical steps in solving business cases, useful in preparing for interviews. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in doing consulting work
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|IT was VERY fun and easy but did have some turns i did not expect.Some of the battles are a bit harder for younger ages and on larger devices.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Since the latest update, it won't load anymore. Loved playing but for now until it's FIXED, I'll give it one star. Once fixed, I'll change the rating.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I read it to find out what all the fuss was about. Did not make me jump up and down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very entertaining app I like it alot if you like horses but cant get one you should get this app
B0043WDK2G|5.0|The cheesy tongue-in-cheek humor mixed with the puzzle of the day somehow remains fresh and entertaining! Such a reliable watch!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|I searched for an app that would let me play a .mov file sent to me by my daughter, of my granddaughter, who lives 800 miles away.  Description said it would work on my Kindle Fire.  It doesn't.  Still can't watch the video.  I've been working on this all day, with no joy.  Deleted it as I don't need any more apps that don't work on my Kindle.  I tried to get help from Amazon.  I received an email saying they didn't know what app I was talking about and to send them more information.  The e-mail mysteriously vanished, like it had a self-destruct.  Talk about mission impossible.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|Was watching another DVD and saw the previews to this movie. Bought the DVD and story was predictable and somewhat disappointed in the movie. Worth a watch but will probably be one of those DVD I never watch again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|FUN game. I like to play when I have to wait in lines. Kids love to play it on my kindle
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Amazing true story about an amazing humble man. Loaned this DVD to several people already and they had to get their own copies
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Very nice family movie,  It proves that you don't have to have sex, swearing, etc. to make a great movie
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|So I read The Governess Affair novella right before I read this book, and had it very fresh in my mind. I really enjoyed that one and was hoping to see a little more of the main characters from that in this one. None of their personalities or quirks were revealed at all in the few scenes they had, but that's neither here nor there. My biggest issue came on page 127. Milan has Robert revealing his secret adolescent hopes that Oliver's family would take a shine to him and invite him into the fold. He is convinced that one day he will marry Oliver's OLDER sister. What?! How in the world can there be an older sister when Oliver's mother had been a virgin before being impregnated and his mother's husband didn't have any kids before either? So if I hadn't been looking for great continuity of the other character  in this series I probably wouldn't have cared and would have enjoyed this as a great stand alone novel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this game with my 16 month old son on my lap.  he loves it and I get to have fun too!
B000FCJZ3G|2.0|There are other books that are more interesting and helpful,<br />and will give you more value for the money.<br /><br />Some of the books I own and can strongly recommend instead are,<br /><br />&#34;Rich Dad Poor Dad&#34;, by Robert Kiyosaki<br /><br />&#34;Millionaire Next Door&#34;, by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko<br /><br />&#34;I Will Teach You To Be Rich&#34;, by Ramit Sethi<br /><br />&#34;The Richest Man In Babylon&#34; by George S. Clason
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|It was a great game and I was scared to even try to win but I let my friend play the game and he beat the whole thing but all it said at the end was game over you win I think something should have happened at the end.But I can't wait for chapter two overall it was good.
B0007KTBIU|3.0|The case was in extremely poor condition, and did not say that it would be. However, the disc is what you actually watch, and it was ok.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|I really like this app. It is good for long car rides because kids will stop asking are we there yet are  we there yet.
B0063GORYU|5.0|try to beat your own score every time you play. even your own time. I give it a five star rating.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a really fun &amp; funny game, I Love it, and I Love challenging my ,daughter, we do that all the time, we do that almost everyday.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|Beautiful collection of songs and poetry can be heard from these nice CDs . Very soothing rendentions of music with nice background composition!
0307271080|5.0|I'm sure the comparison is tired by now, but Adichie is an African Zadie Smith; in fact, I think I may have liked Americanah better than anything I've ready by Smith. There's this unwavering cultural intellect that exudes from every word on every page. It's powerful, it's thought-provoking, and it's intimidating. In a nutshell: it's wonderful.<br /><br />Gushing<br />- The characters, whether we're talking about the Ifemelu or Obinze, or even the minor ones like Dike, are multi-faceted and well-developed.<br />- The narrative is complicated; the present is told in a linear fashion, but she constantly returns to the past to support what she's doing in the present. Adichie trusts her reader to understand where she's going and when. The path taken allows the reader to obtain such an intense understanding of Ifemelu and her history.<br />- The juxtaposition between America and Nigeria is done incredibly well. Being present for Ifemelu's discovery and handling of this, both when she moves to America and when she moves back home, is fascinating.<br />- As a middle-class white woman, this book made me think, and it even made me defensive at times. Being from such a generic race I don't pause to consider my own status in society often; this book made me.<br />- I loved the attention to little things; the food, the hair styles, the tones of voice.<br /><br />For You?<br />- This book is dense. It's long. It's well-written. It's not easy read, though, so know what you're getting yourself into.
1609611543|5.0|Have used this book for several months and found it very informative and enlightening... used several of the recipes which I found very good and easy to do!
B000001ELL|5.0|Dynasty is highly underrated and it's actually my favorite Kiss record next to Destroyer. The sound is less heavy than on their past records but it was a good direction. They experiment with disco a bit as well but it's not nearly as poppy as their follow-up Unmaksed. The lyrical direction is a bit different as well and more mature than on their previous records. This would also be the last time that all the original members make a full contribution to an album. Peter didn't contribute nearly as much but did vocals and lyrics for Dirty Livin'; Ace makes a great contribution on Save Your Love, Hard Times and a cover of The Rolling Stones 2000 Man. Gene (X-Ray Eyes, Charsima) and Paul (I Was Made For Lovin' You, Sure Know Something, Magic Touch) make a good equal contribution as well. All members get to make a good contribution throughout and as an Ace fan, Dynasty is one of my favorites from Kiss and a great rock album in general. Ace never contributed much to the band until Dynasty and is arguably the highlight of the 4 here. Never understood why so many people called them sell-outs when I only find the direction of Dynasty original and it was their first that was more than straight-up rock/metal. Despite it's negative reception from fans, it was still highly successful which went multi-platinum and is just successful as Destroyer or Love Gun. I Was Made For Lovin' You was a huge hit in 1979 and among their most successful single to date. Kiss both gained and lost fans with Dynasty, Peter and Ace would eventually leave the band and they didn't make an album this complete until '92 Revenge.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and easy to play.  Like the graphics. Many different games and jump courses. Nice variety of accessories too.  My daughter got me playing and I'm glad she did.<br />This rev I we usually because orient let me finish n rate it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game like a brother but I try to sleep but it says I can only sleep at night but it's never night so I'm confused.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|A movie to sit back and enjoy.  Goofy, juvenile jokes and lines makes it fun while in the midst of it the storyline of sibling rivalry between McBride and Franco's characters is actually pretty uplifting as they work things out to the conclusion.  Basically it was as low-brow as I expected but more emotionally involved then I'd imagined it would be, in terms of the brothers coming together and how Portman's character helps McBride's grow up.  Yeah, it's not a high artform classic but it has its moments and overall a good, &#34;happy movie to chill with.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and I love the challenges and world themes<br />By selina lindroth<br />Can u do USA next though ?

B000VNMMQG|4.0|The film is a good dramatic presentation of Britain's abolitionist movement. It has high production values and good acting. Lovers of period films will enjoy this.
0375869026|5.0|What a wonderful handbook for learning about empathy and kindness.  The main character is charming and authentic as he struggles to make friends and deal with the reality of his facial handicap.
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|And people thought \\"The Hobbit\\" was an overly-delayed prequel. It has nothing on the prequel to the classic movie \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" which came out almost 75 years after the original.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's easy to see why \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" turned out to be a massive disappointment. It tries to coast on all the recognizable people and things from the original \\"Wizard of Oz,\\" in the hopes that you won't notice the tacky CGI, the lackluster acting and the plot composed almost entirely of cliches. In other words... pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.<br /><br />While escaping an angry husband, stage magician/con-man Oscar \\"Oz\\" Diggs (James Franco) escapes in a hot-air balloon and is sucked into a tornado. Of course, he arrives in the widescreen, Technicolor paradise of Oz.<br /><br />He is is quickly hailed by the witch sisters Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weisz) as the legendary wizard who will save them all by killing the Wicked Witch. Oz is more than happy to oblige, since success means he will become king of the Emerald City AND get a Scrooge McDuck vault filled with treasure. So he sets off to kill the Wicked Witch.<br /><br />Turns out Evanora is the true Wicked Witch, and the witch he's pursuing is the Good Witch Glinda (Michelle Williams). And with Evanora -- along with the newly-transformed, very angry Theodora -- preparing to assault Glinda's domain, Oz has to come up with a plan to defeat a pair of powerful witches, with an army of Tinkers, Munchkins and Quadlings. Can a wizard triumph without any magic?<br /><br />When you peel away the pyrotechnics and CGI, \\"Oz The Great And Powerful\\" doesn't have a lot of substance. It's yet another story about a con-man-with-a-heart-of-gold (is there any other kind in Hollywood?) who is called upon to become a hero and reform himself. Every single aspect of this story is painfully predictable -- you can guess exactly what will happen all the time.<br /><br />In short, \\"Oz\\" feels sort of like a marshmallow peep: sweet and brightly colored, but empty of actual substance. And after consuming it for awhile, you start to feel a little queasy.<br /><br />It doesn't help that Sam Raimi's signature style is nowhere to be found -- it's smothered in a vast sea of giant CGI flowers and glossy, fake-looking panoramas. The movie is crammed full of unnecessary CGI (why do the evil witches FLY everywhere?) and references to things from the original movie... and yet, strangely, no \\"ruby slippers\\" origin story. There are also a couple of comic-relief sidekicks (a china girl and a talking monkey) who are inserted just for the comic relief -- and instead they make this rambling movie feel about twice as long as it actually is.<br /><br />But there are a few saving graces -- mostly James Franco and Rachel Weisz. Franco is oddly convincing (if a bit hammy) as a white-smiling wastrel who aspires to \\"greatness,\\" but who isn't such a bad guy after all. And while Weisz's character is OBVIOUSLY evil right from the start, she brings a brittle, charming energy to her character's outright evilness.<br /><br />On the other hand, Kunis is relentlessly awful. At first she's a simpering, prancing little girl just experiencing her first crush. But after her transformation, she shows her evilness by glaring at people and making your ears bleed with her screeching. Leave the screeching, posing and scenery-chewing to Margaret Hamilton.<br /><br />Williams is almost as bad. She plays the connivingly saccharine Glinda as a doe-eyed, sentimental damsel who seems pathetically weak and stupid compared to the powerful Wicked sisters. Seriously, she even gets captured by a pair of flying monkeys WHILE HOLDING HER WAND. Even Oz seems more magical than she does.<br /><br />\\"Oz The Great and Powerful\\" tries to dazzle you with CGI and charm you with comic relief, but it doesn't flesh out a pitifully underdeveloped plot.s sort of like a marshmallow peep: sweet and brightly colored, but empty of actual substance.

0062082353|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  A great read about the Navy Seals and a great American hero.  Sadly he's gone now.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I watched, and thoroughly enjoyed, the movie before reading the book. The screen play conversion gives a projection of the story which makes the characters enjoyable to watch. The novel portrays the life of a neurotic man who, in reality, you would wish to avoid. The book portrays his slow mental recovery in a way that is amusing and entertaining. I found time to read the book when I should have been busy elsewhere; savoured the story and regretted that reading so fast would end the experience too quickly.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|and had been waiting for the ending.  Too bad he didn't get to finish it himself, but at least it has been completed.
B003629IPW|5.0|I enjoyed his music and his concerts. this one is a great one to get if you like to his last concert that he did the rehearsals for.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|It was difficult to follow and read like someone describing the effects of a bad drug. It was not worthy of the hype.
B003YOXINU|5.0|I enjoy his genesis stuff and his solo stuff. this one is a good one to get if you like his solo stuff in 1992.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|It was okay. I would watch it again on TV, maybe. It was entraining for a cheap movie. Rent was low that is.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A fantastic tool. Easy to use and more to the point easy to see. Nice large buttons and read out.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I use a poket knife quite often and I find that the blade needs shapening alot. This sharpener is small and handy to have around.<br /><br />I can carry it in my pocket or throw it in a drawer until needed. It sharpens serrated blades as well as regular edged blades
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is the best rendition of the book I have seen, by far it beats anything else.<br />The film score is wonderful<br />the chemistry was well set and the whole production was over the top.<br />thanks to all who had a part in it, you've really outdone yourselves.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The delivery was excellent.  With the new headphones, I have been playing the piano an extra half hour a day. I can barely hear outside sounds and don't even notice I am wearing headphones.  Not a bad deal.
B004X75RK4|1.0|I got half way through it and realized I had made a mistake in renting this move, I will think twice before watching this genre again.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|very well written and keeps the reader thinking all though the book you must concentrate at all times to appreciate to story
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app was recommended by my sister and helped me through a frightening period of poor health.  I kept my Kindle plugged in all night with this app turned on and was able to go back to sleep every time I woke up.  I don't write reviews but this app truly helped me rest and recover, probably the best free medicine I have ever been given.
B000IZXR20|3.0|This is really 2 stories pretending to be one.  The first story is REALLY well done, very suspenseful, and just... well, it's really good.<br /><br />And the second story just sucks so bad.<br /><br />The two stories are in chronological order, so it won't be hard to figure out which one I'm talking about, and I'm sure you'll end up agreeing with me.<br /><br />If you like horror, it's 100% worth watching the first half of this movie.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|tells from the point of view from other who experienced the walking dead and there story's first hand. There is some verbal language but all in all it's a good book
B008OOYALE|5.0|Had played tiny monsters before, this is similar, but I like the graphics and missions more. Love the fact that you can gift gold (the in game buying currency). I have still bought some gold, but it's really nice that you can get it without having to pay for it. Seem to get a lot of the rarer dragons pretty easily. Overall, a well made, engaging game.
B00CB4ET0K|2.0|Loaded to slow and it's truly a money pit.  These games should be out lawed because a child could run up a tab.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you are looking to exercise your brain with an extraordinary and exciting story, then by all means purchase this game.  The only way is forward.  The only reward is freedom, from boredom, from the inane and most of all from &quot;little kid&quot; games!
0486274268|5.0|it goes about teaching animal studies and rendering the same way a figure drawing instructor would teach human anatomy. ITS GREAT
B005IY3DP2|5.0|Initially didnt think ths was going to come clse to the bands first album (kasabian) or ther third album (west Ryder) but the more I listen the better it seems o get.  Reckon kasabian have done it gain !!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is up there with My Sister's Keeper for making you weep. I didn't think I would like this book because I felt it would be too depressing, but the author doesn't make it about this illness. He writes a beautiful love story with a side effect of cancer. The ending is kind of predictable about halfway through, but it doesn't make  it any less devastating. Read this if want to change your life. I know it changed mine.
0425129616|4.0|It's Poirot's debut appearance through the first person POV of Hastings. Love. Agatha is the queen of mystery. love her.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I really like Factory Balls. Its a really fun (but not too hard) puzzle game. Following the model, you use various paints and tools to make your product match the prototype. I'd say its more for older children to adult, but I'm sure a small child would have fun just changing colors and using the tools, even if the puzzles may be a bit too tough. I enjoyed this one a lot.
B005LAII44|1.0|Don't wast your time if your a GI JOE fan, they killed Duke off.  You might be the ROCK, but your not DUKE(Channing Tatum); you just screwed a franchise, close out that series of movies. What a disappointment, only the last 20 minutes were worthwhile.  How sad that they let a wrestler ruin an American icon!<br /><br />If you idiots in Hollywood can't do math, come see me; I can.  80% viewer are GI Joe fan from 1980's, other 20% are viewers being dragged by other 80%; are you really that stupid?  Where is the YO JOE!  Stupid Hollywood!<br /><br />I spent a $1.50 at redbox, I want my money back!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved the storyline and the interaction between the main characters..I loved the fact that it showed LOVE  has no limits or bounds..<br />I also love the fact that first impressions are not always what they seem to be..it makes me understand and know that sometimes we have to give people as well as things a second chance .<br />It's an easy read but well written..the character development was excellent as it fit the story and truly explained why everyone was exactly the way they were..and are..we are products of our past and present  and bring into the future our dreams goals and spirit..
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book and it's surprising ending.  Good writing style and easy read.  Funny and sad all at the same time.
B000KNE0Y4|2.0|I bought this watch in HK I absolutely loved the design, its absolutely beautiful but it really isn't durable. All the lovely patterned pieces on the band fell off one by one. I miss the pretty watch I bought, its just not the same. If I were you, I would not buy it.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|The Shocking Miss Emerald is all aces as far as a sophomore album goes.  Vocals are impeccable and instrumentation is state of the art.  Every song is a winner, but \\"Liquid Lunch\\" and \\"Pack up the Louie\\" are standouts because they are well-executed and just plain fun.  I hope Caro comes out with a concert DVD, and better yet, does a major U.S. tour.  I saw her perform on Later With Jools Holland, and she has a great stage presence and magnetic personality.  Being easy on the eyes doesn't hurt either!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I'd put this right up there with The Wire. Great acting and very realistic. But also humorous at times. Must see!
B007TK77QE|4.0|Thanks, JK, you've made me SO happy I don't live in an English village<br />Petty British middle class's life brilliantly described.<br />Sad, but I did enjoy it more than I've enjoyed fiction for some time.
B00E8B1358|1.0|I honestly thought it would be a cool movie but got bored when stupid non tactical decisions were being made.
6305127697|5.0|this is one of the best movies I have seen.Richard Gere is really good in this and I love edward norton. this movie will keep you guessing right up to the end
B00CHRBA12|5.0|Had forgotten how sweet the sound of the full Allman Bros. band can be. Will always be a treasured choice for old hippies.
6305128952|5.0|this movie had such a great story and robert redford and kristin scott thomas have a great chemistry.this will make you laugh and cry.
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|This is getting back to real country music.  Vince Gill has such an amazing, able to sing anything, country voice and Paul Franklin is the best steel player around.  I have listened over and over and still can't get enough.  If you love country music, you have to own Bakersfield!
B00005LK94|5.0|this one will tug at your heart and has such a great story line.everyone that has seen this movie loves it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|If I reviewed this book while I was reading it, I would have given it 4 stars and recommended it..I couldn't put it down, and the characters were interesting. You did see the first twist coming, but it was still exciting. After reading it, I was very disappointed with the ending. Ultimately, neither Amy or Nick showed any growth. The way it ended just wasn't believable, and there were a ton of plot holes. Also, in the beginning when you're reading Amy's diary entries, her character is supposed to be very well liked; she even says so herself later in the book. However, I found her annoying, shallow, and silly from the very beginning, and then I started to wonder if she was schizophrenic. I only liked her after she reveals herself but only because she made a good villain. The author could have ended it so many different, exciting ways. I felt cheated. It seemed like she wrote herself into a corner and couldn't figure out how to get out. Bummer.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Am unable to use this.  The AP doesn't work at all.  Can't even find it on my Kindle Fire.  Useless.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was a wonderful show from beginning to end. I could not help it. I binged watched! I can not wait for the next season!
B009LDD5E0|1.0|Glee Season was 4 was utter GARBAGE!  I was a DIEHARD Glee fan until S4.  Hardly any Rachel, Kurt, Santana and Finn.  They totally destroyed Finchel and made poor Finn a Lima loser in order to prop up the less then compelling Newbies.  Invest in S1-3 buy the 3D concert and S1 Best performances but don't waste your money or time on S4 and this horrible new cast!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Warning! This game is very addictive! I like it better than Jungle Run. No offense guys. I play this every night to try and meet some challenges. You get to upgrade your items, outfit, and get a whole new character. I highly recommend this game to everyone!
B001R6AW18|5.0|There is something special about the original.  No matter how many copies are made, the original movie just cannot be beat.  This is indeed a classic and one of the top 100 movies made.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm 20 he years old and I love this game. It's like temple run but with minions. Can't beat it!!
B0057567P0|1.0|It would be very hard to suggest this product to a friend. Bottom line is this: make sure you have your drive connect before you start your computer. I said drive because it's tough to have more than 1 drive connected since you HAVE TO USE an adapter cable that lets you connect to an available USB 2 port AND the USB 3 port to provide power to a drive in order for it to mount. Hot swapping wasn't possible hence you always need to re-boot if you want to connect another drive. This is on a Macbook Pro 17 inch.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love the new Weather Channel app. It makes it so easy to change between locations to see the weather and the layout is visually pleasing.
0385736002|4.0|Interesting plot twisted.  It's a well written story that starts the series quite well.  Must read this first book before attempting the rest of the series.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Things that are totally absent from the first 30 minutes of this film: plot, dialogue, character development, drama, comedy, coherency.<br />Things that you are subjected to incessantly for the first 30 minutes of this film: random, fleeting images of stars, birds, landscapes, fish, amoebas, etc.; overblown operatic music that bears no relation to the meaningless images flitting across the screen; bits and pieces of anguished, whispered ruminations about nothing.<br />Here is what you know at the end of 30 minutes into this film: there is a family (maybe) that lives somewhere consisting of a father, mother, and two (or maybe three) children; one of the children seems to have died somewhere; the earth was created a long time ago amidst a lot of cosmic upheaval; dinosaurs lived on the earth a long time ago; Sean Penn lives in a big city somewhere and goes to work (maybe) and talks on a cell phone.<br />If you happen to think as I do that you should know more about something after 30 minutes into a movie, than you will agree that this film is a pretentious compilation of pseudo artiness and that it bears as much resemblance to real art as I do to Brad Pitt.<br />P.S. I did not like this sorry excuse for a movie. I limit my remarks to the first 30 minutes of the film because that is all of it that I could tolerate.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love this game but they need to fix the racing glitch i try to race but just takes my dragon coins otherwise it would be five stars.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Jesus is not mentioned in the first half of the book. The Scripture tells us that God is light and in Him there is no darkness. You contradict the scripture in saying there is a little darkness in Him. I wanted to finish the book in hopes of you having a real revelation of Heaven, after considering time spent without mention of our Savior, and not mentioning worship of Him in song, I figured it would be a waste of time. I look up the word Ohm which took the place of worship in Heaven. Its a eastern yoga chant. I believe the author had a counterfeit experience and pray he will receive Jesus Christ as his Savior to one day experience the real heaven.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Perfect for a rainy day at camp.  They could use it alone for quiet time or make up games for competition.  The best part for me, they can save their pictures in albums year after year.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Was on a gift list so recipient was delighted to have it- he gave it the 5 stars!  Thanks much!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My two boys love the minnions and this game! We have it on both of our phones and the kindle. Great fun for the whole family.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Where has this man been all my life!!?! Grew up listening to 60's music with friends who owned crates full of albums but never came across Rodriquez. That is a terrible loss. I wish I had been able to grow up with his music like they did in South Africa and Australia but am so happy to listen to his stunningly beautiful music now. Came across Seaching for Sugarman a few weeks ago and have watched it probably four times already. I don't think anyone can sit through that film of Rodriquez's rediscovery and not just feel happy. Such an inspiring, wonderful, happy story. Justice in the end for a man with the most beautiful voice on the face of the earth. I honestly can't think of anyone with a timbre like his though there are some who have achieved fame and wealth who aren't too bad...I have to think that the \\"years in the wilderness\\" of Detroit have made him who he is and even though it was our loss, the loss of all those years of knowing his music were necessary to make this the best real story I have ever known. Who cannot love the story of someone who carries on without complaint holding inside of himself a genious? Who cannot love that he did hard labor with the soul of a philosopher and the eyes of an artist. He is an inspiration. Rodriquez is 70 now and I have never seen a 70 year old so fit. Not only the best story ever but with the music of what...an angel?
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game has a delicious introduction it offers a tutorial which you can for go and it challenges your mind to get you hooked I downloaded the free version and it gave me enough of a taste I'm buying the full game the graphics are good and the storyline flow a very good game in my opinion if you like puzzles this would be a must try

B006K2WXOI|4.0|Great story to read around Christmas time of the Polar Express train. Very good quality pictures as well. A must read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. You really have to think some things through to figure some of the rooms out. A really fun brain game.
1442359315|4.0|It was very good but I got it in cd and would listen at night.  I fell to sleep a couple of times and missed some sections.  I am however going to listen again in the day time when it is quieter and I can better stay awake. It is a subject I find very interesting and would like to read more about! Thank-you for your work and new understanding of I believe an actual and natural process about life and death!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|i bought this soundtrack at walmart granted i listened to it on spotify now the version on walmart is is a little confusing when you look at the track list on amazon but the soundtrack because disc 1 has 17 tracks is really the best of the best if you can't find it a local store you can get it here.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Impressive! All I want in a notepad app. The free sync option is very handy. I recommend it over Inkpad.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|This is an AMAZING Movie!! Some people just really need to be careful about who you watch it with or around. I can see this movie offending people that dont take it for what it is...
B000JMKRKC|5.0|The writer is truly gifted.  Looking forward to reading another one of her books!  I highly recommend this book to everyone!
B00CL68BK2|4.0|If you are looking for something to watch on a quite night then this would be a great movie to start with!!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I put this on in my car on my drive down to LA to see them live on Jimmy Kimmel. Needless to say by the time I got there (5 hours later) I was singing all the songs at the top of my lungs. I have loved DM from the beginning so they would really have to screw-up for me to dislike their music. I don't regret buying the album.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I very much enjoyed the format of this book and enjoyed the twisted ending. Will read more from this author.
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you wanna watch an amazing show that keeps you hooked, this is it. I would recommend it over anything else on tv.

B00005JLKB|4.0|My husband and I are Superman fans and we really like &#34;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&#34;.  &#34;Smallville&#34; is less to our taste, especially in the later seasons (despite the wonderful Erica Durance as Lois and Justin Hartley as Oliver Queen / Green Arrow), but it certainly begins in a fresh and creative way.  There's an innocence and good-heartedness to Season One that is quite welcome.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book is good for teenagers. It's told from a college freshman with cancer. A bit juvenile for me; however, I'm in the 40 something range.

B0064X7FVE|3.0|The previous version of the weather channel was easier to use and  maneuver through. I don`t know why they changed it. Sometimes the original is best.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|Well,  If your new to horror and don't branch out much you will probably love this film.  The only interesting scene is within the first few minutes when you realize they are all out there to support Mia, a heroin addicted junkie, who Ash promises to stick with until the end.  The gore isn't bad - the FX team had way too much fun with the blood though.  Thought I watching a Japanese samurai film.<br /><br />If you're a tad bit more experienced and loved the cult classic Evil Dead you may want to pass.  If you fell madly in love with Ash and the film's dark sense of humor please leave it at the door.  Consider this film a reinvention and not a remake.  It is a serious - predictable, dull, horror film. If you have ever seen one of the millions of films where kids go into the woods, hit up a cabin, and suddenly get picked off one by one in a gory way - then you've seen this one.  The characters are vapid, overreacting, and simply frustrating to watch.  The writing is horrific, but not in a good way.  Some how each character is maimed viciously in just the next room - walls must be sound proof.  Wish my apartment walls were.<br /><br />In the art world we have this thing called \\"Happy Accidents\\". like in the film Jaws.  The shark didn't work which ended up adding to the suspense.  The original film was so low budget Sam wasn't allowed to really do what he wanted and he really lucked out with Bruce Campbell.  He made a funny, quirky, scary, original film which will live on long after this has died... which will probably be in a year, or less.<br /><br />If you really want to watch people get killed in a cabin in the woods - one by one - might I recommend these: last house on the left (original), Any pumpkin head, blair witch, Tucker and Dale VS Evil (Wicked funny), Antichrist (XXX - but watch the entire film it's surprising), Any Friday the 13th, Any Cabin Fever, Cabin in the Woods (dark comedy - worth it), The original Evil dead (the special effects suck - but Bruce Campbell more than makes up for it), dreamcatcher, etc., etc., etc..  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS IF YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN ANY CABIN IN THE WOODS FLICKS.pbell more than makes up for it), dreamcatcher, etc., etc., etc..  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS IF YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN ANY CABIN IN THE WOODS FLICKS.

B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Video goes too fast. You can't really see how to get the moves in. Some of the moves don't look right.
1591844096|4.0|I had heard about Seth Godin's book Linchpin for several years before I decided to invest what few dollars we have allotted in our budget to \\"books' for this one. In reading others' reviews, and in skimming the inside jacked a few times, I knew this would be, for me, anyway, an interesting read. As a licensed and ordained minister, and a fan of church and church staff members everywhere, I have long been interested in content that helps 'employees' (not a ministry term, but close enough) find deeper satisfaction in serving while becoming so important to the ministry that their place on the team is secure, even if it really isn't.<br /><br />In that respect, Godin's book certainly brings a lot of practicality to the table.<br /><br />As a creative, I loved the first part of the book, panned and labeled 'boring' by many other readers. It is very mechanical, but aptly descriptive. The second part, the more practical section, is dead on for those who serve a boss, who are employees, and anyone who consider themselves servants to others higher in their hierarchy (church ministry staff fit in here). And to go one step further, the majority of the principles Godin explores can relate directly to people on ministry staff who desire serve a human with character and integrity, but to those who desire to offer their very best to God, to whom they are ultimately responsible.<br /><br />Since completing Godin's fine book, Linchpin, I have recommended it to others with whom I have a consulting relationship; not only to employees who seek to improve their work ethic, but also to leaders who can benefit by learning what a valuable employee looks like.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|my granddaughters introduced me to this game.  However, I have now downloaded it twice to my kindle fire as it keeps getting booted off. I am still having problems with it running on my kindle. If it gets booted off again I will not be downloading it anymore. I would recommend the game for all ages as it is fun to play.

B002W7J3SO|5.0|One of Alfred Hitchcock's best films. Cary Grant is outstanding as usual as a man being mistaken for a spy.
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|Seemed more like a travelogue of Australia. Very disappointing!,, hopefully there will be a better plot in the next book.
B003Y3ZTGA|4.0|This album features at least four songs that were top-selling hits, so this is a perfect addition to your pop music collection. Plus, Katie Perry can sing & that her lyrics are just plain fun. Great dance tunes!

140006922X|1.0|It's like a son of Osama Bin Laden writing about Barack Obama, or a member of Saddam Hussein's family writing a biography of GW Bush. You will get as much objective and unbiased writing. So much for \\"scholarship\\" from a wannabe \\"Professor of Religions\\"

B0053O89KG|5.0|I really savored season four knowing that each disc had 'extras' to also enjoy. Always nice that the episodes are in order. I tried pacing myself so I wouldn't have as long a wait till season five came out without luck.
0762434279|1.0|So now we have to pay attention to whether the book we are ordering is a real book or a miniature with only a few headlines.  While I have read the real book and wanted some more copies to give to my children, I had no idea I was getting this useless 3-1/4\\" x 2-3/4\\" \\"book.\\"  Too much trouble to return, so in the trash it goes with a special lookout for Murray Media in the future.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I really savored season three knowing that each disc had 'extras' to also enjoy. Always nice that the episodes are in order.
0670026638|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time and I don't say that lightly! Combines Japanese and American culture, Zen Bhuddism, quantum mechanics, a good story and great characters. I can't stop thinking about it.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS THIS HORIBLE GAME IT DOES NOT LOAD IT A DUN TIP AND IT IS STUCK ON THE LOADING
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|My little family got together to watch this. I loved the original film and Gregory Maguire's \\"Wicked\\" series and had no desire to see it, but my two 20-something college students are both diehard James Franco fans and couldn't wait. James Franco's performance as Oz reminded me of the worst high school plays I've had to sit through. Michele Williams wasn't much better.  The plot made no sense and it was difficult to understand the motivation of the characters.  The little monkey character was just plain hokey. Although we all came to the film with different expectations, we all agreed it was a colossal failure. Not even the ruby slippers can get those two hours back!
B009DKFSUA|5.0|My grandaughter loves it. I thought it was the one that was a Nice version. It wasn't. It<br />was the explicit CD. I did not realize that when I bought it. She loves it and is getting<br />me the cleaner version CD.<br />Thank you,

0307730700|5.0|FEARLESS<br /><br />The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown<br /><br />Expecting another detailed account of the military missions of the Navy Seal teams, I sat down to read Fearless.  Halfway through the 273 pages, I still had not encountered the death defying skills and heroics generally associated in this genre of book.  Quite frankly, I was bored.  But don't stop reading this review on that note!  The first half of this book describes and develops the man, whose career is that of a U.S. Navy Seal.  As I neared the end of the book, it all fit together so neatly and that satisfying feeling of having read a meaningful book overcame me.  The first half of the book really does a great job of developing the foundation (also the chapter 1 title) of Adam Brown, the process of growing and developing the worldview with the tenacity needed to not only achieve membership in the Navy Seals, but to attain a level of recognition as one of the highest achieving seals in history.  As the second half of the book develops, there are high action, up tempo descriptions, with the crescendo being a riveting account (spoiler alert) of the battle action, in which Adam Brown was killed.  For the remainder of the book, all the foundation information provided in the first half of the book, sealed just how meaningful his entire life had been.  An excellent book, but one which must be read in it's entirety, to be satisfying.  I would recommend it for anyone, however if you enjoy reading about the harmony and hope of mankind, then this book may be especially appealing to you.  4.5 of 5.0 stars.<br /><br />[...]  -  author's website<br /><br />[...]  -  more info.<br /><br />[...]  -  read chapter 1..<br /><br />[...]  -  author's bio.<br /><br /> \\"I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.\\"ceived this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.\\"
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the improved minion version of temple run. There are three settings in which you can play and many objectives and incentives that keep it interesting, along with the fact that you make points by running over other minions, so much fun! Best part: IT'S FREE!!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I consider this one of the most important books I have read this year. Choosing to read this book is the first step in choosing yourself to do what you need to do. Stop spending time with people you don't enjoy, stop work you don't enjoy, and invest time into what you learn from this book.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|Love these gals.  This was one of the best series on TV.  This series just didn't lose steam - all the way to the end.  I'm going for the whole collection.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|A worthy successor to the original franchise; entertaining, good action, with enough humor not to take itself too seriously. Shatner should be pleased.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Fun game. Very addicting. Then came the update and the fun came to an end. Screen keeps switching from downloading to loading, but nothing happens. Very frustrating. Just deleted it from device. Maybe I'll try again in a couple weeks. Hopefully another update will fix the problem. (Although I'm sure I lost all my powerhouse and progress.)

B00439MV42|4.0|Michael J. Fox  is awesome as usual. and the story line is great. plan for a good night and plenty of popcorn.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|A great series. Hail sigourney weaver and hail the writers and directors.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the whole set. Each one has its high points and I enjoyed every new addition. Obviously when the same character/monster is repeated in every new sequel, it is gonna get a bit, well, &#34;repetitive&#34;. Each sequel though does have its variations and new situations and being a fan I loved them all. I think this series is a classic in its genre.<br /><br />A must watch and a must have for fans of this genre.
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|an older movie but still Jim Carey is Excellent. You will Laugh, cry and love the main character. Enjoyed this movie.

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|an excellent movie, not for children as they would not understand the story line. Deeply touching and profound in its lessons of life. I recommend this movie for the older souls who will recognize the meaning.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Love the castle series<br />Very entertaining and great chemistry between the two leads<br />I am hooked on it and look forward to each new episode and season.<br />Cheers!
0385342039|4.0|Twenties Girl, for me, was an immensely interesting read! It was amazingly written which made the book engaging throughout! Above all, Kinsella uses a great sense of humour in the story to the extent that its hard not to have a personal LOL moment!! I think the whole ghost concept of the story and the intriguing character of Sadie really made you contemplate at times about perhaps death and the afterlife sometimes! Overall, a great plot and superb read! :)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What a great book.  I could not put it down.  I wanted it to go on and on.....not to end
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This is OK for phone, not as good as the WC desktop on my computer. As good as any weather app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|BEST APP EVER SUPER COOL IT FEELS LIKE THE MOVIE IN A GAMS SO COOL I LUV ITS SUPER EASY
B005K17RU0|3.0|This is not as easy to use as their regular program, maybe just my problem.Lots of information but not real intuitive.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just a fun game to distract yourself with. This is my first &quot;running&quot; game, and I am enjoying it probably more than I should be! It's definitely addicting!
0446310786|5.0|I can say anything negative.  The book arrived clean, and new.<br /> I half way reading the book and is clear and understandable.  Thank you.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My daughters kindle wasnt charging fast enough.  I ordered a new cable and accelerated charger.  Problem solved. The two together work well...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator I have found. I tried a lot of others but this one is the best I have found.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|this author has a wonderful way of introducing each character in the book.  He also shares interesting facts about a way of life that is often very different  in other parts of the world.  tying the different characters together over  several generations brings the reader into a relationship with several families who experience devastating life events and holds your interest to the very end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love how it makes you engage in the game and think. It's not just a normal game. Very challenging. I can't wait to see if there is a game two.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great, so funny minions, game graphics excellent, sound so really, game process very good. I like this game, thanks Gameloft)
B005LAIH2M|4.0|I thought Jeremy Renner, Gemma Arterton, and Famke Janssen worked well together. It would probably be well to do a pre story on how the character Muriel and Mina  (Famke Janssen and Pihla Viitala) played became THE witches in charge and where or how they built up their powers. At the same time, perhaps how Hansel and Greta (Jeremy and Gemma) began to be Witch Hunters and the trials and tribulations they went through to be who they are.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THE BEST game I've played on the kindle, it is so funny, entertaining and HARD! It changes difficulty based on age and there's three settings, gru' s lab, residential area and el machos lair!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Fantastic, different from the show but we'll wrote comic book series best zombie story out right now, the tv show is fantastic
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This Games Is Very Fun :) I Would Recommend To Anyone. I Can't Wait To See The Movie, I Know  It'ss Going To Be Just As Good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have had this app for a few months, and I would highly recommend it for anyone who loves horses.  It might not be the real thing, but it is still fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best!!! lots of fun and simple to learn but also challenging...wish there were more minions to play with but it is so fun! I love it!!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|The demo is great, but I don't have time to do anything.  It is a great app other than that.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|The show is a little overboard, but the content is clean. The things that MacGyver comes up with are pretty amazing. It's just a good show.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is cute and fun.  The graphics are not that good, but the rest of the game makes up for it.  I love the daily gifts too.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Saw him in concert earlier in 2013 with Kid Rock and had to get his hits CD.  He is so true to his music both on CD and LIVE.  I hope to see him in concert again soon.  I have my CD to play and can listen to many great songs!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is sooooooooo much better than the original temple run.  I love the new obstacles.  I would highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am in LOVE with the minions so of course I love the game as well. The pictures are sooo clear and its MUCH better than subway surfers. There are some lags here and there but the game is so good you almost don't even realize it. Everyone should download this game it's addictive and all ages can play it.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|I would highly recommend it.  It is addicting and fun to play.  I love animals, so that was a plus too.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|MTG 2014 is a solid addition to the Kindle app collection. The play is simple, easy to learn,and instead of controls like for the consoles you can just drag your cards for play. I know a lot of people are saying just wait and play only the free version but do yourself a favor and just spend the 10 bucks to play the whole game. The guys who made this spent a good amount of time and effort into making this game and it shows.
B005LAII4E|3.0|This second installment of the Joe's feel like a new B movies era. Not to mention that it does pack some fair action, the movie suffers of some direction at the beginning. Characters are week and sometimes dialogue is as cheesy as ever. Special effects are good but not great. The GI Joe movie franchise needs a very serious REBOOT or at least if a third part is coming out (which I think it will) it really needs to have a more serious tone, a better action director and a new fresh cast.<br /><br />This blu-ray presentation is very strong on the AV department. The 2D video transfer really pops with solid colors and the black level and contrast are solid. I can't not say the same about the 3D presentation which is a real mess. Black levels look gray and colors look like they have been done with crayola. Some 3D scenes have a lot of crosswalk, while others really shows real sense of 3D depth.<br /><br />On the audio department I have to say this is one of the best 7.1 Dolby TrueHD experience you will ever have. Paramount has done a magnificent audio transfer with rock solid LFE, dialogue is crystal clear and the surround effect are strong without overpowering the front channels. From flying jets, boombastic tank explosions this Dolby track will test your system. Enough say.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like Subway Surfers and Temple Run combined. Very fun to play it! I would recommend this game to everyone.
B008220D5K|4.0|This was a little long at the end, but it had some real life funny scenarios most people can relate to.
B00DW36G32|3.0|The plot contains the traditional years of desire revenge driven motif.  The story really does a poor job of portraying what happened from the moment that initiated the plot up until the moment you are immersed into.  There are some vague flashback references that accompany some bland conversational exchanges, and you are left with an idea of how each character suffered in their own way.  Beyond this aspect, the main theme of the hunter becoming the hunted is portrayed very well, with many wrinkles and turns, as to keep your interest.  It was a good watch, acting was sub-par at some points, but it's what you would come to expect from the cast and the story line being portrayed.<br /><br />Good rent would not run out and buy it.
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|Anthem is such a punchy album.  Each song takes you deeper into the psyche of Hanson and when the album finishes you realise you've been totally immersed in the music! Highly recommend this album, best money you'll spend!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game was fun before the update but now with the new movie out its even better. New villains, better game play, cuter minions, and everything u could want. I love it and I'm 29. I can't get better than cute minions running and giggling all the way. Give it a try.
B00DHKKN6Q|2.0|The game enticed me mostly because of the bright colors, but I wasn't as thrilled once I started playing. It's just your average bubble game, so nothing too exciting. Maybe if we're a bit more challenging I would give a higher rating.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I love Kevin Spacey. Love the political games they play. The woman that plays his wife seems so strong and independent.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Just found this author on a whim and got hooked right from the start!  His writing paints amazing pictures.  You easily fall in love with Reacher, he is a perfect hero-faults and all.  Can't wait to read more
B005K17RU0|2.0|I used it and it has now frozen my kindle and i am unable to get it to work,  There are some intenseces where it is nice to know what is going on but since I cant get it to work that often Im still in the same boat even before I got this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I go  this  app for me and  loved it. I  enjoys playing temple run so this is like a spin off of it but with more characters 2 choose from. It is the perfect  app  4 me.
B0000691TJ|5.0|I didn't even realize this was one of their earlier albums.  I had not heard most of the songs on it.  They are all Great songs.  I love the ramones.
1451673442|5.0|Easy to read and very enjoyable! I bought this for many friends and relatives, A must read for everyone you know.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is definitely a must read. The parallels of both Vivian's and Molly's stories were just the beginning. What a heartfelt gem!!
B008JFUQ16|5.0|I have 1 but not 2. :( But I`m going to ask my mom for it. (I hope she gets it for me) anyway I have wached it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is Bingo with fun side attractions like slots and collections to acquire!  Five extra free bingo games daily for fun.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|This game is one of those ones where you have to buy stuff to complete any tasks before the next presidential election.  I deleted it.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Worked a couple times but the game freezes a lot. I tried playing on my iPhone and my tablet. When you get to the very first vector battle the game gets stuck on the instructional section telling you how to throw bots at vector. I un installed the app and re installed it again to have the same issue. I tried another tablet even with the same glitch!!! The game sometimes gets stuck in a downloading loop and will not load at all. If they fixed those issues the game would be great.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I purchased this app to load on my Coby so that I could read &#34;Amarantos - One That Never Withers.&#34; It did not disappoint! The app was easy to download as was the eBook, and it looks as good on the Coby as it does on my Kindle (yes, I have both). I'm happy because now I'm able to buy Kindle books.
1612680011|4.0|This book challenges its readers to consider how they perceive money and its affect on their lives. It's an interesting read that draws upon the problem that many people in this day and age face. This book is highly recommended.
B00B8BR1YS|3.0|This lady is the Hollywood actress who has the most flat affect. She put her character to waste. Bad acting. This film could have been more effective with an actress than can actually act.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|This is a fun light book that had me smiling. I would recommend this book for anyone at any age.
0894803123|4.0|Lots of ideas for ice cream add ons and recipes for some of Ben & Jerry's best favors. As soon as I'm off my diet, I'm actually going to try a few of the recipes! I also a think that this book along with an ice cream maker would be a great wedding gift!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just updated the app, but when i get to the download screen, it keeps flickering, but wont start up or download. I dont know why, but can someone help me with that. Other than that, i love this game soooo much its really fun.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I haven't played very long.  Fun, but too much stupid dialog to skip though.  It's not worth $3, but it was free today.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's a cute fun game for kids when they are bored... great to play to waste some time before doing something
159463176X|4.0|I love all of Hosseini's books, and I look forward to each new book on the market.  This is not his best in my opinion, but I still enjoyed reading it.  I found it difficult to follow the constantly changing scenes, which were many.  However, I by the end of the book the story does come together.<br />The story takes us to Afghanistan, into the lives of many people, young and old, rich and destitute, and follows their lives for many years.  All are riddled with tragedy, some from personal choices, some from fate, but all of these lives are intertwined in unique ways.<br />It is definitely a book worth reading.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|i really enjoyed learning about steve jobs via other ppl's interactions with him.  I thought it was a well balanced book, well written; the approach that the author took was great, and now I want to read his Einstein biography.<br /> Any Apple lover would truly enjoy this book, and appreciate apple products even more after reading it.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is an amazing story that I read in 4 hours. It is hard to believe that this is happening right now and no one is helping
B009POCG2C|5.0|What more can an old guy ask than an interesting movie about baseball starring Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams !
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Had to buy it for my personal collection, positive, and uplifting; A must have for any inspirational collector. Buy all four and you won't regret it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very easy to use works well with my s3. I was thinking of getting a kindle when my phone took a nosedive. Having to get a new one I bought a s3. This was my first smart phone. Looking through the apps I came across the Kindle and liking free I downloaded it. As I said so simple to use. Go for it!!
0671250671|5.0|I was disappointed when I received this book because I had ordered it new, in good or excellent condition.  The pages were brittle and torn at the edges.  I know it's an old edition, and this book probably helped me make the most beneficial changes to my life when I first read it in the mid 80's, so I will keep it.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is wishing to change and improve his or her life, either spiritually or mentally.  I always thought I knew what love was until I read this book.  It totally changed the way I look at relationships.  When I first read that 'love is not a feeling', I thought I had misread it or missed something, so I read and re-read it over and over until I finally got it.  There are newer editions of this book, but I wanted to read it the same way I read it so many years ago.  THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!  So, 3 stars for the condition of the book, but a million stars for the content of the book.
0062255657|2.0|For new Gaiman readers- start with something else.  I am a long time fan, and have read everything Gaiman has published.  For starters, thank you Amazon for discounting the purchase price- it is pure celebrity greed for the publisher to be asking $25 for this novella.  Even $15 is really pushing it.  I love a good fairy tale, of any length, but this slight story falls short.  Most Gaiman stories leave me feeling that I've read a glimpse into a complicated place I wish I could explore beyond the story I'm reading.  Not here.  The setting and characters are flat, the story invites unflattering comparison with his earlier works.  Perhaps it should have been marketed as YA- it is extremely 'safe' in tone, even the horrifying things that happen feel muffled.  Neil- turn the volume back up!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is a blast AND can be deceptively challenging. Plenty of levels and a great time killer. Need to fill words on here lol
B008JFUTUY|5.0|An excellent documentary of a man who finally realized his dream to be a musician in a land far, far away. Even before he knew he had realized his dream.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was skeptical about downloading this game. This is challenging but not hard at all its a great way to pass the time. I hope the new levels comes soon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire has provided a challenge and fun no matter how many times I play. Thanks for a great free game.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Cool game wish got it soona awesome game love it just I love war games and this is what I was looking for
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Excellent character development and storyline. Would highly recommend to anyone not already familiar with Jo Nesbo's writings.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is so much fun. Still trying to completely figure out but I sure do love love love it.
B000YPWDSS|4.0|I am a fan of Amy Winehouse but have only listened to a few of her songs, Rehab, Back to Black and a few others.  She had her own unique style and I love her music for that uniqueness.  Reading and listening to the lyrics of her songs leaves little doubt that her was filled with illicit drugs, sex, and alcohol, and that's very sad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's the best you all should get it I hope you guys like it remember it's the best game
B002SF9YUM|4.0|Awesome dvd for anyone who is interested in the art's and of the mysterious lives in which the artists lived. Robert Pattinson is fantastic as Dali. We are thrown into drama like no other from his art to his love affairs, it is worth watching. The dvd came in perfect condition.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This is amazing for my opinion. I would rather get this app than go on internet to search for videos trust me u gonna like this app!!! :D
B00333NCTM|2.0|I thought  I would read and interesting story. It was very disjointed trash. Glad when it ended. I don't recomend
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is an outstanding game because it's challenging,adventurous and attractive. To me for a game to be a game it needs to contain these key points.<br /><br />And if you don't already have this game I suggest that you get it emideatly, and if you do have this game why don't you upgrade it to subway surfers Beijing
1401324649|4.0|I read this book over a couple of days because it is extremely easy to read and yet very witty and engaging. It is about the very colourful life of Allan Karlsson who at 100 years old decides to escape from his nursing home and so embarks on a hilarious and emergent escapade that involves a suitcase with cash, criminals (most of whom end up meeting very fateful ends, but always portrayed as amusing), a hot-dog stand operator who just happens to be the most educated person in the world, and an elephant. Plus we get to meet who Allan has met during his life, including presidents, prime-ministers, despots, and world-famous scientists (in fact we learn that Allan was responsible for the nuclear bomb). This all sounds absurd; and it clearly is. And yet the story is so enjoyable that at times I found myself laughing out-loud. If you want a funny and easy to read book for the beach this summer, this could be it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is more fun and easier to play than  other internet farm games, I love the fact that I can play without having to rely on friends for items to complete tasks... Thank you!!!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I played the flash version of this game a couple years back. I absolutely loved it. I got this as the free app of the day, but honestly, I probably would have payed for it, had I missed the sale.<br />This version added new levels and different tools compared to the flash versions. Very easy to use on my Galaxy S3. Simple design, very intuitive.<br />It starts out nice and easy, and eventually ends up being a fun but challenging logic puzzle. One of my favorite games, though I wish it had lasted a little longer. Finished the whole thing in under an hour and a half, I think.
B00000JNO1|5.0|Everything went well.
B00008L3U1|5.0|Grandkids now 10,11,12 and just laughed there heads off!  Compassion loving and excepting of others;)<br />Well recommended to all family's
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|To all you people who say they can't stand Justin Bieber, stop hating. If you can't stand him, then why buy and review the CD? Some of you people are over  27 years old. They aren't shooting to please adults, they're here to please girls between the ages of 6-18. Many of you don't know how to sing,play an instrument,or to even get girls. He's 19, give the kid a break. Did any of you sell out Madison Square Garden? Did any of sell more than 1 million copies of your CD? You could be out living your lives. But instead you're making sure your hatred gets out. Let me tell you this. If Taylor Swift has been in the music business for over 7 years, then the Biebes is here to stay.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Yes, this book kept you on your toes with reading, page after page........excitement to see what happens next........and how it kept your interest going through out the book.
B00DM12ANO|2.0|This movies was visually interesting, even beautiful at times. That's the only thing holding it together. Barely. In the beginning of the movie, we get a short explanation of the physics of this world. Then the script goes on to trample wantonly on everything we've been told at the beginning. There are so many inconsistencies for convenience sake, you'll spend the entire movie remarking on them. Maybe that's the most fun you'll get out of this flick. Watch it with someone else so you can enjoy being snarky.  Anything difficult to explain happens automagically off camera. The script is dismal. There are multiple long make out scenes to fill in the time. I mean looonnnng scenes of making out. Just making out. Long. It feels like the director just doesn't care. One of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen, except for how it looks. It could have been really interesting if a different director had made it as the premise is promising. Oh well.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Not a bad read.  A bit tedious at times and not a good as some of her other work.  Worth a quick read.
B0001W1BXC|4.0|I find that this movie is good for a collector of horror movies from the past 20 years.  It is not really scary but rather silly.  I enjoy it because it brings back memories when I was younger.  I'm 45 now.
B002MCYWHG|4.0|My daughter loves to ride in it. I like it too, but I have little problem with that seat. It says that is for children up to 4 years. I don't think so. My daughter  is not even 2 years old, and it looks like that pretty soon she  won't fit in the seat at all. It is very good seat, but for children up two years.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|New version is nice, but lost all my friends!  Also, more items moved from being potentially attainable without money to nearly impossible without paying.  Still fun game
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Being able to watch all 3 seasons was an incredible xperience.  I love the series. Not being interrupted by commercials was also a great convenience.
B008NUJ99M|2.0|I got the book and it did not have the same cover as indicated on the website and the ISBN number was one digit off. Not a big deal except for the fact that our child's school required an exact match on the ISBN.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This is without a doubt the best phone case on the market today!!! If you consider any other phone case you are wasting your money. I have tried them all and this is the best!!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This was a fairly easy read.  For me it wasn't one of those books you have trouble putting down.  I like character driven books and because this is written from many points of view it was difficult.  Just as I'd get really involved in a character the POV would change.  I liked how it all came together.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! Even tho there were some real seals acting in the movies and you can tell it made no difference to me. I have nothing but GREAT RESPECT for them!!! If you have not seen it you should!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am not used to this kind of game, so I am still getting the hang of it, but it is challenging and fun. Who can resist the cute minions? (I kind of like running them over, though ;) )
B0056BMK6K|5.0|The only disappointment is that I found out how good John Locke was after he stopped selling his books for $0.99. This is really a master class on blogging and connecting with one's target audience.
1881273156|5.0|The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman is a MUST HAVE for EVERY COUPLE! If you have 2 people in a relationship, there will always be problems communicating with one another.  If your 18 or 60, the odds are not favorable that you will always be understood.  It seems Women and Men really do speak different languages.  This is an excellent tool in helping breakthrough that language barrier!  Over the years, I've given it to many couples who were struggling in their marriage.  None of those couples were disappointed by the help in brought to their relationship.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Awesome graphics and realistic sounds. I WOULD SAY THIS IS A FUN GAME FOR ALL AGES.Also will teach you the basics of horse care.Very nice for a free app.
B008W8X5N6|5.0|Ok so the big eyes on Kong are cartoony and Faye Wray's acting is a bit like Miss Crabtree's in the Little Rascals, but King Kong is a hoot, and a film that shows the people, fashions, technology and ideas of the thirties in America like no other.  No CGI here! Just good old &#34;special effects&#34; and lots of old fashioned sci-fi stuff.<br />Some of the jungle fights between Kong and the dinosaurs (long before Jurassic Park!) are a scream.  Have fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is fun.  I love playing on my kindle. The horses are pretty and its fun to feed them and play with them.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was sent to my kindle, book was enjoyable. Different than the movie. Not much more than that to say
B009DCOU9S|5.0|good game...it keeps you intrigued. when you finally figure out that certain things can be used without putting them in your inventory; u get the hang of it very quick.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I can't comment on this first hand.  But, the person I bought it for reviewed it very positively.  No complaints.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|We couldn't stand this movie long enough to have anything to say. I like fantasy, but this had no redeeming features.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is like a cross between Subway Surfers and Temple Run 2. It is a very fun game and is easy to play. You play as a minion who is trying to become Minion of the Year, and in order to do that you have to be despicable and fight villains like Vector and El Macho. You get to dress the minion up in different costumes, and the graphics are amazing, they look real.<br /><br />A great game I wish I could give more than five stars.
B00CHILW64|5.0|We were in Spain in 2004 for Christmas when the tsunami hit.  This is an excellent movie that captures the human tragedy of this event.
B00181MHQU|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. Not a huge fan of musicals but this one has great story of love and hate and the perfect music to go with it.
B00821OX98|1.0|Bad acting, stupid plot...why would a survivor try to kill one of the few remaining humans? I was very disappointed
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I absolutely love this show and I'm wondering why I never knew about it before! You can't go wrong with Fringe especially if you were a fan of The X Files.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|This is anice little program but had gotten another little program that does much of the same and have  began to use Photo Editor + more. Have had this a while and should probably check it out again. Wasn't able to produce a picture like Draw Infinity as of yet. Maybe I  am missing out and need to check it out again. All in all have enjoy all my art apps so much!
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|but I still enjoyed the CD quite a lot.  He has a beautiful voice.  I would definitely recommend it for a romantic evening.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I like the highlight and search function, I would like to access the bookmarks, I think it works faster and smoother than the Amazon pdf reader.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Thus is a super fun game. Some levels are extremely challenging in trying to break the codes. I became addicted quickly.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game keeps you engaged but not too hard. What can i say it is free but they are forcing me to write this review to keep playing. I guess nothing is free.
0547391005|5.0|Great book, my son wants a different story at bed time.<br />And it's a beautiful book too, well done<br />Thanks
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was amazing to read this book. I can't wait for the next book of the heroes of Olympus. Awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Without a trip down to the same thing with the clothes she was just thinking about the clothes for it to the way the clothes world of the way the world clothes clothes she
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The Piano Guys' version uplifts the music without turning it into a typical copy cat boring elevator music. The DVD is a compilation of their videos that can be found on YouTube.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Quick, easy,and informative. Whenever we need facts we go to this site for up to date stuff no matter how crazy
159463176X|5.0|Having enjoyed Hosseini's prior books, I expected the best and have not been disappointed!<br />I am in the midst of it and have trouble nightly putting it down to go to sleep.<br />I'd recommend it to anyone who appreciates a great story, loves well written and engaging prose<br />and wants to help maintain a high level of literature in the market.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a good game but it is slow that is 1 thing that I would change<br />but I do like it.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|There's a million self0-help books out there, but this one is simple, easy, and common sense.  will amaze at how easy you can improve relationships.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Awesome! This show has gotten better! I'm glad the cast remains the same and the acting is superb! Love it!
1934609625|5.0|Also known under its British title, Tethers End,[[ASIN:B00DWL95BO Tether's End]] this is one of Margery Allingham's two very distinguished serious thrillers. (The superb Tiger in the Smoke[[ASIN:1934609579 The Tiger in the Smoke: Albert Campion #14]] is the other). In these two novels, Allingham gives her spiritual and psychological analysis of the truly wicked and the truly good, through intriguing characterization.<br />Scotland Yard Detective Charlie Luke has a 6th sense that something wicked is connected to a small neighborhood in his 'manor' where clues and remnants of violent crimes keep turning up. It's a pattern he senses, but does not understand. Then a pair of innocent young people step into the picture, and act as catalysts for the unraveling of a serial killer's career.<br />The killer becomes known to us very early in the novel--but this is not one of those boring tales that take you inside the mind of the murderer, who proves to be mundane and not really unlike you and me. Oh no. This killer shows himself to be a charismatic man who is in some way 'off' and 'distorted.' Most people are charmed by him, and he charms a number of people right out of this life and into the next. Only in his undoing do you come somewhat to see the crippled mind and spirit that has created the horror within and around him. Allingham is exploring the mystery of evil. She doesn't take the mystery away entirely, but she surely reveals the evil.<br />A little poking around based on asides in the novel show that her character is loosely based upon an actual person--a notorious and particularly ghastly serial murderer named Haigh. You can look him up on Wikipedia if you want to give yourself some spoiler details at the outset.<br />Opposite this dangerous, preternaturally clever, charismatic, yet finally fatally flawed personage, Allingham gives us three genuinely good people. Mrs. Tassie, the elderly lady who has 'mothered' the criminal, and the innocent young couple who come into Mrs. Tassie's life. All are put perilously together and entangled in the murder's elaborate planning. He treats life as though it were clockwork he could wind up and run to suit himself. All the characters are colorfully drawn into and through the highly exciting and fearful entanglements of his plans. At last, it is unconditional love and human goodness that prove too much for the criminal to handle. It's an ancient story, but not ever a boring one. Allingham is a great maker of plots, and she unwinds this one with great panache.<br />Albert Campion and his Police Detective Charlie Luke, though present, are really outside the main thrust of the narrative. Luke's role is to be in the place of Dr. Watson: \\"you see, but you do not perceive.\\" Campion intuits what's going on, but it is the characters working out their destinies that really causes matters to unravel. This novel is a cut above Allingham's other witty and 'cozy' Campion mysteries. I count it as one of the all-time great mysteries.o Mrs. Tassie's life.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The quality of this series was excellent.  The scenes were beautifully composed and the colors magnificent. We learned about the lives of people and how they lived in that era.  We totally enjoyed this show and are hopeful that there will be a Season 4.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  This was certainly the best book of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series.  I wish there could be more.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I ran across this quite by accident and was caught off guard.  So charming!  Such a nice romantic comedy, perfect for a late night in with a favorite beverage or a rainy day escape.
B008220C38|1.0|One not familiar with the movie would not understand this musical version. And if you are familiar with the story, you would hate the almost sci-fi type fantasy musical that was the vehicle for a classical story of social mores, moral conflict, and the contrast between young love and illicit love. Keira Knightley is a wonderful actress, but even she could not pull this off. The producers are probably saying that the classics don't sell, but the reason this one wont sell is because it is an abomination!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! it is so addicting! I love that you can get different characters and use different power ups.
B000H1RFKU|5.0|If your a fan of Denzel Washington this is one you want to own and have in your collection! The quality of this movie is by far better than the dvd version.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I'm a fan, what can I say? I like the extended version, but I wish there were more to it. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to leave the reality of this world and enter a great fantasy world where love truly can last for ever.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit. Tolkien. Peter Jackson. Ian McKellan as Gandalf. Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Dwarves. A Dragon. Hugo Weaving as Elrond. An all around awesome package!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Love the nostalgic games and characters referenced in this cute film. Blu-ray has great definition, highly recommend viewing in this format to fully enjoy the vibrant and colorful landscapes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and entertaining. Free which is the best feature. Good fun for the whole family. Challenging and makes you think outside the box.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|If your expecting something similar to the other die hard series.  It was kind of a let down.<br />Action was there , but somehow the whole thing just didn't work that well for me.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Nice way to keep often-used timers. I like the repeating timer feature (really good for FlyLady 15 minute pickups). I also like how the alarm announces the name of the timer.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. Unlike others I find it very intuitive to use. Good progression and new skills. Hard is very hard and easy is easy.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Jeremy Renner and the serious talent he brings to any role.  This movie is no exception, and his animated, probing take on the generally stoic spies in the Bourne series is refreshing.<br /><br />The plot is also helped by the excellent roles of Edward Norton and several others, plus a truly wild opening scene.<br /><br />This is one of the most compelling, watchable versions of one of my favorite movie series!
B00821OX98|5.0|Its a must watch!! I watch each season in a day! I love this show so much. I would defiantly recommend it.
B009CG29RK|5.0|This is a great movie for the parents and the kids! The minions are great! They so remind me of Steve Colbert ha ha
B00002N9ER|3.0|Good thing these are cheap, because im on my 3rd one. I only use one bracket, so I just bought my second set because theyve all broke. If you use your light a lot....just be carefull pulling your light out.
B00932A4XE|4.0|my wife and i really enjoyed the movie. You will find some character in there that you can relate to.
B004G6TD4S|3.0|This prog band was right in the middle of the scene. I love &#34;From the Beginning&#34; The rest was OK, a little trite now, but well performed and well recorded. I enjoyed it, but I won’t wear a hole in the CD.
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|Let me just start out by saying that this movie made my wife cry.  lol It was that good.  Watch it.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Yes! This album was one of my favorites and now I remember why! The musicianship and studio craft that went into Fragile was impeccable. The 2003 remaster was a welcome touch. I did not need the bonus track, but they do not subtract from the original.
B00DFFI7K2|1.0|I bought this movie and boy do I regret it. I fell asleep at least three different times. Bad acting, bad plot,  bad movie. I am going to try to return it.
B00007KWHN|5.0|I had a few Yes albums on vinyl and my younger brother owned this one. Somehow I thought that since the album art was not the Roger Dean classic that their sound was not fully formed. Big mistake! This is truly a great album for a casual Yes fan or anyone wanting a sampling of their work. The bonus tracks are interesting but not a deal breaker.
B002TZ3C8G|5.0|This was a fast moving and totally engrossing read.  I look forward to reading all the other books in the John Corey series.
B004ZN9NCY|4.0|This half live half studio masterpiece was a tiny bit more work than I remember it from the 80’s when I first heard it. Floyd was well on their way to being the head-grippy masters of the art that they are known to be. This album was right at the end of the “Old Floyd” sound. Fun, spacey, a little creepy... good stuff.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|sooooooo fun i love it when you can pet the horses but the rider is not verry good at doing the jumps
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The shows ensemble cast it great. Every episode flows together in a nice story arc over the course of the season, but the many different characters get their own little spot light in each episode.
0385535147|2.0|I like John Grisham and have read all of his books.  This is the first one that I didn't care for.  The story is confusing and some important details are left out until the end, which I think is a cop out to make the storyline work.  I also didn't like any of the characters - they are all crooks and they are all guilty, even the main character is guilty even though Grisham tries to make it seem like he didn't deserve to be found guilty.  I would not recommend this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is the best game when you are watching kids or baby sitting.<br />If I where you I would get the game.
1439153663|5.0|This was one of my favorite books.  We had reviewed the book &#34;The Help&#34; earlier in the year and this book paralled this in many ways.  It had more of the corporal punishment episodes than &#34;The Help&#34; but gave a good picture of slave life on the plantation and this little Irish girl was taken in by the help and made to feel a part of their family. To me, althought the conditions in the housing and life of the slaves was harsh, their closeness of family always impresses me as being something special. So far, this has been one of my favorite books, it was my turn to review a book in our Book Club and I really enjoyed doing the review of this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love it!!! It seems to have no problems or glitches at all. I recomend this app for all horse lovers.
0061537969|5.0|Another one of my very favorites, the book being written by the dog was especially powerful and gave you the intense feelings that pets have for their owners. You often wonder with your own pets what they are thinking and this book gave you a very clear view of what this dog was thinking and would have liked to be able to speak and communicate with his owner. Ezno was a very special animal, very human in his thoughts ( much smarter than a lot of humans ! ) I loved that his mistress at first was maybe a little envious of the relationship between Ezno and her husband, but with the dog's very special knack of communication she was brought to love him. It was so well written, I really loved reading such a special story.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I love this app. It shows me everything I want to see for weather any where I want in the country<br />.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game.... I love it. Wish it wouldn't cost money to get the things I want.but it is still a good play.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is fantastic, I know it is 99 cent but it is worth ten dollers, and it is even better if you get the upgrade for the extra levels. I can only give it five out of five starts but if I could I would give it more, this game is perfect for those who want the Scribbenauts experience without the DS gaming system. You Will Love This Game!
B007B6T3K4|5.0|I love this CD. It is an awesome mix of symphonic metal styles. Very touching music. The singer sounds a lot like Tarja.
159463176X|3.0|I was almost afraid to start reading this because I knew I was bound to be disappointed. Both \\"Kite Runner\\" and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" are among my top ten books of all time and I somehow knew no writer could keep that up.The first part was excellent, with a riveting story of a poor family and fairy tales of children stolen by divs, which later proves to parallel to real events. But Hosseini then jumps all over the place. I was fascinated by his main characters, but instead of focusing on them, he gave long narratives about totally unnecessary characters such as Markos and Thalia who I could care less about. I don't even know if I would have finished it had it not been written by my previous favorite author. The novel is very jerky and disjointed in terms of people, settings and time. Even the ending is a let down. I'm giving this 3 stars because of its beautiful beginning, but that is a gift. It probably should get only 2.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So...Minecraft pocket edition eh? sweet, now I don't have to worry soo much about not playing minecraft anymore, now that I have the pocket edition of minecraft I can play anywhere &amp; anytime... =)
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|If you're a Stephen Stills fan from way back, maybe you had a couple of his early albums on LP, and if you're like me you bought Manassas on CD because it's just that good, this is a great collection to fill in all of the holes for his entire career.  I ended up downloading a few songs from Stephen Stills I and II just to fill in the few I remembered that I liked.  Then I still want to listen to the entire Manassas album because there really aren't any bad cuts and I love the way the sides go together.  Highly recommended for the casual or completeist.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. The levels get harder and harder as you play on.<br /><br />Another good thing about this device is that it helps out users who aren't familiar with using touchscreens. My mom has always had a hard time judging what she is doing while using a touch screen and how to press the \\"buttons\\" and this game helped her learn how to use a touch screen and how you don't have to press hard to get a result. As the levels in the game get harder the game boards get smaller making the player work through smaller and smaller grids.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This epic movie is one of my favorite of all times. Purchased immediately one from BestBuy when released. When recently travelling to Eastern Europe, my wife purchased Polish version of Blu Ray edition of this movie. This is identical to US release with exception of having different spoken and caption languages: original English, Polish, Czech & Hungarian.<br /><br />To my surprise this disk plays no problem on my US Panasonic DMP-BD500 (region coded A) blu-ray player purchased from Amazon.com few months ago. First I thought it is my player which might be multiregion but shortly I found it is the disk - although labeled region B it is actually region free.<br /><br />I post this information for all US residents who would like to take advantage of watching this movie with alternate language versions as listed above.
B0063HBPH6|5.0|A great read, full of interesting characters that you just can't help but like... can pick it up and re read and find something new every time.
0394826817|5.0|This is a great book on manners that my child requests.  It is fun to read and has great, simple messages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the next generation of the world and is about the fun for the future this game is awesome
B00E193TM2|5.0|for any music lover who loves heavy music you will love this cd!!  for any knucklehead who has been wanting to hear more music like The Way of The Fist you will love this album.  from the first song to the last the cd is great!  the drum beats are infectious and the guitar riffs are perfection!!  get this cd now!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have never had so much fun and I hop u have has much fun as I do.<br />and thanks for this awesome game they how ever created it your the best.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I really love Gillian Flynn's writing style and would recommend this even more than Gone Girl. Great plot , story line and characters.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is really fun to pass time! It was hard to understand at first but, once you get the hang of it you will love this game.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Just a fantastic cast.  They perform so well and Maggie Smith and Billy C. are great.  They make you<br />laugh, show true friendship and companionship, bring some tears but most of all forgiveness. emotions can<br />run high.  You feel like you are with them each day living in that home.  What a happy ending. Amazing to<br />see the joy, love and hurt weave through out.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great fun my daughter loves it she's six and enjoy it I also have fun it's great for adults and kids
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Just like the old shockwave games,very pleased to have this for free<br />nice game play but monologue a bit too long
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is a well written program with some actors and actresses that are not all that well known.  They do a wonderful job.  The program stays interesting and the character development is well done.  You seem to learn a little bit more about the characters each week.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can't stop! Must get to next level. So I have to rate to continue playing that is annoying. Fairly complex.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson really is a master of creating a world different from ours and keeping us reading to find out more about it. He is also a good character-creator. Amazingly, I believe, he manages to create credible women characters. Well worth reading - but a marathon read no matter how you look at it. I am half-way through after 5 days of reading (approximately page 650), and already am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app its so fun. the horses are so pretty.they are fun to take care of. so fun
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I loved this app until it stopped working. It said it was a problem with my purchase through Amazon so i deleted it and tried to reinstall & I'm getting an error that says the purchase is pending. I \\"bought\\"this when it was the app of the day and how it won't work. What's up with that?<br /><br />****Amazon helped me to uninstall, clear cache, and reinstall and now it works again!**
B005UG542S|5.0|I really enjoyed coming full circle with Harry Potter and friends from childhood to adult.  I would recommend this to anyone who has viewed other HP movies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Keeps me entertain for hours. I love it. Would recommend to others! :) watch the movie to, you'll have a great time.
0425263991|5.0|I enjoy reading these books. I Love Nalini Singh The book was in good repair and came in a timely fashion. I am pleased with the order.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|The movie is educational, not entertainment. Blu ray clarity and sound. A must for the Christian library to revisit regularly.
1451696191|5.0|A young adult classic, that I'm just now reading as an adult.  Very poignant!  Loved from start to finish.  Written in the form of letters from Charlie, an awkward freshman, trying to find his way in the world.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is 'the'James Bind, sorry Sean Connery fans. This film is awesome,a don't eh blu ray is a must for fans of it.
