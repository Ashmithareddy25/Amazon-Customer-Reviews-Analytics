B000063V8S|5.0|I've come to expect the same level of quality from each of the season sets for Star Trek: The Next Generation. This one did not disappoint.  The box structure and layout remains the same, the foldout holding the DVDs is the same material as the rest. Overall the physical layout of the box set is the same as before. <br />My only complaint with the entire box set is the layout on each disk. This time, instead of having short clips of all the episodes on the disk play back to back, or having a separate screen for each episode, the disk is split in half, with two screens for clips, each one alternating between two episodes. It makes it harder to follow than previous disks, unless you're familiar with all the episodes on that disk you're not sure where each episode ends and the next begins.
B000002L9O|3.0|I first found that I loved the Ramones in 1983 when I saw a video for Psycho Therapy on a Night Flight special about \\"Violence in Music Videos\\". The song was from the album Subterranean Jungle, so I ran out and bought it and LOVED it. After that all of my weekly allowance went towards buying their previous albums. I found that I loved them all dearly. (With the exception of End of the Century, but that's a whole 'nother story.) About a year later, Too Tough To Die was released and I loved that as well. Then in 1986 Animal Boy came out. It was the first Ramones album that really made me think \\"Eh.\\" It seemed lifeless and dull and somehow generic, like they didn't care anymore, like they'd finally run out of juice. Like they were just going through the motions. The same goes for Halfway to Sanity and Brain Drain. I never did hear any of the albums that came out after that. Oh well. They'd had a phenomenal run.<br /><br />That said, I can't honestly proclaim that this is a \\"bad\\" album. It's got some good songs, especially the more hardcore sounding ones. The most noteworthy thing about it in my eyes is the guitar sound. It's unusually metallic and aggressive, even for Johnny.
B000065U1N|3.0|A masterful work.  But a bit too much to take.<br />My hat is off and my heart is burdened for military personnel who have seen combat.  This film purports to portray combat and I find it hard to endure, even as a mature adult.<br />I perceived that the purpose of the director was never to glorify violence, but instead to show the story of courageous people.<br />But this film is not for the faint of heart....<br />....and I avoided Saving Private Ryan based on such reviews.

0780020685|5.0|When director Akira Kurosawa was presented the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in the late 1980's, he was very old, almost blind, and still making incredible films.  In his acceptance speech he said that he was just beginning to understand how to make a good film.  I don't know...seems like he knew pretty well in 1954 when he released `The Seven Samurai.'  <br />As the film opens, a small Japanese village has been raided by bandits time after time.  The villagers know they are coming again and that the next time will finish their life of farming for good.  In desperation, several of the villagers hire (for very meager wages) seven samurai warriors for protection.  <br />The warriors have many problems to overcome:  Initially the villagers are as scared of their saviors as they are the bandits.  The villagers also have no training in how to protect themselves.  And some of the samurai are just BARELY qualified to bear the name samurai.  Plus, of course, the big problem:  The bandits are coming.<br />The movie is over three and a half hours long, but you don't notice it.  Kurosawa is a master of directing your eyes to the places they should go, whether it's a village pilgrimage to the local ancient sage, or a huge battle scene with the bandits.  No one else shoots large-scale action sequences like Kurosawa.  The scene where the multitude of bandits come pouring down the mountain towards the village is breathtaking.  But tighter shots are equally effective.  Watch how Kurosawa focuses on the feet of the horses during several scenes from the battles.  Those feet tell you everything you need to know.  <br />The subplots deal with the breaking down of ancient traditions, forbidden romance, loyalty to a cause, and much more.  By the time you get to the end, you're forced to ask yourself some questions about everything that's happened.  I'll say nothing more about the ending, except to add that when you get there, you know you've seen a film that's been imitated countless times, but never matched.

B000056HE9|4.0|Loretta Young deserved an Oscar and she got it the year this film was made, but for another role &quot;The Farmer's Daughter&quot; a comedy. While that was also a wonderful performance I can't help thinking that Academy voters were also thinking of this movie when they cast their vote for her to win against the odds on favorite that year, Rosalind Russell.  In the first 15 minutes of the Bishop's Wife Loretta Young brought me nearly to tears twice the first time I watched this movie and many times since.  Mind you the all star cast does not end with her alone, we have Cary Grant giving us a little piece of heaven right here on Earth.  In addition, we have David Niven in a wonderful turn as a very believable (trust me I know!) Episcopal Bishop over-worked and harried trying to raise money for a new Cathedral.  Monty Wooley, James Gleason and Elsa Lanchester were all wonderful.  Gladys Cooper was also a scene stealer as the &quot;selfish materialistic woman&quot; that the Bishop must grovel to for funding.  I wish they made wholesome faith-filled movies that still deliver a message of tolerance and inclusion during the Christmas season in this day and age.  Well, I will go on wishing, but I recommend this DVD to watch for the time being.

B000069AUI|5.0|It is hard to put this music into words, but I'll do the best I can. Beautiful, hypnotizing, emotional. This album is just as, if not more, amazing as the first. Go out and buy this cd, let it never leave your player.
0316666343|1.0|There is nothing inspiring, nothing learned from reading this book. The book does not make sense and it is very hard to read. It seems that Susie never actually died, she never left earth. In buying this book, I thougth there was a chance to learn something from the heaven perspective but the author was just to earthly, into the emotions and the sex ...<BR>I was very, very disappointed. I am surprised that other readers gave this book even two stars.
B000063DHL|4.0|Most heavy-metal bands that used synths (or synth-guitars like on this album) tried to appeal to a larger audience. Iron Maiden had made true heavy metal-albums with only guitars, but on &quot;Somewhere&quot; they started using synth-guitars, but luckily they managed to make them a part of the classic Maiden-sound.<BR> The production on this one is Maidens most 80s-like and is evident for example in the somewhat bigger snare drum-sound.<BR> The songs are great, but also a little more commercial sounding which doesnts mean theyre selling out. The choruses on &quot;Wasted Years&quot; and &quot;Heaven can Wait&quot; just stick to your mind.<BR> This album hasnt got any evident filler songs, but some songs arent just as strong as the better ones. This album has also some of Adrian Smiths  best songwriting.<BR> If you are new to Iron Maiden, dont make this your first Maiden-album. Get &quot;piece of mind&quot; or &quot;seventh son of a seventh son&quot; first. This isnt Iron Maidens best album but still a great collection of songs and definetily a part of a Maiden-collection.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is such a wonderful and relaxing CD with great songs.  highly recommended!!
0385006896|5.0|This book contains everything, all the short stories, all the novels. There is a reason why Sherlock Holmes is one of the most easily recognized fictional characters of all time: this stuff is good. It is especially good if you compare it to anything else written in the same time period, but it also stands the test of time: you can read it today, and it draws you in like all good writing does, with only a few details seeming absurd or outdated (warning: there is some pretty heavy racism in the second novel, &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;).

B000021YQV|5.0|System Of A Down is a band that hates to have labels pinned on them, and this band has had their share of labels thrown at them, more labels than one would find in a supermarket.  Whether they're being called \\"nu-metal,\\" \\"political rock,\\" or even \\"Armenian Rock\\" is completely irrelevant.  What is relevant, however is that System Of A Down is probably one of the few important bands to come out of the late-1990's.<BR>    SOAD is a band that I got into a little late in the game.  I had liked them earlier, based on their hits \\"Sugar\\" and \\"Spiders,\\" but I didn't buy their first record until right before this one came out, and I didn't get this one until recently, for I had liked their first tremendously, but my record collection is usually a little short on heavy music these days, save for Helmet and Alice In Chains.  This album is brilliant, though.  <BR>    What is relevant about SOAD is that they rock, and hard, too.  Seamlessly blending eclectic influences into an immensely listenable stew that features flourishes of screaming thrash metal, punk, and even touches of folk music, they are unique.  Their sound has been referred to as \\"the bastard spawn of Frank Zappa and Slayer,\\" which is about as close a description as one could peg on this band.  Toxicity came out last year amidst a sea of other \\"Nu-Metal\\" albums, such as Slipknot's \\"Iowa,\\" but \\"Nu-Metal\\" is something that SOAD doesn't fit neatly into, for they aren't the 7-string guitar slinging, hip-hop beat-happy, mommy-hating posers that most of those guys are, they just happened to get popular around the same time as the \\"Nu-Metallers.\\"  This album might seem uneven to some listeners, but after reading an interview with guitarist Daron Malakian, I realize that the sequence of songs and subject matter here is a touch of brilliant as well, for according to Malakian, \\"our album is just like life--completely frivolous and happy one moment, and completely serious the next.\\"<BR>    Serj Tankian is without a doubt the most talented singer in hard music today.  He has the ability to go from a soft melodic vocal tone, to a bizarre carnival-barker's voice, to a scholarly-sounding rant, to a blood curdling scream--within the space of one song!  His lyrics are wonderful, too.  Whether he's writing about the utter stupidity of the U.S.'s laws on mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenders (\\"Prison Song\\") or waxing about the excesses of Hollywood and rock stardom (\\"Psycho\\") his lyrics always make sense.  They make you think, and laugh at the same time.  A lyrical highlight can also be found in the song \\"Needles,\\" where Serj uses a tapeworm as a metaphor for a drug habit, and the chorus of the song is something you'll be singing for days on end, making your closest friends go, \\"What the--?\\"
1573225517|5.0|This novel is a classic, easily one of the best works of fiction of the 1990s.  Very much a product of its time and place (north London during the first half of 1994) with all of the realistic, pop-cultural details that implies, but not the least bit dated when read nearly a decade later.  Hornby's writing style is so seductively engaging, so witty and incisive and topical that it's incredibly easy to visualize Rob Fleming (the British Rob Fleming, not John Cusack as played in the movie version) and Laura and the rest of the believable and all-to-human thirtysomething characters in this book.  If you haven't read it, do so now!
B000069AUI|1.0|I was a little disappointed with this CD.  I guess I loved the  one before this one so much that I put them on some pedistool.  Things on this CD seemed repeatitive and it lacked some warmth that the one before had.  I could listen to the other one &quot;Parachute&quot; again &amp; again.  But this 2nd one I'll probably hand to someone I don't like or toss it out the window.  Don't waste your hard earned money!
B00003CXB7|5.0|M*A*S*H is one of those great movies that stand up well to repeated viewings.  It has humor, drama, and a rare combination of grit and wonder.  This is one of the best movies made about war, and certainly one of the funniest.  Robert Altman has one of his best moments here, although by all accounts, no one on the set at the time had that thought.  The exploits of Hawkeye, trapper John, and Hotlips are all here, along with the raw emotions of being part of the Korea War.<br />The transfer to video on this movie is terrific.  If you have only seen this movie on VHS or on TV, you owe it to yourself to see this print.  It is cleaned up and really wonderful.  The color depth is terrific and it is like seeing the movie for the first time.  The extras on the DVD are enertaining and informative as well.  This is a terrific package.  M*A*S*H belongs on any list as one of the top films of the past 40 years and is a worthwhile addition to any collection.
B000066NW0|3.0|i really like avril's music, but it is definitely not punk. Sk8er Boi is okay, everyone seems to like it so much, but I don't think its oh so great. Complicated is pretty much my fave song from the album.      Don't buy the album if you're looking for punk, because you definitely won't be getting it here! But the music is still ok if you're like me and will listen to anything that sounds good!      Luv,   Mandi
0767020308|5.0|This is a wonderful adaptation, with a marvelous script and a superb cast. I've seen other versions of this novel brought to the screen that did not capture the relationships nearly so well. Frank Churchill's double entendres, as well as other characterizations and events, are realized more visually; servants and townspeople are seen going about their business; scenes take place outdoors and in the town.  This version really fleshes out the written word and makes Austen -- the ultimate drawing room author -- cinematic, beginning with the marriage of Mr. Weston and Miss Taylor and including Emma's actualized fantasies and daydreams.<br /><br />The only disappointments here are the paltry dvd features: a paragraph about Jane Austen, a list of four A&E web sites, and optional English subtitles. That's it.  No cast info, no commentaries, no interviews .... let alone any kind of scholarship from people who have obviously made an authentic commitment to create high quality interpretations of British and American literature.<br /><br />Normally I would demote this item to 4 stars based on the pathetic extras, but this adaptation is to Emma what Merchant-Ivory are to E.M. Forster. This is a brilliant, beautiful rendition of a novel dear to the hearts of many.  One must believe that our Miss Jane would approve.<br />Highly recommended.
B00006AW2O|4.0|The Stones second U.S. album, 12x5, was filled with some great covers and some early original material. Besides being one of their best early albums, the sound has been improved greatly.  The album now contains STEREO versions of songs that have never been heard, let alone released, in the U.S. before.  This version is superior to the old ABKCO version.  This is definitely one album worth buying in the current SACD collection.  You will not be disappointed in the upgraded sound.  Highly recommended.

0060925000|5.0|If I had it my way, I would want the additional 600 pages Seth excised from his original manuscript tacked on to this pared down concrete slab we readers were left with. Needless to say, I loved this book. Loved it. And here's a few reasons why:<br />The whole story makes sense, for one thing. Seth's characters live and breathe like real people. No-one is really a superstar, or superhero... no one individual always saves the day. Almost everyone takes their turn at being admirable, vulnerable, humiliated, elated, dejected, disappointed, unsure, hypocritical, sincere, lovable, revered, loathed, snooty, exalted, and cast down. Even Lata Mehra, the girl for whom a suitable boy is being sought out, even she is not technically the undisputed protaganist in the novel... so many interesting sub-stories are at work throughout this year long adventure, that, at the end, it would be difficult to single out anyone as having the leading role. It would only be proper for them all to join hands and take a bow, our job being merely to applaud.<br />This book is a river with many tributaries. But it IS a river. There is a source, a unity, a connecting thread... it flows from a high point, yet the structure of A Suitable Boy is different from most &quot;plots&quot;. There certainly is no single &quot;bad guy&quot; or &quot;good guy&quot; to point to. Here we've got four families, each member of which has their own growing up to do... and as in real life, there is no time or place for a single plot. Yet, all of them (the Mehras, Kapoors, Khans, Chatterjis), have a profound effect on each other and great themes such as pride and humility, passion and patience, the practical vs. the romantic, power and authority... these themes emerge and keep the reader not only awake, but enthralled.<br />It's true that there is a lot of tedious (yet necessary) political stuff going on in this book. But I found that just as I was getting tired of it (or overwhelmed, or let's say it, bored) Seth moved on... just in time, for me anyways. I can sympatize though, and see how some readers would like to set a match to that Zamindari Abolition Act! Hello?<br />I must say that I found Lata's decision unpredictable and surprising, and right up until reading the very sentence I did not have a clue as to what she would decide to do, if anything at all. I accredit my surprise to the author's skill.<br />When Mrs. Mehra says to her younger son Varun at the end of the book &quot;You too will marry a girl I choose&quot; I had to laugh, and think &quot;Hey, what a great foreshadowy segue into a sequel called A Suitable Girl&quot;.<br />And if there were such a thing of equal size to this present book, I would wade right into it without hesitation. A Suitable Boy is a masterpiece, and I'm confident that any true lover of story will not only appreciate it, but find it unforgettable.. just in time, for me anyways.

B00005JKCH|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the film that all Spider-Man (and Marvel fans) have been waiting for.  As a lifelong comic book super-hero enthusiast, I must admit that Spider-Man has always been a favorite of mine, and watching some of the past adaptations has been painful at times.  Seeing the transition from comic book to film performed so well in this case, however, is remarkable, from the special effects to the writing and even some of the inside jokes meant strictly for the comic book fans (we know who we are).  Instead of poking fun at the character, the filmmakers do what they should do when making a movie of this caliber, and that is to pay homage to the character.  People who may not understand why this character is so popular before seeing this movie will (we hope) understand why after seeing it. While it is not a literal translation of each and every comic book, it does capture the essence of who he is and what he represents.  This movie may have seemed to take forever to make, but it was certainly well worth the wait.  Make Mine Marvel!
B000069HKH|5.0|This is a brilliant collection of songs. Sit down and listen to the CD two times back to back.  What you don't get the first time will hit you where it counts by the second listen through.
B000068IEU|1.0|Last House on the Left is an exploitation film based on true events with shaky camera handling, unreliable acting, poor sound, and a lot of poor \\"in your face\\" psychological violence.  This is Wes Cravens debut film, and you can certainly recognize that this his first appearance as a director due to all the errors.  The film depicts two girls who are going to see a concert and on the way want to score some pot to enhance the evenings pleasures.  However, everything goes wrong from this point forward and they end up in a brutal environment of torture, rape, and worse.  Two things you can take from this film include that you should take a self-defense course and beware of strangers. Otherwise, this is a horrid film experience.
B00005YXZH|5.0|After all the hoopla surrounding this CD, you must have thought that something must be off about it.  Well, let the truth be told!  It is definitely experimental, but it is not O.K. Computer or anything.  It is still without a doubt the same Wilco that we have all come to love and admire.  And quite honestly, if this is your first wilco album, it just may be the best one to introduce you to the band with the exception of Being There.  It is not a straight forward rock record and it does not have any country twang that most Wilco albums seem to have.  It is simply a great, SMART pop record with more hooks than their previous effort.  Give Wilco a try, if you have the money by this and Being There and you can see the range that they are possible of and also the brilliance af the man known as Jeff Tweedy.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is a \\"must have\\" to anyone's collection. An excellent mix of rap and rock, done in a smart, uplifting way. I purchased it ... and I listen to it all of the time in my car. Check it out!
B000053ZRR|3.0|I had VH1 version of this concert taped and decided to buy<BR>DVD hoping it will be the same concert. Unfortunately, it's not... It's not bad at all, but the one showed on VH1 was much better --- band performed better, stage was better and nice fireworks!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I got this CD about a month ago and listen to it often. (I bought it with March to Fuzz - Best of... and Rarities by Mudhoney, which is getting equal time on my CD players.) I think this is some of the freshest music to come out in a while. This CD demonstrates well Norah's beautiful voice and range: from the soulfull \\"Turn me on\\", to the country laiden \\"Lonestar\\" to the the sultry \\"I've got to see you again\\" to the jazzy remake of the Hank Williams classic, \\"Cold, cold heart\\". I really enjoy nearly all of the tracks on this CD and rarely fast forward any songs while listening to it in the car. My favorite tracks are 1,2,3,5,7,8,9 and 11. Gradually, I have come to appreciate this entire CD and recommend it highly. I eagerly anticipate the chance to catch her live, in concert; it is sure to be a moving experience.

B00003CWL6|5.0|The Burnhams are a typical, upwardly mobile family: a father with a well-paid job in advertising, a mother who is a driven real estate sales agent, an angst-ridden teen age daughter who is at an age to despise her parents.  They live in a lovely home with a white picket fence, lovely roses, and a red door.  Everything about them projects an image of success.  And yet-- Lester (Kevin Spacey) hates his advertising job, which makes him feel like a prostitute selling second rate wares to stupid johns.  Caroline (Annette Benning) is frustrated at being second-best in the real estate business.  Daughter Jane (Thorah Birch) finds both of her parents vapid and doubts her own validity as a person--particularly when compared with her beautiful, sexed-up best friend Angela (Mena Suvari.)  Their lives, like the lives of so many others rushing \\"to get ahead in the world,\\" have become less about actually living than about maintaining and improving upon the appearance of success so prized by society.<br />What is most astonishing about the film is its complete believability.  Speaking as one who has worked a great deal in advertising and sales, I was amazed with the accuracy with which Ball's powerful and darkly funny script captured the lives of those whose values rest exclusively upon external achievement--Lester's growing and barely concealed hatred for advertising and Caroline's constant use of self-help tapes and personal success mantras are truly commonplace in the business world.  Now, if AMERICAN BEAUTY were merely this and nothing more, it would still be an astonishing film.  But it goes considerably further than that--for Lester, suddenly motived by a lust for his daughter's friend Angela, realizes how completely unenjoyable \\"keeping up appearances\\" has become.  And he explodes the status quo in such a way as to bring every one's petty materialism and mask-like personaes into a sharp, very funny, and pitch-black focus as the shallow and meaningless things they are.  And in the process he both finds and destroys himself forever.<br />The cast is astonishing throughout, with Kevin Spacey the ultimate \\"I Can't Take It Any More\\" man and wife Annette Benning the ultimate vision of every hard-core sales representative it has ever been my misfortune to meet, a woman determined to \\"project an image of success at all times\\" even if it kills her.  Thora Birch is a remarkable young performer, as is her boyfriend Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari is perfectly cast as the youthful beauty for whom Spacey develops an unexpected passion. Mendes' direction is flawless here, and he navagates the both the complicated appearances of success and the personal shallowness it conceals with tremendous clarity, never overplaying his hand in either direction.  Perhaps the most telling bits of the film are among the most subtle, as when the film posits the tiresomely yuppie but nonetheless considerably more honest gay couple next door as more genuine than the Burhams, Caroline's eternal efforts at ego building through motivational tapes, and the way in which Angela (in time honored teenage fashion) niavely attempts to use sex as a weapon to conceal her own insecurities.<br />The film is extremely funny, but it is also ultimately devastating.  A great many people--particularly those who equate \\"an image of success\\" with successful lives, will despise the film.  But like it or not, AMERICAN BEAUTY's take on the failure on the failure of the American dream is easily the most successful and deadly accurate satire on life in these United States since the equally wicked NETWORK.  This is the real thing, people--and it may be too close to home for many.  Watch it at your own risk.  Strongly, strongly recommended.in the process he both finds and destroys himself forever.<br />The cast is astonishing throughout, with Kevin Spacey the ultimate \\"I Can't Take It Any More\\" man and wife Annette Benning the ultimate vision of every hard-core sales representative it has ever been my misfortune to meet, a woman determined to \\"project an image of success at all times\\" even if it kills her.

0307120007|5.0|This was my daughter's first book.  I had  hoped to save her copy for my youngest daughter, but she wore it out, and ripped the pages.  So, I bought a new copy and both girls still love reading it together.  It is a timeless classic that will always appeal to the toddler's sense of touch.<br />This would make a great shower gift for baby and I give it 5 stars because it is fun to read and feel.

0805017445|5.0|This was the first story my daughter learned in Primary/Kindergarten.  Each day the kids learned a new color and words for each page of the book.  My child really enjoyed bringing home worksheets to show me what was happening in the story.<br />After she learned the story, I bought the hardcover book to replace the well-worn worksheets that were getting very crumpled.  This is truly my daughter's favorite book, and she loves reading it to her sister.  Her reading skill has surpassed this level, yet she returns to it for the colorful illustrations, and to remember the joy she had in learning to read.  This book rates 5 stars and your child will love the melodic tempo to its words as they learn to read.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is so original that begins in the end and ends in the beginning. But this does have a reason. The main character, Leonard, has a memory problem since his wife was killed being in their home, he knows who he is, and remembers everything before that incident, but since then, he can't make new memories. He will forget what is happening right now in just few minutes. He won't remember events, people, conversations, places, nothing. However, he remembers the murder of his wife and he wants to take revenge. He decided to investigate, not an easy task in his condition. He needs to write everything down, takes  pictures and tattoos important facts on his body. Since the movie is going backwards, you can feel the frustration of Leonard about not knowing what happened before. You will know how the story ends but you will discover new things as the movie goes on until the end of it (the beginning of the story), only then you will understand  the end of the story (the beginning of the movie). Confused? Well, Memento is also a little confusing. I admit  I had to watch it twice to understand it completely, but such a great film deserves to be watched. Do it too.
0553381350|5.0|I opened this book with a limited interest in the Space Race, jet pilots, or Tom Wolfe, but have become fascinated by all three. This is an extremely well written, exciting, fast paced novel that takes place during the early days of space flight and focuses on the personalities who drove our pursuit to beat the Russians. It contains subtle criticism of the space program and the people inside it, which is a nice subplot to the story, but the adventure and energy is what makes this a great book. I will again read Wolfe and want to learn more about the history of the space program now, and when a book inspires these kind of reactions I can not help but recommend it to anyone who asks for a suggestion.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was skeptical to pick up &quot;Come away with me&quot; for two reasons: one, I heard just as many bad things as good, and two, she was compared to singers that can't be compared. Of, course, there is only one Billie Holiday and I was a little biased about how this girl would sing.  So I picked it up and gave it a listen, and loved it.  This is music good enough to be enjoyed by fans of all different genre of music, the songs were all pretty and there wasn't a bad one.  Since buying it, I've listened to it over and over again.  Maybe she isn't Nina Simone or Lady Day, but she sure beats most of the young female singers today.  Her lyrics are deep and pretty, her voice soft and her piano playing is wonderful.  Compare her to what's out there, and you will be pleasantly surprised at music that is different from what's out there and far surprasses most of what has came out in 2002.<br />So if you have an open mind and you don't compare her and you just listen to it, you might enjoy it.  Its a great cd.

6305511055|5.0|This more of an opinion than a review.  I loved this film the first time I saw it on TV. The start   is so downbeat, I thought it would just fill a couple of   hours while I was babysitting. Then it took off and didn't   let up until the very end.  I was so impressed that I spent 3 years looking for the  book by James Grady ('Six Days of the Condor', which was   out of print at the time).   I eventually got a copy of the book and went on to get an  NTSC VHS tape (I live in PAL-land) and eventually a Region 1  DVD (I'm in R2). I don't do that for many films.  I cannot understand how this film got so little notice and  isn't regularly shown on TV; I think it's fantastic.
B0000019PA|5.0|I was able to, ahem, OBTAIN all of the songs from this album, with the exception of &quot;two-headed boy pt. 2&quot; several months ago from a now-defunct (essentially) website. I'm not in the habit of music piracy, but all I'd ever heard from this band were the 30 second tidbits above and they sounded intriguing, but awfully STRANGE. I didn't want to throw 15 bucks at something I was going to listen to once. That being said, I just bought this CD just to obtain that one last song, after buying &quot;on Avery Island&quot; and some bootlegged live recordings. This is simply one of the strangest, catchiest, smartest, and most beautiful albums you'll ever hear. Most psychodelic music that I have heard is strange and abstract to the point of being boring or unlistenable; this album manages to meld strong emotional themes out of fantastical lyrics. The best example of this is undoubtly &quot;Oh Comely&quot;, which builds in intensity and pure dread out of lyrics like &quot;soft silly music is meaningful, magical... the movements were beautiful, all in your ovaries...&quot; and ends with probably the most crushing final line I've ever heard. It's imagery on par with faulkner, and I don't give that compliment lightly. Yet this is not an album just for &quot;lyric nerds&quot; like myself; the soul of the album is pure, raw emotion. I won't waste time and review space to harp on the common &quot;why do people listen *N'Sync when this is out there?&quot;. The plain fact is that many people are not going to &quot;get&quot; this album, and not because they're dumb, but because they look for something out of music that this doesn't give them, and there are things that it won't, like a crystalline singing voice or, frankly, uplifting themes. But I still suggest that everyone check it out, because for that one person out of ten who will be into it, it will be nothing less than life-altering. Yes, I paid 16 bucks for one song. And it was worth every penny.
0743201140|2.0|The basic premise of the book is great, and the on-line tool is useful.  However, there is very little discussion of how to use these strengths.  Also, I tend to be skeptical of the results when I'm not allowed to complete the survey again, 6 months or a year later, unless of course I buy another copy of the book!
B00004U8H4|2.0|American Psycho is kind of a dull movie.  Christian Bale's acting is occasionally interesting but the character of Patrick Batemen fails to gel.  <br />The oft-cited satire is played in a ham-fisted manner and comes off more as the usual propaganda from the usual suspects then anything revealing or entertaining.<br />I felt the movie was overrated first, because of all the talk of violence when the film was released, and secondly because all the glowing user reviews.<br />Since so many people do seem to like it, I would rate it a rent before deciding to own.  This has been a review of the unrated version.
B00003CXRP|3.0|I was surprised to read after seeing &quot;Cast Away&quot; that it is almost three hours long. I didn't squirm as I usually do while watching a movie of that length.<br />So that speaks well for the movie. However, I didn't think it was a super wonderful movie either.<br />Roger Ebert complains in his review that Zemekis and company revealed too much of the plot in the trailer for &quot;Cast Away.&quot; I concur with Ebert, although I may have come by my prior knowledge by reading reviews or talking to people who saw the movie.<br />The ending was a good idea with our protagonist meeting the woman who sent the FedEx package at the beginning of the movie (classic envelope pattern). But it wasn't filmed well (with Hanks standing in the middle of a dusty Texas intersection, pondering which direction to take next). I wish it had been more like the ending to &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; when the man and the woman started talking, and it was clear they were going to hook up.
B00005OAIE|5.0|As a fairly competent musician/songwriter, I think I hold my own at spotting exciting new artists. John Mayer's music is a fresh apple and his talent is well-balanced, especially for his age.  Sometimes compared to Dave Matthews in his sound, I would also bring in a Michael Franks vocal quality and you'll be closer to John Mayer's voice...and it's a good voice. As we all know, not many things are totally unique in music these days, it has pretty much all been done before... it's the individual's approach that births a new original.  John Mayer is writing lyrics that speak of breaking illusions and breaking out of them - not a new subject for lyrics but the difference here is that he doesn't take the cheap route of using the common anger that we find in many artists' content.  That is what sets him apart from the modern crowd. Mayer's good storytelling comes with melodies you'll be bouncing around in your head for a long while after you've gotten out of the car. His guitar work shows a honed technique and a natural talent for the instrument.  Bottom line - Mayer yields a CD that you can easily listen to again and again ... and you'll probably feel better for doing so.  I'll be interested to hear what John Mayer will put out in the future, considering the fact that \\"Room for Squares\\" shows that he's already got it.

My friend Laura and her sister had a bet going to see how long they could without crying and they both lost. It is a great movie that I watch with friends even now that we are 15 to 16 years old! It is the cutest, saddest, and best movie for girls. All girls are princesses!

B00000IFWE|4.0|Although I'll confess that there is not a Tom Petty song (or album for that matter) that I do not like, Echo stretches my limits.  It is a very depressing album which tells many stories of Petty's life (especially in relation to his divorce from his wife of 20+ years).  &quot;Room At The Top&quot; is about his relationship with Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys and the loss of Carl.  &quot;Free Girl Now&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Sundown&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Rhino Skin&quot;, &quot;Billy The Kid&quot;, and more tell tales of his suffering through his divorce.  However, I feel the album is only depressing if you're a true blue Petty fan and know what he was really going through at the time of it's writing and recording.  Out of the 4 producers Petty has gone through, Rick Rubin is by far my LEAST favorite, but &quot;Echo&quot; is still a very good album.  I bought it a week before it was released in spring of 1999 and would pay full price for it again.

B000002H1T|5.0|This is the definitive work of The Cars. The next person who refers to them as \\"new wave\\" music I will flog with a wet noodle!  This album is also Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange at his best and brightest.  Greg Hawkes (keyboards, saxophone, vocals) mentions in an interview that his keyboard work never really got complicated until this album.  Nothing could be more true.  Hawkes uses a plethora of overdubs to bring in new sounds to the group.  Unfortunately this is the album that caused the break-up of such a great rock and roll group.  Elliot Easton (lead guitar/vocals) released a solo album that same year after his contributions to The Cars' album because he needed some time to do his own thing. He was tired of the tedious work of Lange and needed an out--thus he turned to his friend and collaborator Jules Shear.  The following year Ric Ocasek (vocals/guitar) and Ben Orr (vocals/bass) both released solo albums.  Ocasek's was a moderate success and out of all of the remaining Cars still has the most successful career.  The whole album \\"Heartbeat City\\" is great--every song on it!  Although it's successor \\"Door To Door\\" is a great album, it hardly fits into the category of this 1984 classic.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Good god this album is so painfully good. I cannot stop listening to this cd. Each listen you get a little more of the puzzle. If you don't know who the Queens are, I am truely sorry for you and this album is meant for you. The best thing is that heavy, crushing, riffs are tempered with Josh's low-key vocals that perfectly balance everything. There are no fillers here, each song goes for the throat and delivers everything one would want from a genuine rock n' roll album. That term has been thrown around or at numerous bands these days but the Queens are the real deal. Songs like the insanely catchy, yet heavy, NO ONE KNOWS to the all out crust-punk of SIX SHOOTER. Nick Oliveri handles the vocals on this beauty of a tune. We also get a couple of songs sung by Mark Lanegen, formally of the Screaming Trees, SONG FOR THE DEAD & HANGIN' TREE. He fits perfectly in this circus. Now is your chance to support an actual rock band with probably THE best album of the year, so go out and get this CD NOW!!!

B0000640VO|4.0|&quot;One of my first loves was cartoons,&quot; Mr. Jeunet said. With his spiky hair, stubble- covered moon face and impish smile, he looks like<br />  a cuddlier, chubbier version of the British artist Damien Hirst. &quot;In fact, my first short films were experiments with animation,&quot; he said.<br />  This influence is palpable in every frame of &quot;Am&eacute;lie,&quot; which frequently resembles a live-action homage to the cartoonist Tex Avery.<br />  -'Am&eacute;lie': Going Sweet and Sentimental Has Its Rewards (Daniel Zalewski, 10/28/01, NY Times)<br />Though overcute, overlong, and overcontrived, this film has such an appealing star (Audrey Tautou), tries so hard to please, and is so unexpectedly sunny (coming from France), that its flaws can be forgiven.  But at least two of those flaws are worth noting.  The first is that the cartoonishness mentioned above makes it seem as if the director is trying to distance himself from the romanticism and sweetness of his own film.  This unfortunate failure of nerve leads to a kind of self-contradictory effect, as the Tex Avery touches get wheeled out every time Mr. Jeunet seems to be embarrassed by the sentimentality of a situation he's just presented.  This may help him keep his credibility with his fellow French filmmakers but necessarily weakens what should be some of the films finer moments.  Still, if you're willing to get in the cartoon spirit they won't bother you too much.<br />The more serious problem concerns a quintessentially French, or at least European, aspect of the plot.  The film, like Clueless, represents a modern take on Jane Austen's Emma, with its story of a young woman meddling in the love lives of those around her.  However, while Emma is one of the most underrated political novels of all time precisely because it shows the disastrous results of Emma's what we might call central planning, Am&eacute;lie assumes that such interventions would have uniformly happy results.  Oddly enough for such an otherwise whimsical movie it betrays the flaw of rationality, in its conceit that those things which Amelie can imagine would work out well continually do so.  In fact, Mr. Jeunet says that people have told him that he inspired them to become Am&eacute;lies themselves.  One shudders to think of these film-addled Frenchwomen roaming the land fixing up peoples' lives the way they think they should be.  Mr. Jeunet and his followers would do well to recall the words of the great Eric Hoffer :<br />  A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs<br />  by minding other people's business.<br />This, though Mr. Jeunet seems to have missed it, must be the point even of his own film.  The inherent drama lies in Amelie's attempt to fill her own empty life, which if we really had the godlike powers she improbably demonstrates might not be so empty.  But since we don't and since we are ultimately not really either responsible for nor competent to govern the lives of others, the plot of the film has to build to the moment when Am&eacute;lie herself embraces the possibility of love.<br />Ms Tautou is so compelling an actress that we do indeed rejoice when this moment comes, and we have a pleasant enough time along the way.  But Mr. Jeunet needlessly lessens the tension with both his Bugs Bunny antics and his gallic certainty that our lives can be run better for us by others than we run them ourselves.  If only he'd imbibed the lessons of Jane Austen as deeply as those of Tex Avery it would be an even better picture.<br />GRADE : B+ise whimsical movie it betrays the flaw of rationality, in its conceit that those things which Amelie can imagine would work out well continually do so.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|This is without a dought, the best action movie I have ever seen. Blade 2 starts off as Blade (Snipes) giving you a quick review about he became Blade. Very intersting. Then it has him running in a tunnel finding his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) in a tube in which the vampires have been torturing him. You dont see that. Then he brings him home. And he is talking to him and his pal Scudsy. Then as their talking the Bloodpack people come in soooo quietly that you can not hear their footstep at all. Now here comes the action. Blade is doing all this Martial arts action and is donig a GREAT job at it too! Then as he is going to kill the last person of the Bloodpack, he says we have a proposition for you. Blade listens. He says there is a SUPER VAMPIRE out on the lose. Blade is like \\" So let me get this strait. \\" You want me to kill this vampire for you\\"? And from there it is action, suspense and some tense moments. Much better then the first one. Blade 2 is rated \\"R\\" for Strong Persuasive violenve, language, some drug use and language. This movie has blood in it. That is a defenitly. But I think Blade 2 is better with all the blood. It makes it more exciting. It really dosent have any gore, but there are 2 parts that could make you a little grossed out. Both of them are a back reveiling a guys spine (not that bad) and a person opening up a super vampires chest. There arent that bad, but they made me a little grossed out. But then I liked it. On my scale from 0-10 Blade 2 is a Pulse Pounding, Action Packed 10! Great movie. Have fun!

It yearns<br />  mightily for &quot;freedom&quot; and does all it can to escape.  Being denied its &quot;freedom&quot; for too long, the animal becomes a shadow of itself, its spirit<br />  broken.  So some people imagine.<br />  This is not the way it is.<br />  Animals in the wild lead lives of compulsion and necessity within an unforgiving social hierarchy in an environment where the supply of fear<br />  is high and the supply of food low and where territory must constantly be defended and parasites forever endured.  What is the meaning of<br />  freedom in such a context?<br />  -Life of Pi<br />Whatever else it may be, and it may be a fable or a hallucination or something altogether beyond our ken, Canadian author Yann Martel's Life of Pi is an absolutely mesmerizing bit of storytelling, one that will keep you reading from cover to cover without a pause.  Within, he tells the story, framed by author's comments which suggest it is a true story, of an Indian boy, Piscine Molitor &quot;Pi&quot; Patel, named for a swimming pool in Paris, who spent a thoroughly improbable, though entirely compelling, 227 days (from July 2, 1977 to February 14th, 1978)  lost at sea in a lifeboat with a 450 pound Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker.<br />Boy and tiger were originally on board a Japanese freighter that was transporting them and the Patel family along with numerous other animals to Canada, to which the Patels were transplanting themselves and their zoo, from Pondicherry, India to escape political unrest.  A zebra, a hyena, an orangutan, some rats, and a few cockroaches survived the initial sinking, but not Richard Parker's predations.  Only Pi and the tiger eventually made it to Mexico, where they washed up on a beach before Richard Parker disappeared. During their time in the lifeboat, and on a makeshift raft that Pi made himself, to put some distance between himself and the big cat, transpired a remarkable story of survival and of natural selection in all its gory glory.<br />It is a story, as an old man in India told the author, &quot;that will make you believe in God&quot;.  Or, maybe it isn't.  Maybe it's the kind of story that will make you believe in the human need to tell stories in order to make sense of our existence, an animal story told by the most dangerous of all the animals, but nonetheless the one animal that tells story and that knows God.

At any rate, it's a terrifically readable and enjoyable novel (?) and Pi Patel, a Hindu/Muslim/Christian--who when he swears says &quot;Jesus, Mary, Mohammed and Vishnu!&quot; and who's felt the presence of God--seems certain to become one of the most fondly remembered narrator/heroes of modern fiction.<br />GRADE : Ahe tiger eventually made it to Mexico, where they washed up on a beach before Richard Parker disappeared. During their time in the lifeboat, and on a makeshift raft that Pi made himself, to put some distance between himself and the big cat, transpired a remarkable story of survival and of natural selection in all its gory glory. <br />It is a story, as an old man in India told the author, &quot;that will make you believe in God&quot;.  Or, maybe it isn't.  Maybe it's the kind of story that will make you believe in the human need to tell stories in order to make sense of our existence, an animal story told by the most dangerous of all the animals, but nonetheless the one animal that tells story and that knows God.  Or maybe it's just a fairy tale.

B00005JKDR|4.0|I saw this film in the theatre and I loved it.<BR> The only problem that I had with it is it seemed <BR>to go on for ever.  There were a couple of times when it seemed like it should have ended.  Never the less a great and funny film for everyone, not as good as the Toy Story's but definatly worth buying.  I cant wait for the 2 disk DVD.
0767805712|5.0|In the not too distant future, a young man, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), dreams of escaping from Earth and rocketing into outer space.  But Vincent is genetically flawed--he's got a bum heart and a life expectancy of just 30 years--in a world where such human frailty is no longer the norm and no one's about to waste precious resources on an astronaut with less than an optimal genetic profile.  In order to get around his all too human limitations, Vincent swaps genetic profiles with Jerome Morrow, (Jude Law), a genetically-designed and nearly perfect young man, embittered by the accident that left him wheelchair bound.<br />The achievement of bio-engineered superiority for some has naturally created a bifurcated society, with the elite gripped by paranoia about inferior \\"degenerates\\" trying to pass themselves off, so Vincent's deception requires him to sneak Jerome's urine into sample cups, to wear false fingertips with Jerome's blood for identification pinpricks, even to salt his workstation with Jerome's hair and skin flakes.  Even with all that he still has to deal with the suspicions of an arrogant launch Director (Gore Vidal), a watchful staff physician, and a beautiful fellow trainee (Uma Thurman).  The situation becomes even more fraught with danger when a murder occurs at Gattaca and two cops begin to haunt the place.<br />All of this works well enough as a mere sci-fi thriller but writer/director Andrew Niccol, who also wrote The Truman Show, is after far bigger fish.  What he gives us here is a timely and thought-provoking argument against the idea that genetics is destiny.  Just as he showed Truman's seemingly perfect world to be anti-human, he shows here that the utopian quest for physical \\"perfection\\", because it can not account for the human soul, must result in a dystopic nightmare.  A few of the really fine touches here are the set designs which are cold and sterile; the general absence of women, who will be selected out in a world where fathers can always choose to have sons; Vincent's birth scene, when his own father, realizing him to be an \\"unsatisfactory\\" heir, decides not to name the boy for himself; and what is, I think, the best scene in the film, when the genetically perfect Jerome reveals that he envies Vincent's natural birthright, the unengineered will that drives him.<br />This is a profound film.  It sounds a too seldom heard cautionary note about the limitations of science, even as it celebrates the limitless human spirit.  At one point the Director says : \\"No one exceeds their potential. If they do it just means we didn't judge it accurately in the first place.\\"  This notion, that human potential is a physical quality, to be quantified, measured and judged, is the all too likely and frighteningly imminent horror that resides at the core of this vile future world.  Mr. Niccol is a polemicist of a very rare sort, for he manages to entertain even as he delivers his jeremiads.  That's quite a feat.  It makes him one of the most exciting and visionary talents to come along in Hollywood in some time.<br />GRADE : Aan always choose to have sons; Vincent's birth scene, when his own father, realizing him to be an \\"unsatisfactory\\" heir, decides not to name the boy for himself; and what is, I think, the best scene in the film, when the genetically perfect Jerome reveals that he envies Vincent's natural birthright, the unengineered will that drives him. <br />This is a profound film.

B00003CX7L|5.0|Toy story 2 fleshes out the charcter of Woody. Woody is kidnapped by a greedy toy collector who wants to put him in a museum with the rest of his round-up gang. Woody finds out he was part of a major children's puppet show (Like Howdy Doody) and that he is a very valuable doll. He meets Jessie who is part of his round-up gang. Jessie wants to go to the museum and hates being in storage.The rest of the round-up gang includes woody's horse Bullseye and the Prospector. Woody still holds loyalty to Andy. <br />In the meantime Andy's toys launch a daring rescue. They run into Barbie (Tour Guide Barbie). Of course Barbie is portrayed as a complete Airhead. The Round-uP gang convince Woody to join them. Andy is getting older and will out grow his toys. Jessie sings a beautiful song \\"When she loved me\\" about her child Emily. Emily outgrew Jessie and ended up giving her to charity. Of course Buzz and the Gang reach Woody. <br />Woody realizes he cannot stop Andy from growing up and he would not miss it for the world. The prospector tries to stop them. Eventually Woody goes back to Andy with Jessie and Bullseye.<br />This is a great story about loyalty and frienship. Most children animation shows are very violent. Toy Story 2, as well as the first movie, gives a possitive message to children and are a refreshing change of pace. Toy Story 2 shows that a Child is a toys entire universe and that they are crushed deaply when they are abandon. There are some children that do have an enotional attachment to their toys and do keep them into their adulthood. Some even pass their toys onto thier children. Toy story is a movie that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. The animation was fantastic. I like that \\"tongue in cheek\\" reference to Star Wars when Buzz confronted Emperor Zurge.<BR>\\"You killed my father\\"<BR>\\"Wrong, I am your father\\"<BR>\\"No!!!\\"<br />Will there be a Toy Story 3?
B00005NB8J|3.0|Not much to say about the movie that hasn't already been said.  You either like it or you don't.<br />However, I'm horribly disapointed with this as a DVD.  The film transfer is terrible;  It has been over-enhanced and sharpened artificially.  The over-processing has destroyed many scenes, causing horrendous aliasing on anything with contrast or fine detail.  There are halos around people (look at any shot outside where someone is against a sky for instance).  There's a lot of dirt in several dark scenes that was never cleaned up and it screams out like mad.<br />What a disapointment, especially for a \\"Special Edition\\".
B00003W8NO|4.0|Toy story set the standard for all future computer animated stories. The story is simple is about a boy named Andy and his toys. When Andy leaves (or when no humans are around) the toys xcome to life). Andy's favorite toy is a cowboy doll named Woody.<BR>Andy and his family are moving (probably getting away from the \\"kid from Hell\\" next door). Before the move Andy has a birthday party. Birthday parties and Christmas are a toys most trying time periods because they could be replaced by another toy. Andy gets a new Toy , a space toy called Buzz Lightyear. Buzz replaces Woody and Woody becomes Jelous. Buzz really thinks he is Buzz Lightyear. Well they end up getting lost together then eventually end up next door with Kid Evil named Sid. Sid is a child with serious issues. He takes his toys, and his sisters, and makes these creatures out of them. Buzz realizes that he really is a toy and not Buzz Lightyear. Woody tells Buzz thier is no greater honor in being a toy and making a child happy. They escape the house and how they did it is funny. The toys decide to come to life right before sid thus turning him into a basket case. Woody and Buzz then catches up with Andy and is family.

Me senti tan identificado con Santiago, pues en ese momento yo andaba en una busqueda tambien y bueno aprendi a dejar el miedo a lo nuevo a un lado y a buscar mi leyenda personal.
0788812807|5.0|This a pure classic from Disney's golden age. The story is a classic love story between two different people (or dogs). The spaghetti eating scene is  a classic. It was repeated in Hot Shots! Part Duex several years later with Charlie Sheen. <br />Lady is a well-bread Cocker Spaniel and Butch (The Tramp) is a free roaming mutt who has a nose for trouble. Like many of Disney's amimated movies, it can be enjoyed by adults as well as children. The musical score is typically good for a Disney cartoon.
0688170528|3.0|This book was the first I've read by Jodi Picoult and found that I could not put it down!  However, in the end, I found that I wanted the loose ends to be tied up.  For instance, what was in the diary that her mother found, read and burned?  Who was sexually abusing her, if not her own mind with Chris?  Maybe I just missed something.  All in all, I think for myself, it's worth another read to find out.
B00003CX8T|5.0|After Beauty and The Beast's success i thought that disney could never top that. However Alladin blew me away. I have it on VHS also with Alladin 2: Return Of Jafar and Alladin 3: The King Of Theives. Excellent trilogy... a must buy.
B00005UWCV|3.0|This is the only animated movie I`ve seen that wasn`t made by Disney but managed to achieve the entertainment and charm of &quot;Disney magic&quot;. When I saw this the first time I was eleven and I didn`t know the difference. I think the reason Disney stopped making so many animated features like the classics everybody knows is because they`ve run out of fairy tales and books to cover. The creators of &quot;Anastasia&quot; took an unthinkable story that you`d never think would make a passable kids` movie and pulled it off.<BR>In some moments the movie is very much like the Disney masterpieces, but a great deal of it is pretty original. The main character, Anastasia or &quot;Anya&quot;, is not much like any Disney beauty previously created, and there has never been a main Disney dude that acted or even looked at all like Dimitri. The movie has a different kind of feel altogether from the Disneys. When the characters go into song it suddenly has the setting and mood of an old-fashioned musical. There are parts in the beginning that remind me of &quot;Newsies&quot;, and during the song &quot;You Can Learn To Do It&quot; the whole thing is kind of reminiscent of &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot;<BR>There are, of course, some hurting elements that Disney probably wouldn`t have allowed to happen. The computer animation goes from being beautifully done to overdone from scene to scene. In the beginning of the movie there`s blurs of white blowing around the screen that`s supposed to look like snow. There`s a part when a stone horse is attacking Dimitri and it`s the fakest, most poorly animated thing accomplished in a long while. Plus there are a few weak moments in the script, though overall the lines are full of good laughs.<BR>To say something about the music, I liked that the songs reminded me more of classic live-action musicals than Disney movies. The score is very good, but I wouldn`t say better than even most scores from other animated movies. That`s a hard area to beat.<BR>Overall, if you`ve never seen the movie you should see it at least just once to check it out. And if you`ve got kids, buy the thing. I had a lot of trouble borrowing the VHS from my friend`s little sister because she didn`t want to part with it.
B00003CXCS|5.0|If you think your child is too young and sit though a musical, think again in the case of Sound of Music. Our 2 1/2 year-old love the songs in this movie *MORE* than the music of Elmo and Barney!! Something that I thought could never happen.<br />Ever since we turned her onto &quot;Do-Re-Me&quot;, she had asked to watch this DVD every day. Now she knows all the words to &quot;Do-Re-Me&quot;, and she can sing it as well as other songs in the movie like &quot;So Long, Farewell&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;. Incredible.<br />If you have young children who wants to watch and listen to the songs over and over again, make sure you get the DVD version, because you will be able to jump from song to song immediately, something you can't do with video tape.<br />Highly recommended, especially over Elmo and Barney.
0767847431|4.0|I thought this Sinbad, had even better effects than The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. It had a great scene when The six armed Buda Statue fights Sinbad. The monsters were not giant, but they were realistic. The actor as Sinbad was okay. None of the Sinbad movies will never surpass The 7th voyage of Sinbad
B00005JKNF|5.0|This movie is not for those with short attention spans or those who are held by a great plot. Not to say that just because you aren't captivated by this movie you're automatically stupid... but a great many people won't have the same capacity for enjoying this movie that I had.<br />Some people thought that the huge number of substantial characters prevented them from being developed well, but one of Altman's great strengths as a director is to give a character no more than 10 minutes of significant screen time but still tell you their whole life story and make them incredibly moving. The best examples of this in the film are the characters of the thoughtful, plaintive Ivor Novello, the neglected, looked-down-upon Mabel, and the weasely but sympathetic Commander Meredith, three characters that I'll admit had little impact on me upon first viewing but grew on me greatly as I watched more and more.<br />Which brings me to an important point... this movie MUST be watched more than once to be appreciated. Don't expect to get everything the first time, and don't make the mistake of watching the movie as a murder mystery, waiting for the crime to be committed. This is not the point of the film, and the crime is not committed until more than halfway through the film.<br />The show is stolen though, by those performances who really do make a big impact on first viewing: namely, those of Maggie Smith as the delightfully snobbish Countess of Trentham, Kristin Scott Thomas as the husband-loathing, cold-but-sexy Lady Sylvia, Kelly McDonald the understatedly charming lady's maid Mary, and especially Helen Mirren as the head housekeeper with a sordid past, Mrs. Wilson (a performance that deserved the Oscar it was nominated for... though a smaller role, Mirren's performance towers over the generic Jennifer Connelly, who robbed her of the Oscar).<br />In short, if you're looking for fun, wit, humor, intrigue, mystery, tragedy, and a wealth of great characters, then Gosford Park isa cinematic experience that will not be forgotten!
B000062XKL|3.0|It's your classic theif on his last job movie.  A good companion to David Mamet's &quot;Heist&quot; which was better than this.  It's about Brando's character and his last job for the thief, played by DeNiro.  Ed Norton (no not the one from the Honeymooners) plays the young crook on the rise to the top hoping to one up DeNiro's big score.  It's fun to watch and has one good twist that I guessed right away.  You don't have to watch too many movies to see how the ending came out.  All in all it's still a good movie to see DeNiro,Brando's performance (who could have been played by any character actor)and Edward Norton...who is the wild card in this movie....
B00005JKJA|5.0|.. if you think long enough, and if you see it 2 or 3 times.
B00004TRD8|4.0|This is a really cool movie. Even 11 years after it's release, the special effects still look convincing, and the story and acting is excellent (as long as you don't think too hard about the time travel). The story is that in the future, a self aware computer system called Skynet has ravaged the planet with a nuclear war, to wipe out the humans. However, a military resistance lead by strategic genius John Connor is mere inches from defeating Skynet, so the Machines, in a last-ditch effort send a Terminator, an unstopable Cyborg that looks like a Human to kill John Connor's mother, thus preventing his birth! However, John Connor lears of this, and sends a lone soldier named Kyle Reese back in time to protect his mother. Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor fall in love, thus concieving John Connor, and destroy the Terminator, with Kyle dying in the process. That is what is chronicled in the first Terminator.<br />In T2: Judgment Day, the machines devise an even better plan for wiping out John Connor. They send a more advanced terminator to the early 90's to kill John Connor himself while he is still a boy. The adult John Connor lears of this, and re-programs a Terminator to protect his child self in the past. Thus, the story for Terminator 2 unfolds.<br />The movie is awsome, but there is something VERY annoying about this film, and for that reason I will deduct a star from it. This movie could have EASILY been PG-13, had it not been for an over-abundance of foul language, and some \\"un-artistic\\" eye gouging scenes. If it haden't been for these two things, I'd say this would be a perfect film to show to the whole family. It's got a thought provoking story, and had it been milder in the language and more \\"artistic\\" in the eye gouging scenes, kids would be captivated by things like John Connor's frienship with his robotic protector. If you want to let your kids see it, I suggest that you see it yourself first, and fast forward through the eye gouging and one scene with alot of un-presidented profanity. However, there might be a bit too many \\"F-Words\\" scattered throught the film for it to be clean enough even so. Still though, for the more mature of us, this is a great film. And for the kids, you could always take them to the 3D show at Universal Studios.

B000068OSK|5.0|I stated to get into the White Stripes when my sister bought De Stijl. I really liked it, and bought White Blood Cells. Shortly afterward I bought this cd, and wow. I think out of every CD I own (accept maybe The Strokes) This one is my favorite. I love thier raw, blues-y sound. It's art. I know the White Stripes are awesome people, and they don't like being the center of attention or anything, but they sure do deserve it. I'm still confused as to how anyone, anywhere can be as artistically and musically inclined as they, and all they are doing is what they feel is the truth. I just want to say, if you don't own this CD, buy it. It's great. It's the most outstandidng CD I've ever heard, and I hope that they continue to make wonderful music for as long as they can!
B00005OAIE|4.0|By now, you've probably all heard his music on the radio. ...  I don't like DM.  I DO like this offering.  Great guitar work, original voice and interesting style.

B00005JKL8|1.0|Pathetic - infantile, naive, made to look like a video<br />game for 13 year olds. Wonder what made Gene Hackman want<br />any part in this..
B00003CXN4|3.0|My review of \\"Traffic\\" is based on what I saw at a movie threatre, not on VHS or DVD.  First there was a 6-hour miniseries; \\"Traffik\\" set in Europe and Asia, which has been shown on PBS many times.  This is an outstanding look at the drug trade as seen through the eyes of the users, the dealers, the police, the parents, and the politians. It was so realistic, it almost appeared to be a documentary.  Then a few years later, the 2-hour film \\"Traffic\\" set in the U.S. and Mexico, was released.  It is a condensed remake of the earlier miniseries, and although it is good, it does not compare to the earlier film.  Some scenes in the movie just don't work as well as they did in the miniseries, because, in the shorter film, they just don't make sense.  The food delivery to the hotel room in the movie looks like a way to speed up the end of the film, while in \\"Traffik\\", the same scene looks right in place.  In the movie, at the last minute, we find out there's feud between the drug dealer and his lawyer.  It the in miniseries, the rivalary is shown in much greater detail, throughout the film.  I liked \\"Traffic\\", the movie; but \\"Traffik\\", the miniseries, is much better, and is a definite must-see for everyone.
B0000047CX|5.0|I bought the original album(really wax!) and played it until you could see the neighbors house, across the street, through it!  Stan Getz had one of the sweetest sounds on a sax.  Only a very few can achieve that kind of sound.  <br />If you love the sound of Brazilian jazz, samba, and other rhythms, you will love this CD.  Antonio Carlos Jobim was a fine writer.  Without his gift of writing, the sounds of Brazilian jazz might have never become so well loved.   Gilberto was an amazing performer.  I had the priviledge of seeing these gents together in a performance in Los Angeles.  Stan Getz was responsible for their coming to the USA, and they also brought Astrid Gilberto who became famous for her song &quot;The Girl From Ipanema&quot;.  <br />The music on this CD will bring back fond memories of the 60's and 70's for some, and will be an exciting musical blend for newcomers.  Whichever you are, dear reader, know that you will not be disappointed.  <br />I am now and always will be a Stan Fan, and a fan of the sounds of Getz/Gilberto-and Brazilian jazz.
B000069HKH|5.0|Having been a Springsteen fan since 1975 and seeing numerous concerts over the past 27 years, I found the Rising to be one of his best efforts, especially in recent years. I am a huge fan of the &quot;older stuff&quot;, Darkeness on the Edge of Town, Wild, Innocent &amp; E Street Shuffle, The River; you get the idea. This is up there with the best of them.<BR>After purchasing the CD, I dropped it in my magazine in my car and it hasn't left yet. It is on all of the time and my 6 year old daughter knows the words to several tunes and is wondering when I will be seeing him again (I can only hope!)<BR>Keep it up Bruce, I love ya!
B00005JKG9|5.0|No doubt the best sales movie, the typical sales environment, themes, what goes on behind the scene of and etc...  Anyone who ever wroked in sales would really appreciate the film.  Al Pacino, a great actor in a great movie, Alec Baldwin, typically successful A-hole. Anyone who works in a sales carrer CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO WATCH IT!
B000067DNC|4.0|The only bad thing about the box set it is in widescreen.<BR>whould be alot better in full scrren.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a light-hearted and fun movie, and the DVD and case are uniquely designed and packaged.  You get two DVD's in a special cardboard case, which has a nice slip cover.  Good product all around.
B00004RF9B|5.0|First off, those of you complaining about the stretched out video transfer need to educate yourselves on DVD. It's called anamorphic and allows more of the MPEG-2 video codec to be used for the picture itself in very widescreen formats. If you don't have a 16:9 television, you need to go into the video options menu of your DVD player (not the DVD's menu, mind you) and tell it you're using a 4:3 aspect ratio display. As for the color hues and sound, I don't own the DVD, so I can't say. Somehow I find it unlikely that a major studio's video mastering would be paltry, but who knows.<br />Now for the film itself: Forbidden Planet blew me away. Human beings in the future using flying saucers. Realistic jargon. Believable military behavior and procedures. Scenes that have been used in countless other sci-fi movies, including Total Recall and Star Wars. I even noticed that David Lynch copied some of the costumes and props for his version of Dune (uniforms, rifles, gun fire, onboard microphone handset, etc). Leslie Nielsen plays a very convincing captain of the military vessel. The crew is much more at ease with each other than you see in most science fiction where there's a command structure. Then, we have the stunning Anne Francis who's got a face to die for. The plot has excellent pacing and it never gives away too much too soon, even going so far as to never show us certain unnecessary elements at all. This is definitely a must see.
B00005RFAI|5.0|These are my favorite tracks. However, there isn't one song on the album I dislike. I definately don't think the title track is the strongest. LOVE the duo with Steven Tyler! Genius!
B000069HKH|5.0|I was a little skeptical before acquiring this album - firstly, because of the length of time it has been since the last Springsteen and E Street Band collaboration, secondly, because of the inspiration from 9/11 and thirdly, the Boss is getting older.  I ran through the album the first time and honestly some of the songs do have a different sound and may be a little departure from the Boss norm but after the 2nd and 3rd listen it kept getting better and better.  \\"The Rising\\" has been the only CD in my truck for the last month and I still love it.  The music and lyrics are inspired and meaningful, Bruce's voice is getting better (if you can believe it!!), and the E Street Band still packs a punch.  The listeners who spoke disparagingly about this album simply do not know what they are speaking of - and probably haven't welcomed a new album since Woodstock.  For the rest of you open minded and willing listeners - GET THIS ALBUM!! It is a must - own!!!  You'll LOVE IT.
B00005NGSD|4.0|I saw the Scorpions perform \\"We'll Burn the Sky\\" live on their last tour and I was totally blown away.  This CD is worth getting just for this song.  It stands up against the recognized classics of the 80's.  The rest of the album is an acquired taste.  Ulrich Roth was great on this album but seemed to be playing a different style than the rest of the band.
038533558X|5.0|When I open one of Harlan Coben's books I expect to be pulled into the whirlwind of suspense that he is so capable of presenting. He has me guessing till the last page of his books. They never leave my side. I carry them about in anticipation of having a minute or two to read even a paragraph.<br />In this, his latest mystery, we meet Will whose brother Ken disappeared several years ago after being accused of a murder that his family believes he has been framed for. The circumstances around the murder become a tangled web of secrets and everyone has something to hide. Friend becomes foe and vice versa, as everything in Will's life is questioned from start to finish. Wonderfully intricate story line with bone chilling characters that leap off the pages. Coben is never a disappointment.  Kelsana 10/07/02
B000000OSE|4.0|I bought this album 11 years ago along with UYI 2 and I definitely prefer the other one.  Use Your Illusion I is harder and angrier, with dashes of country (You Ain't The First), spanish classical (guitar solo at the end of Double Talkin' Jive), to epic ballads (November Rain).  One of the things that makes Guns N'Roses stand apart from other 80's metal bands is the diversity of style, which in my mind makes the Use Your Illusion set superior to Appetite For Destruction, and Axl's virtuostic keyboard skills.  I would recommend this album to anyone, if only for November Rain, in my opinion THE BEST ballad ever written.
B000099T3P|5.0|Somewhere in space, a prison asteroid was going to have a vicious gang of furry baskeball-shaped razor-toothed alien creatures called \\"Krites\\" until they suddenly escape to Earth where they can fed on anyone or anything that comes in their way. The Brown family ( Billy Green Bush, Dee Wallace Stone, Scott Grimes, and Nadine Van Der Valde) will have one hell of a night fighting off these hungry hairballs that not even Sheriff Harv ( M. Emmet Walsh) and lovable drunk Charlie ( Don Opper) can stop but a pair of intergalatic shapeshifting bounty hunters named Ug ( Terrence Mann) and Lee come to the rescue to kill off these things.<br /><br />Funny and entertaining Sci-fi horror comedy with charm and wit! the movie was kind of a cash-in on the success of \\"Gremlins\\" but the movie isn't really like \\"Gremlins\\" it's more in the tradition of E.C. Comics and those 50's Sci-fi flicks. Billy Zane does a nice earlier film appearence here before he became a big shot star and the movie has a sharp sense of humor including some good special effects like the bounty hunter transformations.<br /><br />The DVD has good picture and sound quality with the only extras are the original theatrical trailer with trailers to the other Critters movies and there's a easter egg if you go up to see the highlighted Critter eyes you can see an alternate ending.<br /><br />If your into lighthearted horror comedy or Sci-fi/horror flicks then i recommend this movie.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Critters 2: The Main Course\\", \\" The Deadly Spawn\\" ( a.k.a. Return of the Aliens The Deadly Spawn), \\"Bad Taste\\", \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\", \\" The Thing ( 1982)\\", \\" The Blob ( 1958 and 1988)\\", \\" Terminator 1 & 2\\", \\"Starman\\", \\" Doom\\", \\" War of the Worlds ( 1953 and 2005)\\", \\" Dreamcatcher\\", \\" Night of the Creeps\\", \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( 1957 and 1978)\\", \\"Contamination\\", \\" Alien Series\\", \\"Predator 1 & 2\\", \\" AVP: Alien vs. Predator\\", \\" Pitch Black\\", \\"X-Files: Fight the Future\\", \\" Slither\\", \\" Starship Troopers\\", \\"Evil Dead II\\", \\"The Fifth Element\\", \\" Species\\", \\" They Live\\", \\" Xtro\\", \\" The Faculty\\", \\" Men in Black\\", \\"Lifeforce\\", \\"Insemenoid\\", and \\"NightBeast\\".Starship Troopers\\", \\"Evil Dead II\\", \\"The Fifth Element\\", \\" Species\\", \\" They Live\\", \\" Xtro\\", \\" The Faculty\\", \\" Men in Black\\", \\"Lifeforce\\", \\"Insemenoid\\", and \\"NightBeast\\".
6305291489|3.0|**NOTE: This review has nothing to do with the DVD specifically, but with the film itself.**<br />Now, granted, I haven't seen the original (being an '80's child...awe yea), but I can assure you it's better. The originals always are. Plus it's gotten dazzling reviews. Now, the remake, which I recorded off of Disney awhile ago.<BR>It tells the same storyline: Two separated, longlost twins (Hallie Parker and Annie James, both played by Lindsay Lohan) are reunited at camp, figuring out that they are twins, and decide to switch places. In the meantime, they have to cut Annie's hair and pierce her ears to make the switch believable. (::shudder:: The ear-piercing scene was horrible...I nearly cried, and therefore didn't get my ears pierced afterward for awhile.) Then we see Hallie in the place of Annie in London with mom Elizabeth (Natasha Richardson) and Annie in Hallie's shoes in Napa, California with dad Nick (Dennis Quaid). Chaos ensues when Annie discovers that Nick is set up to marry Meredith Blake (also called by the girls as &quot;Cruella&quot;; played by Elaine Hendrix). Then the girls' secret is discovered, and, well...trouble for them.<BR>The England scenes are wonderful...I've always been fascinated by their culture, and this movie portrays it beautifully. The Napa scenes are charming too...what a cool place to live. <BR>Now, the actors. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson are very good, and perfect for their roles. Lindsay Lohan is funny, sweet, and good in two roles. But the real shiner is Elaine Hendrix as Meredith. She is so perfectly cast; she's catty, witchy (one letter having been replaced...:-D), and downright detestable as the girlfriend...but I think she was excellent in her role. The other shiners are Lisa Ann Walter as Chessy (the scene where she's crying and Nick calls her on it made me laugh...I rewinded it and I laughed again) and Simon Kunz as the butler. He was very funny, and the grandfather was adorable.<BR>This movie is good fun for the family...though I bet some may be bored with it. I enjoyed it, but not enough to tape over part of it. I think you'll like it, unless you are in dire defense of the original, in which case, you'll see the inferiority. BUT, I think you should check this out for some '90's fun added to a '60's classic.
B00005Q66T|5.0|When I was going to buy Madonna's Greatest Hits II album last November,  I was pleased to see that alot of her 1990s and current hits were on this album.  Hits like \\"Erotica\\", \\"Take A Bow\\", how could you not include one of her biggest hits, \\"Ray Of Light\\", \\"Frozen\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"Music\\" just to name a few are all here, and while many of those are here you still have people saying well where is \\"Bad Girl\\" and \\"Rain\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\", or people are saying that the hits on this album don't match the hits from the \\"Immaculate Collection\\", they are not suppose to.  Can't we give Madonna credit for being able to release two greatest hits album with enough material on both to make each one great, and as far as the songs that are missing, \\"Rain\\" and \\"You'll See\\" are already on a compilation album \\"Something To Remember\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\"  simply weren't hits, but then how come \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"Bedtime Story\\" are on here when neither cracked the top 40, because both of them had good videoes to help them especially \\"Bedtime Story\\", but then why isn't \\"You Must Love Me\\" found here, because it's found on the Evita soundtrack, well what about \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" that is the original version, well the dance version hit #8, Madonna simply wanted \\"Argentina\\" and not \\"Love Me\\".  Many people are never really happy when an artist puts together a hits' album because it's the same arguement, why was this left off and this left on, but on GHV2 Madonna put all the right songs on the album, enough said!.  I loved this album last year and I still love it this year.  Grade A+!
B000000OSG|5.0|I first heard this CD 10 years ago at age 13 and at the time I thought it was seriously heavy.  And I loved the lyrics.  Today, I think the drumming is very poor (same fill through the whole album!!) the depth of character to the songs is still unsurpassed.  I especially like the epic ballads like Breakdown and Estranged, but really, I don't think there is a poorly executed song on the album except for &quot;My World&quot; which I have always referred to as Axl-rap but in hindsight could it have been a foreshadowing of nu-metal?  The melodies are sweeping, Slash's guitar solos send chills down my spine...and I think that this album is still one of my all time favourites.
B000021YQV|5.0|I was lucky enough to go to Ozzfest for free by wining tickets, and they were the best band there, period. Their second CD is deffinintaly one of my best, and shows they can go from speed metal 1-2 trashes to calm melodic beats, and back. Any fan of Heavy Metal/Rock should and would like this album. BUY IT, IT ROCKS!!
B00006FXB6|4.0|This disc feels like a breath of fresh air because you have a group trying to 1) be catchy and 2) be musically interesting.  Dave Grohl's drumming helps a lot, for example on &quot;First It Giveth&quot; there's catchy singing, relatively bland guitar/bass work, and the drumming makes the music good.  The CD also bears close listening - odd instruments like flute pop up every now and again, though they're buried in the mix.  The radio station interludes don't bother me, they're meant to tie the record together.  The bonus DVD is cool - it has live performances of two old songs and &quot;No One Knows&quot;, plus pieces of other songs.  The neatest thing shows QOTSA at work in the studio and the technical drumming terms Josh uses when talking to Dave... &quot;play it like bud-a-bump-bum-bump, but with stiff wrists&quot;.
B0000636UN|5.0|I Don't understand how some people right reviews, here is &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;, from Sheryl Crow, easily one of the best albums of 2002, and people are giving it 2 stars and three stars, I would like to know how?  This album is absolutely incredible, I ean if you're buying this just for &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot;(Excellent Song) then you are buying is for the wrong reasons there are so many great songs on the album that any of 13 tracks can be hits, in fact another one already is &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; this song just blows me away and it just ROCKS!, then there is the superballad and tearjerker &quot;Safe And Sound&quot;, a little rough around the edges but boy does it work.  And there is &quot;Abilene&quot; after all we all have a little country in us, and &quot;Lucky Kid&quot; and &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot;, just to name a few.  I mean I am little bias when in comes to Sheryl Crow but how can anyone give the album a 1 or 2 star that just hurts.  2002 has been a down year for me musically and &quot;C'mon, C'mon&quot; has been a bright spot in a very low year CD wise for me.  I don't want people giving up on this album because it is too good.  I mean I could make a case for &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot;, but not &quot;C'mon, C'mon&quot;, it's just that good and that is why this review is being written, don't judge an album for one song judge it for all the songs.  Sheryl Crow rocks don't let anyone say otherwise and &quot;C'mon, C'mon&quot; well you've already guessed gets an A++++.  It's simply terrific.
B00004U8PA|5.0|I recommend this movie for anyone who every now and then feels like just laughing and letting themselves go. Rocky Horror Picture Show is truly senseless, but still one of the best I've seen. Mr. Tim Curry does an excellent job. His unique accent and some of his various gestures really gives his character a boost. I must admit that they cast the part of Frank-n-Furter perfectly when they chose him. Knowing how Susan Sarandon is today, I could hardly picture someone as uptight as her walking around in her &quot;unmentionables&quot; and playing such a off-key part. I barely recognized Barry Boswick, for I am so used to seeing him in Spin City, several Lifetime movies, etc. The one and only complaint I have for the movie is that from what I hear, when performed in a theatre, the character of rocky horror is much more masculine looking. I mean, I know he was supposed to look like a transexual, but the actor who played Rocky appeared so scrawny, sure he had muscle, but still scrawny. But nonetheless, this itself does not take away from this timeless film. The songs are wonderful, days after I watch the film I still find myself humming &quot;toucha toucha touch me,&quot; &quot;fanfare/don't dream it,&quot; or even &quot; eddy's teddy.&quot; All together I believe this movie is a must see. Ignore some of the more negative things you've heard about it and give it a try. You'll be extrememly glad you did!
0671004107|5.0|Carl Sagan was a genius on this book. His truly visionary ideas mixed with the reality of politics and social fads(how people would reject the project at one moment and love it the next) was truly stunning. His idealism about us being silly to think of ourselves as the only living beings in the universe is visionary and seemingly accurate. The excitement of evolving sciences and the wonder this book fills you with are all well worth the time to read this book.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind naturally sunk the overblown hair-metal craze once and for all.  G'nR (yes!) put a few holes in the hull, then the Seattle bands sunk it.  No album had as big as an effect as Nevermind.  The dynamics, screaming, and brilliant songwriting were a revelation.  Unfortunately, rock music hasn't quite recovered yet from the onslaught of [cruddy] musicians trying to copy Nirvana.  Luckily, Dave Grohl is drumming with Queens of the Stone Age, and Frank Black (\\"Teen Spirit\\" was Kurt's attempt to write a Pixies song) put out two albums this summer.
B000001FND|4.0|The Bee Gees 2nd album 'Horizontal' was quite an escape from the beautiful lush orchestration from the band's debut.  On this album the bands sounds more like a rock group than singers with a back up band.  'Horizontal' is quite different than the 'Bee Gees 1st' it's darker and more somber than it's bright and cheery debut.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, 'Horizontal' is quite a good album and a respectable follow up to the Bees Gees strong debut.<br />The first gem that will probably catch your eye on this record is MASSACHUSETTS, one of The Bee Gees biggest early hits and a personal favourite of mine.  The other song here that was released as a single (albeit in the UK only) was WORLD a rock song that made the group sound like the Beatles during Magical Mystery Tour.  AND THE SUN WILL SHINE has become somewhat of a turntable hit over the years.  This tear jerking ballad is the finest love song on the album.  The late 60's hard rock sound comes out on tunes such as LEMONS NEVER FORGET, THE EARNEST OF BEING GEORGE, and THE CHANGE IS MADE.  Indeed the band still sounds like The Beatles a lot on this record especially on THE BIRDIE TOLD ME and DAY TIME GIRL.  Two songs that sound like something McCartney would have done.  WITH THE SUN IN MY EYES is a bizarre yet beautiful love song.  REALLY AND SINCERELY is a nice tune but a tad too depressing for me (also I don't think the accordian helps the song!) and HARRY BRAFF is a catchy novelty tune that can also be considered very annoying dependingon your taste.  The final track HORIZONTAL is a pyschadelic retrospective tune that has some haunting piano and guitar work.<br />The Bee Gees 'Horizontal' was once again another success for the group.  It reached #12 on the charts in the US and had a near top ten hit with MASSACHUSETTS (peaking at #11 on the singles charts).  However it has always puzzled me why they never put the hit single WORDS on the album? (which was released around the same time as this record)<BR>Adding the b-sides SIR GEOFFEREY SAVED THE WORLD, SINKING SHIPS and BARKER OF THE UFO as bonus tracks wouldn't have hurt much either.  However all in all this is a pretty good album.  Highly recommended!
B0000636UN|1.0|When I bought this CD, I was a big fan of &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot;. But after listening to it twice, it got boring. All of the songs on this CD are way too sugary. Sheryl is trying to get her popularity back by trying to become Britney Spears.
B00004LN16|1.0|AC/DC seem to have made a career out of naming their albums after cliches.  Razor's Edge, Back In Black, Fly on the Wall.  Now we have Stiff Upper Lip and the music is just atrocious.  This is an example of a once great band that has outlived their usefullness.  Angus Young just doesn't look right in that school boy outfit now that he is in his fourties.  As for his riffs on this release, well, nothing you haven't heard on every other AC/DC release.  If there next release has the title of a tired cliche lets hope it's called &quot;Throw In The Towel&quot;.
0060955775|5.0|This is one of those books that appears as a harmless story in principle, but the wisdom and questioning of your life and your journey will make you not want to put this book down. The writing is inspiring as within the first few pages you are immediately drawn into this tale. The lessons for us all are endless in this treasure. Even if you feel you have all the answers (which none of us do) I suggest you read this and learn even more about yourself. This is the best of Paulo Coehlos work, of which I have read everyhing.
B000021YQV|5.0|OMG! I am in love with a CD. This is an amazing mix of ranting lyrics and outstanding musicality. Every song makes a point about our world and it's faults. The preaching voice of Tankian blocks out everything else. <BR>   After owning SOAD's first album which I listen to nonstop, I thought I should try out their new album Toxicity. I was completely blown away. This is the best music purchase I have ever made. What are you doing sitting here reading my review?? GO BUY THIS CD!!!
B0000524CY|5.0|Lets get one thing straight right now: I would be lying if I said that this movie scared me. I thought it was freaky in some parts, but not really scary. Still, this movie is one of my all-time favorites. The cast is amazing, with Ellen Burstyn providing some good dramatic moments. The &quot;Version-You've-Never-Seen&quot; DVD is a plus because it includes many scenes that never made it to the theatres. So if you're looking for a creepy Saturday-night movie, try &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.
0375707972|3.0|First off, I had to read this for a class.  So that should tell you that after years of cruising over this book, I never really wanted to read it.<br />Then after getting past a bit of the dryness (not dry humor, dry story) this book has a somewhat intriguing plot.  I found Michael and Hannah's initial relationship interesting.  It made me wonder where the story was going and what the psychological profile of Hannah was made up of.  But then the interest dropped off there.  The story jumps through Michael's life, briefly mentioning his marriage, child, then divorce.  The next time we see Hannah, she is on trial.  Yet again, we wonder about her, why she did what she did, why she is doing what she was doing in the trial.<br />And then the story ends in what seemingly is supposed to be a tragic ending.  But I couldn't care less.<br />This gets three stars because it was such a quick read.
B000002NBY|5.0|My Dad has this record on LP, and I loved it then. Last year I bought the CD (with the help of my Dad). The sound is just great, and the songs are even better than on the LP. I like &quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; best. By the way, I'm 16 years old, and I'm going to play it right now.
B00005T7I6|4.0|one of the best visually entertaining movies of all-time. warren beatty was nearly flawless as the title cop. pacino had his moments and the cartoonist gangsters jump straight out the sunday papers and on to your screen. kinda like casino for the kids. got a bad rap at time of release although reviews were positive to my knowledge.
055321263X|4.0|Wilkie Collins' 'The Woman in White' was a novel that I enjoyed thoroughly. The structure of the novel - the use of multiple narrations was something that I liked. The way the characters were built and the plot woven was terrific.<br /> But I thought that the novel was a bit too big. The author could have conveyed the story much better had he chosen to cut it short. One thought the story was a good 15-20% long when compared to the main plot. But this was not the 'much ado about nothing' kind of book.<br /> However one will find it tough to forget the characters of Laura Fairlie as well as the wily Count Fosco. Ah! the Count, what an excellent character!<br /> I bet you'll enjoy this one!
B000001GF9|2.0|Defiantly old fashioned, not always very well sung despite a good team of soloists, Bernstein's view of this unfinished masterwork veers from the insightful to the ordinary. It may be worth hearing once for the insights, but the rest - and that's a good 60% - will pall very quickly. Best avoided by all but Bernstien's most faithful fans.
0517548232|5.0|Probably the best economics book ever written for the non-economist, and that means most politicians and media people... who desperately need this type of knowledge
B00004T37H|5.0|This takes a runaway first on my list of best movies.  The animation is superb, the musical score the best I've heard since...ever, a storyline that captures your heart, and characters whose feelings you can feel sometimes.  If you like anime, you'll love it.  If you don't like anime, this movie WILL change your thoughts about it.  My dad hated all anime until I made him watch this, now we watch it together all the time.  A must-see for everyone.
B00006HBUA|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was a box office hit.  I enjoyed all the actors.  I actually watch Buffy, the vampire slayer and at the end of the movie Daphne(Sarah) made a comment that would have been a classic Buffy line.  I am looking forward to Scooby-Doo 2 and I am planning on buying this DVD.
B00005YW4H|5.0|nice. cosy. husky voice. i don't have an elevator in my aprtment but i can ramp up the volume when i walk the spiral staircase to the wine rack or library.
0316666343|4.0|Never read anything quite like this -- it is definitely an original.  Very poignant, disturbing, yet hopeful in the passages about heaven -- great beauty here.  Makes one appreciate life while we are living it (not an easy task).  Very unique.
B00005JKL8|2.0|In these times, when the world is concerned with terrorism, it seems logical to create a movie based on an American hero who beats the odds and defeats the enemy. But that's when the logic ends.  The first twenty minutes are interesting - the introduction of all the characters, including the rebels, played by Owen Wilson and Gabriel Macht. On a mission, these two fly beyond the allowed flight space, discover military activity and are shot down. After that, the intrigue ends, and the suspenseful monotonous chase begins as Wilson flees from the Serb army in order to rendez-vous with his squadron. This story seems almost plausible, except for the too frequent narrow escapes, and the numerous lapses in judgment on the part of Wilson's character. For example - surviving running through a mine field, not being shot by an entire army, hiding under dead bodies, and my personal favorite - while wearing black, Wilson stops for a break on a white concrete slope, fully aware of the army chasing him. In fact, about half hour into the movie, I found myself rooting for the sniper - in the sheer hope that he would kill Wilson and the movie would end.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I have loved this UFO Live album, Strangers in the night, since the late 70s. It is fantastic from cover to cover. Great playing and Great rock n roll singing, I will never tire of it. Doctor Doctor, Love to Love, Rock Bottom, Too Hot To Handle, Shoot Shoot, and on and on; every song is great, it just rocks. Get this CD, you will not be sorry.
B000066NW0|5.0|this cd had easily become my favourite! every song has really good lyrics and a really strong beat. avril lavigne has an amazing voice. my favourite songs are sk8er boi, i'm with you, unwanted, my world, too much to ask and naked. having said this i love every track on the cd - i can put it on at the beginning and listen to it all the way through, which i dont always do. buy it &amp; you wont be disappointed.
B000050X31|5.0|Existen momentos mgicos en la vida. El poder ver este DVD es uno de ellos. Realmente, la actuacin de todos y cada uno de los cantantes es asombrosamente adulta, creble, astuta y dulce a un mismo tiempo. Sin dudarlo, me llevara este DVD a una isla desierta.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Don't listen to Rolling Stone, this album cannot be beat because Queens of the Stone Age are simply the best out there. Musically,lyrically, they are masters of the genre and are undoubtly the best rock band out there making music today.  In a sea of uninspired bands who give a good case for the death of rock, Queens of The Stone Age give me something to look foward to.  There is not ONE bad song on this album not a one. Trust Me
6304362498|5.0|Being one of the late Richard Burton's last fims, I was surprised this has yet to be released on DVD.. Even MORE surprised the VHS tape is out-of-print! This is an essential movie, certainly a counterpiece to Terry Gilliam's &quot;Brazil&quot;, which was also released in 1985, and is drawn from the same mold as &quot;1984&quot;- as a Criterion Collection volume on three DVD discs, no less...<br />Also, if this does get to DVD (PLEASEPLEASEDOUBLEPLUSPLEASE!), one treatment it must have, in my opinion, is that it MUST have _BOTH_ scores- Both the original orchestral score the movie was released with, and the Eurythmics' score (which the CD for has been finally reissued- Probably the Eurythmics' best album ever, and essential 1980s album, again, in my opnion), which the orchestral score replaced. One of the beauties of DVD is multiple audio tracks, and a DVD issue of &quot;1984&quot; would certainly benefit the full restoration- Perhaps with as many as 4, maybe 5 audio tracks: movie with orchestral score; movie with Eurythmics score, orchestral score only; Eurythmics score only, and audio commentary.<br />It is doubleplustime for &quot;1984&quot;.<br />(Note: I have only seen portions of this movie- I've never had an opportunity to see this ever since it came out lo those many years ago, although I _do_ have the Eurythmics CD (I never did find the orchestral score on CD- odd), but what I _have_ seen, and know about this movie, I think this movie is very much an essential movie, and deserves reissue- Especisally in this day and age- 2002- it's more relevant than ever.)
B00005UWBP|5.0|Jurassic park is still number one on my list of favorite movies, and I'm really upset by the hurtful quotes on how it lacks plot and has horrendous acting, and blah blah, it is a beautiful movie, and my favorite. The Lost World is a good follow up, however is pittiful compared to the first, and the third is just plain bad. But uou have to look at this movie and realize how beautiful it is. The acting is superb, the filmaking is superb, and just everything is superb. It's also full of moral which many don't catch on. Yes it doesn't have as much data in it as the book, but what can you expect?<br />Jurassic Park is a great movie, i'd give a hundred stars if i could, and I wish some more people would look past a few flaws and realize what this masterpiece is.
B000006TRV|5.0|ok, let's get down to the basic point of this - this is a really great album.  it is not my absolute favorite floyd album but is a pretty [darn] good one.  here's a partial line up -<br />in the flesh - great opener, sets the mood for the piece<br />the thin ice - starts out very mellow but continues into a hard rocker<br />another brick in the wall (pt. 1) - a great laid back song, good opener for pt. 2 which is 2 tracks away<br />the happiest days of our lives - sets the mood for another brick in the wall pt. 2 and displays the feelings of \\"pink\\" about his childhood school days<br />another brick in the wall (pt. 2) - everybody has heard this song, regardless if they are a floyd fan or not.  its a great song though, really good single.<br />mother - a great acoustic song which displays roger waters' great song writing ability - very simple but very good<br />goodbye blue skies - a song about world war 2; beautiful but a bit depressing<br />empty spaces - good song; very deep & dark thoughts by roger waters<br />young lust - song about being a rock star & the rock star life<br />one of my turns - mellow keyboard song which turns into a high adrenaline rock theme (about \\"pink\\" crashing a hotel room to pieces and scaring a groupie out of her mind)<br />don't leave me now - very depressing and dark song about pink's loneliness and depression, particulary about his wife leaving him<br />another brick in the wall (pt. 3) - a high adrenaline (but very short) rendition of another brick in the wall <br />goodbye cruel world - a very straightforward and depressing song about pink's further descent into madness<br />disc 2: <br />hey you - very good song; great opener for disc 2; very much about loneliness <br />is there anybody out there? - another depressing song about pink's building of \\"the wall\\" and his alienation; the title is the only set of words in the song<br />nobody home - very sad piano-based piece; but a great song, even roger waters himself said that<br />vera- another very sad song following \\"nobody home\\" - very orchestrated song<br />bring the boys back home - an orchestrated band song; very self explanatory about bringing home the british soldiers of war<br />comfortably numb - originally a david gilmour song, with the help of roger waters' writing as well; awesome rocker song; really brings the tempo up on the 2nd disc a lot<br />the show must go on - very short but good acoustic song; like \\"hey you\\" it is not on the movie <br />in the flesh? - another version of in the flesh?; little bit longer, as it has different words<br />run like hell - song like \\"in the flesh\\" about pink's uprising of a fascist nazi-like army<br />waiting for the worms - a good song, once again following the fascist portion of the story (if youre in a band, i recommend not singing the words to this live as a cover, being as how it is extremely racist and may result in an [rear] beating)<br />stop - a very slow, short and simple song after the downfall of pink's \\"hammer\\" army<br />the trial - a very humorous song \\"showing feelings of an impecable human nature\\" as the schoolmaster puts it

B000002AHC|4.0|Ross Perot once commented that Dana Carvey's impression of him made him want to hire the then-SNL comic to campaign in half of the country while he did the other half. I wonder if Dylan ever had that same impression of the Byrds--as his other touring band? The Byrds got four albums worth of mileage out of that magic formula of Dylan and Dylan-like songs with the underlying arpeggios of Roger McGuinn's twelve-string guitar. You had to stop and remind yourself that he didn't invent that instrument. It was enough of a formula to make the Byrds elder-sibling role models to Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers. Then along came the Fab Four's \\"Sergeant Pepper\\", and everybody had do do one of those. The only ones to really make a go of that schtick were bands who had the smarts to make sure that they kept their own styles dominant rather than do a cookie cutter number on Old Sarge. The closest the Byrds come to that is the fanfare trumpets in the opener \\"Artificial Energy\\". Otherwise, this album is a mixture of an adventure into other styles and a foretaste of their return to their true roots as the unwitting fathers of Southern Rock. \\"Get To You\\" and \\"Tribal Gathering\\" were the first use of Brubeck's famous 5/4 time signature by a rock band that I'm aware of, and they both appeared on the original 11-song LP. \\"Gathering\\" actually has the jazz-waltz feel. The album's original finale \\"Space Oddysey\\" is a rendition of Arthur Clarke's short story \\"The Sentinel\\" which had just been expanded into the novel \\"2001\\". \\"Wasn't Born To Follow\\", \\"Draft Morning\\" and \\"Natural Harmony\\" could all have been leftovers from the previous \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" album--maybe they were. But in that same spirit, \\"Old John Robertson\\" and the refrain section of \\"Change Is Now\\" were previews of the next album \\"Sweetheart Of the Rodeo\\". I agree with one reviewer's comment that David Cosby's \\"Triad\\" should have been on the original release--instead, he did a remake of it with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash for an album also known for its greatness--the first CSN release. Crosby's departure during the making of this album might have been a blow to those of us who loved the first four albums, but in his leaving, he left McGuinn free to work in his natural element of Southern Rock. Only to have The Dead and The Allmans cop all the credit only a few years later. Bummerfor an album also known for its greatness--the first CSN release.

0345349571|5.0|Barbara Tuchman brings the Middle Ages to life in this fascinating and thorough depiction of the Middle Ages, during the Hundred Years War.  The focus is on France, but it widely covers the background of that time; from the Black Death to the emerging \\"third estate\\" of merchants; from the contradictions of knightly \\"chivalry\\" to the daily living conditions of the common man.   Tuchman illustrates many themes; the dominance of the Church, the great disillusionment in the wake of plague, war and banditry, and the whole mentality of the different classes.  The nobility of the lords and knights is questioned, as brigands roamed France, sacking, pillaging, robbing and extorting.  The treatment of children, women, Jews and heretics is described in detail, and it's not always a pleasant picture.  At the same time, it was a time of change, of mankind becoming more aware, trade and commerce emerging from the darkness of previous centuries, and the seeds of nation-states and standing armies springing forth in the \\"calamitous 14th century\\".<br />Tuchman entertains simply by her great knowledge of the subject as well as her fine writing.  History comes alive and we realize that we truly are looking into a \\"distant mirror\\"; this is the way we were so long ago.  Tuchman is also very thorough and comprehensive in this book, so this might not be for everyone; some might prefer a more condensed version.  Still I heartily endorse this slice of history, it is well written and compelling.
0440211727|4.0|Although appearing slightly ammateurish at times, with undeveloped charactors playing central roles, and the hero being portrayed as an uneducated murderer, this is an excellent read and great tale that i reccomend to all.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This album will easily be the album of the year.  It is an eclectic mix of songs that builds on the hard Sabbathesque rock of Kyuss and the melodic sounds of earlier QOTSA albums.  With contributions from Mark Lanegan, Dave Grohl, members of Eleven, Ween, and Perfect Circle, the album proves to be one of the best rock albums to date.  Josh Homme and Nick Olivieri have once again produced an album that will blow your mind right out of your [body].
B00006EXCC|4.0|This is the original April 15, 1966 UK release, which is different from the mess the record execs made of the later July 2, 1966 American release (which has been perpetuated by the CD releases using the American track list).

I haven't been this excited about an album since R.E.M.'s Reveal and am going out now to buy Parachutes.

B00006FXB6|5.0|Once again, QOTSA come thru with another record which proves that rock can still be original and that nu-metal just doesn't get it. From the opening track til the end, the band have produced another set of catchy songs that'll continue to play thru your head even when you're not listening to the cd itself. Hard, melodic, (with some songs combining the two) and all tied together in a sarcastic radio format, this is definitely a disk I'll be recommending to anyone willing to listen. And with the bonus dvd and low price, you really can't go wrong. Deaf or not, these songs deserve to be heard! Thanx for a great record, guys.
0316666343|5.0|This book is truely amazing.  I could not put it down!!  I just finished it and can't get over how wonderful a story it was.  Alice Sebold has written a book that will surely become a classic.
0316666343|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I tend to be a bit picky. All the characters are well written and the story is very original.  I couldn't put it down.
B00000JZIK|5.0|go into this film with absolutely NO knowledge of the plot, and if you must know some of the plot, only know the smallest portion of plot details. Knowing there is a surprise ending will take away from the rest of the film as you try to study the characters and plot lines. Here is all you need to know: five crooks team up to pull off a heist. The rest should be left for your mind to filter as you watch this film. You will not be let down. ENJOY!
B00005JKWI|4.0|This is much superior that the original cult film. Wesley Snipes reprises his role once again as the half breed (half human, half immortal) bounty hunter, and this time he is about to join forces with his all-time sworn enemies (the vampires), to take on a perpetual new breed of vampires known as The Reapers. A truly dazzling experience in its superb imagery, premise and action sequence. In fact better than QUEEN OF THE DAMNED. One of the year's best!!!!!
B000002A3T|5.0|It's good to know there are some more non-dogmatic Floyd fans out there. I am so tired of the usual ohh-Floyd-is-nothing-after-Barret(or Waters)-crap. There is a Pink Floyd after Gilmour, and it makes some pretty good music! <br />Truth is, I was born after The Final Cut was released. The only Floyd album I could buy when it was actually released is this one. In fact, it was through DB that I was introduced to Pink Floyd. I cannot even visualize Syd Barrett's face. I think he could very well be my grandfather. <br />Conclusion: Pink Floyd fans keep on coming, even after Barrett and Waters. That must mean something. <br />I love The Wall. DSOTM is God's own version of music . Echoes in Meddle is like getting high without the joint. But Cluster One in DB is incredibly good...and IT IS Pink Floyd.
B000002H97|4.0|After being overly familar with much of metallicas new and older meterial on the radio and such I went ahead and bought the black album, metallica's self titled 5th album. One thing that sorta baffles me is why so many people bash this album, and labeling it a \\"sell-out\\" album, that whole concept within itself it total BS. Metallica contrary to popular belife had lots of musical integrity before and after the making of this album. I mean how could of metallica boldly predicted this album would sell what, 17 million copys? No, metallica have pretty much left there thrashy style formula with this album, but that in no way should demean any value this album has. Metallica are no longer the rage fronted late teens they were back in 1983. So lets just start with this album shall we? Well first and foremost you can actully hear jason newsteds bass playing on this one where as it was vertuly no where to be heard on and justice for all. You first get into the first half of the album with tunes such as enter sandman, metallicas most famous song next to that of \\"one\\".Sad but true, the unforgiven, where ever I may roam etc. The second half pretty much follows the same formula with tunes such as nothing else matters, the god that failed, my freind of musery. Inconclution, if you want to good hard rock album, then go buy the black album, or a fan of rock in genral the choice is yours.
B000069AUI|5.0|In a year filled with middle-of-the-road-pop-rock-[weak stuff] comes an album from a band with guts enough to make a record that genuinely came straight from the heart and not their designer wallet. Here, you can find 4 young men who truly care about the world, relationships and life. Listen to songs like \\"The Scientist\\" \\"Clocks\\" \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" \\"In My Place\\" and you truly believe this is a band who wants the world to sit-up and listen and hold hands. Chris Martins lyrics isn't exactly poetry, but where it lacks in rhyme it makes up for in honesty. Like their debut album \\"Parachutes\\" Rush Of Blood is filled with luscious melodies and great vocals. Not since U2 have i believed that a band was making music to for themselves and their audience rather than the some silly Top 100 chart
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album is one of those music industry rarities: every track could be released as a single. Steps did it with 'Buzz' in 2000, Dido did it with 'No Angel' in 2001 and now Avril's done it this year with 'Let Go'. The self confessed skate punk (the best looking skate punk I've ever seen, btw) wrote all of these herself and every track is just brilliant. Standout tracks include 'Losing Grip', 'Complicated', 'Sk8er Boi', 'Mobile' and 'Anything But Ordinary'. She's like a teenage Alanis Morrissette - and I just hope she gets a big release over here in the UK.
B00005JKNF|5.0|The first time I saw Gosford Park, I must admit I was disappointed.  I love old period dramas for the costumes, the sets, the dialogue.  I was not disappointed with the setting of the film, an opulent English country house, but rather with what on first blush seemed to me to be a lack of cohesive plot. Not to be impatient with this film, because the plot comes together at the very end of the story, like all good who-done-its do.  And not to be impatient with the rest of it, either. Appreciate the character development, the perfect casting, the tension created in weaving the sub-plots together, the 1930's style soundtrack. Once I let the film jell and gave the true complexity of it a chance to make sense, it seemed only right to watch it again.  Again, and again.  Better with each watching, noticing nuances missed before.  Don't sell this film short, because it has much more than first meets the eye, and it is worth sticking around a few times to savor the Altman magic.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I've been a Britney fan since her debut song but have to say that some of her recent singles haven't quite hit the spot for me. 'Slave 4 U' had a good video and a catchy chorus but was well below par for the 20 year old, whereas 'Boys' didn't even have those. I thought 'Overprotected' was good, though, and thankfully this CD is filled with songs like this. 'Lonely' is one of my faves, as catchy as some of her first efforts, whilst 'Anticipating' is also memorable if a little risque. My personal favourite track, though - and surely a single release in the future - is \\"Cinderella\\". Bring on album four!
B00005JKWJ|5.0|The original film had excellent fight scenes, as well as special effects.  The sequel had much longer, and much better hand-to-hand fight scenes.

I loved it from the first chapter and then it just got better and better. Also, reading it several years after the movie came out I feel that I understand more of this book for each time I read it.

Now for those of us who aren't uptight about our music, and just wanna rock, laugh, party, dance, bang our heads, and shove our fists in the air, this CD is a MUST-HAVE!<br />It would not be accurate to call Andrew W.K. a singer. He screams his lyrics, and that's okay because he makes those vocal chords bleed for you. Starting with the first crunching guitar chords of &quot;It's Time To Party,&quot; you know that this album is nothing cerebral, but that's also okay! The point isn't to solve the world's problems. The point is to have a blast. Andrew doesn't sing about politics, race, or religion. He sings about partying, girls, partying, girls, machismo, New York City, partying, and girls.<br />Simple enough for ya? Good. Let's move on.<br />The songs are infectious anthems meant to get your blood boiling, your adrenaline pumping, and your body thrashing around. Andrew's 3-minute masterpieces are rock's perfect answer to the &quot;Oh, Woe Is Me&quot; rock of the last decade. It's background music for having a great time, and Andrew W.K.'s album delivers it unapologetically.<br />Do you wanna have a great time? Buy this CD.<br />Do you wanna smile? Buy this CD.<br />Do you wanna brood about how awful your life is? Buy this CD and feel better about yourself.<br />Are there better albums? Of course. Are there smarter albums? Probably, but if this album doesn't get you moving, check that pulse of yours.<br />You may not be dead but you're definitely BORING.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is definatly the best out of my collection. I love the rock/rap genre and Linkin Park come up with sum very original and catchy tracks that u never get bored of! They prove that not only can they write amazing rock but also sum genius melody lines (for example In the End). Some of their songs, such as Crawling are overrated but still brilliant. However, there r sum amazing songs on this album that r even better which u wont hear unless u buy the album! Id definatly give this 10 outa 10. U never get bored of this!
B00003CX5P|5.0|The DVD itself has plenty of things packed into it.  The movie; I thought it was a very good movie.  I did initially watch it a couple times at the theater with my family.  It took a couple viewings to begin to understand what Jar Jar was saying.  Overall though, I think The Phantom Menace is a very good movie, especially with the light sabre battle between Obi Wan, Qui Gon and Darth Maul.  Believable and stunning.
B000056NX4|1.0|Acting: Mostly overwrought, except for Jesus, who just stands around looking worried, breathing hard when he wants to indicate emotions. The actor/singers portraying Pilate and Herod do much better jobs than their material deserves.<br />Singing: Mediocre. Jesus has a wimpy voice that disappears in the mix on all his dramatically important high notes, Judas can't hit his high notes at all. Peter has a voice but rarely gets to use it. Again, Pilate and Herod are the standouts.<br />Direction: Clueless. Actors are given no stage business and do not relate to their surroundings. The song order of the last part of the movie is rearranged so that it makes no sense at all. Everyone is encouraged to make histrionic faces instead of acting.<br />Score: Lame. Has neither the energy of rock music nor the subtlety of opera. Maybe some day someone will make it work.<br />Cinematography: It's fine; the camera is probably used as well as it can be on a limited set that looks like a limited set.<br />Costumes: Laughable.  The director talks, in the additional material, about how important it was for this production to look contemporary. Apparently, this means gay bars, circa 1983.<br />In all, a mediocre waste of time. If you're a Lloyd Webber fan, you'll love it.
6305127638|5.0|First Contact is absolutely great! It involves the Borg making another run for earth. Starfleet feels that Captain Picard would not be helpful in the situation and orders the new Enterprise-E to patrol the Romulan Neutral Zone. Picard is hearing the Borg and knows what they're planning. He disobeys orders and heads straight for the battle. When they arrive, the battle is afoot; the USS Defiant from Deep Space Nine commanded by Lt. Commander Worf is fighting valiantly and losing. Captain Picard determines the proper strategy to destroy the cube and coordinates it perfectly. Just before the cube is destroyed, the Borg launch a smaller vessel and it heads straight for earth, opening a time portal the past. Captain Picard orders the Enterprise in. What follows is clearly one of the best Star Trek films to date. We see cameo's from Robert Picardo as the EMH, Ethan Phillips (Neelix from Voyager and Barclay makes an appearance. Overall an extremely well written story and directed perfectly by none other Jonathan Frakes (Commander William T. Riker). In the best tradition of the Gene Roddenberry ethos and the other even numbered movies that can be watched over and over again. Nods to Alice Krige who does a very good villain in the Borg Queen. If you've not watched, buy it here at Amazon, rent it, borrow it, do whatever, it's great!
B000069AUI|5.0|An absolutely phenomenal album!  I bought Parachutes a while ago and while I enjoyed the album it seemed to be missing...something.  Whatever that &quot;something&quot; was, there's no lack of it on their sophomore effort.  It's almost ironic that the band went into the studio not knowing if they had another album in them, and came out with their best material to date.  A very mature sounding disc with an atmospheric tone and a great deal of energy for a fairly mellow band.  I've listened to &quot;Daylight&quot; about 5 times today and I'll probably listen to it 5 more times...my personal pick for the album's standout song.  Other favorites are &quot;The Scientist&quot;, &quot;Clocks&quot;, and &quot;A Whisper&quot; but you can listen to the entire album front to back and not find a weak or bad song.  A pleasent surprise from an album that will probably catapult Coldplay straight to the top of the UK music scene and win over North America.
B000068TPN|4.0|If you liked \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" you should like this movie. They are very similar in that they both tell the story of one battle. BHD re-creates the 1993 American siege of the Somalian warlord Aidid's stronghold city of Mogadishu, where a 45-minute mission turned into a 16-hour urban war. In BHD, two Black Hawk helicopters were downed by rocket-propelled grenades. There, the U.S. soldiers, unwilling to leave anyone behind, were attacked from all sides by armed by supporters of Somali warlord Aidid. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is the story of the United States first major battle with the North Vietnamese army. Similarly, WWS is little more than the story of one battle. It involves a contingent of 400 American soldiers from the American Air Cavelry on the bottom of a hill, who for several days fight off waves of several thousand NVA soldiers who were hidden atop the hill in an underground bunker complex. The film has only two parts which are not the battle. The first is in the beginning of the film, where we are introduced to Lt. Col Harold Moore and his family. We, the audience, are also informed Lt. Col. Moore is to implement new US tactics using helicopters as cavelry to ferry men and supplies in and out of battle. The other part, interspersed with battle scenes, has Lt. Moore's wife delivering telegrams to the wives of those soldiers killed in the battle. There is little more to this film.<br />On the positive side, the performances are very good. Mel Gibson makes the film worth seeing. He does an excellent job of making Moore interesting, portraying his religious beliefs, family values and ethical standards. The last are exemplified by his dedication to his troops by refusing to obey orders to leave the battle to debrief his superiors. The filmmakers do a very good job of making the viewer see the overwhelming odds facing the soldiers and their fear. <br />On the negative side, except for Gibson's portrayal of Lt. Col Harold Moore, none of the characters are given any depth. There is no sense of conflict between characters; the Vietnamese army charging down the hill is little more than an attacking horde of aliens in a computer game. A game of Space Invaders has almost as much plot. There is no sense that the American soldiers are there other than to see if they can survive wave after wave of faceless soldiers attempting to kill them. Perhaps this is the film's statement about America's purpose in Vietnam. I don't think so.
B000066NW0|3.0|I saw Complicated on TRL and the song was really catchy so I decided to give her a try. And here is what I thought of each song.... <br />1. Losing Grip ~ A really great song, nice lyrics 8/10<br />2. Complicated ~ I'm sure you've all heard of this song or you wouldnt be here but it is still one of my faves even though its starting to be overplayed 9.5/10<br />3. Sk8er Boi ~ Avril's latest hit! Really awesome sound to it, great lyrics 10/10<br />4. I'm With You ~ It's ok, but i'd say that it is a little bit weak. 6/10<br />5. Mobile ~ It starts out really great, nice beat to it. Catchy chorus but i think the lyrics could be better. 7.5/10<br />6. Unwanted ~ One of the best songs on the album!! 9.5/10<br />7. Tomorrow ~ Nice and sweet, but its seemingly weak 6/10<br />8. Anything But Ordinary ~ Great song 7.5/10<br />9. Things I'll Never Say ~ Really good but could be better!! 8/10<br />10. My World ~ AWESOME song, shows that Avril can sing variety 9/10<br />Nobody's Fool, Too Much to Ask, and Naked... I thought that they were good to listen to but could have been better. These are my opinions on the CD but you might think different on it.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Spielberg's dinosaur adventure Jurassic Park is up there with the all-time greats. Taken from Michael Crichton's thrilling novel, Jurassic Park is one of the most entertaining and exciting films ever made. The special effects are from FX maestro Stan Winston, who did the special effects for Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 (1991). The seamless combination of CGI and robotic creatures creates some truly terrifying action set- pieces.<br />Despite what some critics thought when the film was released, I feel that all the principal actors give good performances, especially Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm. But admittedly, the special effects are the main attraction, and Winston's dinosaurs (which won him another Oscar after Terminator 2) are truly frightening. Great entertainment.<br />The film's transfer onto DVD is first- rate, with superb picture and sound. The special features are exceptional, with a 50 minute 'making of' of the film and trailers for Jurassic Park, the Lost World and the teaser for Jurassic Park 3. Most interesting, however, is the footage of early pre-production meetings with Spielberg and the FX team discussing how certain shots and effects should be done. Also, there's a Phil Tippett animatic &quot;Raptors in the Kitchen&quot;, showing how claymation assists the director in visualising the shots and camera angles. Also there are storyboards, production photos and web links. A 5 star film, 5 star extras. Excellent entertainment.
B000067DNC|5.0|WARNING!  SPOILERS.<br />Season 2 has it all man!  With \\"The Serpent's Lair\\" we see the conclusion to the 4-part conclusion of Season One's last 3 episodes.  And it's a doosey, let me tell ya.  And if you recall, the cliffhanger introduced us to a quite unique Goa'uld weapon commonly known as Zat Gun.  The first shot incompacitates, the second kills, the third disentagrates.  Well, Season 2 sees extended use of this weapon and it becomes an exciting new special effect.<br />But anyway enough of the Zat gun talk.  Season 2 sees SG-1 come into its own.  Lots of good episodes in this ste and I haven't even watched half of them yet.  Lots of good Goa'uld episodes.  In the episode \\"Thor's Chariot\\" we once again see the Horus-type System Lord Goa'ulds.  We also find out that these are Apothisis' mortal enemies.  We are also first introduced to the Asgard named \\"Thor\\"  in an interactive hologram.<br />In Season 2 lots of loose ends are tied up from Season 1 as well as several new plot elements are revieled subtletly.  The existance of the 6th Season's Prometheus battleship program is revieled in the Season opener.<br />In the episode \\"Secrets\\" we find out what happened to Sha're, Daniel's wife from Abydos.  This discovery results in another confrontation with the Horus group System Lords.<br />We also discover the Tok'ra in this Season.  The Tok'ra are a group of Jaffa who are in rebellion from the evil System Lords and the Serpent Gods.  We see the Tok'ra in many up-coming episodes in later seasons.<br />So all in all, Season 2 has become known as one of the best seasons of the series and I can see why.  There really isn't one bad episode in the bunch and we see a lot of new plot arcs starting and other getting moved along from earlier.  The humor is still there and so is the episode ending \\"oh boys\\" (as in they've just let a bad guy get away) as the credits roll.  So if you like SG-1 in anyway, or are wondering just how good this series is, pick up Season 2 and if you hadn't already Season 1 as well.  Season 2 will show you just how good the writing is on this show.  I rate SG-1 right up there with Babylon 5 with story telling.adn't already Season 1 as well.

1573225517|3.0|Though it failed to live up to it's reputation of being hilarious, it was still good enough of a book to trigger me to buy Hornbys other work (I recomend \\"How To Be Good\\").  I frequently found myself angered by the main character, or just depressed for him.  Perhaps his self-hatred and over-philosophising (sorry, I'm sure I spelled that wrong) is intended to be funny, but I'm not one to laugh at someone's pain (unless it's someone getting hit in the groin.  Love that gag!).  So, I'm actually not sure why I liked this book as much as I did, but I'm not afraid of the unexplained.
0694016756|5.0|If I could, every new family would get this book to go home w/ them for their baby's library - and it whatever language they wished.  No matter what translation, the theme of the book is a wonderfully soothing way to end the day.  Snuggle up to your little one, lower the lights and enjoy.  Don't forget to play \\"where's the mouse?\\" on each of the color illustrated pages.  This builds recognition, spacial and cognative skills in early readers!  It's never to young to start reading to your children and you can never read to them too much!
B000069HKH|3.0|I was looking for just the right words to describe the sound of this cd, and one of the other reviewers here nailed it... it sounds like Mellancamp. At least some of it. Too much to ignore.<BR>And &quot;Nothing Man&quot; sounds too much like &quot;Streets of Philadelphia.&quot; That was a little disconcerting.<BR>Not one of Bruce's best efforts, but it's hard to hate.  I know that's not helpful. Let's just say this, ignore the hype. It's not all that.

0792844890|4.0|I used to really like this type of movie. Spoof movies were better over a decade ago. Does anyone out there think Leslie Nielsen is anywhere near as funny as he used to be? \\"Spaceballs\\" by Mel Brooks, years and years after it's original release, remains as good as ever.<br />When princess Vespa flees from her supposed wedding to the boring prince Valium she attracts the attention of the evil forces of Planet Spaceballs, led by the mysterious and hilarious Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis).<BR>In order to save her from Helmet's clutches princess Vespa's father calls for a rescue party; the anything-but-a-hero Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) and his half man-half dog partner Barf (John Candy).<BR>Quickly they find themselves in the middle of an interstellar conflict and the fate of Vespa's home-planet Druidia lies in the balance.<br />With more memorable moments of comedy than most movies of it's kind and countless hilarious references to movies like \\"Alien\\", \\"Planet of the Apes\\" and ofcourse \\"Star Wars\\" this movie will leave you laughing for years.

B00005Y228|5.0|This CD is amazing, Kylie Minogue may not have a huge voice, but the songs are original and great!  ALthough the songs with hints of trance aren't that great (Fragile), there is nothing horrible on this CD.  Here's an overview of the CD:<br />More More More- This is a catchy 80s like dance song.  I can just imagine this being played in a dance club!  This is one of the really good songs on this CD.<br />Love At First Sight-This is a disco-y dance song.  It's one of the best on the CD and Kylie Minogue co-wrote it.<br />Can't Get You Out Of My Head-This song is another cool song with a great beat.<br />Fever-A very original sounding song.  It's just awesome.<br />Give It To Me-A definite pop song,  Kylie Minogue co-wrote this song too.  This song gets stuck in my head all the time.<br />Fragile-This song has a hint of trance in it.  This song isn't the best song on the CD, but it's not unbearable.<br />Come Into My World-An okay song.<br />In Your Eyes-This song is very catchy, it could be her next single.  Kylie Minogue co-wrote this song.<br />Dancefloor-A very fun song, it may not be single material but the song is great. <br />Love Affair-Another song Co-Written by Kylie Minogue.  This song doesn't exactly stand out, but it still has the same great dance beat that the other songs have.<br />Your Love-This song is easy to forget but when you are actually listening to the song you can't help but dance.  Co written by Kylie Minogue.<br />Burning Up-This song is quite a surprise, it's a chilled out awesome dance song even though it's a bit repetitive.  Really hard not to like this one.<br />Go ahead and buy this CD, it's a wonderful pop/dance CD.  Kylie Minogue is a wonderful addition to the US pop scene.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|Amazing record by Ron Howard - has managed to ruin every movie he's directed so far. Way to go! Can take a great, cool story, and load it with triteness and cliche-ridden cinematics, pacing, and story.<br />I was quite excited to see this movie when I bought it - I knew it was about a famous mathematician, that it had won awards (or been nominated, anyway), and I like movies and plays about math and science. And lest you think I didn't like this because it was ron howard, I didn't know it was Ron Howard when I watched it.  After watching this and feeling that I had been taken for a ride, with every emotional response I'm supposed to have being telecasted to me through script and music (like a Spielberg movie but without the artistry), and being taken so far from reality, I and my friend who watched it together felt abused and misled.<br />\\"Who directed this thing?\\" I asked. \\"Ah - Ron Howard. That explains why this movie, which has a great and compelling human story underlying it and could have really been a greaet movie that people would watch over time, sucks.\\"<br />Though I give it two stars, let me give 5 stars to the cast - incredible acting, especially from Russel Crowe. Ed Harris great as always. Rest of the cast, brilliant. This movie has some tremendous acting. It's just too bad that Mr. Howard felt the need to manipulate us, tell us what to feel and think, and tug at the emotional heartstrings intentionally, instead of letting the story itself do that for us.<br />The story of a person's life, told truthfully and accurately, without manipulation, is *far* more compelling than any fictional story we could think to invent, and certainly far more interesting than taking a person's story and adding in some fictional components to make it \\"sell\\" to the movie public. Sorry, but the movie public just ends up feeling abused. Nash's story could be told on grainy black and white film, with the same cast, but with no special effects, and audience would be riveted, because Nash's story *itself* is riveting.<br />Please stop adding fiction to real-life stories; please stop manipulating the viewers, Mr. Howard.<br />On the DVD itself: 3 or 4 stars for the DVD. Lots and lots of extras, but not of much interest. The transfer of the movie onto the DVD was done *beautifully*. This is an excellent transfer.<br />This is one for renting, not owning.cause Nash's story *itself* is riveting.<br />Please stop adding fiction to real-life stories; please stop manipulating the viewers, Mr. Howard.<br />On the DVD itself: 3 or 4 stars for the DVD.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|Love him or hate him, David Lynch always manages to surprise.  With \\"The Straight Story,\\" a G-rated family film released by Disney (surprised yet?), he gives audiences a reason to sit and ponder reality - to look up at the stars and imagine, and to look at friends and family with love.<br />Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth, in his last movie role), a mostly-disabled farmer living with his slow-but-gentle daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek), learns that his health may be declining after both his hips give out.  His doctor tells him that unless he quits smoking and begins to eat well, he will have more serious health problems.  Then, Alvin gets a phone call from his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke.  Alvin and Lyle have not spoken in years, and Alvin decides to go visit.  With bad eyesight and a daughter who cannot drive, Alvin sets off across Iowa to Wisconsin on a riding lawnmower, trailer in tow.<br />Along the way, he meets a variety of people who help him out, and talk with him about his trip and why he's going.  As he meets different people, more of Alvin and Lyle's background is revealed, and the good nature of the main character becomes apparent.  Lynch is a master filmmaker, and in his hands this script becomes magic.  It moves along at a lawn-mower pace (pardon the pun), preferring to focus on character and dialogue than action, weaving an amazingly-accurate portrayal of middle-low-class Midwestern life.  Lynch is known for his attention to detail, and he does not disappoint: most, if not all, of the film was shot on-location and in real buildings (as opposed to soundstages), and he bucked convention and cast real-life people in real-life roles.  These aren't liposuctioned models or Hollywood pretty-boys; women have cottage cheese on their legs, men have scars and stubble, clothes are dirty, hair is greasy, and houses are dirty - in other words, it's got a sense of verisimilitude rare in any film.<br />\\"The Straight Story\\" is, in many ways, an anti-\\"Blue Velvet\\" or an anti-Tragedy (in the true meaning of that word).  Like \\"BV,\\" it offers an unflinching view of middle-class life, but instead of the constructed, artificial town of Lumberton, \\"The Straight Story\\" offers something more like a documentary look at people.  Although no one in the film moralizes, and Lynch certainly doesn't use his camera to preach, what \\"The Straight Story\\" manages is to paint a view that, at their hearts, people are basically good.  While bad people, car chases, explosions, and Evil Warlords might make a good movie (or a profitable newscast, depending on your level of cynicism), it's refreshing to see a master present a project that reminds us that, at our core, we are all good people, and it's really not that difficult to be good to each other.<br />As for the DVD, I think it goes without saying that watching Lynch's films in anything but widescreen is a crime, so it's good they gave us a solid, anamorphic transfer.  He doesn't like extras, so everything is bare-bones, but considering the quality of the motion picture, the price can be forgiven.<br />Final Grade: AVelvet\\" or an anti-Tragedy (in the true meaning of that word).

B000002U88|5.0|Bob commented in 1982 that The Distance would give him some new rock and roll tunes to perform in concert.He apparently realized that he'd gotten a bit formulaic.  Critics jumped all over &quot;Shame On The Moon&quot; as the first single, but it was one of his biggest Top 10 hits. The album is probably Seger's best since becoming a major artist. 'Roll Me Away' is one of his best, and this song as well as the whole record benefit from Jimmy Iovine's production. If you want a set that gives a snapshot of the Rust Belt in the early Reagan years, buy this.

B0000640VO|1.0|Since there is no \\"goodness\\" except into people's minds, the whole idea of the movie tuns into pieces. A predominance of female supporters can easily be explained in the archetype of womanhood Amelie portrays. This is the ONLY plus in the movie. Accordingly, the average woman is utterly irrational and in order to avert responsibility of hers own acts, she typically sees herself as victim. To strengthen this self-indulgent image, she seeks company of other \\"victims\\" and frequently involves into \\"humanitarian\\" acts. The difference between Amelie and factual reality consists in HOW MUCH the victim-character is working to convey its true nature. Amelie is CRUCIADING against normality. She thinks having the right of intruding people's lives, being backed with such insight truly shameful not being shared with the rest of us, the poor unenlightened. She might be broadly classified as a crossover between the preaching evangelical and infamous \\"civil rights activist\\". (It's probably unnecessary to remind you how much I hate these sorry shacks of humans.)<br />Outside of these considerations, Amelie is extremely long, absolutely boring, pleading for the beauty of ignorance devoid of responsibility, cheaply sentimental and FINALLY filled with recycled religion and postmodern rubbish.
0679735259|5.0|The main reason I read as many first hand accounts of Vietnam combat is to see if the author can describe it.<br />Michael Herr in his brilliant little book Dispatches gets it right.  Perhaps it takes an outsider to describe what a combatant feels. Herr was a reporter who went with the Marines  to Khe-Sanh.  <br />Herr describes the fear, the confusion, the gnawing gut feeling that this will be your last day alive and that you will die in the hot mud in a strange land far away from home.<br />I think it is fear that Herr describes so brilliantly. <br />Underneath his on the edge of your seat writing style,  is the debilitating, ever-present, under tow of fear of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, of fear that can trip you up and suck you out in the sea of  never ending incoming, of  losing your 20-20 vision for the one thousand yard stare.<br />This book gets it right..<br />A longer edition of this book appears in the excellent two volume history published by the Library Of America,  Reporting Vietnam.

0553106635|5.0|This series just keeps getting better & better with every installment....Martin I think has mastered the genre that Tolkien birthed, i.e. the fantasy series set in a Medieval techonological/societal period, and set in a world that has its own geography, history, wars, etc. etc. etc.. Martin's world, specifically the 7 Kingdoms, is the most highly developed (after Tolkien's middle earth--martin has yet to write out entire languages) one yet. Martin is also quite talented at using another Tolkien plot device: vacillating between several different characters and subplots, with out letting said subplots detract from the big picture. Dont want to give away the plot, but its definately worth the time youll need to invest in this 900-page behomoth.

630026999X|4.0|What's not to love?  5 Creepy tales told in the style of 50's Horror comic books such as \\"Tales From The Crypt.\\"  A family gathers to continue a bizarre father's day ritual-but there's a special visitor this year.  A man discovers a mysterious meteorite that crashed on his lawn.   A disgruntled husband plans a beach adventure for two young lovers...and more!<br />This film captures the spirit of the old 50's horror comics much better than any of the \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" movies could.  While some of the stories fall slightly flat (witness \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verril\\"-which is more depressing than funny) the stories are generally surprisingly effective.  \\"Something to Tide You Over\\" and \\"They're Creeping Up on You\\" are two of the best.  The atmosphere of \\"The Crate\\" is slightly diminished by the hideously fake looking creature (this would have been much more effective if they'd not shown the creature), but otherwise, the makeup effects are impressive, and they add to the creepiness of the film.  This film was very enjoyable, and is a must-see for King fans.<br />Did you Know: Stephen King and George Romero originally collaborated on this film in order to make enough money to help finance a film version of King's novel \\"The Stand.\\"
B000069HKH|5.0|The BOSS has truly been the voice for the humanity - a streetwise sociologist whose lyrics evince a strong moral conscience perhaps no other singer exemplifies. His songs are such that even a common man in remote parts of the world can relate himself to. This new album \\"The Rising\\" only reaffirms this. The pain we all went through after the 9/11 has been dealt with tenderly with a new hope to look for on the album. The lyrics on this album are more yearning, spiritual, and redemptive than ever. I became a fan of his after I heard \\"Born in the USA\\" but only after I tracked down to his earlier albums, I understood the sheer genius of the man. The title track of the \\"The Rising\\" is a classic rock number with a message to rise up from all those sky full of blackness, sorrow and sadness. \\"Into the fire\\" is an highly inspirational song dedicated to the 9/11 victims. The haunting ballad \\"Nothing man\\" understands the psyche of a man who came alive straight out from the jaws of death. \\"Empty Sky\\" looks at the aftermath of the 9/11. The soulful \\"You're missing\\" describes the haunting feeling of losing your dear ones. \\"Further on (up the road)\\" is a blasting rock number which will be a favorite in concert. The songs like \\"Lonesome day\\", \\"Waiting on a sunny day\\", \\"Counting on a miracle\\", \\"The fuse\\", \\"Mary's place\\" are typical Boss numbers but with a new feel. One song that needs special mention is \\"Worlds Apart\\" in which Bruce has experimented by running Sufi qawwali in the background. Bruce closes the album with two beautiful numbers - \\"Paradise\\" and \\"My city of ruins\\". The most important thing is that the almost all the songs on the album gel together so well to make it an album with a broad theme of hope and redemption - something which is very much missing in today's music.
B0000541VQ|5.0|The book is amazing and the movie is a decent interpretation of it.  The reason though that this movie gets 5 stars from me is because John Malkovich is INCREDIBLE.

6304712936|5.0|This is a great film. It has great art direction and costuming and cinematography and (obviously) music and direction and performances by the masterful, masterful, masterful F. Murray Abraham and even little Thomas Hulce. And it's powerful and revealing and even fun. <BR>But the play is better. The language is better. The characters and scenes are more perfectly designed and executed. Shaffer's rewrite for the screen is so... easy. It speaks a bit too much to the average man. The film's not AS powerful. (Go to my review of the play, in book form, to perhaps learn the real reason I think this.)<BR>But that has nothing to do with what the movie accomplishes. It simplifies and breathes life into the base story. The only flaws are that the story COULD have been shorter and still worked (in a lengthy film that generally means that it should have been) and Elizabeth Berridge is way too American-seeming for Constanze. So is Tom Hulce, but he is a superior actor and makes due with it. <BR>See this movie at least once. Read the play. See the play. (Come to MY production of the play if it happens! I'm too young for Salieri, so I'll be playing Wolfgang.) <BR>Peace.
B00005A46T|3.0|People = shit is the only song that ever gets any space in my playlists these days. its nice aggressive stuff. the rest of the album loses potency as it drags on . . unimpressive riffs, predictable vocals. slipknot was always good for \\"music to listen to when breaking [stuff]\\" and this cd still is, but don't expect any epiphanies while listening to iowa. the cd is still fun to listen too because of the drumming (wow . . . just . . well wow. nice drumming man) and some of the ideas that james and mick execute with the guitars. they might as well axe the two 'percussionists' and the two dj electronica fags and bring the bassist into the music a bit more and focus their sound if they plan to release another cd. this is a cd that falls dangerously near to the limp bizkit/papa roach side of the 'music with heavy guitars' bin.

B00005B36H|5.0|yes thats right sportsfans . . . tool is back. this is the quintessential tool album. excellent production, trademark 9+ minute long songs, unintelligably soft lyrics, killer bass and drums and some darn nice guitar. tool has cemented its position as \\"the band who make music for people who know they are better than everybody else\\" and as \\"the most damn wierd band who aren't faking it to sell more cds\\". if you are a tool fan you can hand out the most crushing criticisms on any other band's music, without having to worry about retaliatory criticism from that particular band's fanbase. Why? because tool's music is flawless. there is nothing bad or negative about it. its not crusty bearded thrash (um, yes that is you carcass . . .), its not rap infested new metal (which is, coincidentally, only for tough guys), its not corny old rock and roll, its just tool dammit. its one of those bands that defy catergorization not because they mix many styles but because they are their own style. primus and koRn are other examples of this sort of self-inspired musical boundary breaking. to purchase this cd is to elavate you above the 'rest' and puts you musical taste beyond scrutiny. for your security, and that of your cd collection, purchase lateralus as soon as chance permits. to delay is to encourage the unwavering inevitable destiny that belies you. that you read this is fate whispering in your ear 'purchase purchase purchase' . . . just buy it ok?

Full of energy, and the performance was tight, even if their brand of rock doesn't seem to lend itself to such precision.  They were entirely backlit, which made them difficult to see and struck me as pretty pretentious, but that didn't detract from the music any.  I would definitely recommend to anyone that you go see this band.

This book draws you in completely, leaving you unaware of anything except Whistle Stop. While many things are perhaps idealised and and seemingly simple, the complicated plot and the deepness of the characters easily makes up for it. Although it does seem simple, many deeper issues are delt with. This is an amazing story of transformations and love. A book hasnt truely affected me in this way in a while. It is a must read book for anyone and everyone. Very enjoyable.

0525946284|2.0|This was a great idea for a book. However, I thought it would be about WWII and spies, but for the most part it was about homosexuality and promiscuity. It seemed that Mr. Follet cared more about sexual details than he did about telling a story about the SOE behind enemy lines in France. I also thought that Homosexuals were still a minority in todays world, let alone 1945. But 3 out of the 6 women in Mr. Follets book were gay. Great premise Mr. Follet, bad delivery. This is one reader who will not be coming back.

The basic plot of the movie is as follows: Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect a witness who happens to be testifying against the same group of drug dealers that the cops are currently after. Riggs decides to see if he can find them on Leo's information. Unfortunately, they turn out to be foreign diplomats who have immunity. (When the drug leader tells this to Riggs, you really just want to punch the screen, he is so slimy.) Riggs still tries to do whatever he can to bring them down. Some important subplots: Riggs falls in love, and discovers the truth about his wife's death.

It keeps itself fresh and fluid, with a healthy dose of quirk to it. But I don't think it knows it's an apocalyptic vision.<br />The film is about James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a man from the future who goes back in time to stop the disaster that sent him underground from ever happening. But that's the simple way of describing it. The story is in a constant fight as to where to go with the plot, with probably a dozen sub-ideas that could turn into something. It's twisted and elaborate and almost impossible to explain to someone without them saying &quot;what?&quot;, but like &quot;Memento&quot; or &quot;The Matrix&quot;, when you watch it, it makes sense. But these plot developements are delicious fodder and keep it moving, allowing characters like Brad Pitt's pitch perfect sort-of-insane &quot;Jeffrey Bowen&quot; to take a bow (deserved that Oscar nod, BTW). <br />The film's eccentricity takes hold of it. From the cinematography, to the accordian theme that playfully plays throughout the film, to the excessive production design that you know was made that way just because they felt like it (though it does help make the film what it is). And more often than not, the miserable conditions of Mr. Willis or whoever else may be feeling miserable at the time come across the screen in an almost tangible way.<br />But behind the running cinematic joke, and the dark atmosphere of the film, it drives itself home where it must, and Bruce Willis, surprisingly, performs in what is probably one of his best roles. There's a frusterating and pitiful scene when he is desperately trying to make psychiatrists in 1990 accept the fact thathe's from the future. They don't buy it, and he realizes that on top of his original task, he now has to find some tedious way to make these people believe him. Teamed with the talented Madeleine Stowe, the duo help create a touching relationship that grounds the film, as it turns out, on a deep personal level.<br />The film doesn't necessarily scare you into thinking all this would happen in real life, we've heard it too much before, and I don't think that was the goal of the movie. But by the end of the film you've been given a healthy sense of dread for the poor characters in the film. How often does that happen? Though when they play the Louis Armstrong classic &quot;Wonderful World&quot; during the credits, it stamps and seals the irony of it all, and does exactly what Mr. Armstrong probably didn't intend the song to do in the first place.
B000069AUI|5.0|If you adored Parachutes, Then you will grow obsesive with A Rush of Blood To The Head. With song soooo beautiful like In My Place and The Scientist to the noisy Whisper and Politik. All that I can tell you is that this Cd is a true master piece and it worth all the money you spend on it!!
B00004Z459|1.0|I love rap music, rock music and electronica; however this is a pathetic attempt at blending the three. The singing is weak, rapping embarrassingly bad and the musicianship incredibly average. only thing that saves this album is the production and even that can't hide lack of talent. I have heard people saying that linkin park are first 'manufactured' metal band; really wouldn't be surprising if that was true.  This is quite simply shallow pop music: if you want metal listen to bands like tool, pantera etc if you want rap listen to the Roots or Wu Tang or something if you want kinda ambient electronica that LP so desperately try to recreate, listen to Aphex Twin or Boards of Canada.  You'll then see how redundant this ... is. Avoid.
0385493622|4.0|I found this book to be fascinating. The best part about it, was it is about the history of math, more than about math itself. You don't need to understand any math at all to understand and enjoy this book. It starts out with a brief history of Fermat's equation, then goes back to the Pythagorean times. I learned more about Pythagoras reading this book, than I did in the 16 years of math I took in school! It was fascinating to hear about the times, and how math was viewed as a religion, the pythagoreans were persecuted, etc. It moves slowly up to modern times, explaining various steps to prove/disprove Fermat's last theorem. Finally, it tells the story of Andrew Wiles: his obsession, his discovery, his fall, and his ultimate triumph.<br />This was a great book. Don't let the subject matter fool you. It isn't dense at all; give it a try!
B00005JKHP|4.0|Here's a dirty little secret you'll learn from this DVD: The screenplay for _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ (or, as some wags called it, \\"Star Trek: The Motion Sickness\\") was an elongated version of the proposed pilot for a new \\"Star Trek\\" television series.  But the series didn't get off the ground, and we got this film instead.<br />Lucky us.  The result was a crashing, pretentious bore that still managed to please enough die-hard Trekkies to merit a sequel (the far superior _Wrath of Khan_) a series of films, and, eventually, a revitalized _Star Trek_ franchise.<br />The new \\"director's cut,\\" unlike the majority of \\"director's cuts\\" glutting the film market, is a vast improvement over the original theatrical release.  That's not to say this film is now a cinematic masterpiece, but at least it is watchable.  Occasionally -- dare I say it? -- it's even pretty good.<br />But the extras make this package interesting.  Audio and text commentaries, ancient relics from the 1979 ad campaign, new featurettes on the film's tortured production history and several deleted scenes make for a truly deluxe DVD package.  If you're a _Star Trek_ fan, this DVD is worth purchasing; if not, it's worth a rental, no more.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Instead of a &quot;high school&quot; setting the storyline mentality is in a &quot;college&quot; setting.  Definitely a girl flick to watch with the gal pals.  If you liked the movie &quot;Clueless&quot; with Alicia Silverstone, then you'll love Reese Witherspoon in &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;.  It's so like funner!  (I've watched it at least 8 times.)  It is just a cute and happy story to watch.
B00003CX9S|5.0|This is the most moving film I've ever seen. I am humbled by the greatness and the beauty this film posseses. It tells an amazing story about truly fascinating people. This film reveals what beauty really is and how ugly, vain and shallow common humanity is. This film is for a deep soul who is not afraid of their own emotions. I highly recommend this film to anyone. It can change the way you see things.
B000069I1H|5.0|Mitch Preston's (De Niro's) worse nightmares come true, when, after shooting out the lens of a news cameraman's video camera, he is forced to participate in television's latest `COPS' Style show, \\"Showtime,\\" or face a lawsuit. Partnered with Trey Sellars (Murphy), Mitch is less than thrilled.<br />Trey, however is ecstatic at the opportunity to show of his acting talents, and easily earns a huge fan following, much to Preston's irritation.<br />I really liked this film. It was funny, entertaining, and really showed both actors' range. Trey is believable as a two-bit actor and wannabe cop, and Preston is great as a burned-out, hard-luck police detective.<br />While the plot is far from believable, this movie made up for it in its sheer entertainment level! A must for Murphy fans, or fans of `buddy' cop dramas. Watch this. You won't be disappointed
B00005QAPH|5.0|Every shot in this film seems like it could be framed and put in an art gallery. Beautifully restored by Criterion, this film is Fellini's magnum opus. This two disc set is the BEST version and the only way to see and understand this brilliant film. Filmmakers such as Woody Allen and Terry Gilliam adore this film and consider it to be one of the greatest of all time. It might take the average viewer a few times before they fully understand the meaning behind this film, but it is a truly amazing and important contribution to the history of film. Give it a chance and watch it a few more times. This is the film for the SERIOUS film fan!
B00003CXI0|4.0|it was okay, some of the acting was questionable, special effects were okay, pistured voldemort a little different, all in all it was worth seeing. Sean Biggarstaff was so adorable as Oliver.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|If you are interested in a touching character drama that casts a much-needed eye on the human condition, here's your film.  The relationships that are depicted seem very coherent and organic, running the gamut of natural reactions to situations that, though rare, are at least believable.  Even supporting actors seem to be putting their all into events in an attempt to make them matter to us.<br />The skeleton of the story is drawn from real life.  Gifted mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr., uncovers a previously unknown economic principle, proving that capitalism only works when vain self-interest is sometimes sacrificed to the greater good.  (We all knew that, of course, but he proves it using the numbers.)  He gets a plum appointment to an MIT/Defense Department project, meets and marries a girl, and then suddenly suffers a profound psychotic break.<br />If you're not too religious about your character dramas, you'll like this one.  It tries to investigate what in this world is real and what isn't; it tries to find the human core of a man who has lost touch with reality.  This film won a bevy of awards, and no wonder.  If you've seen it, you'll know why ...
B00005YTFG|4.0|Very strange at the beggining, but for me it was addicting and you just kept wanting to watch more.
044651652X|3.0|I re-read this book this weekend and was surprised at the reviews here.  Some really hated the book and others loved it.  <BR>I read the book a couple of years ago and liked it.  I don't understand the hateful reviews.<br />You know, of course, that an arsonist destroyed the Cedar Bridge on Tuesday, 3 September, 2002. That's why I decided to read the book again.  I was in Iowa at the time of the movie premiere in 1995, but did not attend any events connected with it.<br />A comment on page 78 reflects the view of the average Iowan.<BR>\\"And why in the world would anybody wanna take pictures of 'em?<BR>(The covered bridges.)  They're just all fallin' down in bad shape.\\"  I grew up a few miles north of Madison County, Iowa, and never went to see the wooden bridges. <br />One thing that I noticed the author missed was I am sure that neighbors noticed Kincaid's pickup at the Johnson farm.  In a rural community there are no secrets.  There was no mention of him parking the truck out of sight.  Someone must have seen it.<br />I think city slickers may have had trouble with this story, but we real people did not.
0312955006|5.0|First, before I begin reviewing THE CONCRETE BLOND, how easy is it to buy a book when upon opening it for a cursory scan, you see the main character's name is Hieronymous? It was a must read as I ... nearly laughed out loud! Seriously, this was the first Michael Connelly offering I've read and I was thrilled to find the brashness of Spillane and the heady detail of Grisham. Don't misunderstand, I believe the quality of Connelly's writing to be much more elegant than Spillane's and perhaps more exciting than Grisham's (certainly his latest works) but there are some attributes of those authors seeping into Mr. Connelly's grey matter. Regardless, Mr. Connelly's writing is not one dimensional.<br />The reader is introduced to Hieronymous ... \\"Harry\\" Bosch, a tough, hardened LA detective loathing authority with a seemingly unpenetrable psyche. (Note: My reference to Spillane above was in comparison of his Mike Hammer character to Bosch; definitely some similarities.) As the story opens, the reader is thrown back four years as Harry bursts into an isolated apartment to ostensibly arrest a notorious serial killer known as the 'Dollmaker.' As Harry enters, he is confronted with a naked man, totally devoid of hair. Harry orders him to \\"freeze\\" when the man reaches for something under his pillow. Harry fires and the man crumples on the bed, dead. As Harry looks under the pillow for the gun, he discovers that the man's weapon of choice wasn't a gun rather, it was a toupee. Harry's tail is eventually bailed out after he and the forensics team discover enough evidence to tie the hairless man to the 'Dollmaker' murders.<br />Fast forward four years.....Harry is heading to court as his 'Dollmaker' killing has provided the fodder for a lawsuit by the \\"victim's\\" family. The charge? Excessive force. To make matters worse, the family has hired Honey \\"Money\\" Chandler, a trial-hardened civil rights attorney known for her ability to procure 'money' from whomever she sues. Bosch seems tobe perfect prey for her.<br />As the trial opens, Bosch is called by his current lieutenant to a crime scene. A tip, in the form of an anonymous note, was left in the squad room by an unknown person. The note indicated that the 'Dollmaker' had not been caught and to punctuate the point, the note provides directions to a body proving his claim. As Harry arrives, a demolition crew is removing slabs of concrete from a dilapidated building destroyed in the LA riots. Soon and much to Harry's dismay, a body is discovered (a blond woman buried in concrete, in case you were wondering) who ultimately died under the same \\"M.O.\\" as that used by the 'Dollmaker.' Harry is freaked. Had he killed the wrong man? Was the nefarious 'Dollmaker' still on the streets? Or is this a copycat trying to pull his chain? Regardless the answer, Harry decides he will find out, trial or no trial.<br />The ride Connelly takes the reader on is fabulous. Mind-bending, severe twists. Just when I thought I had it nailed, Connelly would throw another curve. There are so many possible suspects here AND, the reader must determine if, in fact, there is a copycat and who or if the real 'Dollmaker' remains. This is a mystery easily worth 5 stars. I don't often give 5 stars but I was happy to do so here. As proof, I've purchased 4 other Connelly offerings to further my enjoyment, THE LAST COYOTE, TRUNK MUSIC, ANGEL'S FLIGHT, and CITY OF BONES. I look forward to getting to know Hieronymous Bosch much better.
B00006AW2M|5.0|\\"When The Beatles take you on a trip, maybe you should pack a sandwich because you might get hungry on the way.  When The Stones take you on a trip, you had better sublease your apartment and pack a trunk.  You may be gone for a long time.\\"  - The Beatles Book, \\"On With The Show\\", by Edward E. Davis, page 175, Copyright 1968 by Cowles Education Corporation)    No, no lonely hearts club band here.  In some cases, barely recognizable pop songs.  If 'Pepper' was carefully put together, '...Satanic Majesties...' is what happens when you put five celebrity musicians in a studio amidst drug busts and their aftermath trying their darndest to not do a 'Pepper'.    The great songs might have made a great EP - \\"Citadel\\", \\"In Another Land\\", \\"2000 Man\\", \\"She's A Rainbow\\" and \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\".  And if it can fit, \\"The Lantern\\" could be included.  But what do you do with the \\"Sing This All Together\\" opus, \\"Gomper\\" and \\"On with The Show\\".    But, for some reason, this is one of my favorite Stones albums.  Maybe I like the experimentation of the psychedelic era more than others.  And if you agree, this is one example of that era you will thoroughly enjoy.    \\"Sing This All Together\\" sounds sinister and so unlike singing all together (I have read that this was done on purpose).  \\"Citadel\\" with its great backing and unearthly medieval lyric.  \\"In Another Land\\", showcasing Bill Wyman's compositional talents, suggests he should have been given more space to let that talent show.  \\"2000 Man\\" in which a 1967 composition predicts a future that isn't too far off the mark.  In \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\" someone says \\"Where's that joint?\\" and I get the feeling it was found and inhaled for about 8 solid minutes.  The girl in \\"She's A Rainbow\\" has the most colorful sexual experience ever depicted in song.  \\"The Lantern\\" seems to fit if you can picture a foggy, psychedelisized evening in old London town.  \\"Gomper\\" is \\"Within You Without You\\" turned upside down witha mysterious girl at its core.  Then, a blast into outer space that more than exemplifies the mystery and emptiness of it all.  Kubrick captured that in his film '2001'; The Stones capture it here in song.  You are brought back to earth to a seedy bar in \\"On With The Show\\" which seems to have all the earthly treats available provided by the sneering emcee Mick Jagger.  Strange, muffled conversations are heard that you wish you could make out as if they would reveal some secret the album holds.    They don't make albums like this anymore.  Yes, maybe they shouldn't, but I'm glad this one exists.    For those who remember the days when you might find hidden gems in your plastic vinyl discs, how does one play the final track on side one, \\"Cosmic Christmas\\", so, you can hear \\"We Wish You A Merry Christmas\\" in all its glory on a CD?    In the vinyl days, you changed the speed of your player from 33 and a 1/3rpm to 78rpm (I don't think playing it at 45rpm worked) to hear \\"We Wish You A Merry Christmas\\".      The packaging is fine, but couldn't there have been a limited edition 3D cover so we could get Paul and Ringo back in the picture?    And these Certificates of Authenticity that ABKCO provides in the first edition release of their SACD hybrid reissues of The Stones albums that they control - just who came up with this idea?  It is not a guarantee that by buying all 22 new remasters once you will get all the unique, different 22 pieces of the Certificates puzzle, which ends up being a black and white representation of the '...Satanic Majesties...' cover.  This colorful cover is done the most injustice by having these Certificates in black and white.
B00005V0X5|5.0|This cd is astonishing, I have owned the original cd for a long time but i could never get deeply into it because of the poor quality. This cd an amazing improvement in sound quality. Just now I am realizing how much of a masterpiece this cd is. Its darker than the rest of their albums and is full of energy, and awesome guitar work. Its great to hear Mustaine's aggression from being kicked from Metallica in clear audio.<br />Ive read a few reviews that complain of the bad quality of the demo's- well they arent good quality because THEYRE DEMOS. Demo recordings from that time were done on bad equipment. Remastering really doesnt apply to them... theyre for the hardcore fans.  As for the &quot;These Boots&quot; song- Dave speaks of the situation in the booklet- he has kept it on the cd despite massive censoring just for a big &quot;screw off&quot; to the writer. DONT LET THESE SONGS SWAY YOU FROM PURCHASING THIS CD. If youre a Deth fan and you already own the original or dont... this cd isnt a let down in anyway. This is the first speed metal cd and now can be enjoyed even more...
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This is one of the all time greatest live albums. I saw these guys in concert back in 1979. It was one of the best shows I have ever seen. These guys are straight up true rock n roll. Phil Mogg is one of the best rock vocalist. Pete Way pounces on the bass like few can. Michael Schenker, when he is on is one of the best rock guitarist around. The best song on this album is Rock Bottom. There is not a bad song on this album. If you love live rock n roll this album is a must have.
B000001G16|5.0|hey. I'm a Richie Fan from years ago. I think he's one of the best guitar players in the world. His first album released [in] 1991 it's owesome. He's got a great voice and he has the best guitar solos. I think the best songs [on] the album are Rosie, Ballad of Youth and Church of desire which was an amazing solo.<BR>I bought the Cd twice because once I [loaned] it to a friend and I had the hardest time ever getting it back. Eventually I got it back. <BR>YOU [MUST] HAVE THIS GREAT RICHIE SAMBORA [WORK!]

B000069AUI|5.0|Like most fans of \\"Parachutes\\" I was worried I'd be disappointed with this release.  But I worried without reason: This album is simply incredible.  The production is better, the songs are deeper, and the music is crisper than that of \\"Parachutes\\".  <br />If you're a fan of great music and tired of nu-metal, rap, and teen bands, get this CD.  If for \\"Clocks\\" alone...

B00005OAIE|5.0|After reading amazon.com's review of the John Mayer CD, I began to question the value of my recent purchase. Did I make a mistake? Is John Mayer really as bad of an artist as they say he is? The answer... NO!!! Every time I listen to the cd, I begin to love John Mayer even more. I am an avid guitar player and vocalist and John Mayer has INCREDIBLE talent. His music simply amazes me and will be sure to amaze you. Even better are his down to earth and witty lyrics. John speaks of enthusiasm in \\"No Such Thing\\" and the cruelty-hope of a move to a large city in \\"Why Georgia.\\" Room for Squares, being his debut major label album is so great for a first album that I simply cannot wait to see what else John's beautifully artistic mind can churn out. This cd is a definite buy. Definite. Definite.

0316666343|1.0|Given Sebold's personal history of being brutally raped, it is difficult to not find one redeeming aspect of her first work of fiction.  However, a critical reader will be disappointed in this unsuccessful attempt at creating a fully-developed novel.  Sebold's pretty much nailed the 1970s setting; and the first-person narrative of teenage Susie does somewhat succeed at times.  But, oh my heavens!  What happened to the plot?  The non-linear plot weaving detracts from characterization and other attributes of good fiction.  The murderer's identity and gratuitous details of the rape/murder are revealed rather early on.  Thus, this must be a novel about something else?  But, what?  Poor writing blurs + smothers development of any credible theme(s).  Most disappointing are the certain miracles which are just too unbelievable when contrasted with what isn't happening once a soul passes onto the great way beyond.  <br />For those looking for a wonderful novel dealing with death and faith, may I suggest Katherine Paterson's Newbery Award winner, Bridge to Terabithia or Natalie Babbitt's Tuck Everlasting?  Yes, two children's novels; but much more satisfying.
B000002L80|4.0|This album went platinum in 1985 and it's easy to see why. Talking Heads scored four radio hits with this album (&quot;Stay Up Late&quot;, &quot;And She Was&quot;, &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot;, &quot;The Lady Don't Mind&quot;) All of these songs are worth hearing and are Talking Heads landmarks. (Oddly enough, &quot;The Lady Don't Mind&quot; is not included on Sand in the Vaseline) This album has other charms beyond that as well. If you're a fan, it's a must-have. If you're more casual, this is still a pretty safe buy, but you might want to try and give it a listen first.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I saw this film only once when it was first released. The details of the story are fuzzy in my memory but the sounds and images are still razor sharp.     When I saw it, it struck me exactly like an old 1920's silent comedy, with sound. The scene where the man is trying to keep the baby from crying seemed like an direct copy of a scene from an old silent film where the silent comedian (Harold Lloyd or someone) tries to pull his Murphy bed down and needs to sit on it so it won't bounce back up into the wall but he gets comically caught by also needing to close the door to his room so he can undress into his pajamas. The distance between the bed and the door was such that he could not do both things at once - if he stood up to close the door, the bed flew back up into the wall, but if he sat on the bed to keep it down the door came unlocked and swung open.     The main character of \\"Eraserhead\\" lives in a harsh and cruel world where people are rather mean or at best indifferent of him, so much like a vaudeville comedy or Victorian melodrama.    The theme song \\"In Heaven\\" has a bittersweet tune, but again with heavy sarcastic humor which to my mind is poking fun at John Lennon's utopia song \\"Imagine\\" and akin to the sad resignation found in many American slave spirituals. The lyrics are: \\"In heaven everything is fine. In heaven everything is fine. In heaven everything is fine. You have your nice things and I have mine. In heaven everything is fine.\\"    The constant industrial sounds which underscore the film are similar to the constant loud humming of a nuclear power plant -- the constant humming of hell on earth warning of iminent death through poisinous radiation pollution.     My brother uses this film as the rule for measuring the weirdness of all other films.  It's a great film.
B000002KNY|5.0|David Byrne's songwriting was at it's highest level at this point and Talking Heads put out a classic album with this one. I can't even describe it...Even hardcore haters of Talking Heads will have difficulty putting this one down.

B000002KZ6|4.0|Despite only scoring one hit (&quot;Burning Down the House&quot;), Talking Heads handled their split with producing genius Brian Eno very well. This album captures every last bit of Remain in Light's alluring funk and still manages to sound different enough to be interesting. It's a veritable funk-fest with a very generous helping of synth. Also amazing; It's a known fact amongst Talking Heads fans that the band members, even at this early point, were not getting along. It's not often that you hear bands that are splintering apart put out music this good.
B00005YTFG|1.0|One of the worst movies I've ever seen in any Genre, this \\"thing\\" flits around like a major mental project.  The \\"writers\\" filch bits and pieces of well-known pop-culture tunes and shove them into scenes randomly, and then only a line or two every couple of seconds.  It can't justifyably be called a \\"musical\\".  I'm glad I didn't shell out any money for this video (it was a well-intentioned gift), however I feel cheated as I wasted over 2 hours of precious time watching this drivel.  In short: the story was trite and cliched, the singing was amateur, the acting laughable, and the effects were wasted.<br />The fact that the average rating is 4 stars (as of this review) alarms me and causes me to fear for the course of our culture.

B00004WG2X|1.0|I used to think that one could not produce a worse adaptation of Pride and Prejudice than the 1940 version.  I stand corrected.  I have now seen, what is unmistakeably, one of the worst mini-series in history.<br />Jane Austen's lively banter and sparkling wit is reduced to nonsensical drivel in the mouths of these paltry actors (assuming they ARE actors, as I have yet to see another collection of more amateur performers).  No one seems to understand (or even care about) the point of any scene that is being filmed, as the actors anticipate each other's lines with breakneck speed.<BR>  <BR>Many have complained of David Rintoul's woodenness as Darcy, but I think all the performers could not be less lifelike.  The movie might be thought amusing if it was billed properly as &quot;Jane Austen's Night of the Living Dead&quot;.  Elizabeth Garvie appears to be on Prozac, as she maintains a vague, blank smile throughout the series, which is supposed to capture the entire range of Lizzy Bennett's emotions.<br />And this remarkably poor performance is riddled with absurdities such as interiors which look as realistic as cardboard, unlikely costumes, horrid dance choreography, added scenes that do nothing to further the plot or develop the characters, and the flat effect of filming in video.<br />If you haven't seen this adaptation, but your curiousity is getting the better of you (as mine did), I guarantee that you will be kicking yourself after wasting four hours of your life.  I now am able to view the 1940 film in a more forgiving light, and can appreciate its redeeming qualities.  Of course, the cream of the crop is the 1995 Ehle/Firth adaptation, which is most faithful to the spirit and the brilliant prose of Jane Austen.
B000003FIQ|5.0|Most of the time I have heard Heifitz recordings, I dislike him.  He always seems to me as if his playing is the unwinding of a spring that's overtightened; one doesn't feel that he's living each note. <br />But this CD changed my mind.<br />I'm a violinist, and I played this CD to a violinist friend asking him to identify it.  He identified the Sibelius from the very first 2 notes.  (It is so, so beloved).  Within 10 notes he knew the violinist was 'old school'.  Within 20 he guessed Heifitz.<br />We both marvelled at the accuracy of his double stops and his spicatto is unmatched. <br />This CD is one of my car's 'top 5'.
B0000027RL|5.0|Emotional and overwrought form of catharsis present throughout. Allegedly autobigraphical anecdotes of childhood trauma provide emotive subject matter for heartfelt lyrics. Smooth classic rock sound remains welcome alternative to sludge-fest atonal dronish wailing of Seattle's other high profile sons. Eddie Vedder laments his dead father ('Release'), and muses extremely deeply upon a lost loved one ('Black'). Diverse themes run throughout the album: the 'Mamason' trilogy largely present here. In explanation: first part - 'Alive', partly autobiographical. Mother and Father split, but Mother still loves Father. Father dies when child is 13 and Mother tells son a few years later. Second part - 'Once', boy in story grown and messed up (due to Mothers attempt to seduce him, child reminded mother of dead father) becomes serial killer. Final part - 'Footsteps' ('Jeremy B-side), killer on death row awaiting punishment. Lyrics self-explanatory.<br />Superb record, start to finish. No weak moments, masses of single grade material, compelling, emotive and loveable.<br />Spins in my CD player frequently despite age.<br />Essential purchase.
B00005JLD2|5.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence is a wonderful film which the world's largest audience, America, has yet to see. Directed by Phillip Noyce of Bone Collector fame, it follows two sisters; Molly and Daisy and their cousin Gracie. Born half-caste children in the 1930's (white fathers with Aboriginal mothers), their fathers have had a quick bit of fun while building a rabbit-proof fence then long since moved on. The fence stretches from one side of Australia to the other. As a law, half-caste children come under rule of a man named Mr A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh). He orders the three young girls to be taken from their mothers and placed in a 'concentration camp' like place over 1500 miles from home. Any girl who tries to escape will be tracked down by a man named Moodoo who will have her punished. The three girls manage to escape into the vast untouched land on a trek back home, covering their tracks on the way. Always one step ahead of Moodoo, they come across the occasional people on their farms. Not knowing who to trust they must take risks. The girls realise that the only way to get back home is to follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence.<BR>I was lucky enough to go to one of the New Zealand Premieres. After recognising the talanted Christine Olsen (Screenwriter/Producer) from the television and newspapers I decided to approach her. What a wonderful woman she was. We talked about all different things for about 15 - 20 minutes and would have continued if only she didn't have to introduce the film. She grabbed the only Press Kit they had there and personally signed it to me which was a real delight. The movie turned out to be brilliant. The screenplay was amazing and the silence said about as much as the words. The young barely trained actresses playing the girls did a magnificent job. Well directed and a must-see for anyone and everyone. It will make you laugh and make you cry but the thing to remember is that it is based on a truely terrible story of Australia's history. >Enjoy<
B000066NW0|4.0|i don't know what's wrong with me.  i can't remember ever liking a pop song, and definitely not anything by anyone fairly young, but i like this entire album.  hmm.  <br />i also, on the rare occasion i like a top40, can't remember ever feeling like hearing a pop song, and yet i find myself jammin away to this album at the computer.  hmm.<br />so i am confused.  i usually listed to angry girl music of the pjharvey variety or punk rock or dave matthews (mmm, yummy) and this album is nothing like these.  it very much fits into the pink, britney category.  i like a couple of these types of songs, but never a whole album ... i can't figure it out.  i just like avril.<br />so... i'm telling you this album is worth getting if you're thinking about it.  if i can like it, most people can.  <br />first listen fav's: unwanted,anything but ordinary, naked, nobody's fool - in that order
B000067CPX|5.0|this album is in true Red Hot Chili Peppers style, with catchy guitar riffs, kickass vocals, and unmatched bass lines from Flea, this album may not be as \\"funky\\" as other albums like Blood, Sugar, Sex,Magic or Mother's Milk but that doesn't mean it isn't good, they still hold on to their roots as a \\"funk-metal\\" band. listen to can't stop or any of the other songs on the album and try to find anything wrong with them. just because this album doesn't sound like their old ones does that make it bad? the Red Hot Chili Peppers still kick ass and that is a fact! this may not be their best album but there is nothing wrong with it, it sounds good, and that's what matters, you people who get caught up in the politics of music make me sick.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Everybody listen up! this CD is amazing!! All the songs are different sounding but are all tied together by the radio feel.<br />I especially like Song For The Dead. Great high energy drumming, guitar and vocals... When I listened to the CD for the first time and heard Song for the Dead I said to myself, \\"I don't anything can top that!\\" and I don't think any other songs did. Eventhough theyre all great...<br />Anyway go out and buy this CD ASAP!...
B0000025T6|5.0|The first time I heard this album was when I found a vinyl copy in the budget section shortly after its release. Many touted this work a flop following the success of \\"The River\\" which was a commercial hit. When he was ready to hit the studio again to follow up \\"The River\\", something must have touched his need to put down tracks of music that were to be true to his gift of making music. Alone, with very little backing, Springsteen put together these 10 songs that speak for the thousands of us who are hardworking, blue collar folks just trying to get by in this life. Two years later he released \\"Born in the USA\\"!!
0451191935|5.0|First of all, if Stephen King is afraid that his writing will inspire some teenager to murder someone or take a school hostage, he is flattering himself.  I don't think King, while extremely entertaining and imaginative, is quite enough to make anyone do anything that drastic.  King taking it out of print is hypocrisy, pure and simple:\\"Rage\\" is obviously sympathetic not to the people that Charlie Decker, the high school student on a rampage, is terrorizing, but is written from HIS viewpoint, and sympathizing with HIM, which is entirely legitimate.  This also points to the pretty obvious fact that at some point or another King felt the way Decker did as an adolescent or a young adult, albeit not murderous.  I first read the novella when I was 14, and was stunned that a writer could connect so poignantly with alienated individuals like myself.  I've read pretty much everything Stephen King has written with the exception of \\"The Dark Tower\\" series, which I have no desire to read, and still feel that \\"Rage\\" is the only piece of literature per se that King has produced.  Taking it out of print is shooting himself in the foot.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I had recently moved to New York and read the Village Voice and they had the year end reviews for best cd and The Strokes Is This It? was number 2 behind Bob Dylan. <BR>So I heard about this band of rich kids who like to play rock music. I thought ok, no big deal. I had read about them in Rolling Stone and again thought, no big deal. I flew back home for a visit and was watching MTV at 3 in the morning and saw the video for Hard To Explain. <BR>I bought the cd the next day because I could not get that song out of my head. That's the easiest way to explain this cd, you cannot get it out of your head. Starting off with Is This It? which is a slower tempo song, each song is catchy, but not in a bubblegum way. The Modern Age, Soma, Barely Legal come right at you and you find yourself hitting repeat. My favorite track is Take It Or Leave It. Even the grossly overplayed Last Nite still finds me tapping my fingers. Clearly they play their brand of music and don't care what you think. Their cool and they know it, but they don't flaunt it. The Strokes are the kids in your school who never had to study and got all A's. As far as being rich kids, I can think of worse things kids from money can do. They just play music for the sake of music and that's all I ask. Their young so hopefully their talent will keep them in the game for a long time to come. Worth every penny and a quality CD. Go and get it. Julian, Fab, Nick, Albert and Nikolai are worth listening to and may have you hitting repeat like me.
0780020685|5.0|Renowned the world over, Akira Kurosawa's \\"Seven Samurai\\" definitely deserves its status as an action masterpiece and staple of classic cinema.  Though grand in scope, Kurosawa's opus is an intimate and thoughtful exploration of several distinct character types and their place in the world.  It is this characterization and the director's leisurely yet ever-advancing pace that lends \\"Seven Samurai\\" much that makes it unique.  Few movies--action or otherwise--offer as much to consider as this one.  The cast is also superb, from Takashi Shimura's peerless samurai chief to Toshiro Mifune's wild samurai wanna-be to star-crossed lovers Keiko Tsushima and Isao Kimura (whose love scenes are perhaps the most believably powerful yet filmed) and everyone in-between. Over everything Fumio Hayasaka's magical score, simple but authoritative, hovers like a golden halo.  In fact, though it is surely heresy to say so, I found the action scenes to be among the weaker moments in the film.  By modern standards, they aren't nearly as spectacular as they must have been to 50s viewers.  But while that might doom a lesser action film, \\"Seven Samurai\\" enthralls despite this minor drawback, thanks to its incredible combination of great direction, dialogue, performances, and absolutely amazing camerawork and set design--the rain-shrouded final battle is a thing of macabre majesty.  Of course I realize this is not a film for everyone--this is a three-hour b&w film in Japanese set in the distant past that has little in common with modern action pix in terms of style, cinematography and choreography and so may be disappointing to many.  Be that as it may, I consider \\"Seven Samurai\\" to be a cerebral triumph that is a great testament to the power of drama to portray and inspire the human spirit.  A profound all-around viewing experience.
B000067CPX|5.0|This album was awesome for what it was. Think about it everyone, these guys arn't the super funky, energetic 20 year olds they used to be. Their now growing a little older, a little more mature, and more artistic and experimental in their works. They still keep their own &quot;style&quot; of fusion artists of funky rock/rap, but try to add some more genre of things. The lighter side and some smoother rock was added to make it sound like the blues could sound with some derivement from the beach boys and the beatles, who were hit groups. Let me ask you this question everyone, after recording seven other albums and eighteen years of all funky rock stuff, isn't it time for a little bit of change?
B00004Z459|5.0|Fans of hard rock/pop will not be disappointed with this wonderful album by Linkin Park. Songs like One Step Closer, In The End, Points Of Authority, and Papercut are among some of the hits on this tight CD. GET IT!
B00003CXI1|3.0|The movie of the first Harry Potter book is worthy of the time and money to watch it, but it lacks in one essential element; the characters don't seem to believe in the reality of their world as much as I.  Hermione never looks around the Great Hall when she first walks in; when he comes to pick him up from the island, Haggrid acts like it has been a few days since he last saw Harry, not many years.  There are many such examples.<br /> I am glad for any and all attention the movies generates for the books, however.  Ms. Rowling works deserve all the attention they get. Seek them.  THERE lies a real adventure in reading.
B000058T5E|5.0|This album, as said by many other reviewers, is one of Jeff Beck's best, and is one of guitar's best as well. You Had It Coming pushes  musical boundaries like none before it. People usually turn their heads when I tell them it's techno oriented, but once I play it for them they run out to buy their own copy. <br />Anyone who thinks Jeff Beck is boring should listen to the first cut, Earthquake. The dynamics and tension are a nice touch, listen as the middle section is like the eye of the storm, calm, but then Jeff rips it apart with his awesome, awe-inspiring solo. Classic. Roy's Toy is another highlight piece with a funky groove (think &quot;A Day in the House&quot; from Guitar Shop, only even cooler). For motorheads such as myself, this song has an extra bonus when we hear the 32 Ford roadster start up at the beginning and is used throughout the rest of the song. Jeff's solo in this song is also quite inspiring and, simply, awesome. The next cut, Dirty Mind, is the single from the album. Jeff Beck's wah pedal playing in this song is amoung the best I've ever heard. The technically staggering solo in the middle is THE best wah wah solo that I've heard on an album. Rollin' and Tumblin', the next song, features the soulful Imogene Heap on vocals. This awesome rendition of the song gives the Blues a new name. The solo section between Jeff and Imogene is very fun, awesome, and leaves you wondering how on earth Jeff Beck does it. <br />The next cut, Nadia, merits more detailed examination and we shall look it over in a little bit. Meanwhile, anyone who thinks they sound tough and menacing on their Strat (or any guitar, for that matter) should give Loose Cannon, the next song, a listen. The menacing riff in the beginning sets the tone for the whole song. The solos are also very mesmerizing, especially at the end where he hits two signature and totally Jeff Beck harmonics. The sounds he gets out his simple Strat-Marshall setup are amazing. Rosebud is a funky piece with agroove and lick that will leave you humming and dancing afterwards. The next song, Left Hook, is amoung the best on the CD. Listen to the fade out... I can't even explain it. You'll have to listen for yourself, it's that good. Blackbird/Suspension close this disc, and what an ending. The tone of album turns down a bit and is left with just Jeff, a bird, keyboards, and soft drums. Very emotional, as is all of Jeff's playing, and very beautiful.<br />As I promised before we will now look at Nadia, the standout track of You Had It Coming. &quot;Jeff's signature tone is in full splendor here...&quot; said another reviewer, and it is so true. Nadia will leave you scratching your head and asking yourself why you can't get that kind of beauty out of your guitar. Not only is Nadia one of the most techincally difficult songs Jeff has ever done, it's also one of the most beautiful. It's just Jeff with keyboards and drums. The up-tempo beat is also note worthy. You have to close your eyes when you listen to it to take it all in. Jeff switches amazingly between bottleneck and fingers, as well as doing whammy bar flutters. The sheer emotion of this track can bring a grown man to tears. Not much more can be said. Buy it and listen for yourself. I agree that Nadia is as good as Where Were You from Guitar Shop, and might even be better.<br />You Had It Coming is an awesome Jeff Beck album and is one of his best, if not the best, of his entire career.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|If your taste runs to the sophomoric ideation such as the WWF and that ilk, by all means, run to see the film. However, if you are seeking a storyline that isn't interrupted every few minutes with inane martial arts, puffed up chit chat, and an accompanying Rap soundtrack, avoid it.<br />The best bet with this is to rent it first. Personally it was a money waster for me and I regret buying it based on the original Blade without having seen this sequel first. It won't hold up well on repeated viewings the way the first one does.<br />When all is said and done, this film seeks to financially cash in on the Rap/Hip Hop culture and the many anime/martial arts fans while dressing it up in a pseudo-vampire theme.<br />Those associated with this film should be embarrassed to have lent their questionable talents to its creation.<br />Better luck next time New Line!
B00005YJMX|5.0|This is one of my favorite. i once saw it on the channel AMC around Valentine's Day, and I loved it. I bought it. I thought music gave a eerie, sad sound to the movie. Even though it was not as quit close of being like the book, Dracula, but it had and outstanding story. I can see why Roger Ebert, rated it 4 stars. Very goood movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JLHG|5.0|This is a fantastic film, with a fantastic cast. What people dont seem to understand is that the film is about an era,  therefore a lot of bands and a lot of famous people. It is not paying attention to detail or telling any one person's story in depth.It would be impossible to do so and was never the film's intention. Steve Coogan is brilliant as Tony Wilson, yet the public fail to see that Alan Partridge is based on Wilson and not the other way around. Sean Harris who played Ian Curtis was incredible and any one who liked Joy Division will be utterly spellbound by the way Harris captures the essence of Curtis.This is a great movie,which chops and changes as much as the music industry and scene did during that time. Hats off to Michael Winterbottom.
B00004RFFS|3.0|I would say this is a good vampire movie, except it did not please me. Number 1, No stakes. Number 2, in the movie Vampires have reflections. Number 3 Vampires do sleep in coffins with soil, but in this movie, They just sleep in ordinary coffins. And Number 4, The Vampires did not remind me of true vampires. <BR>The film is better than Queen of the Damn, also by Anne Rice.
B000001F6N|1.0|Now that I have your attention!  Yeah, the music is great and every song is a gem (checked it out of a library), but I think that consumers should boycott this and other overpriced CDs until they're remastered and extra tracks are added.  This CD is only 37 minutes long and it's a rip off that it's priced so high for so little music.  Since a CD can hold 80 minutes of music it's not too much to ask that older works such as this be packed as tightly as possible.  There's hundreds of other value-priced CDs out there, why buy this?
B000035Z3K|4.0|This is the original Dracula. It is great. It has a good story, but not as quit as how the book is. But, mostly, Director and writers do that, so they can show it there way. I think there is nothing wrong with it. It would be nice if it went by the book. But, I give this 4stars instead of 5 because They killed Dracula, but they never kiled Lucy, when she became a vampire, and they never staked Dracula's Brides.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Seabold's style of writing is utterly brilliant.  I especially enjoyed her description of Suzie's 'heaven', in that we each create our own in life.  I was a bit disappointed in the last chapter as it had a &quot;let's hurry up and wrap this story up&quot; kind of quality.  I would have enjoyed a bit more &quot;what goes around, comes around&quot; sort of justice.  I look forward to reading more from Alice in the future.  If you enjoy her writing, give Wally Lamb a try!
B00005R23X|5.0|This is probably the most realistic, most enternaing Dracula movie of all time. It is also one of the first Dracula movies ever to recieve academy Awards. It won Three. The [clothes] dracula wears in this Dracula, are probably better than Dracula wearing a cape and a tux. Dracula is described exactly from the book. And yes, [i]n the book it does say he is old in the beginning. The ending comes the closest to the book than any other Dracula movie. And Dracula was once [a] Prince of Hungary, and he impaled people, that is a true story. In real life there [was] a dracula and his bride did [plunge] into a river. Great love story. The best costumes ever [I] have seen.
B00000JPH6|4.0|Hi people. I have seen this film in the theatres, on video tape, HBO, and now DVD. I bought the video tape way back when it first released in the 80's on beta. Do you remember beta VCR tapes? I was very impressed with this DVD version because of the better picture quality than the tapes and the deleted scenes that I have not seen before. I was hoping for more original scenes and original made up language of the charecters that was run on the pre-release film before the final film was released nationwide. I was not impressed with the way the music soundtrack is to be heard on the DVD, the only way to hear it is to play the whole film at the same time or seperate scene shots. I would have liked the soundtrack to be played seperate from the film like the LP record I once owned. I did like the trailers, art, and the making of The Dark Crystal bonus film. Overall the film is an adventure set in a fantasy world which has a lot of thought and imagination brought into it. I suggest watching the making of the film which will bring alot of insight to the world of The Dark Crystal.

0385720920|5.0|Choke is going to go down as one of the late 20th centuries' best statements about itself. People seem to be turned off by the amoralism of Palahniuk's characters, but I think that that misses the point: in this day and age amoralism is no less rational than honest living, it may even be more truthful.<br />The point of the book is that society is choking itself, or at least a big part of society, mostly young, is growing up choked: alienated from the past because of social destruction and afraid to face the future because of this same instability. In face of all this people are choking themselves off, buying into false utopias that promise a coherent, normal, view of what's around them while secretly hoping that reality does not intrude.<br />Palahniuk goes much farther than other writers in the underground genre with his critique. What get's savaged in the book isn't so much New Age utopias as it is the idea that a person can transcend this irrational existence by fighting back with sexual ecstacy and the transgression of moral codes. A hot topic in the underground scene. Palahniuk isn't opposed to these things, but he suggests that they're just another way of blocking out reality. Instead, he suggests a more radical alternative to get beyond choking, whether it be from the left or the right: to go beyond society itself, to go beyond a contest between the establishment and the underground, and create something radically new yourself based on a profound truthfulness combined with a view of life which instead of contesting power simply ignores it and pursues a good existence completely severed from it's games. Have fun!
B00000634L|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim, after listening to a couple of sample tracks on Amazon. I absolutely love this album; it definitely exceeded my expectations. The songs are very catchy and likable without being the same, old formulaic pop you hear on the radio. <br />The best way that I can describe Bran Van 3000's music is that they put everything they can (lots of different sounds and styles) into a song, and yet manage to make it all sound like it was meant to be together. Most importantly the music is FUN. I definitely reccomend this CD.

B00005RYKU|3.0|Okay, I admit, I was totally psyched to see this film because it looked like a slick scary thriller. I came out of the theater dissapointed. Totally not scary in anyway. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this very much but it just wasn't what I thought it would be.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This album has, quite possibly, the best chorus' I have heard on any album, ever. Nuff' said.
B000002J09|5.0|Not much can be said about the album with &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;.  That overplayed fave is still possibly the best rock song ever.  Of course, rockers like &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; and &quot;Black Dog&quot;, and bouncy songs like &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; and &quot;Four Sticks&quot;, and bluesy songs like &quot;Levee&quot; all help make this a great album.  It still sounds fresh.
B000059XUP|1.0|I loved the first movie when I saw it in the theaters at 5. that made me what i am know. A fourteen year old in highschool proud not to be in a chess club. when i saw this in theaters i was in complete shock. your setting there going are the doing this or is it a dream. \\" IT's all your worst nightmares,rolled into one.\\" as said in the movie. Its a little bit of stupidity mixed in with unsual movie making, iggy pop with a shirt offin one shot, and the Godfather III to top it off. I love david Goyer and how he writes but when he was righting that movie you know some one pass what he's smoking. this movie had some good things to it.. oh wait nevermind my bad there was nothing in it to make me watch again unless i wanted a few laughs. and i really don't care about giving away the ending of the movie to atleast spare you the embarressment of saying you saw it. sarah dies at the end. why what was that all about the only thing that survived the first movie except that damn cat Gabriel. somtimes i wonder why they release sequals I'll never know oh well...
B00000ILDF|3.0|I remember when my dad took my older brother and sister to see this movie. They were VERY excited, because all of us enjoyed the first two movies. Sadly, they came home disgusted that night after paying almost $10.00 a person to see the first screening, and I really can't blame them.<br />What's so bad? Well, first off, Alien 3 had a very weak script. The main characters die off right when the movie begins. Characters from \\"Aliens\\" (The 2nd movie) like Hicks and Newt, who you grew to love. Talk about shock value. As the movie progresses, we're treated to listening to a bunch of fowl mouthed prison inmates who you don't quite care about anyway. Ripley gets close to one of the inmates in particular, but he's killed off rather quickly. Oh, and did I mention she now has an Alien inside of her? I guess paying good money to see this movie with high hopes could be considered the equivalent of being shot and kicked repeatedly while you lie helpless on the ground. I feel for the people who were severely disappointed.<br />I watched this movie quite a bit from the time it was released on video right up until it became a DVD, and even on television a couple of times. What intriques me about this movie? Unlike the 4th installment, it stayed true to the dark brooding horror which is what the first 2 films captured. Alien 3 was very dark. After your mind accepts the faults over a period of time, you're able to appreciate it a little more. Ripley's selfless act at the very end of the movie, the emotional and not to mention enthusiastic speeches given by Ripley and the inmates, the music. It's a depressing film to some, and everybody knows why. But what can you do? I was personally hoping they'd make a 4th installment which canceled Alien 3 out as nothing more then a bad dream in hyper-space, but instead we were given something even more disgusting and a phony/dumbed down version of our main hero who was cloned. But that's another story.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Not only is Mayer far and away NOT a Dave clone, this album is an unbelievably intelligent and thought out recording, something you dont see every day or even every year anymore...Theres alot of humor and sarcasm in the songs if you know how to listen for it... The only downside to this album is the occasional mismatch of music and lyrics, notably \\"Your Body is A Wonderland\\". The happy skippy music distracts from the incredible lyrics, and might have been served better toned down a notch.<BR>No Such Thing, Stupid Mouth, and Neon are worth buying the album for alone. Why Georgia, 83 and Great Outdoors are fantastic too.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I borrowed this album from my friend expecting it to be pretty much in the same vain as Tori Amos or Ani Difranco or something. But Fiona is nothing like either of those singers, or any other singers around for that matter, her style is completely unique and amazing - in short, I fell inlove with the album, despite the fact that I usually listen to punk/metal and etc. Its become my album of the year and I seriously recommend it to anyone with ears. And even if you dont have ears then just eat the CD, because I bet it even tastes good.<br />'Get Gone' and 'I know' are my favourites, aswell as 'On The Bound', although it's difficult to pinpoint favourites, because all the songs are good'uns. Whats more, Fiona's voice is sexy as hell and she's got this real kind of 'dont [mess] with me' tone to her voice sometimes. <br />Personally, I wasnt too impressed with Tidal, but thats probably because I'de heard 'When The Pawn' first, so I had big expectations.<br />I read something before about Marilyn Manson obsessing over Fiona Apple, and I can understand why. Shes lush, so buy it.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This album has, quite possibly, the best chorus' I have heard on any album, ever. Nuff' said.
B000003TAR|3.0|This is a pretty good album, but in my opinion, Steve Albini has never done anyone's album any good. The production sounds abrasive, and the songs are a little too spare. If that's what Kurt was going for, fine, it just isn't as enjoyable. The songs are still very good, and though I have my complaints, it's still a good album.
0345451325|4.0|Sure, I played the game for the XBox, but I wanted more. And Halo: The Fall of Reach was just what the doctor ordered. No, this isn't a mindless video game based novel, this is actually a PREQUEL to the smash hit video game (which was indeed an epic one at that.) All original story, etc.<br />The writer did an awesome job on this one. I can't give him enough credit: Eric Nylund is a genius. Page by page, this book is written very realistically in great detail just like Heinland's Starship Troopers, where often he'd show off his actual knowledge of science in great detail. Amazing stuff.<br />I guess going indepth on the story would waste your time since you can read a brief synopsis at the top of the page, but I just want to say I enjoyed this book from start to finish. It drops you off right where the video game starts. My dad's been reading science fiction novels since he was a kid -- he picked up the book and couldn't put it down. Really goes to show you that this a book for all ages. Just because it has video game tie-ins doesn't necessarily count it out or play it off as a &quot;kiddie&quot; novel. I'd suggest this book to anybody, especially since you need no knowledge of the game to get into it. Hope he makes the sequel! Pick this one up!
B00006F2TV|5.0|This is the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life! Tobey Maguire is soooo hot! I thought this was going to be a bad movie but I was SO surprised. I've seen it 6 times and each time it gets better and better. I DEFINITLY reccomend this to ANYONE. I have seen this with about 50 different people, all types and ages. Every single one of them said that they absolutly loved this movie and couldnt stop talking about it. Everyone who thought they wouldnt like it loved it. So see it!...
B00005YXZH|5.0|Considering that Uncle Tupelo/Wilco's prior output left no impression on me at all, this one just seemed to leap out of nowhere at me. I'm hard pressed to think of anything I can compare this to. The usual elements of country, folk, classic rock, singer-songwriter, etc. are there, but the ratios of one to the other are altered pretty drastically from their earlier records. In a way, it's alt-country in the sense that it's not city boys trying to adapt country &amp; folk music for an urban audience, but  a strain of country &amp; folk music that somehow grew out of an urban environment (sort of like how some of Pere Ubu's records were kind of &quot;urban folk music&quot;). I also was pleasanly surprised to find that this was the first album with Jim O'Rourke's name in the credits since &quot;Bad Timing&quot; that didn't have me grinding my teeth. Who knows - I may even have to check out those earlier records again to see if there was something I missed the first time around. I don't know if I'd call this my favorite album of the year, but it's certainly in my Top 20.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This album has, quite possibly, the best chorus' I have heard on any album, ever. Nuff' said.
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin makes their most fun album (fun b/c of &quot;Crunge&quot;, &quot;Dancing Days&quot;, &quot;Ocean&quot; and &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot;), but of course it has excellent Jimmy Page guitar work on &quot;Over The Hills&quot;, and John Paul Jones gets to do his thing on &quot;No Quarter&quot;.  All of these songs are great, and this album is not optional for Zep fans.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I don't know how anyone (other than a true horror hater) cannot like this movie. I've played the game since it's first release, and once I heard Tomb Raider was coming to theater I had my fingers crossed that Resident Evil would soon follow.<br />    I didn't think that Tomb Raider did the game justice, but with Resident Evil the cast and crew have more than captured the feel of the game, they've taken the idea and properly put it down on film. I'm sure we all agree that is one tuff task.<br />    I've heard a lot of nonsense about the zombies not looking real enough and that the monsters weren't scary looking enough...Hogwash. I mean these zombies aren't the \\"rotted in the ground for years\\" type of zombie, their freshly killed zombies. What's a freshly killed zombie supposed to look like? Pretty much like a person that's just been killed I would guess. Anyway, the zombies were quite fitting to the plot in my view. And the monster at the end looks just like something out of the game, another good job done in my opinion.<br />   The computer guarding Umbrella's underground hive was a really good addition to the overall monster theme of the movie. It definitely added an interesting twist to the first parts of the film.<br />   If I HAD to pick out weak points of the film it would be, the hidden/secret object format the game follows. The group finds it clues/keys/guns a little too easily, but we only have a limited amount of time, so looking for a key for 30 minutes like the game would have been a tad much. And not to give any of the movie away, but I do think the dogs should have had a wee bit bigger of a part.<br />   But other than that, this is one of the best zombie movies to date, and I look forward to RE2 which should be soon to follow.
1577311760|4.0|The message of this book is quite simple but extremely difficult to practice. Unlike most books I review, this one can be easily summarized in a few sentences. Live in the moment --the past and future are illusory. All pain and dysfunction arise from the ego's insistence on avoiding the present moment. Of course, this is the basic teaching of all schools of Eastern mysticism, Zen in particular. Eckhart Tolle also quotes Jesus quite often, giving his words a different and less literal meaning. In it's tone and message, the book The Power of Now most reminds me of is A Course In Miracles. It may be my ego saying this, but I have to admit that I have some problems with both of these books. It is almost impossible to argue with the message of The Power of Now. Any healthy spiritual or psychological system encourages such a practice. It is the tone and attitude with which this message is delivered that makes me a little uncomfortable. It seems to me that there's a kind of dogmatism lurking beneath the surface here. Everything is presented in dualistic terms; we are either enlightened beings living in the Now OR we are lost souls living in the delusions of the ego. I tend to believe things are more on a continuum. There's a Buddhist saying I like, \\"samsara is nirvana.\\" In other words, the idea that the world of illusion (samsara) is separate from nirvana (enlightenment) is itself a kind of illusion. I still recommend The Power of Now. Whatever your spiritual path --or even if you're not on one-- hearing these words can remind you of some valuable things.
0446677450|3.0|Have you ever had someone who told you what you wanted to hear, and you were glad that they did? That's the best way I can describe my experience with this book.  Lucky for me that I read this as a motivational book that expanded my financial perspective. It is not a how-to guide, and I would probably lose my money if I tried to copy his examples. <BR>His advice on the rules of the game, how to view assets and liabilities, and the importance of financial literacy are necessary for the traditional &quot;work-hard and save&quot; crowd.<BR>However, a college education can be an advantage for anyone. Besides the book knowledge, you make invaluable contacts and set the foundation for getting a job that will provide investment capital. There are other nuggets of questionable advice. <BR>Learn what you can, but read between the lines. He is giving you a clinic on how to market, sell, and keep customers. Unfortunately, it is usually the talented ones that make it look easy.

B000000WA4|5.0|If you've ever had the honor of listening to this set of CDs, you'll know how life-changing this music is. One of the greatest features about this set of songs is that, even though it's probably not the Pumpkins' greatest (Siamese Dream is my personal vote on that one) it is one of the most varied collections by the same artist I've ever listened to, and one that showcases its diversity the best through the excellent progression of music through the tracks. When you listen to their music, it seems more than music- more like a relation to your own life, and on Mellon Collie you are sure to find something, from the rising orchestral melodies to the violent guitar solos to the vocals that only Billy Corgan could make into something so great, to heighten your mood and make you feel the music all the way down through your soul.
B0000696I0|5.0|Very seldom do sequels live up to their predecessors.  But, this is one of the few cases where the second installment of a franchise actually surpasses the original.  TMNT II is one wild, hilarious, action-packed ride from beginning to end.  The movie delivers plenty of what you'd expect from the awesome foursome.  The fight sequences are better performed while the comedy keeps the interest peaked and ready for more.  While searching for secrets of their origin, the half-shelled heroes are confronted with enemies both old and new as the Shredder returns armed with two new super mutants as he seeks revenge after his \\"demise\\" at the end of the first film.  All in all, the turtles' second outing is a smashing success and will definitely satisfy any fan of the series.  My only personal regret is the fact that we didn't get to see more of Super Shredder.  He was one awesome villian for one great movie!  Don't miss the DVD!!
0792846443|4.0|I saw this movie at a college theatre so the admission was free and since I had spare time to burn, I went in. Maybe I'm too cynical, but the plot mirrors that of The Butterfly Collector, except it is a psychotic woman doing the abducting instead of a psychotic man, and the abductee is a James Caan instead of a college girl. Read Butterfly Collector and you'll realize that Stephen King basically ripped it off, changed a few details, and gave it a happy ending. However, the film does do a good job at suspense so its not too bad. I gave it a 4 because it's not a bad film, but just saying...
020161622X|4.0|If you're already a pragmatic programmer, this book positively reinforces that which you probably already know (either innately or through experience ... but usually the latter), while drawing out many tidbits of knowledge that lie dormant in our subconscious.<br />If you're new to programming and lack the mentorship of a pragmatic programmer, read this book!  Be open to the ideas and absorb the wisdom.<br />I read this book cover-to-cover.  I found the content well-organized, and I appreciated the inclusion of exercises (with answers in the back) which tested my knowledge and assumptions.  The checklist and quick reference guide is also a nice touch.  Overall: an easy read.<br />As a final note, readers will find errata on the authors' website with the exception of the following:  Detracting from an otherwise excellent book are the glaring bugs in the answers to Exercises 7 and 8; specifically, the bison/yacc grammar and Perl code don't handle a range of valid input (e.g., &quot;12:30am&quot;).
B0000584V3|5.0|There is no better phrase to desribe this album than &quot;absolutely fabulous.&quot;  This CD is one of the best CDs that I have ever listened to.  This album displays Opeth's ability of Heavy Metal and a Neo-Classical expertise as one, together.  Blackwater Park album always reminds me of Led Zepplin in some ways.  Both bands have broke boundaries with an extreme heavy style of music during their days. and both bands maintain a classical style in most of their songs.  This album is &quot;pure genious.&quot;  Well anyways, I must part.  Untill Deliverance and Damnation are released, enjoy listening to Blackwater Park!  Rock on cyberspace!
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is a new look at an old subject.  English Society as seen from the view point of the household staff.  The period dress, accents and furnishings are very close to authentic.  Great movie watching if you are interested in background as well as the actors.  Maggie Smith is in rare form and brings her wonderful timing to scenes that would not be funny without her.<BR>If you have trouble with accents, watch it twice.  Each viewing brings fresh insight and better understanding.  I recommend this movie highly.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie could be classified in so many genres at the same time and get away with it.  There's such a wide range of emotion blended together perfectly.  Jake Gyllenhaal is one of those great actors that haven't been fully discovered yet and needs to be soon.  His portrayal as Donnie Darko couldn't have been played accurately by anyone else.  This part was made for him.  I don't even want to go into the movies scenario because it makes it so much better to watch without knowing.  When your done watching it, your shocked, then you try to understand it all.  Watch it two or three times to pick up underlying plots.  You must watch the DVD version to see the deleted scenes then the deleted scene's commentary.  It helps putting it in perspective.  It's one of those movies that you have to figure out it's true meaning on your own.  It's a Dark Comedy, Sci-Fi, Rebellious, indie-ish, thought provoking, coming of age, sad, horror, movie.  Just think of \\"Pi\\", Kevin Smith on a Bad Trip, \\"Dragon Fly\\", \\"Clockwork Orange\\", \\"Contact\\", \\"Final Destination\\", \\"Very Bad Things\\", and any Dean Koontz book put together.  WATCH IT.  Then ask your self, \\"what's your cellar door\\"?
B000024V8E|5.0|Enya is one of my favourites and this CD brings the best of her first albums together.  It also includes two songs not on any other album - &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; and &quot;Only If&quot;.  A great addition to a collection.  Enya's music is relaxing and inspirational.

0312265859|5.0|The last book I read by Evanovich, \\"7 UP\\" left me a little disappointed.  BUT, she came back in \\"Hard Eight!\\" The reason I read this series is for pure enjoyment. If you are looking for suspense or a thriller you won't find it here...what you will find is a contiuation of Steph's cars being stolen or blown up, dead bodies, people breaking into her apartment, Lula's and Grandma Mazur's zany humor as well as the on going sexual tension Steph has with Morelli and Ranger.  My favorite is the interaction between Steph and Morelli.  I can't get enough of those two!<br />In every book you will find new crazy chartacters.  In this book it is Albert Kloughn (clown), the rabbit, bear and men running around with Clinton and Nixon mask.  Valerie, Stephanie's sister showed up in \\"7 Up\\" and is continuing in \\"Hard Eight ... I'm thinking we will  see her develop more in upcoming story lines.<br />I won't recap the story again because other reviewers have done a wonderul job.  What I will say is ... if you want a quick enjoyable read ... this is the book for you. If need a \\"pick up\\" in your day ... \\"pick up\\" Evanovich and you won't go wrong.
0783225849|5.0|I saw this masterpiece when I was 12 years old and let me tell you,I've seen alot of horror movies in my lifetime and this is the one that still scares me at certain points.The first time I saw Psycho,I was bored during the first 30 minutes of it.Untill Janet Leigh(Marion)got lost in the rainstorm and found the Bates Motel and meets Norman Bates played greatly by Anthony Perkins.Hitchcock was the master of his time and still is in our time,out of all of Hitchcock's films that I've seen,I believe this is his finest work...I recommend this film not only to horror movie fans,but also to fans of both Hitchcock and Perkins and also for people like me who want to be film directors.One of the greatest movies ever made and my second favourite film ever.
0609610570|2.0|I listened to the unabridged version from Audible and got through half of it. Good subject, but disappointing. <br />From a presentation perspective, apparently all the authors narrated it and the different accents did not help to communicate the message. <br />Beyond the cosmetics, I felt the authors focused solely on an executive audience. As a member of corporate middle management, I found there was little &quot;meat&quot; I could take away for self-improvement. I have found better treatment of this subject from material from Peters and Blanchard some ten-plus years ago.
B000002HAF|5.0|SURFER ROSA, the Pixies' first full-length album, was a shot in the arm to indie rock. With its raw production, crazy songwriting, and cutting guitar riffs, it led the way to grunge (Kurt Cobain claimed \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was his attempt to rip off the Pixies). Best of all, the album was only the starting point for the Pixies, they got better and better as time went on.<br />Even though the Pixies raw sound came to be copied by every garage band around in the early 90's, from the very beginning of the album, as soon as Black Francis wails \\"This is a song for Carol\\" in \\"Bone Machine\\", it's obvious that this band is something unique. What other band has married oldies and punk rock so well as the Pixies in \\"River Euphrates\\"? Or shocked the listener so much as in \\"Gigantic\\"? Singer Charles Thompson a.k.a. Black Francis, bassist Mrs. John Murphy a.k.a. Kim Deal (who went on to form the Breeders), guitarist Joey Santiago, and drummer Dave Lovering had incredible chemistry together as a band, although the drumming occasionally (well, often) lacked talent.<br />With the exception of \\"Gigantic\\", Kim Deal's ode to childhood voyeurism, all of the songs were written by Black Francis. Listening to SURFER ROSA, one gets the impression that Mr. Thompson is not at all well. \\"Cactus\\" is a prison inmate's plea to his girlfriend to cut her hands on a cactus, wipe them on her dress, and send it to him to prove her love. \\"Tony's Theme\\" mocks a mentally-disabled man who thinks he's a superhero. In \\"Break My Body\\" the narrator invites aggressive sexuality, and \\"Vamos\\" has some lyrics that'll make you gasp once you stop singing alone and actually think about what they're saying. Track 11, the \\"Interlude\\" and the beginning of \\"I'm Amazed\\" have some charming in-studio banter. All of these songwritings elements, suprisingly, are disturbing, but rather make the Pixies seem more original and more consistent as a band.<br />For anyone wishing to get SURFER ROSA, I'd recommend obtaining the import, which has the \\"Come on Pilgrim\\" EP, their first release, tacked on to the end. Its highlight is the original version of \\"Vamos\\".<br />SURFER ROSA is the ideal introduction to the Pixies, but is only one of their four knock-out albums. Try DOOLITTLE after this one.he import, which has the \\"Come on Pilgrim\\" EP, their first release, tacked on to the end.

006092988X|2.0|I don't think I've been forced to read a book so poorly written. You would think Smith could put in at least a little plot and maybe a better point. This book is a dull read and not worth the time or money to buy.

I also give kudos to Robert Wise for trying to instead of having a lot of action, challenge us intelectually.<br />MOVIE:<BR>This is a slow paced movie that needed more substance for something of this length. But is still a decent movie if you have a open mind. I like this movie though more than ... Wrath of Kahn.

B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters Inc. looked like a really good animation movie when the commerical's were playing and when it finally came out in the theatres I had to see it the day it came out.The theatre was packed and I was looking forward to the movie.<br />When the movie started I was very happy and by the time it was over I was sad.The movie was extremly entertaining and it was funyn and it was touching and it was all perfectly combined to make one hell of a movie.I loved it so much about a month later I saw it for a second time with the \\"outtakes\\" and \\"deleted scene\\"which was very funny.<br />The plot was simple like all G rated movies.Mike and Sculley are two monsters living in Monstropolis and work for Monsters Inc.Monsters Inc. is a company filled with the doors to kid's bedrooms where the monsters go when there sleeping,scare them,and then collect there screams so they could get power in the town.Scully is Monsters Inc's top scarer and his rival Randell(voiced by Ghost World's Steve Buscemi)wants to take Scully down and become top scarer.One night Randell decides to do some late night scaring without anybody knowing.Scully stays late to to do some of Mike's paperwork and discovers the door.Scully goes inside the door and the little girl behind the door ends up into Monstropolis by accendent.Since monsters are afriad of children Scully runs in fear and Randell is left wondering where the kid behind the door is.Now Scully and Mike have to keep the little girl(who Scully named Boo)a secret or all of Monstropois will be in a panic.<br />The movie has humor for children and adults alike and the DVD adds to the fun.The DVD is supposed to have a short created just for the videa called \\"Mike's New Car\\".So see Monster's Inc if you already have not.It's a great movie.
B00000JPH5|4.0|For people who only know David Bowie via his music in the past 2 decades, the David Bowie in this film may be surprising.  However, if you know \\"The Man who Fell to Earth\\" and other of his earlier movies \\"Labyrinth\\" fits right along side of them.  I don't think the special effects are as good as other of Jim Henson's films and the ending is a bit too cheesy and vague for my strongest vote in this venue.  The lead actress is a bit mechanical at times but overall gives a strong believable performance as a teen with jealous toward a new sibling and stepmother.  I was impressed that what we see at the very beginning of the film is important at various times throughout it; movies need this level of inner complexity more often.
B000005J56|5.0|I'm not your typical Jazz listener and I can tell you that I enjoy this album a lot. The album presents the talents of my great musicians. It also functions as great background music when you have dinner guests. It is definitely in my top ten CDs.
B00000JPH4|5.0|Please, please do not see \\"puppets\\" on the jacket of this video and think you're little kids will adore it -- it will scare them.  However, adults who fondly remember Jim Henson's work and love a complete fantasy story should enjoy this.  We watch it about every 2 or 3 years and still find ourselves jumping at various times in the film.  At the end of the video there is a documentary about the making of it that those of you who want to know that sort of stuff will appreciate.  For the time it was made, \\"The Dark Crystal\\" was amazing.
B000067CPX|5.0|I can't even begin to say how much i am in love with this new album!  The sound is a new sound for the chili peppers...more passionate, soulful, and mature.  For those who have loved the chili peppers since day one, there are definately still elements of funk.  Frusciante, a true genius, wrote most of the music, so it's no wonder that the album is so mindblowing.  You can definately tell that their experiementing with new sounds.  For example \\"Cabron\\" has a Spanish flamenco sound to it.  Bottom line is once i bought the CD i couldn't stop listening to it!  It's definately worth every last penny!
6304466498|3.0|Why \\"satire\\"?  During the course of the movie there are several references made to the marketing of the movie as a movie, much to the confusion of the characters in it.  The film borrows largely from the Star Wars series but also Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, The Princess Bride, and a few lesser known sci fi and fantasy movies and television shows.  A lot the humor is crude and rude in nature.  Not one of Mel Brooks best movies but it can be a funny and mindless relaxation period unless you are easily offended by \\"bathroom\\" and sexual humor or you take your sci fi very seriously.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I have completely fallen in love with this show. I bought the DVD the second I found out about its existence. So what if I had already taped the entire season from television? The commentary and extra footage on the DVD were definitely worth it. This is a must-have for anyone who even remotely likes the legends of Superman, or has enjoyed an episode of Smallville.
B0000029DD|5.0|Even though Jeff is no longer with us, his music still lives on and &quot;Grace&quot; is enough proof of his talent and passion to music.  Jeff's voice was absolutely beautiful, radiant, and powerful.  I haven't heard such a haunting vocal performance as I have on &quot;Hallelujah&quot; and &quot;The Last Goodbye&quot; and those two songs make the album worth it.  The entire album is amazing and all of the songs are great, but it's just a shame he wasn't given the chance to amaze us with more wonderful albums.

0345350499|4.0|Who would have thought to ever tell the Arthurian legend from the feminine point of view? This book stands out because it has taken the many patriarchal re-tellings of the legend and told it from the feminine stance. Finally we can see, for good or for bad the enormous impact the women behind the throne had in the legends' trials and eventual bitter-sweet outcome. Women such as Viviane, Morgaine, Raven and all the other priestesses who devote their very lives to keeping a wise balance between the Goddess and Christian religions, thus blending it into a feminine struggle to keep its importance, honor and balanced worldview in an increasingly hierarchal and distinct masculine society. Though \\"The Mists\\" is told from the priestess point of view, it does not simply slam Christianity but actually subtly illustrates the moral myopia of both religions and the nonesense in enforcing both religious philosphies in running the affairs of state. At times, it seems to boast even an athiest opinion (told mainly through Lancelet but even all characters struggle with it). It is a beautifully told book of emotional love, betrayal and feminine and masculine themes. If anyone has ever hated Guinevere in the Camelot stories, you will despise her in this one as well as Lancelot. The main heroines may be Viviane - indeed a wise but sometimes ruthless priestess, her predecessor Morgaine who never quite gets it together but triumphs in her own way and in the first part of the book, Igraine, Morgaine's mom.\\"The Mists\\" show the various archetypes of femininity in a chilling turth - even the irritating, submissive one such as Gwenyfhar and uses itself as a mirror for all women. The men too are deeply developed characters and contrary to popular themes in \\"Women Rule\\" books, it actually does them justice too which is why I think it would benefit men also to read it. It is a novel of humanity, emphasizing masculine/feminine themes, forbidden love and religious differences. Despite what I consider to be a somewhat weak ending I highly recommend it - for 800+ pages it is the only book I have ever read which I could simply not put down.
B00000AFDW|2.0|Riding the crest of arguably the biggest rock and roll reunion in forever, KISS released 'Psycho Circus' the album that would prove they were more than just nostalgia and more than just four guys in greasepaint. It was supposed to be a Very Big Record.<br />It wasn't. For all the pomp and circumstance, 'Psycho Circus' just isn't a great record. A couple songs work, the title track especially but the rest of it seems to suffer from the same old problems most lesser KISS Records have -- inconsistent contributions from Gene, Peter and Ace and songs that need to have infectious hooks to mask their banality but don't quite manage that. <br />This album's self-indulgence doesn't help either. From Gene's self-serving 'We Are One' to the abysmal 'You Wanted the Best' where the band trades verses, this is an album of KISS celebrating themselves for all of us to see. But all it did was remind us that, whether they liked it or not, KISS was about fond memories more than current relevance. After a 'Psycho Circus' tour, KISS promptly went on their Retirement tour. It wasn't a coincidence.

B000001EIA|5.0|Songwriting is not something people frequently mention when talking about KISS.  Image first, then the tongue and, maybe, if you're lucky, they'll mention a tune or two.  But, really, KISS is a pretty solid rock and roll band and a show like 'Unplugged' does them a great service by letting them show that they CAN in fact strip down to just four musicians and their songs still hold up.<br />This is a great concert. From the opener 'Coming Home' to the eventual reunion of the original four, KISS rolls through their musical library, playing a lot of better but less known tracks. 'Sure Know Something' is a great song, one of the band's best and it works just as well here as it ever did (although watching the video it's easy to note Paul was reading the circular lyrics off a sheet.) KISS smartly avoided songs like 'Lick It Up' that wouldn't work in this environment and instead emphasized a handful of solid, entertaining tunes that rely on melody instead of arena bombast.<br />And, oh yeah, this is still the show where Ace and Peter joined Gene and Paul onstage together for the first time in forever and set the stage for the reunion of a lifetime. That this CD was able to capture THAT moment almost makes it worth the price right there.<br />A live record that truly shows off what the band is capable of as a band as much as a larger than life experience, 'Unplugged' is as important an album as 'Alive.'

B000062TU2|3.0|I watched this movie for once and I couldn't watch it anymore. When I tried to watch the 2nd time, it just got so boring and I almost felt asleep. Sure this movie was interesting at first and especially appealing to children but the story is just too strange and childish. Maybe the Harry Potter diehard fan and children might enjoy it more, but certainly any adult with some senses would agree with me. I would only recommend it to people who might be interested to get to know what this popular wizard Harry Potter is all about without reading the books. This movie might give them some ideas. But I certainly would suggest to rent it on video only, don't waste your money and anymore time with this one. So buyers beware!
B00005JKCH|5.0|I actually waited awhile to see this movie to avoid the lines. The movie is just awesome with great special effects and a nice story too. They really brought spiderman to life in this movie. I cant wait for the sequel!
0131103628|5.0|Trivia. Who was the man behind the C programming language? Simple, it's Dennis Ritchie. And so he gets down to writing a book along with Brian Kernighan - well done.<br /> This book was aimed basically at fellow programmers because this was the only book on C for a long time. So you will not find things like 'the + symbol stands for addition' in this book.<br /> An important aspect of this book is that it is easy to read, and will give the reader a good exposure to one of the most important programming languages of all time.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|I enjoyed the first blade movie even though it was kinda of gory. The sequel looks like it is even better then the first one with more action and special effects. I pre ordered it and looking forward to seeing it!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I'll try and be brief. David lynch, along with Peter Greenaway, is probably the best director of our time. Thanks to him, cinema really goes forward, introducing new and uncommon narrative and multi-dimensional characters.His fiction, then, gives us to try and reconstruct a plot, feelings and characters, which is a unique and wonderful experience.Grasping reality is not an easy matter. Instead of giving us straight forward answers and certainties, David Lynch, as a real artist,unveils the complexity of life and human relationships. I 'd also like to say how wonderful Naomi Watts is. She is the one who brings life to Betty, the multi-facets cornerstone character of 'Mulholland Drive'. This film is so different from what we are used to seeing, so subtle, clever and exciting that anyone owning a dvd player should buy it.
B00003ETOW|5.0|I watched this version of Jane Eyre in 1980 and can never forget about it since then. The main actor and actress may looker older than the charactors described in the book, but they are exactly the Rochester and Jane in my mind. Great performance by Scott.
B0000640VN|2.0|Have always been a Meg Ryan fan, but gave up on this one.<BR>The film has a great beginning, but after a while, the feeling is that it is too light and cute -- I lost interest in the characters, and didn't even bother to see the film to the end. (And this, from a Meg Ryan fan!)
B000008GEF|5.0|After the huge success of both \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Bangla Desh,\\" George's release of \\"Material World\\" might seem to be a disappoinment to many, but those that see it that way are not appreciating the difference between this and his previous recordings. Although the recordings started at EMI, they were eventually moved to Apple where the overall tone of the production would be a far cry from the Phil Spector bombast that made up \\"All Things Must Pass.\\" Using a small core of musicians, George goes to work on nine new songs and 2 old ones.(\\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" have already being written the previous year and \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" was an \\"All Things Must Pass\\" out-take). \\"Give Me Love\\" opens the disc and its really not an impressive cut at first. However, it does grow on you, especially Harrison's tastful guitar work. It was released as a single and made it to number 1. \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" is next with Harrison bemoaning the Beatles legal entanglements on a superfunky beat. A hot dobro lead by Harrison just adds to to the vitrol in his lyrics. \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" I could do without. A slow song whose lyrics, while good, are preachy--something that will dog this whole project. Capitol wanted this next song-\\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\" to be the single from the album. Its easy to see why: Nice beat, easy listening lyrics, a sure top 40 smash. \\"Who Can See It,\\" I've felt is an underrated Harrison song. Not really known for his voice, George really steps it up here and carries the song(especially in the chorus) with amazing feeling. The orchestration by John Barham, is subtle, giving the song more drama. The title track \\"Living in a Material World\\" is almost a Spector production. Again, more preachy than it has to be, the up tempo beat carries the song along while listening to tablas, 2 drummers, horn players and guitar solos building up to an impressive climax. \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" has nice fluid guitar playing by George with predictably preachy words. \\"Be Here Now\\" has more impressive guitar work by George(this album is full of George excelling on the six string)but the song is more of a drone and really doesn't go anywhere. If \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" sounds like a Spector production that's because it is. The story goes that the song was not up to snuff for \\"All Things Must Pass.\\" Then it was given to Spector's wife Ronnie to use. It didn't work for her so George took it back and wiped her vocals off and put his on and bingo, another album track. The song tries, but doesn't do anything as its not much of a tune. \\"The Day the World Gets Round\\" is again, preachy but George is so earnest about it, plus the tune and musicianship excell, so he carries it off. \\"That is All\\" closes the album with George doing what he does best: A love song. And just like the brillant love songs in his back cataloge, this one can join them with no shame.y preachy words. \\"Be Here Now\\" has more impressive guitar work by George(this album is full of George excelling on the six string)but the song is more of a drone and really doesn't go anywhere.

6302517036|5.0|I have been watching this movie for years, and every time I see it, the movie gets better and better each time. The story plot revolves around a teen boy who is just a normal teenage boy, and one of his main interests is in horror movies, invoving one of his favorite movie characters. The boy, named Charlie, has a girlfriend, named Amy, and a good friend named Ed, or \\"Evil\\". Charlie lives with his mother in a typical suburban neighborhood, and starts to notice something strange about his new next door neighbor, Jerry, who is very attractive, in a dark and mysterious way. Charlie begins to realize that suspicions he had about his new neighbor, and his live in carpenter, who is equally attractive as Jerry,  are now becoming a reality, and that his new neighbor, is a vampire. The movie gives you quite a scare, and yet, is also comical at times. This movie is one of my all time favorite movies, and is a great movie if you are ready to go on a fantasy journey. The movie really has something for everyone, and I will always love this movie. The all star cast is fabulous, and very entertainging. If there was a rating of 10 million stars times a zillion, this movie would get it! I know that sounds corny, however, thats how much I recommend this!
B000002BSG|3.0|I purchased this album back in 1998 after falling in love with the video for \\"Alright\\". The song was hittin', the post-disco '80s R&B feel and sharp percussion along with lead singer Jay Kay's soulful falsetto, \\"Alright\\" was the perfect example of a band realistically paying homage to music of an era while keeping it up to par with modern overtones. <br />The rest of Jamiroquai's 1997 \\"Travelling Without Moving\\" has that same theme. An electic set highlighted by Jay Kay's Stevie Wonder-ish/ Michael Franks-esque voice and sharp intrumentation,\\"Travelling\\" starts off perfectly with \\"Virtual Insanity\\", a sharp song talking about the complications of technology. And of course there was the celebrated, techinally impressive video with lauded Jamiroquai with short-term love from MTV and the mainstream pop auidence (this album went platinum in the US thanks to that video's exposure). The album version here has a cool interlude that wasn't included on the video version. The playful \\"Cosmic Girl\\" has a happy vibrancy that's infectious, this was too a big hit for Jamiroqaui in the states. But it's the lush and sincere soul ballardy of \\"Everyday\\" that will show folks that Jay Kay is not merely a white soul pretender. \\"Everyday\\"'s sweet strings and dense drums make for a winning combination, it's a very accessible track as well. Of course there's the aforementioned \\"Alright\\" as well as the cautious \\"High Times\\" and the easy going \\"You Are My Love\\". Not to mention the reggae ease of \\"Drifting Along\\", when \\"Travelling Without Moving\\" hits, it HITS! <br />But along the way...the album seems to sag but the first half is very on-point. Jamiroquai would later take a beating from fans, critics, and the mainstream auidence that embraced them after \\"Virtual Insanity\\" when they went onto to record more redundant disco-influenced music with their next two albums yet \\"Travelling Without Moving\\" showcases an electic band who uses their pop smarts to good sense. Recommended.
B000065U1N|5.0|Alright, i am a military buff, and i know a good portrayl of a war or battle when i see it. Black hawk down is the story of 100 U.S. soldiers who were sent into mogadishu Somalia to extracate one of the warlords who had the taken over part of the city. We were outnumbered 10 to 1, and only the bravery and courage of our fighting military allowed us to prevail. After 2 black hawk helicopters went down, the soldiers were forced to fight non stop until help could arrive. In the end only 19 of our men were lost, to their 1000. Josh Hartnett gives a good portrayl of a cool, calm, and collected Sergeant Eversby. There were many outstanding supporting roles as well. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a true to rights war story.
B000000HHE|4.0|I was going to become to a certified madman if I heard one more time about how brillant De La Soul's \\"3 Feet And Rising\\" was so earlier this year I brought the newly remastered edition of this much-celebrated hip hop milestone(?). <br />It's suprisingly that hip hop headz at the time who were weened on the nilistic, violent LA gangsta rap of NWA and the urgent, consious grooves of Public Enemy embraced De La and \\"3FAR\\" like they did since this album was so [darn] QUIRKY!! This is one hip hop album that happily colors outsides the lines. Offbeat humor, strange rhymes, and eccentric and smattered samples abound. Unlike the stone-faced aderaline of NWA and PE, De La Soul were happily offbeat, happy, and friendly. They were surburban kids with two much time on thier hands. They didn't know anything about Compton or South Bronx but they did know how to be very whimiscal though. <BR>Produced by Prince Paul, \\"3 Feet\\" begins with the classic game show-parody intro and into the gleeful \\"The Magic Number\\" with it's multiple samples and scrathes. The quirky DJ strach-a-thon \\"Cool Breeze On The Rocks\\" which features snippets of everything from Michael Jackson's \\"Rock With You\\" to Gregory Abbott's only hit \\"Shake You Down\\" to a Run-DMC track.<BR>\\"Eye Know\\" with it's Steely Dan sample and \\"Say No Go\\" with the Hall & Oates lift(\\" I Can't Go For That(No Can Do)\\") actually went left and sampled far more abstract sounds away from the James Brown samples everyone else was using at the time. <BR>The hilarious \\"Take It Off\\" (Take that jheri curl off/ TAKE IT OFF!!) and \\"Transmitting Live From Mars\\" which sets a obscure French instructional record to a Turtles sample is just so offbeat and odd, you get the punchline. \\"De La Orgee\\" will crack you up as well! But the crossover hit \\"Me Myself & I\\" and the classic Native Tonuges posse-cut \\"Buddy\\" also can't be forgotten.<br />Like PE's flawless Bomb Squad-constructed beats, De La Soul's music was like a collage of sounds and influences. Veryclever. Although they'd fight off the label, the men of De La Soul were widely called hippies after this album came out. As a result, De La (who believe it not toured as an opening act for NWA!) released the darker and even more offbeat \\"De La Soul Is Dead\\" in 1991. Although, I found De La's brand of hip hop to be a little too quirky for my taste \\"3 Feet And Rising\\" is a hip hop classic that shows how hip hop used to be diverse, vast, and risk-taking.
B00000IQMT|5.0|John Williams did it again! Duel of Fates is truly a one of a kind masterpiece.The duel of fates,the droid battle,the flag parade,panaka and the queen's protectors,the droid invasion,Qui Gon's Noble end, and Augie's great Munsical Band are just some of my favorites.Mabey Jar Jar was annoying, but this soundtrack is not.If your a H-U-G-E Star Wars fan like me,\\"Then this c.d. is your destiny\\".
B000002KO3|5.0|Talking Heads after studying African music, repetition, and American funk decided that they would put their hands in it as well and what we recieved is this 1980 classic that mixed the Talking Heads' uncanny, quirky lyrics with some funky arrangements. It's classic and proved that you can be funky and smart at the same time.<BR>\\"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)\\" is a gem. With it's African-like repetion, funky bass line, and funky syncopation along with David Bryne's offbeat yet thought provoking lyrics. \\"I'm not a fighting man/I'm a tumbler!\\"...<br />\\"Crosseyed and Painless\\" featuring Bernie Worell on keyboards (Worell's known for his work with the Parliment/Funkadelic) is TOO funky! Nona Hendryx is credited as singing background on this song (she'd later duet with Talking Heads' bassist Tina Weymouth). \\"Once In A Lifetime\\", familiar since it was a big early MTV hit and featured in ads for the 2000 film \\"The Family Man\\" is a danceable classic with brainy lyrics that again, sound nonesical yet have some eccentric meaning. \\"Houses In Motion\\" is yet another funky cut with clever vocal arrangment and snapping percussion breaks. The Brian Eno-helmed closer \\"The Overload\\" is a droner...yet balances out the funky sounds of the rest of the LP.<br />Talking Heads-David Bryne, Jerry Harrison, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth- were geniuses. True originals and \\"Remain In Light\\" is a classic. It's surprising that the very funky sounds of \\"Remain\\" didn't catch onto Black radio in the early 1980s but then again, it comes to no real suprise. <BR>\\"Remain In Light\\" is the type of album that you must run and buy if your local record shop is to be fire. It's a must-have.
0312265859|4.0|Too close to real life, Stephanie is becoming mundane with age. It's hard to imagine why not just one but two hunks repeatedly come to her rescue when she shows no resourcefulness, self esteem or self control over her burgeoning appetite. While this book was entertaining, Stephanie was not. This series is read for escapism, so crank up the heat and give Stephanie back her spunk and soul.
0471413909|4.0|In watching my sister endure the merry-go-round of Atkins, I think Cordain's 'Paleo Diet' makes a lot more sense.<br />His proposal of fresh, natural foods and omitting grains, sugars and salt makes much more sense than consuming heinous quantities of saturated fatty meats and expecting pounds to shed without consequences. I am much more intrigued by this book than the ramrod approach of gurus like Atkins and, I think, this is the ONE diet plan I will be very happy to try out for real.<br />I would have to agree that the pre-cultivation diet was likely more healthy than the cereal-based diet that began some 10,000 years ago. This grain-based diet has created [my opinion] havoc and its effects have made itself felt since.<br />Another reviewer cited that this will likely offend everyone. I know very well that the purveyors of all grain-based items will be screaming at what is proposed in this book. They will have fewer buyers if more will take on this lifetime eating plan and will lose money. Some reviewers have correctly brought up the kinds of meat permitted. Dr. Cordain advocates free-range and grass-fed but a budget like mine won't permit this luxury. I'll have to settle for plain ol' storebought in that department. Any nastiness from chemical buildup I think will pale compare to what would be there if I didn't omit grains, sugars and salt.<br />If it honestly works [don't see where it cannot] Dr. Cordain will have another very happy convert. Then, my only concern will be in convincing my relations that Atkins is more detrimental in the long-run than going back to paleo-foods.
B00006FXB6|5.0|having bought this album from hearing good things from others and hearing samples of a couple of songs, i'd recommend this to people. i think you have to like this sort of music to like  this album. but if you do, you should love it! it got great guitar riffs, some thoughtful lyrics and its full of little suprises. personal favourites of mine are hanging tree which can also be found on the desert sessions 7&8, go with the flow, everybody's gonna be happy, which is a cover and no one knows! they just make me want to rock out and sing along. this is why i recommend it. just check out a few songs 1st on download and if you like them buy the rest of the album. if you didn't you'd be missing out on some great music :)
B000002I2G|4.0|Yeah, so this is the album where the Doors went into the studio and a dozen musicians followed them.  Horns, strings, sax.  Let's face it, folks, every band ends up doing it at one point or another.  Even Zeppelin got strings involved.<br />I can understand the reaction some people had to this album.  To put this on for the first time and hear the horns and strings of Tell All the People (which Morrison hated) and lyrics like \\"where milky babies seem to be\\" must have been horrifying for some fans who loved it when the band was \\"underground\\".  Nevertheless, now it's great to hear a band try something different and make it work.  And for the detractors, well, at least this album would lead to 2 great comeback records: Morrison Hotel and LA Woman, both rock classics.<br />With this album Morrison does only half the songwriting.  Krieger provides the lighter fare, including the classic hit Touch Me.  Though never performed live, Shaman's Blues is an excellent tune, a jazzy, skipping song with enigmatic lyrics.  Definitely has a strong Manzarek influence.  Wild Child is a solid rocker, and The Soft Parade is the albums epic fare.  Wishful Sinful is a plain beautiful song, period.  It's also the one piece where the strings and winds are essential.<br />There was a point when this was my favorite Doors album.  It's the most different, but I think it showed that they could do other things and that they had a lot of imagination.  Sure, they had problems recording the album, it was delayed, it came in the wake of the disastrous and tide-changing Miami affair...but remove it from the time for a moment and appreciate it as a playful, fun album that uses some trendy arrangements.  It was only a matter before the band broke out the string section.  It's called paying rock dues.
0792839730|5.0|As a boy, after seeing the 'making of' documentary I had to see the film. I'd always liked war films, but this came out on top. Until then, I didn't know anything about Market Garden, but afterwards it sparked a real interest in the subject, resulting in much reading and research, interviewing veterans and many trips to Arnhem.<br />It's a fast paced blockbuster of a film with a great cast and gives a fairly good all round account of the Operation. It sits high up there with 'The Great Escape', 'The Battle of Britain', 'The Longest Day' and all of the other Second World War classics. It's definitely one to own.<br />I must say however, that since the benchmark film 'Saving Private Ryan, the mini-series 'Band of Brothers', the advances in special effects and cinematography, a film just dedicated to the British and Polish involvement is long overdue. In light of the many books and autobiographies covering the subject, a film made in this style I believe would give the audience an idea as to how bitter the fighting actually was, the complexity of the Operation and the bravery of the Dutch people.
6301640659|2.0|Simply stated, Cruising looks like a serious career-killer for any filmmaker or actor. Try to imagine a major American director pulling this off today. Might be possible, but for William Friedkin this was an atomic bomb.<br />Interesting and very telling - not long after the release of this film Friedkin had a heart attack and began to re-examine his life and career. He became less intense.<br />This is a film that just had me asking, \\"What was he thinking?\\" It's not even that it's bad--there are far, far worse films that are less watchable. Friedkin is a great technical director. Even when his films don't work they're still compelling to watch. There's a documentary style that he employs in his work (stemming from his early career in TV and docu-drama) as well as excellent locations and art direction. It's just that Cruising is...very strange indeed.  After reading quite a bit about the film and the pains it took to produce, it's apparent that Friedkin was DETERMINED to make it, no matter what. It was definitely the work of an angry, self-destructive man who had to get his way, no matter what the cost. I believe Friedkin knew this film would bomb and boy, did it. He knew the movie would hurt him and his credibility, but he fought on, attacked by the Village Voice, picketed on location, and blasted in the press by critics.<br />Cruising is more valuable as a career statement on Friedkin than as the cop-murder-drama it purports to be. Al Pacino, sporting a jaw-droppingly bad perm(!) goes undercover in NYC's West Village to hunt a killer who preys on leather-bar patrons. The film delves into the world of gay leather S&M, and it drew such hatred from gay communities that a disclaimer was added at the beginning. It states that the portrayal of the gay crowd in the film is not typical of the entire gay community blah blah blah, but make no mistake, I think Friedkin was out to shock peolpe. I think Friedkin wanted to be the bad guy and bring the house down around him.<br />A working director who struck gold with The French Connection, Friedkin followed up that classic with The Exorcist, still considered the top horror film. After that he had free reign...and so he chose to make an incredibly difficult film in Sorcerer. A great remake of the French classic The Wages of Fear, that film was grittier and visually amazing. It didn't grab audiences. Friedkin made The Brinks Job next as a kind of makeup, but then he chose Cruising. And Friedkin has never really recovered.<br />To be honest, this film has a gritty look. There are some creepy moments. There is atmosphere. Apparently the original print had an amazingly intricate sound mix, constructed partially by Friedkin himself, but unfortunately this is not present on the VHS version. Pacino looks like he's somewhere else in this film. Still to this day he doesn't talk about Cruising in interviews. Friedkin admit that he's wrong for the part. Otherwise we get dependable, somber support from Paul Sorvino while Karen Allen has little to do as Pacino's girlfriend.<br />This is a whodunit where we never know who dun it! The movie is so ambiguous about the murderer that the resolution is irrelevant in the face of the overwhelmingly seedy atmosphere. Are there 2 killers? Or is there only 1? Is Al Pacino gay? Is he a killer? Is the killer gay? Why is there a cop wearing a cowboy hat and only a jockstrap in the police station, slapping witnesses? What on earth is going on?<br />Plain and simple, William Friedkin lost his mind for a while when he made this. I think he's much better now. Pacino managed to recover from the perm, but this is some kind of dark period for him.<br />Recommended for die-hard Friedkin fans, otherwise most will want to avoid.  Even die-hard Pacino fans may not want to see Michael Corleone learning the meaning of different colored hankerchiefs in one's back pocket.../>A working director who struck gold with The French Connection, Friedkin followed up that classic with The Exorcist, still considered the top horror film.

B00006AW2F|5.0|...<BR>I consider myself very knowledgeable on the history of this band, and can pretty much tell what albums these were left off just by the production or little nuances such as instruments featured. This disc, in particular I have listened to many times, so I'm not casual in my assesment of it. <BR>This collection of outtakes and such was from within the first 8 years of the Stones as a recording band. Without question  this was their most prolific period, and given the Stones incredible penchant for writing, their musical prowess as innovators and taking chances with stylistic experiments; basically the Stones  with the Beatles and Bob Dylan drove the ship of popular music in the 60's like no others. Considering the output of the Stones, there were bound to be tracks that would not make it onto their lp's. Considering the number of discs they put out by 1970, and the quality of their output, most of the songs on Metamorphosis are of superb quality. One thing you can't critiscize the Stones for was their inspired pursuit of a variety of records representing different genres. Some of the songs on this are downright pop (Out of Time, Each and Every Day of the Year and I'd Much Rather Be with the Boys), country or country blues (Somethings Just Stick in your Mind, Heart of Stone), and the bluesy, soulful sound that no white rock group could do quite like them (Jiving Sister Fanny, Try a Little Harder and I'm Going Down). Then there are two cuts I particularly like here that have the Stones stamp all over them....those kind of dark, yet catchy numbers the defy description like Family and Memo from Turner. I've loved this record since it came out back in '75, and  thanks to Andrew Loog Oldham for releasing it in the first place, even if it was to make a little money fer 'imself.<BR>While I think this might be more of a record for serious fans of the Stones, especially of the years Brian Jones was still around, this album would have stood on its own as a studio releasefrom the 60's. If you get it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

0316666343|4.0|A really great read.  The writer keeps you hooked from beginning to end.  Ok. the ending is somewhat contrived but who cares;  it's good to feel good for a change.  And the quality of the writing, the wonderful characters and the overall sense of humor more than makes up for it.
B00006DEFA|4.0|Some of the earlier postings on this list have included comments that the MPAA rating as listed by Amazon is incorrectly given as \\"R.\\"  The \\"R\\" rating is accurate; the Director's Cut of \\"Amadeus\\" includes over 20 minutes of additional footage, and when the Director's Cut was screened for the MPAA, it was rated \\"R\\" (the original version was rated \\"PG\\").  The Director's Cut, which I saw last spring when it was shown in NYC, includes a scene in which Mozart's wife disrobes in front of Salieri; I assume this is the reason for the new rating.
B000069CWE|4.0|Ok, i am a heavy metal fan, attracted to Linkin Park's lyrics, beats and metal influences.  I have listend to hybrid theory proabably more times then healthy, and when I heard about Reanimation, i began to get psyched for something new.  I was extremely dissapointed to learn that it would be nothing but remixes with a few new things thrown in, the first one was short enough.  Because i enjoyed the first album so much, however, i bought the album and was not extremely dissapointed.  The metal influence is virutally non existant, sold to a much more hip hop oriented version of some of my favorite songs ever.  This, at first, made me cringe...but by saying that i didn't like it would be a lie.  After getting over my own stigma, i determined that this album is pretty good...i miss the moods and music from Hybrid Theory, and hope upon hope that this isn't the new linkin park, and that this sustains its role as a remix album.<br />The new lyrics and singers add a new element to each song, giving enough change to have somethin new to listen to...As mentioned in another review, if your new to linkin park, go for Hybrid Theory...if not, this album is pretty good, i dont regret spending the money.
0061020710|5.0|This is a great book. I laughed all the way to the end. The book is so fast to read that I had to buy the next ones to look for more. I hope the next is even better.
B0000027I6|5.0|This album is, hands down, Roger Waters' best solo work. I would go so far to say that it even rivals The Wall. Like The Wall, the album has a single collective message/concept behind it, one that is meant to stimulate the listener's thinking. I interpret it as saying that the human race is slowly destroying itself; the lyrics in the last song \\"Amused to Death\\" elude heavily to this. Waters develops this idea through songs that discuss the elements of society that are bringing us to our doom, such as organized religion (\\"What God Wants, Parts I, II, and III\\"), war and the military (\\"The Bravery of Being Out of Range, Late Home Tonight, Parts I, and II\\"), repression of free thought and speech (\\"Watching TV\\"), and failure to learn from our history(\\"Perfect Sense, Part I\\"). Despite all the negativity, Waters does offer occasional glimmers of hope for us (something he's done more of in recent years), such as in \\"It's A Miracle\\" and perhaps (depending on how you interpret it) the closing monologue in \\"Amused to Death\\" (a continuation of the one in \\"The Ballad of Bill Hubbard; turn the volume up to hear it). The lyrics are consistently thought-provoking, occasionally depressing, but overall amazingly beautiful and clever. Musically, most of the songs are very relaxing. Perhaps this was Waters' intent, to relax the listener so he/she could take in the album's message and think about it more easily. As in his past solo works, Waters employs the talents of several legendary musicians, namely guitarists Jeff Beck and Don Henley. Beck doesn't play the usual style of rock guitar he's known for; his solos are much more reminiscent of David Gilmour, and almost as impressive and creative. The album does have a distinct Pink Floyd style to it, with many of the same musical elements (i.e. the Hammond organs, the trio of female backing vocalists, etc.). However, it does have a more \\"progressive\\" feel to it; Waters employs some sounds and effects that were more characteristic of the time that album was written (1992). A couple ending points,if you don't own a Roger Waters solo album yet, I highly recommend you buy this one first. While his others are also excellent works, this one is easily the best value for your money. And when you do buy it, set aside a spare hour and 20 minutes where you can listen to the whole thing uninterrupted. Like The Wall, all of the songs are great, but each becomes significantly better if you listen to the album all the way through.
B00004TRD8|4.0|Seven years after the original Terminator took the world by storm we are presented with the sequel. <br />Los Angeles, 1994. Sarah Connor has given birth to her son John, but due to the traumatic past, she's incarcerated in a mental hospital. <BR>From the distant future, a highly advanced Terminator is sent to assassinate John. At the same time the human resistance also transports an older reprogrammed Terminator to protect John. <BR>Unsuspecting, the young John and his guardian Terminator find themselves in a relentless struggle for survival. <br />What makes Terminator 2 such a landmark is it's special effects, which are simply out of this world. The seemingly indestructable killer cyborg, the T-1000, consists of liquid metal and mere words can't do it's beauty justice. <BR>Spectacular, all the way through! The reason I don't rate this movie 5 stars is simply because I was still more impressed with the original. There are a few glaring contradictions in the time-traveling storyline, more apparent than in the original movie.  Also, this sequel lacks the sinister dark feeling that made it's predecessor so special. <br />Terminator 2 lacks the sophistication of the original, but even ten years after it's release there's absolutely no denying it's beauty.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is the best CD I have.. I listen to it at least twice a day, front to back. You never get sick of the songs... Serj and the other guys in the band are really saying something in the songs, not just useless cursing like some other hard rock/metal bands!! yay i love this CD!!
B000067CQK|5.0|...This album, one of the greatest in my opinion, has never sounded better. The lush strings on \\"Starman\\" are just amazing, and never has Bowie's acoustic guitar sounded more angelic.<BR>   I think it was a good decision to put the orginal tracks on one cd and the bonus material on another. It preserves the experience of the original recording, as well as lets you catch your breath! You need a moment of silence after such an incredible album. The bonus material immediately following such an amazing closing song as \\"Rock and Roll Suicide\\" would almost lessen its effect and power.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold's stunning debut novel, \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" carries an extraordinary emotional wallop.  This deeply affecting work treats the desperate sadness which innundates a family after experiencing traumatic loss.  All the more remarkable is the author's creative use of voice; her protagonist, Susie Salmon, narrates and analyzes events after her brutal death.  Through Sebold's magnificent descriptive writing, her exceptionally believable use of dialogue and her moving, sympathetic portrait of a family suffused with grief, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" becomes transcendent in its exploration of death, loss and recovery.<br />Riveting chracterization allows \\"Bones\\" to not only present a compelling story but to permit the reader an uncommon identification with the fascinating, evocative people who populate the novel.  The aforementioned Susie Salmon, whose corporeal life was extinguished as a result of a ghastly rape and murder, simultaneously oberserves and surreptitiously interacts with her family.  As she undertakes life in heaven, which is remarkably fluid and liberating, she also watches each member in her family absorb the terrible blow of her death.<br />How the Salmon family responds to Susie's death emerges as the single greatest achievement of \\"Bones.\\"  Losing a daughter or sister to an unexpected, violent death (and suffering the crushing indignity of never having her body found) shatters family coherence and induces a kaleidescopic series of responses.    Sebold writes with assurance as she elicits reader empathy with the stricken parents, Jack and Abigail.  Mother and father follow different paths as grief, anger and remorse overtake them; Sebold's description of marital stress and parental guilt are soaring examples of a writer who understands the complexities of the human heart.  Susie's siblings, Lindsey and Buckley, also experience the death of their sister distinctly.  Supporting characters advance the central themes of knowledge, responsibility and transcendence gracefully.<br />It is a rare thing for a writer to combine emotion and intellect as beautifully as does Alice Sebold in \\"The Lovely Bones.\\"  She entices us with a vision of heaven that challenges the \\"wings and harps\\" version; her heaven is dynamic, expansive and multifaceted.  Her treatment of the irrevocable sense of loss an unexpected death visits on a family soars; the emotional impact of this special novel resonates with sensitive truth.  With such compassionate, provocative and profound treatment of the theme of existential search for meaning after a safe, predictable life disappears, Alice Sebold's initial offering is thrilling evidence of a stirring voice in American literature.
078322172X|4.0|a pretty good movie, good acting, great atmosphere.  an earlier reviewer asked a couple of questions.  one was how the psychiatrist recognized the Willis character?  it was from the picture of the WW1 soldier, the one she shows Willis later on.  the other was about the scientist on the plane.  that's the scientist who comes back from the future to get the information about the virus.  she can't stop the epidemic since the madman has already released the virus at the airport security check.  she can only gather information to fight the disease in the future.<br />and finally, i never knew madeleine stowe was such an attractive woman!  yowsa-yowsa-yowsa!
0380789035|4.0|Neil Gaiman understands mythology.  He understands how our stories and legends are a part of us, part of our psyche.  They are not merely ways to pass the time or simple children's fancies used to explain thunder or why a snake has no legs, etc.  He also understands that our legends and myths need to change with the times.  American Gods is a vastly entertaining story of old Gods, brought to this country with its immigrants, indentured servants and slaves.  These Gods are fading, and newer, menacing Gods of technology & entertainment are rising to prominence, and a war is brewing.  Through the story of Shadow, who starts out an an observer and ends up becoming a major part of the struggle, we are shown the majesty, mystery, and dark power of our icons, totems, and avatars.  Humorous, chilling, and packed full of imagination, American Gods is a wonderful mix of fantasy and a terrifying exploration of our national consciousness and the mythical figures that give it form and life.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Thanks in large part to director Guillermo del Toro, \\"Blade 2\\" is a whiz-bang sequel. [The original was directed by Stephen Norrington.] It may be just a testosterone-laden movie aimed squarely at young males, but at least it's finely crafted and not without a touch of style. As for substance, forget substance. It's based on a comic book and, if the characters all behave in a cartoonish way, perhaps that's on purpose. <br />As for the special effects, \\"Blade 2\\" has some creatures that are genuinely scary. When these mutant vampires take a bit out of you, they don't kid around. <br />The script is absurd and full of plot holes. Blade [Wesley Snipes], half man, half vampire, now faces a new enemy - a new kind of vampire that is unaffected by most of the conventional weapons used against such creatures, Even the purebred members of Vampire Nation enlists his aid because these monsters are out to get them, too. The script, though, is just a framework on which is built a series of dazzling, adrenaline-pumping fight sequences, all fought on fairly ingenious and properly creepy sets. <br />\\"Blade 2\\" is strictly for the boys. It's a bad choice for a date movie. Frankly, it's not really my kind of movie. I'm more intrigued by character-driven fare. Still, it's only fair to admit that, for what it is, this is very good entry in the horror genre.
B000067DNC|5.0|I love the episodes from Season 2 of Stargate and FINALLY to get them on dvd is fantastic.  The episodes that are included are some of the best from this series.  It's been a while since I've seen these episodes and it's fun being able to view them again and celebrate what a wonderful show this was!
B000002AVF|5.0|This album may be old but it's classic. Although these songs were released years ago they are not outdated by any standard. They have a great style that is still popular today. Mariah's talent and vigorous spirit are evident, especially in my personal favorite \\"Open Arms\\". This album is not just for those who went through high school in the eighties and loved this album when it came out in '95, but continues to affect younger generations. Mariah is timeless.
B000002GBD|5.0|Nazareth really pulled it all together on this one. HAIR OF THE DOG contains the roots of bands like Guns 'N' Roses and Nirvana.Granted, I could do without \\"Love Hurts\\" (which wasn't on the UK version of the album), but the title track and \\"Beggar's Day\\" more than make up for it, as do \\"Miss Misery\\", \\"Whiskey Drinkin' Woman\\", and several other songs. One of the most influential 70s albums ever.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The history of the corleone family changed our way of viewing the mobsters thanks to the incredibly talent of mario puzo of writing the story and the one of francis ford coppola taking it to the movies
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Aside From LIGHTS OUT, and OBSESSION, this is the ultimate UFO experience. The two extra tracks are terrific, the songs are back in proper order, and some between-songs jokes have been restored to this expanded version. The band was white-hot that night in Chicago, and the audience reaction is incredible. If you don't already own this CD, run- do not walk- and pick it up immediately.
B00005B36H|5.0|If you say \\"progressive rock\\" these days, almost everyone thinks of Dream Theater.  Yeah, I like them, but their emphasis seems to be more on instrumental prowess than creating moods.  Tool is more the latter kind of band, sort of like a modern-day Pink Floyd.<br />Lateralus is a great record to space out to, but I did have to listen to it a few times to really get the most from it.  There are entire tracks on this CD that I can't hear in my car!  It's best to sit down in your home and put it on your stereo, or even listen to it with headphones.  This disc displays a lot more emotional depth than previous Tool albums, and Danny Carey's percussion is amazing throughout.<br />There are a few spots where they seem to be doing weird stuff just for the sake of doing weird stuff (\\"Faaip de Oiad,\\" for instance), but overall this is Tool's best work to date.  My favorite tracks, pretty much in order:  \\"Reflection,\\" \\"Lateralis,\\" \\"Schism,\\" \\"The Grudge.\\"
B000062XFG|5.0|In the second season we lost Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to Starfleet Medical.  In reality, the shows producers felt her character wasn't working out.  Thank god we get her back in the third season.  Not that I didn't like Dr. Pulaski, I just didn't feel her character was working out.  We begin to see where The Next Generation is going in this season, although at this point it still hadn't caught it's running legs.  They hadn't completely worked out the terminology, the uniforms and the general feel of the show.  I've read that a lot of people didn't like the Wesley Crusher character, I guess I'm one of those few that did.  I think he added to the family atmosphere.  Some shows that highlighted the season in my opinion:<br />Elementary, Dear Data<BR>Loud as a Whisper<BR>A Matter of Honor<BR>The Measure of a Man<BR>Contagion<BR>Time Squared<BR>The Icarus Factor<BR>Q Who<BR>The Emissary<br />In my opinion, the first seasons loss of Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) was a loss to the show.  Her loss did give the producers the extra room to begin concentrating several shows throughout the seasons on Worf.<br />Overall a good season that starts to give us a good idea of how good The Next Generation will become.
0440217563|4.0|Like the first two books, I completely enjoyed this one. I do a lot of driving about in my busy life, so listen to Davina Porter reading Gabaldon's words. Her voice is miraculous. I would easily travel and pay to take voice lessons from her. Were I reading the printed edition I would have been flipping pages and looking things up, however. It seemed that there were two conflicting references to the date of Jillian's travel through the stones, but I haven't double checked. Also, a bit of carelessness by this usually careful author surprised me. Claire is remembering sitting and reading to the little girl, Brianna. As she reminisces she wistfully recites, \\"One fish two fish, red fish blue fish.\\" Hmm. I am of Brianna's generation and Dr. Seuss was not available to me, so I was curious about this reference, and looked it up. My source asserts that \\"One Fish Two Fish, Red Fish Blue Fish\\" was not published until 1960. By my calculations Brianna would have been a pre-teen or, perhaps, even a teenager by then. I feel certain Claire would have been reading to and exploring literary adventures with her daughter at this point; however, I must wonder how she could have been reading \\"One fish two fish...\\" I also agree with the reviewer who suggests that inherent in the review of any book is the responsibility to not give away plots and delicious secrets that make the reading all the more fun. So, I am avoiding that one in February 2002. I think it should be stricken, along with a few later ones written by other reviewers who seem unable to laud the book without giving away too much and, thus, spoiling the adventure for others. \\"Other People's Children\\" is another one read by D. Porter, and is wonderful. Happy reading/listening.
B000063V8R|5.0|From the beginning of the third season to the very last show of season 7, \\"All Good Things,\\", TNG is now running at full stride.  In the Hiatus between seasons two and three, the shows producers made some very good and very important changes.  They hired Michael Piller, who from then on showed what a consistently good writer can do.  They finally got rid of the terrible spandex uniforms, which from what I've read were actually causing the actors physical problems.  They changed the main title, lead in for the show.  Overall there were a great many wonderful scenes/episodes to come out of the third season!  Some of the shows that really made the season:<br />The Ensigns of Command<BR>Who Watches the Watchers? (One of the top shows of the series)<BR>Booby Trap<BR>The Enemy<BR>The Vengeance Factor<BR>The Defector<BR>The High Ground<BR>Deja Q<BR>Yesterday's Enterprise<BR>The Offspring<BR>Sins of the Father<BR>Allegiance<BR>Captain's Holiday<BR>Hollow Pursuits<BR>Sarek<BR>Menage A Troi<BR>The Best of Both Worlds Part 1<br />With Best of Both Worlds, we received the first and inarguably the best cliffhanger of the entire series.  If you were like myself, watching these shows every week as they came out.  You were probably in agony over the summer to see the season four opener and find out if they got Captain Picard back.  This like all the other seasons is worth the hefty price for the DVD.  In addition to having all the wonderful shows, there are plenty of extras.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I don't have time to write a long totally thru and thru review, but this cd ROCKS. some ppl don't get it, like the person below me, and ESPECIALLY the person above me. if ur smart, u'll get this cd. re-hash, 5/4, tomorrow comes today, slow counrty, clint eastwood, new geniuos(brother), 19-2000, man research, punk, gravity, and dracula all r amazing songs! GET THE CD
B000063V8S|5.0|Season four, what a treasure.  This is the first full season where, when you watched every show all you could say to yourself was \\"that was great.\\"  This is the season where, as stated above, their warp engines were fully engaged.  The writing staff did a great job with every episode.  Patrick Stewart just continue to shine as Captain Picard.  We start off with the climatic, yet somewhat melodramatic ending of \\"Best of Both Worlds.\\"  All summer long between the seasons, I kept asking myself, how are they going to get out of this one?  What a great two part episode, that honestly could've been on the silver screen.  The only problem I had with this season, was a personal one.  It was right at the beginning of Desert Shield and I could only get taped shows.  Season four was also truly the season of family, we finally get to meet so many people who had only been briefly mentioned.  The most poignant episode of the season \\"Family.\\"  They had to address everything that Captain Picard would be feeling after becoming Locutus and doing the things he was forced to do.  Truly a fine episode.  Some highlighted episodes of season four:<br />Best of Both Worlds Part 2<BR>Brothers<BR>Family<BR>Remember Me<BR>Reunion<BR>Furture Imperfect<BR>Final Mission<BR>Data's Day<BR>The Wounded<BR>First Contact<BR>Galaxy's Child<BR>Nth Degree<BR>Qpid<BR>Half a Life<BR>The Mind's Eye<BR>In Theory<BR>Redemption Part 1<br />One of the true gems of the season was Chief Miles O'Brien getting more airtime, which led to his inclusion in Deep Space Nine.  He is one of the best Star Trek characters to date.  Overall a great season and more than just a taste of what's to come in the following years.
0316666343|4.0|My partner brought me this book, thinking that it was something that I would pick out for myself, had I been at the store with her.  Boy, was it the book for me.  I had not yet heard any of the publicity on the book, so I did not have any preconcieved notions.  This author brought out what I think heaven would be like, in some ways.  She was able to keep the reader turning the page to see what was going to happen next, to see how life could go on.  My one and only complaint, is that the ending was not what I thought it should be.  But when she writes again, I will be there to read it.
B000006NPY|5.0|This is one of my favorite works by the Smashing Pumpkins.  The band really takes more of a relaxed aproach to developing their music, and they made it work extreamly well for them.  As many say, and I agree, this is not a typical album for the pumpkins.  This album is for the Pumpkins what Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" is, or the Chili Peppers more current mellow rock.  It's a diffrent tone for them, and it's great.  It's still rock, but plows deeper than any other current rock bands.  It's a must for fans (DER!), and does well for beginning smashers.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Most certainly, 'Amadeus' discovers the accolades it receives. It is a true classic and ingenious fusion of music, spectacle, intrigue, performance, and directorial vision. Please note that the new director's cut has about 30 mins. of added footage. Some of this footage includes a scene containing sex/nudity. For this, the timid souls of the MPAA served up a new 'R rating.' The original theatrical version was rated 'PG.' The added footage is a great highlight and does not diminish this phenomenal film, rather it enhances key plot points. 'Amadeus,' just like Mozart's music, is masterful and unique. See it, then see it again.
0399226907|5.0|My 2 year old, long a fan of Carle's Brown Bear Brown Bear, LOVES the Very Hungry Caterpillar.  The story is simple and delightful and fun to read.  The pages are ingeniously designed to reveal yet ANOTHER item the very hungry caterpillar ate every day... and the belly ache he gets after eating every possible wrong food (wrong for caterpillars) really made an impact on my daughter, who talks freely about \\"very hungry caterpillar ate too much!\\"  The book also beautifully illustrates in simple terms the metamorphoses of the caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly.  It's a bargain and a great, classic read!

0780622553|5.0|Slowly the story of Dark City is revealed to us. It begins with a man with lost memories wakes up naked in a hotel, and begins exploring this so called city he has lived his whole life in. He follows clues, while mysteriously he is chased by a group of strange beings who can alter reality, pursue him. I wont tell more, as to not ruin the experience, but you don't find out the whole secret of the city until the very end. But it is definitely worth watching this film to see this secret. Its got a very noir tint to it, as well as a comic influence, this film. This film brings up many issues about humans, their memories, and soul. Don't expect to much action, but expect a mind exploring film. Be ready to think, as you watch. In the end it will be worth it. 5 stars. Check it out. Also be sure to listen to the commentaries that are on this DVD. They are very insightful to the making of films, directing, and what shots mean and are meant to convey.
B00004HYLF|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see this group live at the Majestic theatre in San Antonio TX in 1982. I knew from the hundreds of times that I had listened to Romantic Warrior that I would be thrilled by this concert. I first listened to this albun upon its release in 1976, (I was a Senior in High School), and have never grown weary of it. If I was to only be allowed one album to own, this would be it!
0066620996|3.0|This book is an easy read. I read it in one weekend.

B000024D4R|5.0|I never even knew about Animals until I was thoroughly immersed in the Floyd.  At first I wondered, how did we go from the sublime keyboard driven \\"Wish You Were Here\\" album to the power chords of \\"The Wall\\"?  The answer of course, was this segue called Animals.  Of course, it wasn't intended as such, but has become a segue in the history of Floyd albums simply because there are no songs which can be pulled from it for Album-Oriented Radio (AOR) stations, like a \\"Have a Cigar,\\" \\"Money,\\" or even a \\"One of These Days.\\"  Occasionally, an ultra-progressive rock station might play \\"Dogs\\", but this is quite rare.<br />This extreme lack of airplay causes Animals to be overlooked by casual Floyd fans, myself obviously included.  Critics, to the surprise of no one, carped on the album upon its release in 1977 for not containing any \\"new\\" songs - in fact, each song but the aforementioned short acoustic \\"Pigs on the Wing\\" doodles had been a part of the band's live set for years.  At the last minute, their lyrics were reworked so that they'd fit in with the \\"concept\\" of animials representing different classes of people.  For example, an old song called \\"Gotta be Crazy\\" was reworded and called \\"Dogs\\".  <br />As to the songs themselves, the arrangements are decidedly more sparse than on the previous two Floyd masterpieces.  Rick Wright's keyboards are virtually gone, except for the drifting middle section of \\"Dogs.\\"  Dogs is arguably the album's best track, and longest clocking in at about 17 minutes.  Sometimes, fans draw comparisons between Animals and Orwell's \\"Animal Farm,\\" but aside from the obvious allegorical comparisons, Waters' lyrics do not closely parallel that classic work.  In terms of personality, the \\"Dogs\\" to which Waters refers are most similar to the Orwellian pigs (Napolean, et al) who thirst for power at the expense of everyone else.  These are Waters' most scathing lyrics, even more so than his ranting solo project \\"Amused to Death.\\"  As usual, however, the great thing about Floyd is that Roger makes you think, whereas Dave Gilmour makes the music immensely enjoyable (Waters' solo projects always lacked this component: even a competent guitarist like Jeff Beck couldn't restore the musicality to \\"Amused\\").  \\"Dogs\\" contains some of Gilmour's very best guitar work with the band.  <br />\\"Pigs: Three Different Ones,\\" the third track, represents a commentary on holier than thou moralists like Mary Whitehouse, to whom Roger sings the lyric closest to a hook-line on the album: \\"Ha ha, charade you are.\\"   The middle section of \\"Pigs\\" is a trough in the album's creativity (get it?), and amounts to Gilmour (I think...maybe Waters) making whining pig noises as a sort of \\"solo\\".  <br />Then, there are the \\"Sheep\\", hapless followers who have no real thoughts of their own.  A driving bassline permeates the piece, along with blasts of rhythem guitar interspersed therein.  It's a long way from \\"A Pillow of Winds.\\"  \\"Sheep\\" really seems to be a warm up for \\"The Wall,\\" especially in the exciting power chord climax which could conceivably pass for a dry run of \\"Run Like Hell\\".  <br />When the dust clears, \\"Sheep\\" ends with the sound of farm animals congregating in a pastoral setting, sequeing into the second \\"Pigs on the Wing\\".  Waters was never a virtuoso (if you've never picked up a guitar in your life, you will still learn to play \\"Pigs on the Wing\\" in a matter of minutes), but the bookends of the album truly do create an image of humanity nonexistent throughout the remaining tracks.<br />All things considered, a truly enjoyable album: incidently, my favorite Floyd to listen to in the car.
0345440900|3.0|I agree with a lot of the previous reviews in that this EASY system is more difficult to implement before 2 months of age because newborns like to sleep after fedding.  At about 1.5 - 2 months, my baby (textbook/spirited - halfway between both according to Tracy's test) naturally woke up after feedings.  This book has pro's and cons:<br />Pro's:<BR>EASY / Start as you mean to go on - try to do this in the first months to AVOID later problems with sleep especially, but don't get too freaked out if it doesn't work in the beginning.  <BR>SLOW - some very good advice about reading cues.  Again, this came in handy AFTER the newborn stage.<br />CON's:<BR>Breastfeeding advice - I don't know too many lactation experts who would agree with a lot of Tracy's theories, especially single side feeding.  Following her advice may lead to supply problems for some women.<BR>Lack of enjoyment - Sometimes it's ok to let the baby fall asleep on your chest or nurse her to sleep.  I think her method can stress out new mothers and not allow them to enjoy bonding with the baby.  Independance is important but so is bonding.  Trust your instincts!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini-series is excellent!  I read the book after i watched the show, and it was amazing how Stephen E. Ambrose's words got translated into a picture so well.  I don't know what else to say other than when this comes out, get it, or rent it, you won't be dissapointed at all.  There were 246 reviews on here, 241 of them gave perfect scores, that says alot right there.
B00005R24G|5.0|Simply put, Sleuth leaves me in awe after every viewing. To watch Olivier and Michael Caine, who reportedly was a little nervous squaring off agaist the master, is like watching an excerise in Acting 101. <br />The plot is convoluted, in a good way, and uses dialogue to push the story. Very much like a play, the joy in watching the movie is the two actors squaring off, always trying to one up each other, both in character and most likely as themselves. Michael Caine might have been reported being nervous, but it doesn't show. This might be one of his greatest performances, and this was before his indy boom of the late nineties. This was Caine in his prime, and Olivier winding down his career in a performance only Marlon Brando could have beaten, a la \\"The Godfather\\" released the same year.<br />Joseph L. Mankiewicz's certainly surprises as a director. The legendary director of \\"All About Eve\\" shows a bit of flash and art to go with the solid substance of his profession. The segues using the many prop pieces in the main setting is ingenious, and quite honestly, a little unsettling. Watching a horde of puppets seemingly moving on their own, banging and laughing, certainly adds a uniqueness to the picture that stands up with the two major performances.<br />DVD-wise, it's not Criterion, but the sound is average and the picture is better than it's probably ever been on home video. Not that that has any influence over my decision to purchase this DVD. Nope, this is simply one of my favorite films, a gem that a lot of people don't even know exists. Well, if you like twist and turns, great actors, and a stylish presentation, then this movie is for you.<br />Highly recommended.
0812550706|1.0|this is the best book i have ever read. not only is it very entertaining, it is a very deep. I recommend this book for everyone.
6304779356|5.0|THE LOST BOYS<BR>*****<BR>THIS IS POSSIBLY THE BEST VAMPIRE MOVIE WITH QUEEN OF THE DAMNED CLOSE BEHIND.  THE ENDING WAS BRILLIANT AND THE SONG THAT PLAYED IN THE CLOSING CREDITS WAS HAUNTING.  FOR ALL THOSE WHO DONT KNOW THE SONG. IT'S PEOPLE ARE STRANGE AND IT'S BY ECHO AND THE BUNNYMEN.  OK SO THE MOVIE WASNT FROM MY ERA SINCE I'M 17 AND I DIDNT EXPECT TO LIKE IT BUT MY COUSIN BOUGHT OVER THE DVD AND I WAS SHOCKED BY HOW GOOD IT WAS. KEIFER SUTHERLAND IN HIS ONLY GOOD MOVIE FROM THAT ERA SINCE PROMISED LAND STUNK. I'D BE EXTREMELY  HAPPY IF THEY RE RELEASED IT INTO THEATERS WITH DELETED FOOTAGE.  I WOULD GO SEE IT AS MANY TIMES AS I COULD AND THEN WHEN THE DVD CAME OUT I'D BUY IT SINCE IT'S MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE.  OK SO NOW TO THE STORY MIKE IS THE NEW KID IN TOWN AND HE FALLS INTO THE WRONG CROWD. THE VAMPIRE CROWD.  THE REASON HE MOVED INTO TOWN IS BECAUSE HIS FAMILY WAS MOVING IN WITH THIER GRANDPA.  HIS MOTHER SUPERBLY PLAYED BY DIANE WEIST SUSPECTS HES WITH THE WRONG CROWD AND SO DOES EVERYONE ELSE.    SO RENT THIS AND ENJOY A TRULY GOOD MOVIE.  YOU WONT BE UPSET. YOU WILL ACTUALLY BE HAPPY THAT YOU RENTED IT.   I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH WATCHING IT.
0316666343|1.0|What's stunning about this book is the PR and the blindness of most critics who have been doing cartwheels.  There is no way at all that this is a convincing voice of a 14-year-old girl.  It's too smart, too subtle, too mature, too sophisticated.  I could not suspend, no, *crush*, disbelief long enough to enjoy it, and  found myself insulted by the author, editor, publisher and reviewers who have put one over on the reading public, which has, sheep-like, made this book a wild success.  The book is in its own way as bad as some early Michael Cunningham (A Home at the End of the World) where he has children observing life with the exact same richness of perception as adults.  A Reader's Manifesto is absolutely right--reviewers are snowed nowadays by beautiful sentences no matter how opaque, or in this case, how unlikely they are.
B00000373U|5.0|This is Elliott Smith at his best.  Drop this disc into your stereo and sink into your sofa, kick your feet up, and just take it in.<br />The fact that this music conveys such clarity and sincerety and just plain beauty makes it a must have for the mellow-loving fans of such talents as belle&sebastian, nick drake, and badly drawn boy.  <br />Standout tracks on this album are \\"Rose Parade,\\" \\"Angeles,\\" and \\"Say yes.\\"  The second half of 'Either/Or' is perhaps the best second half of any album i've listened to in years.<br />If you want to truly be blown away, or if you are debating which Elliott Smith album to purchase first, my advice is 'Either/Or.'<br />Treat Yourself.
B00006AW2E|4.0|The UK version of this CD really surprised me. Without Satisfaction and The Last Time, which were on the original US album, this is probably the most solid slice of R&amp;B the Stones ever recorded. This is no pop group here folks. This album is steeped in soul and blues music the early band, including Brian Jones, loved. From the raunchy/punky mess of 'She Said Yeah' to Mick's soulful vocal on'That's How Strong My Love Is,' I don't think the Stones ever displayed their roots better. If you want to see where the Stones came from, this is the CD for you. &quot;Rolling Stones Now&quot; is a close second to this UK version (and the best US album of the first four), but without the pop hits, we get a clear chance to see what music inspired this band in the first place.
1558908846|4.0|I went to see this movie when it first came out, and I have to say that I never understood why so many people hated it.<br />All I can think of that that they misread Stallone's portrayal of  Judge Dredd. Stallone is purposely playing Dredd as a comic book character (which, after all, is what Dredd was), and therefore not a role laced with any deep meanings. Although there are some deeper scenes (Dredd speaking of what happened to his best friend, and later, Dredd and Rico meeting in the Janus complex), for the most part, the movie is just one big comic book. The movie is what it is, and what it was intended to be; a fun, action sci-fi comic. To expect anything else is unfair.<br />There are some good roles here, too. Stallone purposely goes two-dimensional as Dredd, which is perfect (Dredd sees only black and white when it comes to the Law). Rob Schnider was also pretty good, not too annoying, not invisible. I recall my friends and I were impressed with him in this one. Diane Lane is foxy, and Max von Sydow lends credibility as mentor and Chief Judge.<br />There were some interesting ideas on display here, and the execution of those ideas is handled quite well. Perfect? Well, no, but not bad, either.<br />The effects are a bit dated. Most are CGI, and while impressive for their day, they are very &quot;videogame-looking&quot; compared to more recent CGI work. Still, if you want a fun sci-fi action picture, this is the one.
0792107683|5.0|This is the best western movie I have seen and I'm 62 and love western movies. The acting was outstanding, and the setting is terrific. The entire story kept me glued to the screen! I felt every member of the cast was outstanding and did a fine job. The way the story developed, unfolded and went to its conclusion made this film really terrific. There were really a fine group of actors selected for the film. The gunfight in this movie, and the way it unfolded, is by far the best in any western I've ever seen. I could not rank it any higher for setting, action, story, excitement and entertainment. This is by far my favorite western movie. I get the video out and watch it a number of times throughout the year!
B000059ZLH|4.0|As the title mentions the dvd concert is great, every single band member is a proficient in the instrument he plays.  the songs are performed very nice and the camera focuses on the players enough time to see what the heck is going on.  the only disadvantage i can locate is the sound quality(2.0 stereo) (come on you guys, you can do better than that:)) and some lack of enrgy on stage.  All in all, I think that purchasing the specific dvd is worh the money!
B000001IPP|4.0|A great release by East-Bay's finest.Now with vocals Lars Federicksen on their side,Rancid rocks even harder than their first album.Great and catchy songs like Nihilism,Radio,Sidekick and 7 Years Down.This album has no ska,all punk rock tunes but I still enjoy the album.If you're a punk,this one is a MUST in your collection.
B00006EXDM|4.0|\\"Hot Rocks 1964-1971\\" is one of the best Rolling Stones compilations ever released in the United States, but it is not quite as representative as the vinyl release \\"Rolled Gold\\" on Decca.  Even though the STEREO masters for Satisfaction, Get Off of my Cloud and Mother's Little Helper were not used, they sound punchier.  There is something about the wide stereo mixes that I miss, but this is probably the way the Stones wanted us to hear them.  All of the songs do have more presence and clarity, especially the late 60's tracks.  Jumpin' Jack Flash is a stereo mix that I have never heard before on any release.
B000001IQH|5.0|One word to describe this cd-sick!!It will never come out from my player-this cd is great since \\"Let's Go\\".Hear the bass of Matt..he is the best bassist on the planet.Great melody with great bass and great voice from Tim Armstrong.Songs that catches my attention includes \\"Olympia WA\\", \\"Time Bomb\\" and \\"Journey To The End Of East Bay\\" and my personal favourite, \\"Ruby Soho\\".<BR>Great cd,you should place it in your collection...
B00006FXB6|5.0|Wow.  This is the kind of album that the world need right now.  Songs for the Deaf is a pretty awesome album.  The instrumentation is top notch, extremely heavy (not enough synonyms for heavy!), and the lyrics are thoughtful too, unlike most of the [junk] being forced down our throats.  The radio theme also helps the album; as Josh Homme said, the songs often sound like different bands, so having a theme of changing a radio station helped to bring them together.<br />Seriously, this album is great (note that I said album.  Most records these days are just collections of singles, but this is a cohesive album).  The only track that, and I don't want to say weak, because it's not, but seems out of place, is \\"Mosquito Song\\", but hey it's a bonus track, so whattya want.  Factor in the bonus DVD, and this is a must buy album.  One of 2002's best.
0446677450|4.0|I really enjoyed this book because it makes you really think about your attitude about money and where that attitude came from.  He doesn't give specifics about how to become rich; as a matter of fact, from his life it seems like you have to know the right people.  However, it's very motivating to change how you look at how to make money beyond waiting for a raise.  I also found his writing style very easy to read, very rare in the finance field.
B000002NHN|5.0|I'm reluctant to add to the 343 reviews herein of this cycle of songs, but I simply cannot resist.<br />I've been listening to this recording for over two years, on and off, always with the same result. It troubles me that this work of utter musical genius will always be pigeon-holed with so-called \\"Celtic\\" music. Is the work of Van Morrison Celtic music? Is the dark cinematic jouissance of Godard simply \\"art house\\" film?<br />Anyway, someone herein asks why McKennitt's music seems to leave one in the lurch so-to-speak, or even out of sorts. I'd say \\"devastated\\" is a better term. But devastated in the way that transcendentally exquisite works of art move the spirit to look into the vortex of time. Would it be too much to mention Mahler in this context?<br />This cycle of songs is a musical journal (journey), and the accompanying booklet traces those travels through a very poetic and sparse commentary of Being-There. That said, I challenge anyone to tell me where the \\"there\\" is in the haunting, halting, gorgeous Dante's Prayer ... Skellig may take me to Northern Italy, and leave me in a state of melancholy observance of the spent life of an Irish monk, but it also speaks to me of my own \\"end\\". Yet, somewhere in the lyrical and aural matrix of McKennitt's ravaging music I'd have to admit, sworn upon reams of lesser music, that the places and people she canvasses are all completely of the mind and heart.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|The acting in this film is wonderful and the some of the lines are very touching.  However, the creators of the film took many liberties with the truth about this amazing man's life.  Would have been just as exciting and interesting had they stuck closer to the facts.
B00003CXI0|4.0|Steve Kloves ought to be commended for his adaption of Rowling's novel.  The writing is really excellent, as is several other attributes of this movie.  Daniel Radcliffe (voice cracking and all) was convincing in the title role.  What I found to be missing was some sense of risk on the part of director Chris Columbus.  Granted that taking too many liberties with the story would have incited riots from the legion of  kids who worship these stories, I felt Columbus did a very mediocre job injecting this film with any sort of personal style.  As with his other films, both the hilarious Mrs. Doubtfire, and the horrible Bicentenial Man, Chris Columbus has displayed his penchant for very conservative, &quot;by the numbers&quot; direction.  Where directors like David Fincher and Terry Gilliam are such that one could view one of their movies, without knowing it was theirs, and instantly recognize the style, I don't think Columbus has ever made a movie I could watch and think &quot;yup, that's Chris Colubus film.&quot;  It's sad that the producers of this film felt the need to go the sure route and come up with a pretty good film, instead of a riskier path and maybe come up with something truly magic.
B00003CX7L|5.0|We really loved this movie.  Our 2 1/2 year old son just went wild over Buzz Lightyear.  It was really cute.  Toy Story 2 is really better suited for a really young audience because there is no scary bad guy.  The mean boy Sid of Toy Story 1 was just a little too scary.  We preferred this movie to the original.
1565847032|5.0|I began reading this book because it happened to be around. I had read some Chomsky before but I could never get into him, he seemed kind of a crank. Understanding Power, is without question, the indispensable Chomsky. Nothing is left unturned, even a bit of the personal that help put everything into perspective. If what you see around you in the media, politics, and economics make you mad and you can't understand why things are the why they are, you need to read this book. You will understand, and you will be motivated to do something.
B00006GFAB|1.0|THINK..... ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE HAS NOW MADE IT ON TO 10 DIFFERENT ALBUMS. IS IT REALLY THAT GOOD OF A SONG? THE BAND MUST HAVE A CONTRACT TO FILL, BECAUSE THIS NOW GIVES THEM A TOTAL OF 10 GREATEST HITS/LIVE ALBUMS. TWO WORDS; NEW MATERIAL.TWO MORE WORDS; ACE FREHLEY. AT LEAST GENE AND PAUL WERE SMART ENOUGH TO PUT PETER AND ACE ON THE COVER, OR IS THAT ERIC SINGER AND TOMMY THAYER?. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND FIND A REAL GREATEST HITS, SUCH AS; KILLERS,DOUBLE PLATINUM,SMASHES THARASHES & HITS, UNPLUGGED, GREATEST KISS, KISS ALIVE I-IV, OR THAT SILLY BOX SET. GET THE IDEA!!!!!!!!!!
B00005MNP8|5.0|This is my favorite Blondie album.  All of the songs are excellent and enjoyable.  Debbie Harry's vocals have never been better, and neither has the material.  There are energetic rock songs and meaningful ballads.  My favorite songs are: Hanging On the Telephone, One Way or Another, Heart of Glass, Will Anything Happen?, Sunday Girl and I'm Gonna Love You Too.  The bonus tracks are also very good.  I would recommend this for a Blondie fan, or someone who likes 70s/punk rock music.
B00006FXB6|5.0|QOTSA's third effort to date, and a killer one at that. This band is taking the stoner rock world by the balls and squeezing with all their might. Josh Homme has done it again, always putting out good stuff. The world lived through Kyuss can they survive the queens.
6304479689|5.0|EoT is one of the most AMAZING films ever.  It chronicles the life of the King of Rock and Roll during his 1972 tour.  All done in various forms of Pan &amp; Scan, WIDE (and I empasize the word WIDE) screen, and that cheesy camera trick called Cinerama (multiple-screens).  This was a popular trick in the 50s and 60s to get an even bigger screen.  This was done on usually the tacky movies of the period, but split screen has never been any tackier, cheesier, or more beautiful than on Elvis on Tour.  I guess that's why I get all mushy and sentimental on those parts because it reminds me of the decade of my childhood:  the 70s.<br />The other amazing aspect of the movie is how Elvis had total control of everything.  It seemed he had this magic spell over everything that was around him.  The music itself?  Well, it's the imperfect sound of Elvis in concert.  There's beauty in imperfection.<br />I remember 25 years ago in 1977 when Elvis died.  Thats when I got my first exposure to this amazing film.  In fact, I have in my possession an audiotape of the broadcast of EoT.  My 6 year old voice in on that tape, my mom and dad's voice is on that tape.  It's a 25 year old time capsule!  After the movie was over, I went into my bedroom with the tape recorder and imitated Elvis for hours.  If not for sentimental reasons, if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and buy it NOW!
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is back & better than ever in this incredible album, The Eminem Show. Sure, this CD is full of \\"explicit lyrics\\" but that's why I like it! I love controversial music! Eminem sings his heart out and delivers, and boy, does he ever! White America, Without Me, My Dad's Gone Crazy, Square Dance, and Cleaning Out My Closet are just some of the hits on this awesome rap album. Shady also features some hilarious skits on this album. If you are an Eminem fan or like this kind of thing, then GET IT!!! BECAUSE IT'S ALL WORTH IT!!!!!
0316666343|4.0|I truly expected this to be a thriller/mystery.  It was more of a spiritual quest to help those who have had similar circumstances in their lives cope with such tragic type deaths.  I for one felt comforted to know that there is a possibility that life in some fashion goes on after death as we know it. I was somewhat disappointed in the way the criminal met his death. I felt there was no closure. It left me longing for something more tangible, more definite for the parents siblings and even me.  While I really did enjoy the book, I wouldn't categorize it as a mystery/thriller.
B000055WIQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite horror movies EVER!!!!! This movie is definetly not for Christians! It's graphic, profane, and very satanic! A 13 year old girl (Linda Blair) suddenly becomes possessed by the devil himself! The horror escalates to some very harrowing moments. When this film was released in 1973, the film caused mass hysteria in theaters, with people fainting and parametics on the scene! This unrated version of The Exorcist is not a whole lot different from the original, which includes some exclusive bonus footage. However, the never-before-seen \\"stairway\\" scene will put goosebumps on your goosebumps!!! This movie rocks!!!!!
0451169514|5.0|I've read this book a number of times now and each time I pick up new details and nuances.  &quot;It&quot;, quite simply, is magical.  To me,the horror was a sideline.  The real story lay in the unbreakable bond between the children and the world King created.  Who can read this book without remembering their own childhood?  King perfectly recreates that wide eyed innocence,the way adults just weren't quite real and not a part of your world, and the way laughter could destroy anything.  A few reviewers have commented that it's unrealistic and too coincidental to have all (except one) character growing to be rich and/or famous; this is explained in the book as a direct result of their contact with &quot;It&quot;.  This, and the fact that none of the group were able to have children, were not coincidental but rather the effect &quot;It&quot; had on all of them.  I had tears in my eyes when I finished &quot;It&quot;, devastated that the friends finally grew up completely and as a result, started to forget about the childhood they shared.  Truly a book to treasure.
B00000IQUT|1.0|I rented this movie about a year ago and it was so disturbing I had to cut it off! I have watched a lot of bad movies in my lifetime but this sick twisted film took the cake. I love shocking horror movies and always have, but this movie was too much even for me! And if I can't make myself watch it, then IT'S GOT TO BE REALLY BAD!!! Whoever made this distasteful movie needs help! And anyone who can sit down and enjoy watching this crap should get help-------AND FAST!!! I didn't even watch all of it, it was that damn distasteful!!! The story focuses on an innocent gal who is relentlessly attacked and raped numerous times by a gang of perverts-----one of whom is retarded. After raping her, they leave her lying nakad in her cabin. They think she's dead, but she's not and stalks them and kills them off one by one in gruesome ways. Don't buy this B.S. Don't even rent it, unless you're as perverse as this movie is!!!
B00005AQF7|5.0|This cd is really good..even though i bought it 7+ years after it was made, i still like each song..i recommend this cd to any snoop fan
B000066744|5.0|Excuse me while I go out and beat my head against the wall for a few minutes.<br /> When I first tried to watch this movie, I was at a loss as to why there was no dialogue.  Only background sounds. I was ready to return it to Blockbuster when suddenly I had a brainstorm--- maybe something needed to be done to the sound, a feature checked, or unchecked on the menu.<br /> Well, lo and behold, the menu indicator was on &quot;Music and Details Only&quot;, so I checked &quot;Dolby Sound&quot; or whatever the choice was, and it was a miracle.  They talked !!  I started at the beginning again and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was different, --and the main charactor was very admirable, - he made a life choice and stuck to it. Glad I gave it another try.
0679879269|5.0|An incredible ending to a marvelous tale. I must say, I was getting quite impatiant waiting for this book to be released to the public (I read it quite a while ago, bought it the day after it was published).
B000068PQ0|5.0|Being a longtime Flips fan, I can honestly say that they are getting better all the time.<br />I thought they couldn't get any better when Hit To Death In The Future Head came out, but they did.  Then they hit a rough middle patch with Clouds Taste Metallic.  But since then, they are ascending to greater heights.
1559409002|5.0|_Carnival of Souls_ may not be a true film classic (even its director, Herk Harvey, didn't count it among his best work), but it's one of a precious few American films from the early '60s that qualify as serious works of art.<br /><br />Extras abound on this 2-disc edition, but the most interesting of the lot pertain to the Centron Corporation, an ultra-low-budget production company in Lawrence, Kansas.  Most of the  crew for _Carnival of Souls_ (including Harvey himself) worked for Centron, which specialized in instructional films for public schools and corporations.  As a Centron employee Harvey would eventually direct nearly 400 short films, a few of which are featured here.<br /><br />The DVD makes the persuasive argument that Harvey's ability to make the most out of extremely limited resources (as he did in _Carnival of Souls_) was a product of his many years as a director for Centron.  It also draws attention to the cinematic technique that goes into effective educational filmmaking, no matter how low the budget.<br /><br />The 2-disc Criterion edition of _Carnival of Souls_ is a must-own for any cineaste who wants to examine the nuts and bolts of the filmmaker's craft.  (That said, less devoted cinephiles might prefer a rental.)  It revives and preserves, in the best manner possible, an artful low-budget horror film with a devoted cult following.  More importantly, it also brings attention to a long-neglected piece of American film history.  Kudos to Criterion for their excellent efforts.
6305041156|5.0|While i don't necessarily agree that this is Kurosawa's best film (for me that would be either \\"Seven Samurai\\" or \\"Kagemusha\\"), it is huge, brilliant and gripping.<br />As with \\"King's Ransome\\", the the American \\"police procedural novel by Ed McBain that he adapted to modern-day Japan, Kurosawa finds themes in Shakespeare's \\"King Lear\\" which, while arguably universal, resonate particularly well with Japanese ideas and ways.<br />Tragedy is set in motion when Lord Hidetori, who has spent much of his life in the saddle, amassing a large fiefdom by conquest, decides that he is too old to rule properly and steps aside in favour of his eldest son, planning to settle lands and castles on his other sons, as well.<br />And thus into the familiar story from Shakespeare.<br />The sheer size and scope of this film are amazing; the design is incredible and the battle scenes are overwhelming.<br />And Kurosawa's directorial bravura is always amazing -- in his next previous film, \\"Kagemusha\\", he had staged the battle that destroys a powerful clan almost totally with sound effects and reaction shots of officers and others watching from the hills above.  In, on the other hand, \\"Ran\\", the battle for a castle is filmed in horrifying detail of gushing blood, dismembered wounded, fire and terror, but staged in complete silence... Until the shot from ambush that kills a Lord rings out, and then the full sound suddenly batters the viewer until the battle ends.<br />Brilliant, beautiful, huge and moving, this is a film for the ages.<br />Unfortunately, the DVD package doesn't live up to the film -- aside from a theatrical trailer, the only \\"extras\\" on the disc are text-only partial flimographiesof Kurosawa and star Tatsuya Nakadai.  Such a huge and special film deserves a special package, but it fails to get it here.<br />If the film were any lesser in stature, the sparse DVD extras might lose one star for the package as a whole; but this one gets five stars in spite of its lacks.<br />((Luckily, i understand that a much-more-extensive package, including another feature film and extensive other material, will be out in the near future.))Luckily, i understand that a much-more-extensive package, including another feature film and extensive other material, will be out in the near future.))
B00004T9VY|5.0|This album, along with Teaser &amp; The Firecat are Cat Stevens' best albums.<br />Filled with emotion in songs such as Sad Lisa and Hard Headed woman, to nice ditties like Wild World and Miles From Nowhere, to dialogue driven songs like Father &amp; Son, this album is the epitomy of what Cat Stevens' music is about.<br />This is the stuff! I recommend this and Teaser &amp; The Firecat before everything else in the Stevens Catalogue.
B000067J24|5.0|I was expecting a silly movie with Penelope Cruz.  Instead I found a well-constructed film worthy of entering my collection.  I really enjoyed how the film was put together and the tale.  Maybe some people rating here don't understand it is a FAIRY TALE!  It's not Ben Hur or (GAG!) Gosford Park and it never said it was.  But it was certainly more charming and fun than it ever let on.  The music is stunning throughout the film.
B000067CPX|4.0|Great Collection of somewhat mellow/deep songs.  I am a die hard RHCP fan, so I will buy their stuff no matter what.  I had to listen to it several times to have it really grow on me.  Are the RHCP's growing older, more mature, and perhaps slowing <BR>and/or settling down!  This album has great vocals-Anthony really sings his heart out, but it is missing that edge that the <BR>RHCP's are famous for! Don't get me wrong, I do like it!<BR>Keep it up guys. Keep the tunes coming! <br />Joan
0679735909|3.0|Slogging through the first half of the book is definately worth reaching the second half, but I did have my doubts each time I started dozing off. I couldn't help feeling I was reading someones PhD disertation. Intellectual is okay (it's nice to see a book that is not dumbed down), but this is labeled as a romance. The author, in her role as novelist, is surprisingly poor in her portrayal of passion. However, as a poet she has a great deal of passion buried (sometimes deeply) in the poems. In particular, the section on the Victorian poets' affair is incredibly lacking in tension and passion. The book could have been made much better by a good editor.
B000006045|5.0|This album needs another good review like it needs a root canal. It is, without a doubt, an incredible achievement. Each song is individually great but spine tingling in the context of the entire album. I now will spend the remainder of my review speaking of croutons. I have a friend that doesn't like croutons and I'm like, \\"their frigin croutons! What's not to like!?\\" and he's all \\"It's my right to dislike croutons, besides who are you to judge me? Have I ever criticized your dislike of taco shells or your exceptionally large left earlobe? Or is it just that your right earlobe is exceptionally small?\\"  So I'm like, \\"Would you like them better if they were called dried bread cubes?\\" and he says, \\"Is that what croutons are? Then what were those things my grandma used to serve on Christmas? \\", \\"Moth balls.\\" I say and then he's like, \\"Yea, I like croutons.\\"
0471413909|5.0|This is one of the most influential books I've read - definitely in the top 5.  In following the doctrines outlined here, I've lost about 12 pounds of bodyfat, gained ridiculous amounts of energy, and can lift more weight in the gym than ever before - all in about 2 months.  The title is slightly misleading - this is really less of a &quot;diet&quot; book and more of a &quot;lifestyle&quot; book.  On the three or four times I have departed from this Paleo lifestyle (usually just for a meal or two), I noticed a dramtic decrease in my energy level.  For the first time in my life, I believe I &quot;get&quot; the whole nutrition thing.  Don't confuse the Paleo approach with Atkins - although there are similarities, the differences are critical (ie., salt, quality of fats, etc).
B00004YRQA|5.0|When I first purchased the PS2, I was thrown aback by the price of the memory card itself. In comparison, it was roughly 2.5 times more expensive than the original, a sum that I wasn't too thrilled about. Still, I knew I would have to pay if I wanted to save because not saving, as we all know, is a wonderful way to invoke self-wrought hostility. So, I bought it, took it home, and quickly learned that the memory card itself, besides being of great quality, held oceans of information that were, before, only possible with a handful of memory cards.<br />Yes, in saving/game terms, 8MB will hold just about anything you want and provides that little push toward the top that you need to virtually succeed. I've now gotten into the habit of keeping multiple files to thwart the unexpected deletion of something I've been working on for sleepless days, something I rarely accomplished with the old 1MB cards. Also, it does away with the need to keep cards that like disappear when cornered down to a minimal number. To me, that's a plus because I hate trying to locate something in the \\"heat of the moment.\\" Besides that, you don't have to worry about forgetting to pick up a card and then suddenly not being able to save at that crucial moment when you need it.<br />Also, to note, when I say these things are high quality, I mean that they are (or at least one of mine is) indeed tough. I had an unfortunate incident where a chair was sat on top of my memory card and, strangely enough, it walked away needing on psychiatric help. Perhaps this isn't the best test to perform and wouldn't work all the time, mind you, but it does give and example of just how much punishment they can take.<br />So, buy it because you need it, and because you know better than to buy generic. Unlike other mediums, the \\"memory card money conservation method\\" will bite you in many and many a bad way. You really do get what you pay for.
B000008LOV|4.0|Since this particular Cd arrived, I have not yet taken it out of the player. The content is pure gold, real infectious music. If you haven't yet purchased a Wilburys Cd, this is the one to get. Both Volume one and three, plus a rare Europe only released Single \\"Nobody's Child\\". Released for the Romanian Angels Appeal. The only reason I gave it a four star rating was due to the low volume level on Volume One, but this in no way detracts from the actual content of the songs themselves.<BR>Every track has that unique blend of rythmn, vocals, and gritty Rock ,n Roll, that can only be delivered by Messrs Harrison, Orbison, Petty, Dylan and Lynne together.<BR>\\"Tweeter and the Monkey Man\\" is pure genius in verse. Dylan's vocals, as he tells the story of two dropouts on the run from the \\"undercover cop\\" is just superb. Other tracks I've picked out are \\"Not Alone Anymore\\" and \\"She's My Baby\\" with Gary Moore guesting on guitar.<BR>Every track is a joy to listen to. It sounds so crisp and fresh, it could have been recorded yesterday.<BR>If your collection doesn't include the \\"Wilburys\\", there's a big gap in it, and this is the perfect Cd to fill it!!!
B000066NW0|4.0|This is a very good CD. I did not give it 4 stars, because the lyrics COULD be much better, Avril seems like a very intelligant girl, and if she worked a bit harder it could be MUCH better. Still, it is great. My favorite track is Losing Grip, a powerful song that, in my opinion, shows Avril at her best. She's a sk8er chick too, how cool is that? =P
B00006G8LB|5.0|this is a movie that I would watch over and over again. There is nothing bad I can think of to say about this film. It was well writen and acted out. It's the kind of movie you can take your family, a date or see by yourself and still injoy it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Saw the series an danish television, and this dvd has been one of the few movies i have actually cried over at the end of the last episode. The acting are first class - the storry as weel, and the actors are mostly unknown, which also is a big plus - Tom Hanks never belonged in Saving Private Ryan - but he can sure direct and along with Steven Spielberg this fine peace of art has touched/is going to touch our soules. <BR>A must have dvd for war movie fans....*****
B00003CXAA|5.0|you can't get any better than the godfather.  the films (at least the first two) are just faultless.  coppola's in his prime, the script is great, the acting is perfect.  they're just fantastic movies.  everyone should see them at least five times.

6305537321|5.0|this is probably one of audrey hepburn's best roles.  the movie is a little silly and outdated, one of those in between old hollywood and real movies, but it's a classic.  it's a wonderful movie and gets better the more you watch it.  and come on, paul varjak without a shirt on :)
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca is a great film and looks wonderful on DVD, but don't buy the disc expecting to see a lot in the way of &quot;newly discovered outtakes&quot;. They are not very interesting or revealing, few in number, very short, not documented or explained and seen only briefly as part of and under the closing credits of the &quot;You Must Remember This&quot; documentary included on the disc.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|There's a nice little scene in \\"Donnie Darko\\" where his girlfriend reflects upon his full name.  \\"Sounds like a superhero,\\" she muses.  Donnie gives her a sly glance and quips, \\"Who's to say I'm not?\\"<br />Indeed.  And by the movie's end, we're left to question whether or not Donnie really is such a savior.  At least I did.  In fact, I did a lot of questioning at the end of this picture.  Not the good kind, either--born of wonder and amazement, but the bad kind: spawn of frustration and delirium.<br />The year is 1988, and Donnie Darko is a dorky, reclusive, temperamental teenager growing up in a typical dorky, reclusive, temperamental teenager environment.  He deals with bullies at school, falls for the pretty new girl, fights with his caring, concerned family at home, and desperately tries to understand the life he's been given.  Oh, and as our story opens, he begins to receive regular visits from a nightmarish overgrown bunny rabbit from the future named Frank.<br />Frank reveals that the world is about to end and the only person that can prevent it is Donnie.  Thus begins his quest to unravel a mystery that includes a 100 year old woman named Grandma Death, a new age spiritual evangelist who preaches about love vs. fear, a mysterious book called \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\", and two young school teachers who seem perfunctory at first but then take particular interest in Donnie.<br />I love movies that toy with my mind, confusing the hell out of me while promising understanding and sometimes, by the movie's end, delivering revelation.  \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" ranks among my favorite films of all time.  And even when \\"The Ninth Gate\\" failed to deliver a satisfactory ending, it worked for me nonetheless because I so enjoyed the journey.<br />But \\"Donnie Darko\\" seems to think 1 out of 3 is enough.  It's not.  With every dark scene, every social satire, every equitable performance, this movie promises greatness.  But that's all.  The ending is simply another enigmatic scene.  I wish I could say that the sum of its parts makes up for it, but it doesn't.  There are moments where you brace yourself and smile and think: okay, here it comes, here's where it all falls into place!<br />But, unfortunately, this bunny rabbit leaves no eggs.ene.

B00006FXB6|5.0|The Queens of the Stone Age latest release \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" is a unique experience. Thicker, louder and more chaotic than their last release \\"Rated R,\\" \\"SftD\\" is is a bold step in the direction of Heavy Metal. With David Grohl exhibiting his best drum work ever, the Queens blast through 14 stomach churning, mind melting tracks that will surely earn them the respect they so obviously deserve.
0062502182|5.0|The moment I began reading this book, I knew that it is worth reading more than once. And when I finished it for the first time, I feel that this is not just a book. Instead, this is the Book that I would recommend to all people. It tells you about life, philosophy and other prospects in a very interesting and charming way. I have never read anything like this. A difinite 5 stars.
B00005K9LK|1.0|Don't get me wrong. I'm a JP fan and love this record along with most of their other records. The reason for the 1 star is that I, along with many others, already own the entire JP catalog. Now they re-release them with 1 or 2 bonus tracks. What do they expect me to do, buy the whole catalog again? What they should have done is release all the bonus tracks on one cd. Then I'd buy it. But since they're just trying to get me to buy everything again, I'll just download the unreleased songs from the internet. This re-release of Screaming... is only worth it if you don't already own it.
B00006FXB6|5.0|I had high hopes, almost too high, for this album to come through and holy sh$t did it ever...<br />I've listened to the Queens for almost two years, playing their previous two albums constantly (Kyuss too, check them out).  This album was a long-time coming but the end result shows what all of that time went into.  The opening riff from &quot;...Millionaire&quot; gets your head working immediately and it stays in motion from then on.  &quot;No One Knows&quot; is about as catchy as singles get today with monsterous drum-work from Dave Grohl.  Further highlights include &quot;Sky is Falling&quot;, &quot;Go with the Flow&quot;, &quot;Hanging Tree&quot;, &quot;Another Love Song&quot; and the humorous &quot;Mosquito Song&quot;.  The album centerpiece for me happens to be &quot;God is in the Radio&quot;.  Mark Lanegan's vocals are the best he's done and the main riff sticks in your head after first listen.  The extened soloing at the end adds to the conviction that the song is carried out with.<br />This is a hard rock album in every sense of the word that should appeal to old and newer fans alike.  Definately worth the investment.
B00006G8G1|3.0|I sure was expecting something a lot better than this. Like most reviews say, too many agles changes too fast. It's like that throughout the DVD. Even during the intro. The guys themselves are in top form and the performance is great. They've aged a lot since Maiden England, but the energy is still there. It's just the camera work that really ruins this DVD. Sometimes there's slight problems with the sound quality, but there's not enough of that to ruin the DVD as far as sound quality goes. To me, that gives it a more raw sound which I like. This DVD should be for absolutely true Maiden fans only. Otherwise I'd wait until they release Live After Death and Maiden England on DVD. (which they better do!) But stay away from Raising Hell.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I wasn't really familiar with Dream Theater at the time of listening to this CD. My boyfriend is a HUGE, HUGE fan and when he bought it, it was in his car.. ALL THE TIME.. the first song I heard that I really liked was &quot;Solitary Shell&quot; I thought it was brilliant, and then as it ran into &quot;About to Crash (reprise)&quot; and &quot;Losing Time&quot; I was like, Wow this is really, really good. I thought the 2nd cd was amazing, then after hearing the 1st CD I was really really in love with this band. &quot;Blind Faith&quot;, &quot;Misunderstood&quot;, &quot;Glass Prison&quot; are some of the best songs off of CD1, &quot;The Great Debate&quot; sounds a bit Tool-like in melody and vocal, but is none the less an amazing rock song. It could do without the bits and clips of people talking in the beginning but this song completely blows me away. And &quot;Disappear&quot; is the one song that can bring me to tears, the lyrics are moving, and the music is.. incredible.. This CD is a must get for even a starting DT fan... simply incredible. CD1 also begins where &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; left off.. if you listen carefully. CD2 starts with an amazing Overture, which is reminiscent of Final Fantasy (it sounds very FF like), leading into About to Crash which has the most.. amazing hook, such a great song. Both CDs are amazing and so worth the price. A must have!!
B000002UUX|5.0|Megadeth were a great band, but &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; was, in my humble opinion, their defining work.  Everything just came together for them here.  Four albums into his Megadeth career, Dave Mustaine was at his creative peak, and on this album Marty Friedman joined him to form Megadeth's classic guitar duo (the other ones were good too, though).  David Ellefson contributed rumbling bass lines that, in a welcome change from some of Megadeth's other albums, could actually be heard, and Nick Menza's drumming was superb.<br />And then there's the songwriting, which may very well be Megadeth's best.  I find &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; to be unquestionably Megadeth's most ambitious effort, with Dave writing material far more complex and progressive than most thrash.  &quot;Five Magics&quot; has one of the coolest song stuctures I've ever heard, with blindingly fast mini-guitar solos being inserted into the verses between Dave's vocal lines.  &quot;Hangar 18&quot; and &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot; are epics in the truest sense of the word, lengthy masterpieces with pretty much everything you could want in a metal song: complex arrangements, emotional vocals, crunching riffs, and lofty solos.  &quot;Poison Was the Cure&quot; is shorter than the aformentioned tunes, but it's so fast it would've been hard to make it any longer, and it makes a great headbanger in the middle of the album.  In short, if you haven't picked this album up already, do so now.  You won't regret it.
B00000C3G6|5.0|I owned this album on vinyl many years ago and it was always one of my favorites. I was so happy to see it available again on CD and it hasn't lost any of its appeal. It takes me back to my old hippie days and fills my head with all that wonderful music and all those wonderful singers and songwriters of the 60's and 70's. The sensitivity of the guitar work is amazing. It's rare that we see anything like this in the music being produced today. What a treat!!
B000055Y0X|4.0|This movie makes no sense but you want to keep watching.  While not quite like watching a trainwreck, the effect is somewhat the same.  Randomness does work sometimes.  As if following the axioms of Chaos theory, Stanely Kubrick has made a beautiful, entertaining and weird-funny and occasionally ha-ha funny movie.  The progression of the movie can be episodic and choppy, but that adds to character of the movie.  I highly recommend this movie when you just absolutely need a little nihilistic confusion in your life.  It really is a classic.
B000069AUI|5.0|similar but distinct from parachutes.  same great sound but doesn't feel like a repeat.  great album for just about anywhere.  not distracting but still entertaining.
B000069HKH|5.0|I never thought I'd say it, but with this album it becomes impossible to ignore the fact that Bruce Springsteen now joins Dylan as one of the two gods of American music.  For nearly thirty years he has continued to grow and innovate, and following him on that journey has been one of the great pleasures in life.  This album, of course, is special for a lot of reasons.  The Boss took on the role of National Bard in this one, much like Walt Whitman did a century and a half ago during another crisis.  It could easily have failed; he could easily have looked cheap, or maudlin, or opportunistic.  But he rose to the occasion and gave America the voice she so desperately needed.  Springsteen sees the world and its people complexly, and he communicates that complexity in his poetry (what else would you call such moving and precise lyrics?).  Hemingway said there are no second acts in American literature, and the same could be said of American music--except for Springsteen.  He just gets more amazing with each passing year.
B00005QIPH|4.0|When i first heard \\"Is This It\\", I knew absolutely NOTHING about this band. However, i was the same way with the White Stripes BEFORE they were on every music shelf and on the radio and BEFORE any music videos they made had mainstream release. In that instance, I had no bias towards the band to begin with and, as a true fan of music, i found that \\"Is This It\\" is a very solid album. It has no low points, like how on some albums you like the whole thing except for that one song so you skip it. It is full of very catchy tunes that, despite lacking complexity, have a unique blend of classic rock and modern styling. Other reviewers seemed led astray by The Strokes because they were expecting this vintage, Iggy & the Stooges-style punk rock and thats just not the case. \\"Is This It\\" is simply good music. Nice and mellow, but full of energy. Relaxing-with-a-book-in-one-hand-and-a-cup-of-coffee-in-the-other kind of music. Even still, i cannot claim to be an expert in the genre as so-called \\"indie rock\\" is not my area of expertise. This album gets 4 stars from me as it pales only in comparison to The White Stripe's album \\"De Stijl\\".
0783117388|5.0|My partner and I love to sit in the evening after the day's work is done and watch a movie or something on TV.  Frequently, we've worked and done chores until late in the evening and there isn't time to watch an entire movie.  We like to watch whatever TV shows we might have taped.  But in the summer, and sometimes even the rest of the year, there just isn't enough on worth watching to come up with even 1/2 of TV watching for a night.  We decided to try buying some DVDs of TV shows we thought we'd like.<br />Sex and the City is perfect for this.  We've enjoyed it from the beginning but it actually gets better after the first year because the characters deepen.  All the actors are excellent, but I particularly enjoy Kim Catrall whose comic timing is impeccable and who has to be the current master of the comedic doubletake.  This show makes me laugh out loud.  I definitely knew women just like these when I was young and single and living on the east coast.<br />The episodes even get funnier when you watch them more than once.
B000069AT7|5.0|I don't care what any of you think.  E.T. is the best movie ever made. It's my persona; fave, too. I agree with some that if it didn't have the music in it, it wouldn't be as good.  I have seen this movie near or over 50 times. I am 14 now and I have watched it more than any kid probably ever has in his/her life.  I am not gonna say I have watched it more than anyone else in the world.  I am just saying that I love this movie! It gets better each time.  Here are a few things I noticed in the 20th anniversary:<BR>When he is chasing his ship, there are brand-new scenery shots (magnificently beautiful, I might add).<BR>E.T. gets a bath.<BR>A few of the swear words...were dimmed out when pronounced.<BR>In the original movie Elliott's costume was pulled down straight in the \\"flying scene\\" but in this version (and on the old video boxes) his cape is fluttering out behind him.<BR>A small Halloween addition where Elliot and his sibling's mom is looking for them, and Gertie blurts out some funny dialogue.<BR>And the #1 hated scene, the digitally added walkie-talkies.<BR>Most noticable out of everything is the picture.  The colors are beautiful and the sound (I love Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital Surround EX) [I would love to hear DTS but I have no DTS decoder :(<BR>I have loved this movie since my aunt bought this movie for me years before she died.  This was the best thing she ever gave to me.  Since then, it is untraceable.  I have rented this movie out about 5 times at Video Vault (now Movie Gallery) and a lot more at the public library.  I finally got my friend to beg his mom to let me borrow this film.  I could watch any version I wanted.  I like the 20th Anniversary better because of the remastered sound and the restored footage/picture.  <BR>I leave you, the audience, with one question: does anyone know where I can find a good DTS decoder but I don't have to spend an arm-and-a-leg on it?  I hate the sound on my computer (cuz I have just 2 computer speakers) and I have a stereo that releases good sound.  I just need a good DTS decoder.  If you can help me, please help me!
B0000640VO|2.0|A beautiful cinema exercise, especially fine in terms of application of digital effects & [green] processing to something NOT scifi/war/action, but a saccharin mess/miss as a fable or narrative. Or picaresque imagistic collage or whatever anyone wants to call it. Industrial cubic zirconia? Attempts at fable, especially high romantic comic fable, rise or fall by ringing true or false. Ring is subjective. Those entering darkened mall theaters seeking mysteriously empowered mischievious green fairy civility might feel/argue that it passes? But it's a video now & it's Disney/Shyamalan/Spielberg, [para-]soap operatic NOT dramatic, tightly controlled/artificial NOT loosely natural/inviting, seriously charming self-indulgence in the service of something archly/Frenchly infantile? Occasional flash refs to earthbound sex & the vagaries/glitches of mating are perfunctory. Amelie is Pollyanna with Tinkerball traces? Titania denatured, minus flashy temper & capacity for selfish caprice? Jeunet may feel that one must choose to make either a nice (positive is his usual English word) OR a NOT nice movie, that a natural mix is just too difficult/confusing for movie audiences? Perhaps he's right? <br />Jeunet claims quasi-autobiographical basis for tales/episodes (other than the old globetrotting gnome trick), & DVD bonus stuff provides all sorts of hints/clues about why Jeunet, like many other auteurs, might be wise to depend more upon others for stories/scripts? The game SEEMS Puckish enough on its surface, but it gets worse as it goes, loses its force as Amelie herself is dolled up/out/down past either traditional fairy/witch or merely human, finally centered in an other-obliterating way? All males are caricatured. Amelie's eventual love object Nino is especially weak, pure cipher, as if projecting Amelie & girls from his right brain exhausted Jeunet entirely. No real Bottom, so neither here nor there, neither [humble/bad/sweet/stupid] play within play nor whole complex comedy? Shakespeare himself didn't have the hubris to aspire to DIRECTLY write/stage Bottom's bottomless dream? What we feel after a successful romantic comedy is an adult amazement, the effect of a mix, shaken not machined, of separate unblendably dissonant players/worlds. It can be approached ONLY by indirection, interplay? Amelie develops into Shirley Temple King Kong, way too cute/gigantic for anyone/thing else to escape her sway? NOT actress error. Writer/director (or auteur) goof. Streamed froth. Waste of technical talent, VERY Shyamalan-like.   <br />Quite pretty, though, with many gracefully framed shots of green Paris. If you can stand the bunny & teddy bear cloud effects & Jeunet's clear wish to control/do everything, you'll have fun.
B000024O2Q|4.0|Cartoonish songs that wears out a formula so exausted by now.If you have to buy one,why not this one.The problem is that we were fifteen such a long time ago.I suggest to the mothers and fathers that they buy this to their timid son to arouse his listening sensibility.Am i kidding you here?I actually like THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST and THE TROOPER a lot.As for the rest,it is a matter of one's tolerance.But the father suddently remembering his younger days burst into tears saying isn't this a rip off of the old BLACK SABBATH albums?You know sometimes fathers can get to the point too.

0380977788|4.0|Master of the bizarre Neil Gaiman has tried his hand at EVERYTHING. Novels, horror, sci-fi, fantasy, plays, scripts, comics... He has done it all. Well, almost all. The only thing missing in his repertoire is a children's novel. But here comes Coraline, a very touching and very entertaining story that will touch young and old alike.<br />Coraline is a very lonely girl. She has moved in this big house and has nothing to do. On one rainy day, she goes exploring and finds a door in a closet. This door leads to another world, where people looking almost exactly like the ones from the real world, where the places look almost like the ones she used to seein the real world. Only these new 'other' people and places are slightly different, darker.<br />When Coraline's parents are kidnapped by her 'other' mother, it will be up to her to save them and to defeat this evil woman who is pretending to be her mother. She goes on a wild goose chase in order to find the things that will help her defeat this evil woman.<br />Gaiman is a master at creating different and weird places that still feel real for the reader. And he does it perfectly in Coraline. This magical little tale can be dark at times, but Coraline is such an amazing character placed in such an odd and interesting setting that you'll never find a dull moment in this book. <br />I don't think there is a single thing Gaiman does not excell in. His writing is just magical. It grips you by the guts and makes you smile, makes you frown, makes you feel a slew of emotions all at once. With Coraline, he has created a story - and, most importantly, a heroine - that everyone will love and remember for a very long time.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Beggar's Banquet is the first in a string of albums in which the Stones could do no wrong musically. Try this puppy on for size: it'll knock your socks off guarenteed. The cover alone says enough: a dirty, putrid toilet nestled before a gloriously decorated (with graffiti) yellow-stained wall. For an unmatched rock n' roll/blues blend that puts the rest of the music world to shame, check out this album by the only group worthy of the title \\"Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\\"! <br />Here's a quick list of the songs, my (obsequious and hyper-adjectival) comments, as well as a personal favorite moment/part/aspect of each tune.<br />1. Sympathy for the Devil-- unreal; one of rock's all time great tunes; smart, cool lyrics; a constant build-up of energy. Personal favorite moment: Keith's solo.<br />2. No Expectations-- Soft, quiet, and lovely; impeccable slide guitar by Jones; Hopkins adds flavor with an intimate piano backdrop. Personal favorite moment: Jones' slide guitar work.   <br />3. Dear Doctor-- a Country-Blues beauty; Jagger and Co.'s singing is top-notch; irresistable acoustic sound; Personal fav moment: Jagger(?) hilariously reading a note he found in his pocket.<br />4. Parachute Woman-- Sounds a lot like it belongs on Exile on Main Street; decadent and down-right raunchy; muscular riff; great Jones guitar work; Personal fav part: tightness and speed, in an effort to avoid censorship no doubt.<br />5. Jigsaw Puzzle-- Dylan-esque lyrics; Non-stop barrage of sound leaves one puzzled: will it ever end?; Jones in another incredible slide guitar performance; Charlie rules. 'Nuff said. Personal Favorite moment: Nicky Hopkins rocking and rolling on the keyboard.<br />6. Street Fighting Man: Has, next to Satisfaction, my favorite Stones' riff; unprecedented barrage of guitars; lyrics are revolutionary (literally). Fav moment: Charlie's first couple of beats.<br />7. Prodigal Son-- Another tremendous Stone's romp down country-blues lane; the only non-Jagger/Richards song on the album; placed next to Street Fighting Man, the two tracks show off Mick's vocal range with great success. Favorite part: subtle yet awesome harmonica playing. Note: For an interesting/cool song with a similar feel and sound, check out Zeppelin's \\"Poor Tom\\" which can be found on Coda.   <br />8. Stray Cat Blues: Two words: Charlie. Watts. A powerful antithesis to Prodigal Son; even more raunchy than Parachute Woman; hard rocker with searing guitar work; flawless blues/rock blend; Personal favorite part: dizzying, almost frightening final two minutes of sweet jam action. Did I mention Charlie rules?<br />9. Factory Girl: An intimate glimpse of a working class folk relationship/mentality; short but to the point acoustic gem. Personal favorite part: very appropriate fiddle/mandolin conbination used throughout.<br />10. Salt of the Earth: Another prophetic glimpse into the future: has a feeling similar to Let it Bleed's You Can't Always What You Want (though not as sprawling); uplifting in a gospel/evangelical sorta way; Personal Favorite part: Hopkins again with his powerful piano accompanyment leading the way to the end of this incredible album, the first of four must haves by the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World!
B0000696I0|5.0|Only one year after \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - The Movie\\" is released, we are presented with a sequel. And I must say though I find the first movie a fun and entertaining movie, I found this sequel lots more fun and better than the first!<br />It's only been a short while since the end of Shredder and the scattering of the Foot Clan. Searching for a new home, Leonardo (Mark Caso), Raphael (Kevin Scott), Michaelangelo (Michelan Sisti), Donatello (Leif Tilden), and their master Splinter (Kevin Clash) are forced to stay with their reporter friend April O'Neil (Paige Turco). But soon they discover that a TGRI scientist Professor Jordan Perry (David Warner), might have some answers about the ooze that had mutated them 15 years ago. Unfortunately for them, they find out that the evil Shredder (Francois Chau) is still alive and regrouping his Foot Clan. Shredder also wants to discover the secret of the ooze so he steals the last container of it, along with the Professor. Can the turtles stop the Shredder before he puts his terrible plans to work? Also starring Ernie Reyes Jr. as Keno, a young teenager with martial skills, and special appearance by Vanilla Ice as himself performing a rap song.<br />The whole atmosphere of \\"The Secret of the Ooze\\" is much brighter than the first movie, one good point for this movie. This is Jim Henson's last movie to work on so you will notice in the beginning you will read, \\"In memory of Jim Henson\\". He does an incredible job with the turtles and Splinter, and also with two other mutants Rahzar and Tokka.<br />I found this movie to be a lot more funny and incredibly hilarious comparing to the first. I especially love it whenever Splinter tells his students to do '10 flips... now'. :) Another improved point in the movie from the first is the more likable Ninja Turtle's characters. Leonardo is more of a leader, though he is teased by Raphael about being so respectful to Mast Splinter. Raphael seems to have calmed to hot temper a lot moreand is much more bearable. We can see Donatello's skills in computers and his love for science. And Michaelangelo, he's still a 'very cool dude'! I loved it when he started repeating lines from \\"Casablanca\\" to April. VERY funny!<br />The fighting also feels better choreographed though the turtles don't use their weapons very much. The best fight scenes are the beginning fighting against the looters, all the fights against the Foot, the end fight with Rahzar and Tokka. Keno is also a very exceptionally martial artists and it's fun to see him pull a few of his own moves.<br />To sum it up, don't miss out on \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Secret of the Ooze\\"! I assure that you'll simply love it! Rated PG for the fighting though not at all graphic. No language problems so this movie should be no problem for younger kids. And the movie is for the whole family since my parents also loved watching this with me! But I recommend you first see the first movie because throughout the movie there are references to it. Also, don't forget to check out the third movie!
0380820846|2.0|I LOVE Julia Quinn, and I think she's a talented, funny writer.  Having said that, I don't think I should FORCE myself to finish this book.  If I didn't know the quality writing Julia is capable of, maybe I would like this... not sure.<br />The beginning reminded me of all those Sweet Valley High books I read as a (very!) young girls (and if you read them too, you know just what I'm talking about) where the 2 main characters (twins Elizabeth and Jessica) were described in the same way, and the first chapter was the same in all 100+ books.  Ms. Quinn actually includes a LOT from the prior her earlier books- it feels more like filler than background or perspective.  And I have NO idea why Colin is falling in love with Penelope.  It just doesn't work.  But I love Julia, and I'll be back for the next book!  I guess that means I should finish this one (groan- homework!)
0446605409|4.0|Nelson Demille tells this story of a New York City homicide detective on leave and vacationing on the north fork of Long Island who is abruptly thrown into a murder investigation with wit, sarcasism, and ease. His laid back style of writing allows the reader to feel as though Demille is telling the story to him in a simple conversation. The story is very despcriptive, however, does not drag into unneccesary details. Demille's descriptions of the scenery of the wine country and all parts of the eastern end of Long Island were intricate and detailed. Although, I personally, am a resident of Mattituck and know every town, store, and restaurant Demille mentioned, I'm sure a reader who is from across country could imbibe the fresh, farm-loving, vineard-filled elements of Long Island through Demille's story. Though, suspenseful and riveting, I found that some scenes could sometimes drag on, i even nodded out a few times, although that may have just been the sun making me sleepy. JOhn Corey's adventures in Plum Island were main parts of the story and for the most part kept my interest, sometimes falling into repetitive plots and suggestions but usually one of john corey's smart... comments would liven the situation up. Overall, the combination of Demille's humor, the suspenseful murder investigation, and Detective Corey's love affairs make the book a delightful and light summer read.

B00005JKG7|4.0|Finally! The Fog comes to DVD! The Fog is one of my favorite horror films, and it's great to see it get the full DVD treatment!<br />  The plot is simple: On her 100th anniversary, the small hamlet of Antonio Bay is beseiged by a strange fog, cloaking the vengeful ghosts of a murdered leper colony, whose deaths provided the wealth necessary to start the town. Writer/Director John Carpenter gets right to the point, and there isn't a wasted frame of film in this tightly paced chiller. The scene where the men on the fishing boat see the ghost-ship is one of the classic movie creep-outs, and the ending is great. This film  really harks back to the old ghost story films of the 40's.<br />  The DVD is full-frame on one side, and the widescreen side of the disc has all of the extras, including commentary by Carpenter and co-writer/producer Debra Hill, an old documentary and a made-for-the-DVD documentary, trailers and commercials, posters and print ads, and lots more. (I would have liked to have seen more about the makeup effects for Blake and his crew, but that's just me...) The film transfer is GREAT- The Fog has never looked better, and the colors are lovely and vibrant. I even managed to find an easter egg! On the &quot;Special features&quot; screen, tab up until a pair of glowing eyes appear in the fog- press enter and you'll see a brief (a little under three minutes) music video of behind-the-scenes-footage from the making of the film.<br />  Overall, The Fog is a must-have for fans of Ghost stories or John Carpenter. Now lets see Escape From New York and Prince of Darkness get the deluxe treatment.....
B00006AW2J|5.0|The Rolling Stones have always been problematic when it came to making classic albums, when compared to their rivals The Beatles: even on their best albums, like \\"Aftermath\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Let It Bleed\\", there were always a couple of clunkers which disrupted the flow and feel of the work.  \\"Beggars Banquet\\" remains their finest album simply because it is (with the possible exception of \\"Dear Doctor\\") track-for-track their most consistent, which helps to maintain a masterful mood throughout.  The new remaster couldn't be any better, and although I don't have an SACD player it still played remarkably loud and clean on my modest stereo system.  All of the remasters have been a major improvement, and along with \\"Aftermath\\" this is one of the best (for proof, just take one listen to the old and new CD versions of \\"Factory Girl\\").<br />The album opens with one of the most famous and beloved tracks in rock history, which paints a harrowing and hypnotic portrait of the dark side, before settling into exquisite evocations of working class life (hence the title).  Although the pure blues simplicity of the album was an abrupt turnaround from the ornate psychedelia of \\"Satanic Majesties\\", elements of psych sophistication pop up in \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" and the close of \\"Street Fighting Man\\"; although Brian Jones' incoherent presence was a problem during the sessions, there is no doubt that his musical genius (even if as nebulous as a certain \\"feel\\" of personality) is part of what makes the album so great--after he left the group became increasingly more ordinary and formulaic in approach, and by the mid-70s his presence was sorely missed.  The whole atmosphere of \\"Beggars\\" <BR>is hazy and unique, and was the start of the group's so-called \\"classic\\" period which would last until \\"Exile On Main St.\\". But whether it was a result of Jones' presence, or Jagger-Richard's lyrics (which were the best they would ever pen), or the unique musical vision represented by all the players--which was steeped in blues and yet transcended the genre with infusions of country, folk, latin samba, hard rock and the last remnants of psych color--this one remains my all-time favorite.  <br />The only weak track, \\"Doctor Doctor\\", is OK but sounds like a novelty country joke; the group would do this sort of thing much better on later albums like \\"Exile\\".  There were certainly better outtakes from the sessions, like \\"Family\\", \\"Blood Red Wine\\", \\"Still A Fool\\" and especially \\"Highway Child\\" (which sounds like a potential hit single) with which it could be replaced; for some reason ABKCO declined to add bonus tracks to these remasters (maybe they're waiting to put them on a box set?).  But the rest, from the epic \\"Sympathy\\" to the fragile \\"No Expectations\\", mysterious \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\", powerful \\"Street Fighting Man\\" and closing anthem \\"Salt Of The Earth\\" are well-chosen and have stood the test of time with flying colors.  I'm not sure why \\"Exile\\" gets all the accolades these days, when \\"Beggars\\" seems to be coming from a higher place...I have now played this remaster four times in a row, have heard it in record stores, out of car windows and at parties, and will never get tired of it.
B00006690G|5.0|I really love this cd and i hate how everyone says that eminem is so bad and his lyrics are terrible, but really i love his lyrics and they are just sooo true and some of the songs he is soo sweet, like Hailies song and sing for the moment and i have such a short attention span, this is the only cd that i can listen ALL the way through.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Songs for the Dead is a fantastic album - its original, varied, but most importantly the songs are fantastic. There are no average songs on here, every one is brilliant and every one is distinctive. The addition of Dave Grohl on drums has enhanced the Queens' sound, and its particularly evident on the intro to 'A Song For The Dead'  where the drumming on the intro is just TOO cool! 'No One Knows' is the perfect first single of here and deserves to be a huge success. The Queens' have found a consistancy now and I can't wait to here these songs live! A brilliant album!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a wonderful miniseries.The casting is just perfect and the story is terrific. I don't know what else to say ,but that it was great and I hated for the story to end...I wanted more!!!!
B00005V0X5|3.0|My first introduction to Metal was Metallica. After I collected all their albums and wanting more to fulfill my metal needs, I heard a Megadeth song on the radio. It was Angry Again, and from their on I was in love with the band. I started with buying Countdown to Extinction until finally working up to Kill is my Business...And Business Is Good. I usually leave debut albums for bands I collect until last because they are \\"usually\\" their weakest efforts. In megadeth's case, that statement is true. That doesn't mean it's a bad album. The standout on this album has to be MECHANIX. A great tune written when Dave Mustaine was still with Metallica, and is even better than Metallica's version titled THE FOUR HORSEMEN. The only downfall to this remastered version is that THESE BOOTS had to be editied do to a lawsuit. I personally think the editied version is hilarious, but most fans will be really disgusted. Other than that the sound is great and even better than Megadeth's send and third albums PEACE SELLS...BUT WHO'S BUYING? and SO FAR, SO GOOD, SO WHAT? If your a collector like me, save KILLING IS MY BUSINESS...AND BUSINESS IS GOOD! as your last entry into your Megadeth collection. Start With Countdown To Exctinction.
B000002J1F|4.0|Fragile is often thought of as THE seminal Yes album, and with songs like \\"Roundabout,\\" \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" and \\"Long Distance Runaround,\\" that's hardly surprising.  The problem is that these three songs comprise 3/4 of the \\"real\\" songs on the album.  The fourth \\"real\\" song, South Side of the Sky, is a virtual unknown to non-Yes fans, but it is nearly as strong as the three well-known songs on the album.    The rest of the album consists of five \\"solo\\" pieces showcasing each of the five band members.  Bill Bruford's \\"Five Per Cent for Nothing\\" is unlistenable (except, perhaps, for drummers).  Mercifully, it tracks at less than a minute.  Jon Anderson's \\"We Have Heaven,\\" Rick Wakeman's \\"Cans and Brahms,\\" and Chris Squire's \\"The Fish\\" all are interesting, but aren't worth more than one or two listens.  The only one of the five \\"solo\\" pieces really worth much is Steve Howe's incredible classical guitar piece, \\"Mood for a Day.\\"    Make no mistake, Fragile has incredible songs on it and is the first assemblage of the most popular Yes lineup (note that I've given it four stars notwithstanding my negative comments).  However, there is a LOT of filler here.
6301095294|4.0|And lets just face it - The Queen's speech wasn't exactly a gas, either. This film has its wierd moments, yes, but there are some shots that are funny and interesting, such as the part in which Nicole, the little girl, is playing on John's lap, and of course, I Am The Walrus. That is, as many reviewers have said, the highlight of the film. I don't recommend this film to anybody who absolutely HATES the Beatles. I DO recommend the film to diehard fans (Such as myself), who just cannot get enough of the Fab Four and will watch anything.
B00004RF8J|5.0|As good or maybe even better than the Broadway version.  This movie is super great.  Ellen Greene who i admire so very much gives the best performance of her life. Her talent and her extremely powerful singing voice is unmatched. I absolutely love her. Rick plays a wonderful Seymore and basically the whole cast is just great.It's a fun and sick musical to watch and i would put this in the same group as &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;.  The 5.1 stereo sound engulfs you in splender and will have you humming the tunes long after the film is over.  Buy it now and take in the fun.  Well worth every dollar.
0790729628|3.0|Agree with the others that the voice over is critical to this movie.  ONe of the basic appeals is the futuristic setting with the 1930's style approach.  It is 5 stars with the VO and 3 stars without it<br />
0553573403|5.0|This was a superb novel and easily one of the best works of fantasy I have read in many years. Game of Thrones is a massive epic story set in an imaginary world that resembles Europe in the middle ages.  The story centers on key members of the prominent \\"houses\\" (a.k.a. clans) that are competing for power.  It is a story of intrigue, suspense, adventure, romance, murder mystery, and coming of age, all rolled into one great absorbing novel. There are heroes you will love, enemies you will hate, and a host of others in between.<br />A warning: at over 800 pages this book (the first of several to come) is a big investment.  It is not fast reading; there are numerous characters to keep track of, and the scope of the novel is huge.  Thankfully, Martin gives us a helpful appendix that lists the major families and their members.  In the first few hundred pages I found myself flipping back to the appendix regularly. But it does not take long to become familiar with the players, and your investment soon pays off.  I am completely hooked, and I can't wait to read the rest of this magnificent and complex tale.  I highly recommend this for all readers of fiction.
B00003CXAR|5.0|jaws was a phenomenom when it came out in 1975 and it still a fabulous movie. Spielberg can thank bruce the shark for what he has become thanks to this film and the producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown.
0805066691|5.0|Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is a profoundly moving book.  It takes you back to a time of new beginnings, when things could've been done right, but were inevitably done wrong.  And the original people of the American land who were done wrong by.  Wounded Knee is a place, where spirits live, Indian's do the \\"ghost dance\\" and inevitably people lay in passing, from war and slaughter.<br />Dee Brown's novel is a must for anyone who wants insight and understanding into an indigenous culture.<br />Wounded Knee tells the tale of the &quot;American West&quot; form the other side - the American Indian's perspective.  With quotes and chants from famous names that appear synonymous with the \\"Cowboys &amp; Indians\\" culture of the American frontier.<br />An accurate and emotional journey is what the reader will undertake as they take on the naive understandings of these proud people who are inevitably fighting a culture and system of prejudices they can not win.  Chieftains like Sitting Bull, Geronimo, Crazy Horse, will inspire and bring feelings of admiration and the sense of oppressing injustice to the forefront of your emotions.<br />If you are able to read this book without being truly stirred on some emotional level, then you would appear to be super human or perhaps a little more in human than most.<br />If you seek inspiration and motivation, understanding and sense of being or purpose, I believe you will find these things in Dee Brow's book when you look at and read about the lives of these amazing people.<br /><br />It is my favorite book!
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this film. This movie had so much humor and although I will admit that the first time I saw *Emma* I failed to find much humorous. A movie for people who find intelectual humor more to their enjoiment and not slapstick.
B000002JEV|4.0|The \\"BBC Sessions\\" showcases the awesome musical ability of all four members of the 70's rock titan Led Zeppelin. Disc 1 is mainly composed of heavy rock and blues familiars from their first two official releases. \\"Communication Breakdown\\" is found during three different points during this album, with each track showing the vast improvement of Zeppelin's playing ability in just three short months of touring in 1969. This is also effectively displayed with the inclusion of \\"You Shook Me\\" and \\"I Can't Quit You,\\" played from the first \\"Top Gear\\" BBC Sessions in March of 1969 and during the \\"One Night Stand\\" BBC recordings from August of the same year. The blues drenched standout \\"Travelling Riverside Blues\\" features white hot Blues riffing by Page, and includes song writing credits that are typically documented as produced by Page, Plant, and Robert Johnson, who was one of many mysterious \\"fifth\\" song writers of Led Zeppelin. For those who aren't hardcore Zep heads like myself, Led Zeppelin was a band notorious for stealing lyrics directly out of old blues favorites. My only complaint about Disc 2 is that Robert Plant's voice cracks during the opening track \\"The Immigrant Song\\" and the then-yet-to-be-released \\"Black Dog,\\" which kicks off with the opening drum beat of \\"Out On the Tiles.\\" Outside of those two weak moments, Disc 2 delivers the goods and then some. Led Zeppelin flexes their heavy metal muscles on a rip-roaring version of \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" which was also one of the first live performances of this song. The 60's flower power side found on \\"Zeppelin III\\" or \\"Zeppelin IV\\" is also displayed with perfection on \\"Going to California,\\" \\"That's the Way,\\" and \\"Thank You,\\" which is a great way to end a concert. Outside of a couple of dips in sound quality caused by Father Time and an inept mixing board, \\"The BBC Sessions\\" is a perfect collector's item for Led Zeppelin fans. It is a perfect reminder to those who have forgotten how awesome Led Zeppelin was when they were playing together.
0316666343|5.0|This was probably one of the best books I have ever read.  My best friend died recently and after reading this book it really made me realize that death is not such a terrible thing, and it made me less afraid of it.  The Lovely Bones is bittersweet, emotional, funny, and heart breaking. If you are looking for a great read, I HIGHLY recommend The Lovely Bones.  It really lives up to its expectations.
0345440900|5.0|This is a fantastic book - full of information that all Moms and Dads should pay close attention to.<br />I read it from cover to cover and my husband is doing the same. Tracy takes a daunting subject and breaks it down simply and straightforward.  She isn't there to cushion your ego - she's there to teach you how to be a better parent.
0316666343|1.0|If an imaginitive response to loss is what you want, read Toni Morrison's Beloved.  If a thoughtful response to loss is what you want, read Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried.  O'Brien's entire book deals with this theme, but the last story, \\"The Lives of the Dead,\\" deals movingly with the death of a girl.  Sebold's book is simply over-the-top, especially when the narrator inhabits the body of a friend.  I felt embarrassed for the writer, the publisher, the agent, and everyone else involved.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Okay i saw this in the theaters and thought it was a better movie than the first. It's much more comic book than the previous film which i like. Blade [is great] in this , much more than the first. Better martial arts, much scarier, much more gruesome. The DVD is so loud, i have DTS and listened to both it, and the dolby digital version and dang is it loud. I put another dvd in after , and didn't change the volume and it was much lower. Sound is excellent, picture is excellent, they did a great job with this DVD. The 2nd DVD is just full of features and documentaries about the making of Blade 2 and you realize how much work went in to the \\"little things\\" in this movie. I really feel like i got my money's worth with buying this one. If you like Blade 2 then buy the DVD. Can't wait for Blade 3.
B000002UB3|4.0|All though this is not The Beatles best album to say the Stones are not sell outs is bs. Praising &quot;Emotional rescue&quot;? If the stones are not sell outs why do I here &quot;start me up&quot; in every commercial and why do they keep releasing &quot;product&quot; like &quot;voodoo lounge&quot; that sounds like they go through the motions. And how about those high priced ticket prices for ultra rich fans who never heard &quot;You got the silver&quot;. No what your talking about before you submit a review or back up your claim.
068484267X|1.0|I did not like this book at all! I have never disliked a book so much.  I read it because I like biography style book but this one was filled with whining.  He should never have used the X-rated parts at all and the ones that he did were VERY excessive and explicit.  DON'T READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU HAVE TO!!!
B000002C25|4.0|When 'Be here now' came out I was incredibly disappointed with it. In fact, I disliked the album so much that within months of it's release I wound up getting rid of it.<BR>Recently though, I found the interest in purchasing it again, more or less for giggles, and I found that I actually like it.<BR>Some of my original complaints were with the longevity of the songs, they would either take an eon to start or to finish, and the numerous Beatle references throughout, with Noel Gallager using at least 4 Beatle titles in his lyrics. Which brings up my biggest problem here with the sometimes very weak lyrical contexts. Such lines as &quot;Sing a song for me/one from Let it be&quot;, and &quot;I don't believe in everything I see/Y'know I'm blind so why d'you disagree&quot; make the listener think that Noel wasn't even trying when the songs were being written.<BR>On the good side, there are some great tunes here. &quot;D'you know what I mean?&quot;, &quot;Stand by me&quot;, and &quot;Don't go away&quot; are all excellent songs, and &quot;Magic pie&quot; is my personal favorite.<BR>Also of note is the general amount of energy here. It's a fun record that was apparently fun to make.<BR>All in all it's a great album to listen to if you can sit through all 70 odd minutes of it, and if you can put up with the occasonal weak line or two.
B000068TPN|5.0|While I have never served in the military, military tactics, weapons, and history have been a hobby of mine for most of my life.  <br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is easily the most moving film I have ever seen.  It is touching in a way no other film I have seen is; the movie is less about the battle than it is about the soldiers and their families.  The film is wonderfully uplifting, valueing ardent religious faith, morality, and strong family life, which lets the viewer relate to these young men, their wives, and their children in a very real way.  It was also refreshingly devoid of any political message.  Every vietnam vet. I have talked to about this movie found it very accurate, and deeply moving.<br />Some reviewers, both professional and on this site, have criticized \\"We Were Soldiers\\" for coming up with \\"contrived situations,\\" such as a very touching scene when Lt. Col. Hal Moore has to explain to his young daughter what a war is.  The fact is, that this scene actually happened nearly exactly as it was protrayed in the film, the only real difference being that in the film it occured several days before Moore shipped out, while in real life it happened the same night he was leaving.<br />People have also claimed that the battled, filmed in the hills of Northern California, looks nothing like the central highlands of Vietnam.  The truth is, that when (ret.) Gen. Hal Moore saw the location that had been picked for filming, he said it looked almost exactly like he remembered it.  Not all of Vietnam is rice patties and jungle.<br />(Ret.) General Hal Moore served as a consultant while this film was made, and was actually on the set during much of the filming.  His presence ensured that the movie is very accurate to what really happened during that first American vs. N. Vietnamese battle.  Much of the dialogue in the movie is lifted directly from the Hal Moore's book, so many of the lines were actually spoken by  the soldiers during those terrible 57 hours.<br />I cannotrecomend this movie highly enough, but watch it with a friend or family member, as you will want to talk about what you've just seen once the movie ends.

Are my loved ones near or far away in that other world?  I have and obviously so has this writer, for she has penned a story so poignant that it moves one to tears.  A must read for all those who wonder about the possibilities of life after death!
B000068QY7|5.0|I absolutely loved Definately Maybe, which kept me buying Oasis albums over the last several years, but none ever struck me as being all that great to listen too like the first and I tend not to listen to them much.  Much to my surprise Heathen Chemistry absolutely blew me away.  To me it sounds as if they are not trying quite as hard as they have on their past few and gone are the way too long ballads that all sound the same (thank goodness).  Noel sings a few songs and does sound a little rougher, but actually they blend into the album quite well.  That's not to say this album is like there first, just different and musically it may be the best that they have written, and now I have another Oasis album that will actually get some play time.
B000002GLE|4.0|Great! Early solo Sting live double disk. Makes me wish I was at the concert(s). I like that Sting combines Police songs with his solo material. This makes a great segue album from the Police into Sting's solo career. I gave it four stars because although the content is fantastic, Sting leaves himself room for improvement, and improve he consistantly does with every new release.
B000002699|5.0|In A Silent Way takes a bit of time to grow on you if you do not listen to it with an open mind.  That's the problem I had.  I bought this album originally a few years back and listened to it, finding it kind of boring and putting it in the stack with my other albums.  One night, however, I was feeling depressed and decided to listen to some old albums I never fully absorbed.  I happened to have been thinking about In A Silent Way, and so I pulled it out and brushed off the small amount of dust on the cover.  The case was still in perfectly good condition.  I put the album in and listened to it through headphones and had a beautiful experience.  Everything about the album is beautiful, ambient, mind-blowing.  I felt like slapping myself for sleeping on it for so long.  It's nice to listen to the album with your eyes closed for a while.  Also, another aspect of the album's booklet I found to be great fun is the optical illusion on the back of the booklet.  It says &quot;Miles Davis&quot; in reddish-letters (on the original version) and if you move it the red letters spelling out &quot;Miles Davis&quot; appear to bounce up and down.  I thought it was phenomenal, personally.  I even spent quite a while just watching the letters appear to be bouncing up and down in that weird way.  I found myself keeping the album on repeat for a while, it was late at night so I lost some sleep but it didn't matter anymore.  In A Silent Way is so incredibly intoxicating, it feels almost as if you're actually becoming high when you listen to it.  But it's a positive high, one that makes you feel good about yourself rather than the type of high that just postpones depression.  Look at the lineup of musicians on this album.  Each one of them is among the best on their instrument, we have Miles on trumpet (of course), Wayne Shorter on tenor and soprano saxophones, Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea on electric keyboards, Joe Zawainul on organ, John McLaughlin on guitar, Dave Holland on bass andthe amazing Tony Williams on drums.  The album starts off with the serene &quot;Shhh/Peaceful&quot;, which has soothing guitar and a pulsing drum beat from Williams.  Miles plays with a very airy-sounding low register purposely to give a more relaxed, heavenly feel.  However, you know it's not a technical flaw when he soars in the upper register with beauty and clarity.  The basslines remain focused throughout, and Shorter's soprano contributions are very similar to a saxophone version of Miles, the way the two go together on one song is just perfect.  &quot;In A Silent Way/It's About That Time&quot; starts off with a very slow guitar tune which kind of reminisces on the 1960's which were almost over (this LP was released in 1969).  Miles doesn't play a whole lot on this tune until the end when he really starts expressing himself.  It's actually even more &quot;peaceful&quot; here than it is on the first side.  Then the track gradually speeds up into a slight funk, although nothing extremely hard, making it easy on the listener.  When the album finally ends, it comes as a surprise, instead of the normal fading away that most albums have.  I am very amazed by this album, mostly because it's so relaxed and gives a great feeling (almost like another reviewer said, orgasmic).  If you are going through any problems in your life, just listen to this album, preferably with speakers.  You'll be amazed at how this album will relax you without the pretentious feeling that some so-called &quot;relaxing music&quot; will give you.  It also is much better to listen to than so-called relaxing elevator muzak (which Miles was too cool to do anyway).  This is probably the best album I've ever slept on for years.  Highly recommended.
B000005ILF|5.0|All good songs. Every damn one of them. Generally speaking, this CD has a darker sound than Sting's others. This one has a more personal quality to it as well.  I must agree with a few of the other reviews that this CD is underrated.  I am a Sting fan, and this one receives just as much playing time as any of his others (more than Nothing Like the Sun).  Don't be fooled by its lack of popularity.
B000069AUI|5.0|Sadly, I don't have Parachutes. Still, when the chance came I decided to get this follow up album. I've never thought a great deal of Coldplay, always thinking of them as aimless depressives. But I was of course, wrong... behind every miserable sounding Trouble and Don't Panic there's a real message, and usually an optimistic one. They're a band who may throw you, but listen again...<BR>   On to this album. I bought it on the strength of In My Place, a fantastic, cheerful song, the liveliest on the album probably. But it's not the best. Politik is a song with great variation, one minute moody and doom-ringing, then soaring and hopeful. The Scientist is probably my favourite, a heart-wrenching, tear-jerkingly beautiful piano song, which has all the love of Yellow with even more feeling. Singer Martin's voice is so strong yet frail, you'd think he honestly believed what he was singing. Which of course he does, with the political undertones of Politik.<BR>   Some of the album is a little bland - the tune to Daylight sounds maddeningly familiar - but there are highlights. Green Eyes and Warning Sign are beautiful, Amsterdam is sweet and the title track - a future single, I hope - is fantastic and not a second too long. <BR>   There is so much hope and inspiration in this happy, it's so incredibly uplifting sometimes, yet seems so serious that it makes you stop and feel what they're feeling. It's powerful stuff. I can't say if it's better than Parachutes, having only heard the singles from it. But still, a fantastic album that manages to be beautiful and haunting at the same time, that simply should not be missed.
B00000DLVA|3.0|I really like 'Erase and Rewind'. It has a certain quality that reminds me of The Sneaker Pimps' 'Becoming X'. \\"Marvel Hill\\" & \\"Junk of the Hearts\\" deserve an honorable mention.  The radio hit \\"My Favourite Game\\", while a catchy tune, isn't exactly representative of the rest of the cd.
B00006EXCC|4.0|Listen to the song &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot; and compare it to your LP version or the earlier CD master.  Is it just me or on the new remaster, doesn't it sounds like Mick is singing in another studio down the street?  However, the sound of &quot;Satisfaction&quot; and &quot;Time Is On My Side&quot; on the new High Tide/Green Grass CD is very good.
B000005YZM|2.0|Some good music here, but not enough to justify buying this CD.  I bought this under the misconception that \\"Time of the Season\\" and \\"She's Not There\\" were representative of the rest of the music of The Zombies, but they are not.  Unless you're a tried and true Zombies fan I suggest going with a less expensive, concise compilation such as Absolutely The Best. ...ASIN/B00000JMX0...
0425152251|2.0|I found a friend reading this book one day at a coffee house.  It looked interesting and a easy way to overview a huge subject, namely philosophy, in a relatively short period of time.  I ended up putting it on my wish list of books.  A year or two later, I actually found it at a used book store and picked it up.  As I read it, I found that many people I saw at restarants and coffee shops had read or heard of this book or were reading it currently.  This book has a strong word of mouth hype attached to it and perhaps that's how you came across it.  <br />Nevertheless, I found that the nonfictional material is covered very well, difficult topics are broken down into much easier understood principles.  The fictional part, consisting of a young girl, the nearly 15 year old Sophie, and her aged mystical philosophy teacher Albert, at times was very sophomoric.  Eventually i realized the best way to summarize this book is to call it a philosophy textbook for middle school children.  And in fact, in the end, that is what the author comes near to describing it as himself.<br />In the end, i'm not unhappy with it.  It was entertaining, and I learned a few things about philosophy on the way.  It's light and easy, and easily recommended.  It is an appetizer in the feast of philosophy.  Maybe it will satisfy the lightest appetite on philosophy, more than likely it will make you want to jump into something a little meatier.
B000002MUQ|5.0|Some of their best songs are on this cd. Great improvement in song writing compared to previous VH albums.  I wish they had never gotten rid of Sammy. I really dig this one.  I'm not going to get into the Sammy vs DLR debate.  As far as I'm concerned they are both great for Van Halen.  The songs on Balance are certainly darker than typical VH.  There seems to be more layered guitars than before and it actually works out to sound great.  I don't understand why people are complaining about \\"Amsterdam\\".  Sure the lyrics are silly and somewhat of a departure from the rest of the album (except \\"Big Fat Money\\") but isn't that more the typical VH partying rockin' music people love?  Amsterdam rocks as far as I'm concerned.  The ONLY song on Balance that I don't like is \\"Big Fat Money\\".  Van Halen is back with Sammy now in '04, and I can't wait to see them in Atlanta.  Hopefully they've got a few more cd's worth of tunes to put out.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I had personal issues with &quot;Still Waters&quot;, but this album not only revived my love of the brothers music, but endeared them to me, forever.  It left &quot;Still Waters&quot; in the dust, so far as the lack of rancor goes, and gave back what &quot;Still Waters&quot; took away, which was kindness of thought, and a heart filled with love.  &quot;Walking On Air&quot; is just about my favorite song of all time, except for the dozen, or so, other favorites of mine they have written, that rank right up there with it! Buy it, listen to it, you won't be disappointed!
B00006BTCA|2.0|I honestly don't know how this band made it this far with this singer. It's one thing to kind of sound like Ian Curtis. It's another to totally try and rip him off. This guy needs to chill and just sing. I mean, i like Joy Division a lot too, but not enough to stand in front of a microphone and TOTALLY try and sound like Ian Curtis. This is just completely rediculous. It's a shame too, because this is pretty good sounding record. the guitar sounds amazing, the drums are huge, the songwriting is decent... I just can't get by the vocals. If Interpol were a Joy Division cover band i would give them 5 stars. As it stands now, the only band i can give 5 stars to that sounds like Joy Division is Joy Division.<BR>Throw it down big man! THROW IT DOWN!
B000065U1N|5.0|After getting the movie I bought the book on which it is based.  This movie accurately depicts the American side, as written in the book.  While some reviewers have complained about the chest beating bravado of the soldiers, their attitudes, right or wrong, is the way they were trained.  This movie is very intense, and for all that it is even less intense than the book.  I am astounded by the political situation, lack of  our governments material support of Somalia (ie. the removing of the 2000 marines, not supplying tanks), the fog of war and what I consider command failures.  These include the p-3 orion orbiting overhead and watching the convoy, but not being able to talk to convoy direct, directions had to go through 2-3 levels of command.  What these men went through, why they went through it and what we thought we would achieve is dramatic.  The innocent Somalians being caught in the gunfight, women and children shooting at the Americans, seeing your friends killed, all in a chaotic situation.  Whether one questions are motives or right to be in Somalia, you can't help but admire the average soldier who followed orders.  For a realistic depiction of what went on that day in Mogadishu for American soldiers fighting for their lives, watch this movie.
0385495323|5.0|A very well written book on a fascinating subject.  I've read a lot of books on cryptography, particularly the historical aspects of the subject.  This is by far the best one.<br />All the others either skim over the details of how each cypher works, or ignore it all together.  Not Singh!  Wonderful details very well explained.  Whether you have a good math background or not, you'll find it interesting.
B00006FXB6|5.0|I had been waiting for this cd for almost a year now, and I got out of school on its release day, and quickly headed over to (local store) (sorry, Amazon). Picked it up and quickly went home. Listened to the first two tracks abnd repeated them about 6 times each, and did that for nearly the rest of the album. It's amazing, I'm telling you. BUY THIS ALBUM, IT IS SO DAMN INCREDIBLE... personally, I like Rated R better... but that's like comparing Nevermind to In Utero. They're both amazing, but Nevermind is just a little better. GREAT follow up.
0812550706|4.0|I started to read Speaker for the Dead before I realized that it was a sequel to Ender's Game. I liked the writing style so much that I went out and bought Ender's Game immediately. OSC has a way of telling the story from the point of view and feelings of Ender that is magical. I truly felt for Ender Wiggin and rooted for him the whole way. This was a wonderful story.
B00004Z459|2.0|This is your typical rap/nu metal doing everything that ensures sales with the chemically imbalanced, angst ridden adolescents of 2001. Namely by employing stale hip hop beats and very, very tired subject matter with a pop sheen mix and creative videos. The lyrics are run of the mill pouting delivered with utmost annoyance by lead whiner Chester Bennington and the tuneless yelling of MC Mike Shinoda. The music is unexceptional and unoriginal and DJ Joe Hahn dresses it all up for the TRL/mall rat crowd. You add all that up with heavy radio/video rotation and relentless touring and you have massive commercial success.<BR>It's not overly terrible, just far from the best the genre has to offer. One also has to question the honesty of the lyrics after reading the liner notes thanking the very same parents that they rip apart at length.<BR>\\"Hybrid Theory\\" ultimately is the sound of an alternative cash register ringing. It's music done for a demographic and done for cash...it's business, not art...but fine for those who don't care about things like integrity.
B0000062GE|5.0|Stabbing Westward really hits the nail hard with the hammer on DARKEST DAYS, probably one of the most angst-y rock albums to grace us in 1998. With angry and dark lyrics about failed relationships and the like, Stabbing Westward made the music more metallic than industrial. DARKEST DAYS is hard charging and full of emotion.<br />&quot;Save Yourself&quot; was a great choice for a first single...it rocks hard and gets down to the point. &quot;When I'm Dead&quot; and &quot;Torn Apart&quot;, however, win the battle for most angry rockers on this album. &quot;When I'm Dead&quot; is a twister of scalding guitars, angry vocals, and a fast pace. &quot;Torn Apart&quot; is also seething with angry guitars and throbbing drums. I really liked &quot;Sometimes It Hurts&quot;, the beat, the guitars, the words fit right together in the song. The video might make your head spin, but the song you can't forget. The closer &quot;Waking Up Beside You&quot; seems to be an ode to the longing of a morning with a lover. All in all, this whole album is what I had hoped Stabbing Westward would create.<br />DARKEST DAYS is what many fans have come to cherish from Stabbing Westward. It's a cathartic ride from start to finish, and you're carefully cautioned to hop on for the ride at your own risk. This really is angst at it's most genuine and painful...done Stabbing Westward style.
B000060OFT|5.0|I am almost 60 years old.  I doubt that the \\"GenX generation\\" as a differentiating category of adolescents as compared to adolescents of any era really exists.  However, I am the father of two or three such people, and I take the mantle of authority on that ground alone to review this delightful rendition of a timeless story.<br />I would never have deliberately turned on my television to watch this production, and I just fell on this production by accident.  It took me completely by surprise to see Mercutio as a young black teen-ager with dreadlocks speaking Elizabethan English with an American accent! To see the local Prince appearing as a black chief of police! and to see the epilogue being given in Elizabethan English by the nightly newscaster on television!<br />I would have (been upset) at this blasphemy had I merely read about it.  Therefore it was with difficulty that I could believe my ears and eyes which said this was an absolutely seamless juxtaposition of Shakespearian eloquence and modern street behavior, and an eloquent reminder to all of us about the eternal essence of adolescent life and its genuine tragedies. Romeo and Juliet is a story that demonstrates how Adolescence is a highly complicated and creative time of life on its own merits, and that it needs no new mysterious quality to explain its inherent mystery and the depth of the feelings of its current tenants.<br />This production was an education for me, and in one two-hour or so block of time, demonstrated as eloquently as I have ever heard it expressed our ultimate sameness through time and geographic location, and despite social or ethnic background.<br />The acting was brilliant uniformly. (How can that be?  Yet I saw it with my own eyes.)  The emotion was intense throughout; the depth of the human experience was fully evoked and, in true Shakespearian fashion, beautifully stated (and, of course, was beautifully received by me).
B000006TRV|3.0|Roger Waters rode on the coat-tails of Syd Barrett and managed to sustain a career by rehashing his (and John Lennons) ideas. The only cool Floyd were the space jams and that was mostly because of Rick Wright after Syd was gone. The wall is a look into the human condition of self pity. Definitely worth the trip, but who has time to listen to something that in depth now a days, besides the wall has already beem torn down (thanks to this album).<br />  This is actually all said in irony. Typical Waters fasion. Of<br />course this album was the easiest album to relate to ever. I<br />was certainly hypnotized by it for a year or more, but c'mon,<br />Floyd fan to Floyd fan: this album is not pink floyd. It is Roger<br />and Bob Ezrin.<br />  Rick Wright was such an enormous part of what Pink Floyd was.<br />Even Syd saw that. This album changed the face of our planet<br />all together, coincidentally it destroyed the best band there<br />ever was.
0790729350|3.0|Where was it on the video?  Dance to the Music by Sly &amp; the Family Stone was one of the greatest moments at Woodstock.  It's on the album (yes,I'm old enough to have owned albums), but unfortunately missing here.  Another great moment missed by the filmakers was the Airplane doing Volunteers.  The film starts out with the intro. and then completely skips over the song (it's on the cd for anyone who wants to hear it and it rocks!).  At the end of the day, the film depicts many great moments, but missed too many festival highlights that were on the original album and are now on the CD. The filmakers should have added those cuts.  The CD is a better buy for your money and listening pleasure.
B000002HJD|5.0|After spinning out on REVOLUTION # 9, a person I had never seen<br />before told my friend of leaving this perceived reality, to find<br />the perimeter. My friend told me it must have been what Jim<br />Morrison was talking about when he sang\\"Break on through...\\". Later we found the third friend and watched the sun expand from<br />within the city. Around 7:30 AM we ended up at his apartment. He<br />put the cassette JIM MORRISON an AMERICAN PRAYER on the tape deck. At one point everything collapsed inward while I expanded<br />from my core. I suddenly found myself on a single rail with enormous gears on either side. Each gear was completely different from any other except that it had an exact counterpart just across from itself. I wondered about my father,(who had died earlier that year)where was he? I almost [wilted] inside<br />myself. I turned to my friend, \\"Wow, Jim didn't even say goodbye<br />did he?\\"<br />  Years later I was telling an aquaintance (who happened to have a masters in physics) this very story. He was surprised and said that I had just described a model of human DNA. I think Jim was<br />onto something. Sure I take it to the extreme, but thank god there are people like Jim that will help you half way across the<br />bridge.

B00004Z459|5.0|LP does it with this cd. All songs are good. The band has done something not seen in years, create a combination of excellent music and even better lyrics. The song in the end is probaly the best music you'll hear in a song in a while. They mix rock,rap and beutifull music. To LP they rule!!!
B000002MU3|5.0|&quot;Monster&quot; is dissed by many REM fans, but for me it was (and is) their favorite album. Coming off the crowd-pleaser (and terrific) &quot;Automatic For The People&quot;, REM refuses to make &quot;Automatic 2&quot; and instead dishes up an all-out rock-and-rough &quot;Monster&quot;. What band would have dared that?<br />&quot;What's The Frequency Kenneth&quot; kicks things of and sets the tone: this is all-out, dont-take-any-prisoners rock, with distorted guitars all over the place, and loud, LOUD, no &quot;Everybody's Hurt&quot; here! Standout tracks include &quot;King of Comedy&quot;, &quot;Star 69&quot;, &quot;I took Your Name&quot;, &quot;Let Me In&quot; (all distorted Peter Buck guitar whaling), and the best of all &quot;Bang and Blame&quot;, the outro of which is ohh so good..., the best part of the album (it was left off the single version, I guess for &quot;radio format&quot; reasons)<br />REM has made so many great albums, and as always it comes down to personal preferences. For whatever reason, I tend to play this more than any other REM album. Give it a chance and you wont be disappointed!
B0000640VO|5.0|A brilliant comedic love story using color enhancement and other digital special effects, &quot;Amélie&quot; catapults the viewer into the world of Amélie Poulain from the time of her birth, when she is 6 years old (played by Flora Guiet), and in her early 20's (played by Audrey Tautou) when she is working as a waitress at the Two Windmills Café and living in the Parisian neighborhood of Montmartre.  Being rather shy, her life is rather solitary and private until she discovers a tin box hidden behind a bathroom tile in her apartment on the night that Princess Diana is killed.  The tin box contained keepsakes of a young boy who had lived in the same apartment 50 years earlier.  Amélie decides that she must find the child who is now a 50+ year old man and return his box.  From that point, Amélie's life is never the same as she begins a crusade to do nice things for other people to help them, including her father; but she prefers to remain completely anonymous.  Ultimately, she is forced to confront her shyness after she falls in love with Nino Quincampoix (played by Mathieu Kassovitz) and can no longer remain anonymous.<br />I had no difficulty reading the English subtitles as &quot;Amélie&quot; is in French and no English-dubbed version is available.  In the widescreen DVD version, the subtitles are placed in the black area below the picture so that they don't interfere with the film.  Also, the letters are large so that the subtitles are easy to read.<br />My favorite part on the the second disk in the 2-disk DVD set are the interviews with the director/writer Jean-Pierre Jeunet, but it also includes cast auditions, out-takes, a story-board comparison, home movies and a scrapbook.<br />I am very pleased to own a copy of &quot;Amélie&quot; in my DVD film collection!
B000069AUI|5.0|&quot;Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is the excellent follow-up to Coldplay's debut album &quot;Parachutes&quot;. Long in the making, the album more than delivers and manages to meet the highest of expectations.<br />Less &quot;simple&quot; than &quot;Parachutes&quot;, &quot;Rush of Blood&quot; kicks off with a pulsating &quot;Politik&quot; and never lets up. &quot;In My Place&quot;, a long-time concert staple and the first single, is as close to &quot;Parachutes&quot; as it gets. Everyone has their own favorite tracks, and for me the title track towers above the rest. It is a nice capsule of all that is Coldplay 2002: dramatic and lush musical landscape, thoughtful lyrics, and Chris Martin's unique vocals.<br />It is amazing how fast Coldplay has developed as a band: compare &quot;Rush of Blood&quot; to 1999's &quot;Blue Room EP&quot; and you will see what I mean. While I don't want to &quot;jinx&quot; the band by overloading them with praise, &quot;Rush of Blood&quot; really puts them in a position to become the &quot;new U2&quot; for the next couple of decades, if they so choose.
0060977264|5.0|I do not know how he does it, the character Piedra, is my second favorite character of Coelho's book's. Nothing compares to the Alchemist. However in By The River. . . I felt spiritual love for life and something bigger than either of them, in a way most writer's would fail miserablely,to express. I love this book. It was so hard to put it down and take a break. Great read.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Wesley Snipes OWNS the role of Blade.  Blade II is probably one of the best sequels to any film ever made.<br />Jaws II bit (in the wrong way).<BR>Jurassic Park II was a bit light.<BR>The Omen II was nonsensical.<BR>Home Alone II was just a rehash of the first film.<BR>Etc.  You get the picture....<br />Blade II picks up some time after the first film ended.  Blade is still doing the \\"good\\" work, killing vampires, but since his friend and mentor, Whistler, was killed in the first film, he's been working with a new kid, Scud.  Soon enough we are told, Blade learned that Whistler, though \\"dead,\\" was secreted away by the vampires and \\"turned.\\" He lives a miserable life in a vat of blood, unable to function either as human or vampire.  Blade goes to rescue him in Eurpore (where this film begins and takes place).<br />Upon rescuing Whistler, Blade is faced with the realization that he must work with the Vampire Nation to attack a mutual foe:  the Reapers.  The Reapers are a new form of vampire - evolved, if you will - a form that cannot be killed by a stake through the heart, decapitation, garlic, holy water, etc. - with one exception - daylight......oh, yeah, and Reapers don't only hunger for humans, but vampires as well.<br />Faced with a foe that is almost impossible to kill, Blade agrees to join forces with the Vampire Nation to destroy the Reapers.  Neither one trusts the other, but they realize they must do what they must do.<br />The Reapers are a truly grisly sight and \\"Blade II\\" is a true gore fest.  But do not dismiss this film because of those facts.  The acting here is superior.  The actors are fine and seem to really enjoy their roles.  The script is good and the director did a fine job.  The special effects are - maybe a bit too good.  It is REALLY gory.<br />The first film set a tone in the way that the film was imagined (it had sort of a blueish hue to it and the reds were exceedingly vibrant against it).  Blade II smartly chose the same path, which really sets this franchise apart from any of its rivals.  The Blade films have their own look and feel.<br />Taken from the comic of the same name, Blade is possibly the best of the Marvel's titles to reach film.  Blade, the comic, was always dark and disturbing and the films have kept it so.<br />Spiderman is an awesome film, but needs to maintain its \\"reality\\" and keep it from becoming hokey as DC's film franchise of Batman did.  The X-Men was the benchmark film for Marvel's tentpost title and it, in retrospect, fell flat when compared to the Blade films and Spiderman.<br />So....definitely check out Blade II.  If you've not seen Blade I, don't worry too much, the story stands on its own - BUT, the first film is really great too - so I do recommend watching them in order.
B000069HKH|3.0|One of the most anticipated albums in a very long time in many ways is a dissapointment. Bruce hasn't put out an album since the mid 90's the Ghost of Tom Joad, which in no way was near his greatest work (actually none of his albums since Born In The USA have been all that great). The Rising ruled the billboard charts for the first two weeks sitting at #1 knocking the band-aid wearing Nelly off the top for the first time in a few weeks. Suddenly Bruce was everywhere and looks like he may have one of his biggest selling albums ever (kinda interesting that both deal with the troubles in America). <br />The Rising starts off strong with Lonesome Day and seems to then slip with Into the Fire, which is alot better live (just like alot of songs are). The album seems to go dark to really really happy and sappy to dark again and it just doesn't seem to work. Waiting on a sunny day is cheesy but the music is ok and if they had different lyrics I think it would really help. Worlds Apart sounds more like something Sting would do and Let's be Friends is just plain scary! Why in the world is Bruce writing pop songs like this? Most of the music in that song could easily be played by hitting a button on a keyboard. Also...is it just me or does this seem like it's more of a Bruce solo outting on some songs and less a Bruce and the E Street band album? Max seems to be replaced by some electronic drumming/drum machines on some songs and Clarence is hardly there. The E Street band seems better suited for the live shows than the albums these days.<br />There are some good songs on The Rising. The title track, and first single is excellent but it's two songs, Your Missing and My City Of Ruins that really stand out from the rest and are two of Bruce's best written songs in a long long time (it's a shame that American Skin wasn't on this album but I guess having a song that's questioning the actions of the NYPD and songs that praise the heroism of the NYPD and everyone on 9/11 wouldn't mix but I understand it's been played live on the current Rising tour). Mary's Place is a very very good song but it seems to be missing something. The lyrics are kinda cheesy (Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party)but being one of the longer songs it can get repetitve but if Bruce was still writing like he did back in the day this could've been another Roselita, which is one of his best songs!<br />I didn't have a chance to see him when he came to DC last month because I didn't have a million dollars to spend on a ticket but I understand that 9 songs from the Rising are being played and favorites like Tenth Avenue Freeze Out, Backstreets, Prove it all Night, Out In the Street are getting pushed out. I'm sure they still give a million percent everynight but that's kinda sad that 9 songs have to be performed off a album that's not one of the best Bruce has done.<br />Is the Rising worth it? It is and it isn't. There are good songs and there are bad songs. Alot of people are buying this because of the 9/11 connection and the hype and most likely are loving it but I think for long time Bruce fans there are having mixed reviews with this one. It is his best since the last full album with E Street band but in no way is this anywhere near Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, The River, or The Wild, The Innocent and E Street Shuffle!
B000067CQK|5.0|What else is there to say about a man that has changed music and himself more times than one thought possible!?  Always artistic, innovative, thought provoking and just one beautiful voice.  This album takes you back to the days of Ziggy Stardust as if you were there in your own personal concert.  Highly recommend for everyone!
B00005JKCH|5.0|One star reviewers--I'm sorry Spiderman didn't reach the literary heights you apparently were duped into believing it would. (Are you kidding?) Perhaps the producers can resurrect T.S. Eliot to do the sequel's screenplay. Maybe you start your own review site so you and your friend(s) can share your film suffering.<br />I admit it.I am an old dude who read Spidey since the early days. I also have read Shakespeare. But I did not go to see  artistic expression or some director/write suffering for his art. I went expecting great escapism and fun and I was not disappointed.<br />If self-centered artistic expression is your bag, you should watch IFC more. Now there's a channel with angst to spare. For me, I anxiously await the DVD.
B00005JL96|4.0|-<br />This review had to be broken down into two parts: The first half starting out as more of a call to attention for many of the ''adults'' who have expressed a number of ''concerns'' about the Disney production, ''LILO & STITCH.''<br />* [Part I] * ~<br />For those parents who are complaining about certain \\"unwholesome content\\" of this animated feature (disrespectful attitudes, the ''midriffs,'' the violence, the intensity, the tendency to scare small children, etc.), I offer a simple suggestion: Just deal with it and get over it, because it's ALL ''YOUR'' FAULT for allowing your young children to view this film in the first place BEFORE having done your homework!<br />In case all of you supposedly 'moral purists' had not noticed, ''LILO & STITCH'' was given a *''PG''* MPAA Rating!<br />That's ''PG,'' as in ''Parental Guidance Suggested'' -- wherein the subtitle bar reads:<br />''Some Material May Not Be Suitable For Children.'' ... Get It?<br />If anyone is unclear as to what movie ratings mean or reveal about a film's contents and what it suggests to ''concerned parents,'' I recommend that you learn all about it at the official film ratings web site at ''mpaa .org'' and they'll teach you all about it.<br />Also, for those parents complaining about the content their children are being exposed to in this or any film, ''screenit .com'' is a service which will tell you *EVERYTHING* you need know (the good, the bad and the ugly) about what to expect in a movie or video BEFORE showing it to your 'precious little angels.'<br />So please, EXERCISE SOME PARENTAL 'RESPONSIBILITY,' STOP MAKING 'EXCUSES' and QUIT PASSING THE 'BLAME'! As several poo-pooers have already suggested, go see ''SPIRIT'' instead, if you want something strictly for the kidlets and/or if you DON'T want to take responsibility for what they see in the movie theatre ... and leave ''LILO & STITCH'' for the REST of us!<br />= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =<br />*[Part II]* ~<br />With that all said, There's not much more I can add to the praise which has already been heaped upon this daring Disney film, except this:<br />''LILO & STITCH'' is the first and only Disney animated feature film I have ever found interesting enough for me to consider breaking my [literally] lifelong personal boycott against Disney animated feature films! (And this is no lie ... all anyone would ever need to do is ask my mother how many Disney movies I've ever begged her to take me to.) One could probably call the Live-Action/CGI amalgam ''TRON'' the only exception (though it was really not a Disney production at all, but an independent film project Disney purchased when no other studio would touch it, and to Disney's great credit, they had enough foresight to see just how visionary the project was and understood the importance and future impact of the then new technology).<br />Admittedly, my initial interest in this new feature was the fact that the story is set in my home state of Hawaii. Added incentives included no operatic arias, no dancing refrigerators, no diabetic system-shocking hyper-saccharin syrupy sweetness, and no talking animals ... except for Stitch, of course. When I learned those things about the film, and learned that the underlying theme of the film was ''Ohana,'' I just had to let my curiosity dictate. And though I wouldn't place ''Lilo & Stitch'' anywhere on the same level as with the Warner Bros. feature ''THE IRON GIANT,'' I was still thoroughly satisfied and found myself VERY impressed with it -- enough to want to place myself on the 'new release notification' list, pending the release of the DVD, which I DO intend on purchasing upon availability. I also appreciated the limited use of CGI, as I have a difficult time relating to the visual clashing which often takes place whenever CGI is incorporated into cel animation.<br />Again, I cannot add much more positive to what so many have already said, but considering that an adamant lifelong ''Anti-Disneyite'' can so willingly and freely do something he'd sworn he'd never do even in a jillionbillion years-- heap praise on a Disney animated feature film --should be considered a very positive sign, indeed!<br />American animation has clearly been growing up in the past few years, and it looks as if Disney may have finally reached its puberty stage. That's a good thing, and it's about time.<br />* * *neyite'' can so willingly and freely do something he'd sworn he'd never do even in a jillionbillion years-- heap praise on a Disney animated feature film --should be considered a very positive sign, indeed! <br />American animation has clearly been growing up in the past few years, and it looks as if Disney may have finally reached its puberty stage.

0792160347|4.0|\\"American Gigolo\\" is high on my list of Guilty Pleasures. This 1980 thriller wallows in the troubles of the rich, the infamous and the decadent. Its main characters have too much money, which can be a good thing, and too much time on their hands, which can be a very bad thing. There is a sort of perverse pleasure in watching them sort through their various problems, most of which are indirectly of their own making. Writer-director Paul Schrader has always cast a cynical eye on human endeavors. Sometimes, his insights have been absolutely brilliant. [He wrote both \\" Taxi Driver\\" and \\"Raging Bull\\".] But even when he is playing around, as in \\"American Gigolo\\", he creates for us an interesting world, which can also be repellant because we see a certain amount of truth in his characterizations. <br />Richard Gere is Julian Kaye, a very well paid [and apparently well educated] LA hustler. His specialty is wealthy, older women. Arrogant and self-assured, he has made his share of enemies in his shadowy world, especially among his pimps. Things get complicated for him when he falls for Michelle Stratton [Lauren Hutton], wife of a prominent political figure. But far worse is in store for him after a client is murdered and Julian becomes the number one suspect. <br />Giorgio Moroder contributes a lively musical score - very 80s. John Bailey's cinematography is first-rate. He captures the vanity and vulnerability of Julian right from the opening shots, for example. <br />This is one of those movies that has more detractors than admirers. To me, it is wildly entertaining in a dark comedy way. Its one big fault is a contrived happy ending, which is diametrically opposed to the tone of the rest of the movie.
B00006CXSS|2.0|Band of Brothers, Stephen Ambrose's book on E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne, is an interesting and engrossing read for those who already have some background on WWII. But, sadly, it's not history - more of a reminiscience by a few select members of the company. Ambrose uses appallingly few other sources to back up the narratives, tends to focus on the stories that are convenient, and generally takes the stories of the veterans without skepticism. Nontheless, in book format, that's OK, the book has merits to make up for it, and Band of Brothers (the book) succeeds.<br />Band of Brothers (the miniseries), though, is shorn of its \\"fireside chat\\" style and is throwing you into the midst of this narrative and tries to convince you it is fact, that it can convey what it was like to be there; but it can't. It can't both because the underlying history is too sugar-coated and unreliable in general (there are exceptions, of course), and because the characters have no emotional resonance. They got the blow-up sequences down (leftover effects from Saving Private Ryan, presumably - the looks is almost identical), but the writing is uneven, being unable to make the transition for the storytelling style of Ambrose to real drama with any elan. You never really get to know more than a few of the characters the way the title might suggest, and there is no sense of jeapordy since we always have an instinctive sense that the characters we get to know are those that will survive, since they told their stories and contributed primarily to Ambrose's book.<br />Despite my generally negative feelings, there are some good spots; the one episode that stood head and shoulders above the others was the Bastogne episode; even its calculated and gimmicky ending couldn't damage an otherwise excellent narrative, one where all the exposions complimented the excellent character work instead of being the main attraction (this episode was not in Ambrose's book).<br />To boil it down, I supose, impressive explosions do not make good drama in and of themselves and neither do they convince you of the nature of war; the miniseries has lost the sense of its title. While good in spots, overall this does not have enough to recommend it.impressive explosions do not make good drama in and of themselves and neither do they convince you of the nature of war; the miniseries has lost the sense of its title.

1559409010|5.0|In my opinion, the Python team's finest film.  Unlike their other efforts, which I have also enjoyed, the film has a continuous story, rather than being a series of sketches.<BR>The film does not make fun of or put down Jesus and Christianity. The film makes a statement about how some people seem to lose the ability to think for themselves and act a bit crazy when they assemble together.  The whole message of the film seems to be 'Think for yourself and don't follow the masses'.  Graham Chapman is fine as the lead part, Brian.  All of the other Pythons are great in their various parts.  I particularly like John Cleese as Reg, the leader of the Judean People's Front. His 'What have the Romans done for us' bit is hysterical. The Front is reminicent of the activists who have to sit in meetings and discuss things for ages before they do anything.<BR>Watch for appearances by Spike Milligan, tbe man who created the great radio comedy program, 'The Goon Show', which the Python's acknowledge as one of their major influences, and also a 'blink and you'll miss him' appearance by ex-Beatle and executive producer George Harrison.  <BR>Avoid the Anchor Bay barebones DVD which contains only the film and the trailer.  Buy the one that says 'The Criterion Collection' on the top of the front cover.  This one has a transfer which was supervised and approved by the director, Terry Jones, who also puts in a hilarious performance as Brian's Mother, The Virgin Mandy.<BR>The Criterion release includes two commentaries, one with Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, and Terry Jones and one with John Cleese and Michael Palin. Deleted scenes from a 3/4 inch tape that Terry Jones had.  4 radio ads, which feature mainly Mothers of the Pythons (John Cleese's Mother actually won an award from the British advertising industry for her ad) The final extra is an hour long documentary called 'The Pythons' which was shot in Tunisia while the Python troupe were making 'Life of Brian' there. Oh yes, the theatricaltrailer is included, too.<BR>A very good package of extras for a relatively low budget comedy that was filmed in 1979.  As usual, Criterion has put together a fantastic package, which is a must for the Python fan.<BR>The song at the end is kinda catchy, too...
B000069AUI|2.0|Judging from the number of 5 star reviews on this page it seems like I'm a little out numbered but I do believe Coldplay must be the most overrated UK band of the last five years, closely followed by Travis. Not since Oasis has so much undeserved praise been lavished on a 'kind of OK but rather boring' band. Ok the tunes are nice enough for a while but where is the depth? For UK music try Badly Drawn Boy, Dakota Oak, Aim, Roots Manuva etc.<br />I think Dido is ...as well.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is a reincarnation of the epitome of pop music in \\"punk rock\\" form.  The group features, as most do, an oddly high-pitched lead singer, lyrical topics ranging from the drama of crashing your dad's car to the plight of being an unpopular teenager, and grungy distorted guitars driving the beat.  In these ways the name of the group is perfect; it really is a simple style of punk rock that has worked over and over again for many groups.<br />Simple Plan, however, does take the formula for teeny-bopper, angsty punk in a lighter direction musically.  Honestly, the lyrics are sometimes downright depressing - sometimes about how he wishes he were dead, or that God must be cursing him - but the music, for punk, is exceptionally light.  The guitars are not loud on the recordings, but more distant letting vocal harmonies take over for the melodic aspects of the CD.  It's an appealing sound indeed, so if you can stand the likes of another group of young men playing and singing about how much it [stinks] to be young, then you'll definitely enjoy this album.  If you're tired of bands like Blink-182 coming around, then this album just might cause you to lose control.
B0000026UV|4.0|What's better than one great guitar player?? two of course. This album is 12 years old but sounds as fresh today as when it was released. Great talent besides the late chet are the writing talents of Don Gibson on two selections, Boots Randolph's Yakety Sax which was released by Chet as Yakety Axe. This version is ruined with lyrics by Merle Travis. Vince Gill adds vocal background to a couple selections and Steve Wariner plays bass. Some selections are purely instrumental while others and mildly sung by Chet and Mark. My favourites are 'Sweet Dreams' with the late Floyd Cramer on piano and the Dire Straits song 'Tahitian Skies'.
B00000DFMN|4.0|In the early 1980s, Trevor Horn was one of the most successful and bankable producers of his day.  Years before he teamed up with Seal, Horn also produced albums from ABC, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and this debut from the Art of Noise.  &quot;(Who's Afraid Of) The Art of Noise&quot; is a strange yet engaging collection of dance beats, synth bleeps, and heart-stoppingly lovely arrangements.  There's the hip hop swagger of their signature &quot;Beat Box,&quot; the infectious groove of &quot;Close (to the Edit),&quot; and the ominous ring of &quot;A Time for Fear (Who's Afraid).&quot; There are also some downright strange tracks such as the title cut and &quot;Momento,&quot; which really are collages of random noises, odd samples, and sounds.  But the track that earns this album its 4 stars is the ten-minute excursion &quot;Moments in Love,&quot; which is one of the most seductive and beautiful instrumentals ever.  Proving that this album was no fluke, member Anne Dudley moved on to be an acclaimed composer, known for her work in films such as &quot;The Crying Game.&quot;  This quirky yet fun debut is recommended with my stamp of approval.
0446608955|5.0|Of all the love stories I have read, I have to acknowledge that this is the best one yet. It shows what love really is. That it is not about surrounding yourself with what you think is good for you, but about getting to know that one person that will touch you and change your life forever. That you should not live your life according to others, that you should live life according to you. That it is not about how much time you get to spend with the one you love, but how you use that time. <br /> While reading this book you will find yourself in love with these characters. Jaime, very innocent and pure. Landon, very strong, but yet weak. Two very different people that find themselves tangled in a web of love. With these two, you will not only learn what love really is, but what it can be.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is one of those RARE movies that I could watch repeatedly over and over again.  I love the philosophical points hit on in the flick (any situation in life is good or bad based on how you look at it).  This is a great movie to use as a teaching tool with high schoolers (as I have done) and is that perfect formula of &quot;makes you laugh, makes you think.&quot;  I haven't gotten the new version of the DVD yet with the documentary and the commentary, but I have read that both enrich an already classic movie.
0790729628|4.0|Without a doubt, \\"Blade Runner\\" is a five star affair, since its influence is incalculable 20 years on.  Like others have said, I wish both versions would have been included on this DVD, since I watched the original version with the voice-over almost 100 times before the director's cut hit in '93.  Even with the voice-over, I remember that I didn't even really like this movie the first time I saw it on VHS in 1983 (like many, the movie is confusing if you only see it once).  Thankfully, I was persistent and repeated viewings have made this my all-time favorite flick.  I have heard Ridley is even considering doing a LONGER director's cut, so hopefully soon we'll have the FINAL DVD release of this gem!!
B00005B36H|5.0|This might certainly be the most bizarre album to ever debut at #1 on the Billboard charts.  It's definitely one that demands your full attention, not just as background music.  It would be interesting to know how many of those who made the album #1 have fully &quot;listened&quot; to this masterpiece.  Oh well, this album is what headphones were made for.  Danny Carey is keeping the spirit of drumming alive, and for that we should be grateful.  This is one of those albums that just grows and grows on you, like ticks and leeches!!  It's like the greatest jazz albums; today's thirty second attention spans just don't get it, but you everyone should get &quot;Lateralus&quot; and be taken for a ride!!
B00000JHAU|5.0|A truly gorgeous effort. Along with say The Shins, Elliot Smith, Badly Drawn Boy and Bill Ricchini's Ordinary Time, IYFS stands as one of the great soft rock song cycles in recent years. Fans of Belle &amp; Sebastian should check out Ordinary Time for a more American version of the B&amp;S sound.
B00003CXCW|5.0|I recently saw this film again at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, and I kid you not -- it's one of the great reasons why movies need to be seen on the big screen; even an interior drama like this one -- the richness of the performances, the sets and the crackle of the dialogue as the characters trade barb after barb is all enhanced by the projected film print of this classic.<br />Not withstanding that ideal presentation, this DVD is most welcome. It's Wilder at his pungent best and it's no coincidence that this film ended the writing partnership of Brackett & Wilder. Holden is searing and Swanson does cruel comic insanity like no one before or since.<br />Greatest story ever about this movie, is Louis B. Mayer's response to the film after seeing a preview screening. Mayer ran up to Wilder and said something to the effect that immigrants like Wilder shouldn't bite the hand that feeds them so hard, and Wilder basically retorted \\"...You, Mr. Mayer!\\" And that's exactly what this movie says so well, that Hollywood -- underneath the glamorous premieres and jetset lifestyle -- is rotten at it's core, a town/industry that eats people up and tears up their dreams, and that it would take a peerless insider to bring the house down, yet at the same time prop himself up to legendary status. The four or five subsequent Wilder films after SUNSET BLVD. are strokes of genius.<br />Now, can we get ACE IN THE HOLE and AVANTI  on DVD?
B00005YW4H|4.0|i don't even know (haven't bought the cd yet) whether 'don't know why' is an original or a cover...<br />in any case, that song (which i heard late one recent night on south carolina's public radio network) sold me on the disc.<br />i can't believe norah jones is only twenty-two...<br />there are shades of joni mitchell in jones's voice/phrasing; still, nothing here seems derivative...<br />the arrangement of 'don't know why' is skillfully understated, and the piano (played by jones, unless i'm mistaken) is sublime.<br />and if 'don't know why' is an original, it's the most poetic jazz/somewhat-pop ballad i've heard in a long while.<br />funny how a song can change your whole day: i was driving home from work, feeling circumspect, and then 'don't know why' surprised me.
0446677450|1.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad got my juices flowing--that was almost 3-years ago. I've read other books on money and finance, which were recommended by professional and non-professional friends. Looking back on Mr. Kiyosaki's book, most of his ideas do have a small grain of truth, but his book is too filled with half-truths. For example, most millionaires are still relatively frugal even after they become wealthy (read the Millionaire Next Door). Another point is that most millionaires become wealthy by investing (time and money) into their business and/or by developing professional skills. Most people do NOT become millionaires from stocks, bonds, CD's, money market funds, real estate investments, etc. Those who do get rich off of investing are VERY rare.  For most, investments are just holding tanks for the money from their businesses or careers to make them MORE wealthy, not INITIALLY wealthy.  Other strategies make more sense and are a better guarantee of wealth or at least a comfortable lifestyle (read the books I recommend below for specifics). Mr. Kiyosaki is an extraordinarily gifted motivational speaker and salesperson; however, he lacks sound, useful financial knowledge. (Note: Who is his \\"rich dad\\"? Why is his name such a secret? Why can't anyone find his \\"rich dad\\"? I would be skeptical with this man's advice. He may want to increase his wealth (product sales) more than yours.) <br />For sober views, I recommend Eric Tyson's Personal Finance for Dummies, Consumer Reports The Money Book, and for an easy fable with a powerful, simple lesson read Clason's The Richest Man in Bablyon. I would also recommend reading Carl Sagan's \\"The Fine Art of Baloney Detection\\" in his book The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark. Use his baloney detection system to critically evaluate books and theories within books--many popular financial advisors are full of baloney. <br />Good Luck! Jason
B00001OH7U|4.0|&quot;Young Americans&quot; wasn't a good album. He gets credit for venturing into soul, but for me it didn't work. On this album, though, he has a lot of R&amp;B elements, but they somewhat echo his future works with Brian Eno and the &quot;Berlin Trilogy.&quot;<BR><BR>The songs are very catchy, and some of them are even eerie (but we haven't gotten to Warszawa yet), but sometimes it is a challenge to sit through this record in one sitting. &quot;TVC15&quot; is my least favorite song on the album, and sometimes his crooning on &quot;Word On A Wing&quot; is something of an acquired taste, but it is a very rewarding listen overall, and after releasing this album, Bowie got clean for good. After the misstep of Young Americans, Station to Station is a very worthy comeback.
B00005O5CM|4.0|The formulaic young female blonde is a familar object in American Movies, particularly in recent years; invariably &quot;Clueless,&quot; shallow, vain, and blended with a little streak of mean that always gets, in the end, its just desserts.<BR>I watched &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; with low expectations, expecting to see this bit played tirelessly to the hilt. I was pleasantly surprised to see a few unexpected elements added to the standard mix in the character of Elle Woods played so warmly by Reese Witherspoon, the most notable of such elements being intelligence, integrity, and that rarest of things in modern film, a sense of ethics.  Witherspoon plays the role finely, with an overweening optimism that breathes real life into a script with almost as many unbelievable plot twists as, say, &quot;The Fugitive.&quot;  Here however there are no amazing special effects to make up for the plot, unless of course you count Ms. Witherspoon's winning smile, which somehow does more than Harrison Ford can do by jumping off a dam.<br />The rest of the cast is pretty good too:  Of special note is Matt Davis, as Werner Huntington III, the boyfriend who jilts Elle for a fellow Harvard Brahminette, played by Selma Blair.  Davis plays Warner like a latter day George W. Bush, a mindless self satisfied far overrated automaton who relies on connections and an unearned sense of birthright to push himself far beyond the realms in which he might safely function.  Ms. Blair is also especially good as Vivian Kennsington, the new girlfriend, an ice queen before the fall.<br />Also worth noting is a little throwaway role played by Bruce Thomas, the UPS guy.  He does it perfectly.<br />Definitely worth watching, even if the plot is preposterous.

0812548094|5.0|Stone of Tears would have to be one of the best books I have ever read. It starts off where Wizard's First Rule left off, with Kahlan and Richard going to view Scarlet's Baby. <br />This book has alot of twists and turns that are quite suprising at times, but I will not spoil them for you. Richard will befriend a beast that would normally kill him, Kahlan finds out a shocking truth, and Zedd finds Adie in trouble.<br />I really must recommend this book if you like Fantasy books and have read Wizard's First Rule. Goodkind has a way of making the words leap off the page, in your face. It is as though you can actually picture the events that are unfolding before your eyes. Goodkind has a way with words that is absolutely marvellous. If you have not read this book, then you are missing out on a great read and I say to you: Stop reading this review and go out and buy the book you fool!
155111125X|5.0|Jane Austen's 1811 novel, her first published, \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" receives a grand treatment in this Broadview Literary Texts edition, edited by Kathleen James-Cavan. Anyone who knows me knows how I doat on Jane Austen, and for the first time reading her in a Broadview edition, I find myself doating excessively. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was the first public exposure of Austen's masterful characterization, plotting, and satire to reach the reading public of the Romantic Era. Austen thrives on what I like to call 'the middle of the book,' writing the situations that complicate the lives of her characters, better than almost anyone - almost, it seems, preferring getting her characters and readers in a position to learn from their mistakes, than actually getting them out.<br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" begins with the illogic of early 19th century British inheritance law. The hereditary owner of Norland Park is on his deathbed, and invites the heirs of his estate, the Dashwood family, to reside at Norland. The Dashwood's and their three daughters come to live there, but are put into jeopardy soon after by the demise of both Mr. Dashwoods - bringing the next male heir (and the girls' half-brother), John Dashwood and his manipulative wife, Fanny to Norland. Greedy as they are, John and his wife soon drive their half-sisters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, along with their mother, out of Norland, Sussex, to the Devonshire countryside. Here in Devonshire, in a small cottage, and at a considerably reduced income, the Dashwood sisters and their mother struggle to rebuild their life, while the two eldest daughters, Elinor, 19, and Marianne, 17, try to deal with life and love in the English countryside.<br />Like the well-known \\"Pride (Darcy) and Prejudice (Bennet),\\" \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"s title can be seen to refer to the character traits that mark its two principle characters - Sense on the side of the Enlightenment-influenced, almost certainly emotionally-repressed Elinor, and the overfine Sensibility of Marianne, a great admirer of dead leaves and the dirty ground. As opposed to the former novel, Austen does not really disparage either, except when carried to excess, as each young woman does, instead seeking, as was popular during the period, to reconcile, or strike a balance between rational logic and emotional response. In their love affairs, Elinor's with a distant cousin, the diffident and somewhat mysterious 24-year old Edward Ferrars, and Marianne's with a younger, and very handsome rogue John Willoughby, the young ladies' moral, social, and aesthetic principles are put to the test. While Elinor and Marianne are two of the most cultured, educated, and refined characters in the novel, and while Austen certainly privileges the country over the London metropolis, she makes clear that the ladies' limited interaction with society at large leaves them in a kind of sheltered ignorance which they must come to terms with, both for their sakes and for the sake of their lovers.<br />Austen always does a great job with her minor characters, especially those who serve in comic relief roles - or as the butts of her satire, and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is no different. In their avarice and greed, John and Fanny Dashwood are the epitome of wholly uncultured social climbers and mindless landowners. In her less than refined, but wholly maternal attitudes toward the Miss Dashwoods, Mrs. Jennings (mother of the neglected, but ever cheerful wife Charlotte Palmer and the reticent to a fault Lady Middleton) is as amusing a character, and as warm a mother as one will find in Austen. Colonel Brandon is a fit counterpart to Mrs. Jennings, in his reserved melancholy, while caring just as much about those around him as Mrs. Jennings. The comic pairings of Mr. Palmer and Sir John Middleton with their wives is absolute genius, both being the mirror opposite in style and attitude to their wives - and in particular the relationship between the Palmers, including the continual laughing of Charlotte at the fact that Mr. Palmer \\"never listens to me\\" and \\"never tells me anything,\\" is both highly entertaining, and at the same time, one of the most troubling relationships in the novel.<br />I've praised James-Cavan's handling of this Broadview edition, and now may be a good time to say some more on that head. Broadview and its editors, like the people who put together the Norton Critical Editions, concern themselves with really presenting literary texts in a solid foundation of cultural, theoretical, and critical contexts. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" contains a real treasure trove of such material - the two contemporary reviews of Austen's novel from 1812, generous selections of essays from the late 1700's and early 1800's on contemporary debates on the meanings of the words \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility,\\" and on the cult of sensibility and the picturesque. Also included are exerpts from poems referenced by Marianne throughout the novel, illustrations of the vehicles they travel in, and a map of the character's London residences. James-Cavan's excellent introduction also lays out the novel's issues in their contemporary, cultural, critical, and theoretical contexts, none more obtrusive than any other, and all quite helpful. Altogether, the Broadview \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a tremendous edition for Austen scholars and casual Janeites alike.

B00003CXE7|1.0|I wrote a much longer and more detailed of this film once, but They wouldn't print it so I'll just give you the basic conclusion: Joaquin Phoenix's EYES have more life than this entire dreadful film. <BR>Absolutely the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands.
B000002JR8|5.0|Pantera is just too good.  They had a bit of a slump before this album came out (Vulgar Display of Power), but recovered in true fashion with the release of Far Beyond Driven.  On this one, they are significantally heavier than on Cowboys From Hell and on Vulgar Display.  Vinnie's drumming is more aggressive, and Rex's bass is far heavier and lower-tuned than on the previous two.  Dime's guitar is not as great as on Cowboys and Vulgar, but is still awesome (The best guitar work by Pantera is on their 4th album, The Great Southern Trendkill).  The beginning of the album, &quot;Strength Beyond Strength&quot;, begins as nothing but a big noise-fest, but becomes much better by the 1:30 mark.  The best song on the album is, despite the noise, &quot;Strength Beyond Strength&quot;.  &quot;Good Friends And A Bottle of Pills&quot; is a funny song about a guy who did something fun to another guy's girlfriend the past night, while &quot;Use my Third Arm&quot; has no truly definitive explanation, while it sounds very good, still.  This album is Pantera's 3rd best, but if it is as good as I know it is, and you will, too, once you have bought it, it is still one of the great hard rock albums of the 90's.
B0000640VN|3.0|See other reviews for plot info.  Take it from me, the director's cut on the DVD is far superior to the theatrical release.  The latter had plot gaps and didn't explain why Kate was so bitter.  Directors do know best!  (Ironically, many of the cuts were made in deference to prescreening focus groups, and one of the major scenes cut out was about such a focus group and their perverse influence!)
0446677450|4.0|This is a book that the author, Robert, wanted to share the concepts and experiences how to manage money. The story is telling about the different views of points from two different Dads. One is called Rich Dad and the other is called Poor Dad. These two Dads have two different directions to explain about the money. In the childhood, the storyteller started to hear the concepts from his two Dads. Rich Dad taught him for investing money in order to succeed. On the other hand, Poor Dad taught him in the way for following the original life to succeed. Finally, the journey for finding the rich way was begun to start.<br />According to the teaching from the Rich Dad, the storyteller understood that the rich wouldn&iexcl;¦t work for money. As we are the masters of the money, we need to know how to handle this as well. As starting to learn about money, storyteller had learnt that the money had different roles in our lives. Money could be the income or asset in the real situation .It depended on our decisions that we made at all.<br />The main concept for this book is the changing roles of money from income to asset. This is not an easily concept that we understand. Actually, most people will work hard to earn so much money. However, they don&iexcl;¦t care the method of using this. They may use money to buy some irrelevant products such as big house. They may not afford to pay back the expenses for this. Finally, they will be become the slave of the money. Rich Dad taught us to invent money and turn the money into the asset. And don&iexcl;¦t work for this. In the last part of the book, Rich Dad mentioned some obstacles that we may face roadblocks. They are fear, cynicism, laziness, bad habits & arrogance. We need to handle these and ready to getting started.<br />To my mind, I think this is really a good book as well. I never thought about these concepts before I read this book. Although I had learnt some basis investment knowledge in my studies, I don&iexcl;¦t have this mindset to think about money. There are some excellent points that I want to share in the following.<br />Firstly, I think this is a good book for the youngsters. As I was the teenager, I always wasted my money to buy some useless products such as toys, TV games, etc. However, I just played these for a short period. I would like to buy so much. I felt sorry that I did not learn how to use the money. If youngsters can understand how to use money early, they will be good planning in the coming future.<br />Secondly, it is really a good exploration for understanding about the concept of money. In the past, money was my master. I worked hard to gain the satisfaction for the useless things. After I had read the book, I tried to think about the new concepts. I knew that it was difficulty for me to change my mind at once. But I tried to use some ideas from the book. I started to use my money for investing some projects rather than buying the useless materials.<br />This is really a good book that I strongly recommended. After you have read this, you may have some new ideas to generate about money.
0783114222|5.0|The Apollo Space program covered such a short distance in our own solar system, yet it was a hugely epic and legendary journey in human history. The true story is filled with so many incredible details that are so mind bogglingly beyond belief that it seems like a work of really well written fiction.<br />From the Earth To The Moon is more than just the 9 round trips that were made to the moon, and the 6 trips where man landed on the moon. This HBO miniseries covers every aspect of the Apollo space program, and it does in a very convincing and entertaining manner. Every step of the way, everyone involved in the space program was intensly focused on answering the question of how to get to the moon and back again.<br />Episode One, \\"Can We Do This?\\" begins with the early space missions of the Mercury and Gemini programs. Most of the missions have men with now familiar names who went on to be in the Apollo missions featured in later episodes. This episode alone is more adventurous and fact filled than The Right Stuff.<br />Episode Two, \\"Apollo 1\\", is about the tragic Apollo 1 fire that killed the first three Apollo astronauts while still on the launchpad. The episode answers the important questions most people had about what caused the fire.<br />Episode Three, \\"We Have Cleared The Tower\\", is about the next three Apollo astronauts who are training in preparation for the first launch of the command and service module. Througout the episode, a documentary crew follows the astronauts around while they prepare for this mission.<br />Episode Four, \\"1968\\", is about the turbulent year of 1968, and the first trip to and orbiting of the moon by the crew of Apollo 8.<br />Episode Five, \\"Spider\\", was one of my favorite episodes. It was about the making and testing in earth and lunar orbit of the lunar module, the spacecraft that would land on the moon. Apollo 9 and 10 have been often overlooked in history, but were extremely important missions. There is so much detail in this episode, yet it is entertaining, funny, and filled with this awe inspiring prelude to greatness that comes in the next episode.<br />Episode Six, \\"Mare Tranquilitatis\\", is the episode of Apollo 11, the mission where man landed on the moon. What made this episode so believeable was Lane Smith's performance as a fictitious network anchorperson -- he seemed like a real composite of all the anchormen of that time. I felt like I was really there watching the first moon landing for the first time ever. <br />Episode Seven, \\"Is That All There Is?\\" -- The mission of Apollo 12 is directed much like a situation comedy. It is a lighthearted break from all the seriousness of the first six episodes, and one gets the sense that the story has turned a corner -- man has already been to the moon . . . now what?<br />Episode Eight, \\"We Interrupt This Program\\", directs its attention to the reporters on the ground, rather than the struggle of the astronauts of Apollo 13, who were in a life or death situation. Most would agree that this was the weakest of all 12 episodes, but not because the story was bad, it just had already been told in a motion picture with Tom Hanks. As a substitute, I would recommend seeing the Tom Hanks movie instead.<br />Episode Nine, \\"For Miles And Miles\\", is about Apollo 14, and the story of Alan Shepard, who was seen in the first Mercury launch in Episode One, and who thought he would not be going to the moon because of problems with his inner ear.<br />Episode Ten, \\"Galileo Was Right\\", is, in my opinion, an incorrectly titled episode. True, at the end of Apollo 15, Dave Scott tested Galileo's theory about gravity with a hammer and a feather while on the moon, but the story focuses on the geologists who taught the astronauts of this mission how to find the important things that needed to be found. I would have called this episode, \\"Guess What We Just Found\\".<br />Episode Eleven, \\"The Original Wives Club\\", focuses its attention on the domestic part of the families of the Apollo Astronauts. Only a small amount of detail is shown about the Apollo 16 mission in this episode.<br />The final episode, Episode Twelve, \\"Le Voyage Dans La Lune\\", is about the last two men who walked on the moon on Apollo 17. It is also about the making of the first film ever about a fictitious voyage to the moon . . . long before the first ship was launched into space.<br />I loved this miniseries so much, I went out and bought the book that the miniseries was based on -- A Man On The Moon, by Andrew Chaikin. The book covers what the miniseries didn't -- like ESP experiments done by Edgar Mitchell while on Apollo 14.
B000066F6H|4.0|This CD is damn good.  Don't listen to these music snobs who disagree just to disagree.  They are nothing like the Vines, or the Strokes.  Ok, they're not the &quot;saviors of rock&amp;roll&quot;, but that's a pretty big cross to bare.  Just listen and enjoy and judge for yourself.  Believe me, their's far worse out there.
B000066C1N|5.0|The music from spirit goes together perfectly with the movie, instead of the horses talking it has a narriator, and whenever spirit goes through something the music in the backround goes along perfectly with what is going on at the time. I might be 26 years old but when it comes to horses anything goes! I highly recommend this soundtrack!!!
B000007T1M|5.0|Anything that is done by Serj Tankian automatically gets 5+ stars just because he is an ultra-super-mega (guy).  Not to mention this cd is awesome and SOAD rules all of music with an iron fist.  What the What Yo!
B000066F6H|3.0|The hives are OK.  Each song packs a punch and ends, without fail, at the strike of 2 minutes and 30 seconds.  But their songs wear thin quickly.  They're definitely better than the Vines, but for some great 70's rock revival, listen to Bona Roba.
B00004Z459|2.0|Dwhat? Boring. This cd is ok the first time you listen to it until you realize that you are being bored to sleep.  It will make you say Dwhat?
B000068TPN|5.0|Great movie that is very well done and shows the reality of war, the best movie I have ever seen.
B000068TPN|5.0|As a former Marine with the 3rd Recon Batt., I can say that this movie is the best movie on Vietnam I have ever seen.  Not just because it was based on a true story, although that adds to the effect, but mainly because this movie hits you at all levels of human existence.  It is not just a movie about a battle, but about wives, children, friends...all affected by war.  About Fathers who kiss their children and wives good-byein the middle of the night, and wake up the next day fighting for their lives.<br />When I finished watching this movie at midnight, I walked to each room and kissed my children and my wife, then wept for another half-hour.  The music will haunt you, the scenes will replay in your head for days, but events of that November in 1965 will never be forgotten.  Thanks to Col. Moore and Joe Galloway for writing this story and thanks to the producers and actors who brought it to life.  <br />\\"Garry Owen!\\" fighting 7th, and may God bless our country with more brave men like these.
B00005RYLE|5.0|This movie is amazing in that it used a very small budget but took that and created a very imaginative movie.  The director Sam Raimi used excellent sound and camera angles to create a very suspenseful picture.  This is definitely the scariest movie ever made. Bar none.  If you have a weak stomach then it is not for you because it just happens to be the goriest movie ever too.  But in an artistic way it is.  I recommend this movie to any fan of the horror genre.  If you are used to and sick of the bad Jason and Freddy movie sequels, than this is for you.
B00000420F|5.0|Hello !<BR>I have rather ecclectic tastes and this is one of my all time favourite albums.<br />I understood it is a classic sampler of songs (about ? 2/3 are on the album) collected centuries ago to cover all required singing technique &amp; is used as exercises.<br />I can relate to the comments of the previous reviewers.<br />I am NOT an &quot;opera buff&quot; and find some of Cecelia's albums a bit tedious - but not this one.<BR>When I first heard it, I went straight out and bought it.<br />Why ? <br />Enjoyment - most of the songs are very pleasant and easy to &quot;hum / la,la,la along to&quot;.<BR>But mostly because of her astonishing technique.<BR>If this was an exam, I'm sure she'd get a perfect score.<br />Her breathing is incredible. As an untrained singer, I KNOW how good she is, believe me ! <BR>I was, and still am, completely flabberghasted at her ability to vary volume - especially &quot;without breathing&quot;.I have, on occasion, asked friends who actively dislike classical singing to hear certain examples only to consider her ability and in every case they have been very impressed.<br />I also find some of her renditions extremely touching - even devastating: her &quot;expression&quot;is very skilled &amp; genuine.<br />My father (opera buff &amp; amateur singer) was astonished at her age when she recorded it - I think approx. 26 or 7 - he felt she sounded far more &quot;mature&quot; than that on this recording.<br />The accompanying piano is the only instrument and is sensitively and well - played.<BR>The overall impression is of calm with a few lively bursts to break it up. And all the while, excellence.<br />If you are NOT into complete operas or grand, orchestral performances BUT appreciate &amp; enjoy classical music and singing, you should give this a listen.
0062502182|4.0|A friend gave me this book a long time ago and then I had to get it for all my other friends. I loved it at first, then after reading the reviews, sure, I saw the flaws mentioned below. I became skeptical. It is not progressive and it perpetuates narrow views of the world, faith, purpose, the ideal woman too ... but, inspite of this, I find this book to be nourishing and beautiful. I couldnt put it down. It's well written and fun to read. It inspires us to have hope and pay attention to the &quot;signs&quot; out there. Signs of blessing and direction.   Take it as a simple myth, a subtle push to help you reevaluate your life. t
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Once again a big FX budget makes dishwater of an excellent story.  Although the 1960 version was romanced up and the ending made more blithe than the original book, it was --at heart--more true to Wells' work.  Wells' story, however, is brilliant.  From the UN-NAMED main characters to the horrific image at the story's close, the tale is a gripper.  WHY OH WHY can't any director simply take a good story and let it tell itself? This version is laughable, pot-boiler, silly at times, and so full of over FX and over made up villains (who do NOT exist in a person in the orig.) that I nearly puked.  I walked out on this film in the theatre.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I am a Kubrick fan but I do not think he could have done this without Spielberg. I choked up at the end which indicates to me that I felt the character, which never happens with Kubrick movies. If we take out the surplus of the movie we are left with a young boy who will always stay young and was made to love his mother until the end of time but cannot compete with her husband's love for their own son.<BR>A very endearing beautiful story, a bit lengthy but beautiful nevertheless.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Some Hollywood screenwriter has an idea: Let's make a film based on HG Wells's TIME MACHINE.  ONLY, instead of  England, let's set it in Iceland.  Instead of an inventor, the hero is a bus driver and , oh cool! He drives his BUS into the future so he can find out who will win the Latin Grammy award. ONly, in the future there are these gangs of girls who force you to dress like Madonna because, well, because they WaNT to make you do it and then There is a big Crash or explosion, and some Monster, and a fast car . . . ANYWAY, it all ends on Hollywood Boulevard and N'Sync are there and Mr T and Pamela Lee and, maybe we can get George Bush to make a speech about Iraq?  Anyway, we'll call it THE TIME MACHINE!  [HG, I am SOOOOOO SORRY nad apologizefor my era]
B00003CXAA|5.0|It is a must have to any serious movie collector.  Al Pacino is great in it and the story is a definite classic.  It is number 3 on AFI's The Greatest Movies of All Time list following only Citizen Kane and Casablanca.
B00005JKG7|4.0|If you're looking for an atmospheric horror classic with great acting and a haunting theme, look no further! John Carpenter was at the top of his game when he wove this chilling tale of a mysterious fog that rolls into a small seaside town. Easy-on-the-eyes Adrienne Barbeau does a stellar job as a sultry-voiced disc jockey. &quot;Don't go outside! There's something in the fog!&quot; she warns listeners . . . and the listeners soon learn she's right. <BR>If, on some foggy night, you hear a knock on your door--especially a slow, rhythmic pound--I'd think twice about answering it. You just might yourself face-to-face with a sailor from the doomed Elizabeth Dane. And he won't be selling Avon.   <BR>This is definitely one of my all-time favorite fright flicks, and I'm glad it's finally on DVD.
B000006ZL4|5.0|Powerful, passionate and very technical Heavy Metal. But this if you like great guitar and vocals, and well written, original sounding songs.
0671799320|4.0|This book spells out how oil fuels our national affluence, how the very survivals of nations depend upon oil, how competition for oil contributed to WWI and caused WW2, and how the lack of oil defeated Rommell's North Africa campaign and left Japan defenseless. It contains information without which we, the electorate, would be voting largely in the dark. It reveals, for example, the true motivation for our war on Iraq. This book will help to restore our republic. <br />Why only four stars for such a master-work? Because Yergin covered up at least these four major facts:<br />1. That soon after Middle Eastern oil was discovered Britain set up puppet regimes protected by British troops acting as enforcers in a lucrative (for Britain) protection racket. <BR>2. The US/UK's pre-WW2 threat to Japan's access to oil.<BR>3. That Reagan's successful pressure on Saudi-Arabia to sell more oil at lower prices was aimed at destroying the USSR by cutting off its crucial oil income. <BR>4. That US Ambassador April Glasbie OK'd Saddam's invasion of Kuwait.
B000068FUS|5.0|Don't be fooled by the Rock Opera thing.  There is no real linear story in this compilation and the story written in the jacket is totally superfluous and possibly should have been abandoned.  That being said, this is my favorite CD of the year.  Some folks complain of the lack of vocal range of the DBT's and lack of production value, like they were expecting this to sound like Skynyrd, just because it was a tribute to them.  Well if that is your way of thinking, you may be disappointed.  Patterson Hood's vocal range is more simular to a guy some call \\"The Boss\\" than to Ronnie Van Zant.  And truth be told, it was Skynyrd that worked for MCA.  The Truckers are self produced and usually record live.  You can even hear a few hesitations in \\"The Three Great Alabama Icons\\" that must have been \\"awe, screw it, good enough\\" for a band on a tight budget.  But who cares.  This is awesome music and lyrics that are nostalgic,funny, moving and even educational.  The first track, \\"Days of Graduation\\" is about a fatal drunken crash of a teenager and the folklore that ensues that most high schools seem to encounter.  \\"Ronnie and Neil\\" is about the feud in song of Skynyrd and Neil Young.  \\"The Three Great Alabama Icons\\" is Patterson Hood's monologe about Ronnie,Bear Bryant and especially George Wallace.   As a born \\"yankee\\", I must say that this song gave me a good Alabama History lesson and made me feel for the souther man and the stigma of the past he must carry.  \\"Let There Be Rock is a nostalgic and funny take on drinkin'druggin'and rockin'in the '70's.  \\"Life In The Factory\\" , a great song about being rock stars is about the rise of Lynyrd Skynyrd.  The final three tracks are about the fatal plane crash that brought is all to an end.  These are some of my favorites, but really the whole damn CD is great.  Even if your an old rocker like me, pull out the air guitar and crank that stereo.  Even if the wife does complain.
B000069AUI|5.0|I wasn't worried about what kind of sophomore effort Coldplay would produce given the consistent,sometimes uncompromising beauty of &quot;Parachutes&quot;. Instead I looked forward to more of the same from Chris Martin and his retro-Brit band. What you find upon a couple of listens is a band that has shown a progression from ideas of it's debut. Straying from formula and instant &quot;hit&quot; syndrome this wonderful band has crafted a sound that is an amalgam of Smith-y(Title track comes to mind.),early Rod Stewart,Pink Floydian grace. The last track &quot;Amsterdam&quot; is gorgeous enough to evoke tears. Martin's voice may be the best in music today. There is no sophomore slump here only the budding genius of a band that is making it's own mark!! BUY IT!!
0792844890|5.0|Mel Brooks has gone and done it again. With tongue planted firmly in cheek, this sendup of science fiction (most of the roasting aimed at Star Wars) goes beyond the stars to bring you an enjoyable movie. You'll chuckle your way from riffs on the seperate characters and sly asides (especially Yogurt's merchandising spiel), to Mel's usual assortment of jokes and puns. Look for the late John Candy, as well as a young Bill Pullman, amoung the gang of jokers and wiseguys.<br />I felt that my children (ages 10 and 6) could watch this film, despite a few &quot;adult&quot; words and situations. They loved it, and actively ask for this movie when we decide to have a Movie Night.<br />Do I feel that this is the best of the Brooks' comedies? While it might not be THE best, it certainly is up there, and I feel any movie collection can only benefit by including a copy of Spaceballs. While the DVD might not be as fully loaded as some others, I appreciate the choice in screen formats, as well as the audio commentary From Mel Brooks.. a good value for your Spacebuck. May the Shwartz be with you!

B00006AW2G|4.0|This is a great album, but the remaster does not sound any better than the old CD
B000007U6V|5.0|There may be some younger consumers out there who have never heard the title track of this CD.  If you are contemplating purchase of this album, all I would like to say is that the title track \\"Autobahn\\" is one of the most beautiful pieces of pop music that has ever been recorded.  It speaks to its power that in the mid-70s FM radio stations were playing this 22-minute piece (heavy rotation!!) in its entirety, even though nobody had ever heard of electronic pop music before, and despite the fact that it is sung in GERMAN!!  Many years later, it still moves me and every other appreciater of modern music I know, magically evoking the experience of a perfect drive on a perfect day.  The other songs are charming, likeable, but may be dated to modern ears.  Kraftwerk made other albums that were more consistent, even more influential (especially the dance-oriented albums), but they have never created a more perfect moment than they did on this title track.  It is a transcendant and timeless piece of music.
B00005JLHG|4.0|This film is part comedy, part documentary, and is very entertaining. I've certainly been spinning the old Joy Division records in the week since I've seen it! 24HPP may be the first feature film to include a reference to its own future status as a dvd. In fact, it's the self-referential nature that makes the film so fun--Coogan's performance as Wilson is quite brilliant.Maybe not the greatest film ever made, but a better film about the very influential Manchester music scene that I'd have thought possible. More proof of the superiority of the Northern English punk bands!

Good scratchin at the end.<br />There's also 'Uzi' and 'Radioactive' which have great beats. There are a few bad tracks though. 'Babies' isn't that great and I can name a few more.After 10 years Wu-Tang still have it, if you're a fan it's a must, if you're not, then it's a good maybe.
0671027344|5.0|I never thought I would read a book that would make me laugh out loud, and then cry. Then I stumbled along \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" by Steven Chbosky. I loved it.

0679735909|5.0|I have decided that after my reading of this book that it is most aptly named. The act of 'Possession' within the book's context is certainly not passive but transcends the bound pages and possesses even the reader.  After reading the first 250 pages and having those pages lull and mesmerize me with their utterly beautiful language, the second half of the book moves the reader swiftly as if he/she indeed were caught within the fairy fountain and wonderfully drowning within its swells.<br />I attempted the reading of this book when it first was published in 1990; it seemed so delightfully written for someone like myself in mind.  Mystery, romance, literature, poetry, metaphor, hidden meanings, parallel love stories---what more could I ask for?  Sadly, my first attempt failed; I read perhaps 100 pages and could read no more, having made little sense of what actually was being reported.<br />I saw the Paltrow movie recently and encouraged by the plot projected by the movie as well as the performances of the two actors portraying the 19th century lovers made a second attempt at reading this book. This time I am happy to say I was successful.<br />Briefly and without disclosing the novel's ultimate secrets, the book tells the story of two parallel sets of lovers:  Contemporary Maud Bailey and Roland Mitchell and 19th century poet Randolph Henry Ash and poetess Christabel LaMotte.  As an academic researching Randolph Henry Ash, Roland discovers an unfinished love letter of the great poet. Upon further investigation, he finds he believes the letter to have been intended for Christabel LaMotte, another poet of the same time period. This discovery would discount many speculations regarding the poet and his muse and would change the recounting of literary history.  His findings lead him to seek out Maud Bailey, another academic who studies the poetry of LaMotte and has a vague family relation to the poetess.<br />The first half of the book is a little tedious, interspersed with short and epic poems by both fictional authors which unfortunately due to the unknowns not yet reconciled at this early part of the story seem overdone and trivial.  I would suggest rereading these with the help of a fable and phrase dictionary once the entire story is in place.  My own education although good simply falls through the cracks in this arena or I should say that my memory of once-learned folklore and mythology has been usurped sadly by more modern undertakings and could definitely stand a refresher course.  Be that as it may, as the two contemporary academics become 'possessed' by uncovering  the entire truth regarding Ash and LaMotte, the 19th century unfolds with readings of the lovers' letters, Ash's wife's diary, LaMotte's cousin's diary, the poems written during the times shared by the two lovers and a third person narrative supplied by Byatt to further titillate what is not spelled out by the manuscripts.  As the denouement draws closer, Roland and Maud find themselves possessed by each other as well as the past.  This heightening of emotion and awareness drives the reader deeper and deeper into the work devouring Byatt's clever use of different literary styles to delineate the characters from the past until they are full-blooded and breathing creatures rather than stuffy drawing room whose remains one glimpses of in museums. In addition to this is an amusing sub-story of the academic in-fighting between LaMotte and Ash constituents from America and Britain all straining to be the first to make inroads within literary history.  Pay close attention to the descriptive names Byatt gives her characters and relate them to their personality quarks.<br />I found myself reading aloud some of the letters and poems merely to hear the exquisite language aloud and to selfishly luxuriate in its meaning.  I can only imagine by the reading of 'Possession' what it must have been like to assemble the pieces of such a book; my hat is forever off to Ms. Byatt for allowing me the simple pleasure of reading something so well constructed and with such a plethora of meaning.lowing me the simple pleasure of reading something so well constructed and with such a plethora of meaning.

B000062X90|4.0|I've got the Argus album on vinyl and the Japanese import on cd and I've got to say that this new remastered and remixed version is better than both. Ya it sounds better than the vinyl. MCA did such a lousey job of mastering the whole Wishbone Ash catalog on cd initially that they should send all of there consumers a rebate check. I've got a great sound system that cost me in the thousands and every time I would pop on a W.A disc it sounded like I put pillows in front of my speakers. So I went through the expensive process of collecting remastered imports. BGO Records did a great job on the first album and Live Dates and the rest I bought on Japanese import. Here's what really ticks me off. This is the 30th anniversary edition so you would think that everything would be true to the initial vinyl release. Instead the boneheads at MCA trimmed off a little of the slow intro to The King Will Come and then air brushed the flying saucer out of the cover art that the Argus warrior was observing from the hilltop. Why censor or tamper with the album? Wat's up wit dat? It's good that they didn't decide to remove the warriors helmet with a sombreo. The original music and cover art are on the Japanese import but because it is the old mix the sound quality isn't as good as the new American release. The old mix had some inherent distortion on the drummers high hat but with Martin Turner's new remix that problem does'nt exist on the anniversary edition.....

Little girl, Boo (voice done by a real little girl, Mary Gibbs) is a pocket-sized sweetheart who will make the toughest go \\"Awww--\\" My whole family were agonizingly stumped over the voice of the Yeti (Abominable Snowman--\\"who IS that guy?  I KNOW that voice!\\")  For other aurally challenged customers, John Ratzenberger is Cliff the Mailman in \\"Cheers.\\"  He carries off the big, dumb but friendly \\"I don't know my own strength\\" character with aplomb.<br />The package:  Loaded with goodies.  You have a choice of Widescreen or Pan and Scan.  Has an original short of \\"Mike's New Car\\" (fairly funny) and a delightful Oscar Winning Animated Short Film, \\"For the Birds.\\"  There are a couple of very primitive games for the toddler set inexplicably (to me) overdubbed from Japanese.  I loved going through the Monster Door that told you how the animation was done and discarded takes.  My favorite was the \\"hard to do\\" stuff that explained how Sully's furry coat was made to move and blow and get snowed upon.  No one could ever say they were shorted in the \\"extras\\" department.  The sound and picture quality were excellent.

0201485672|4.0|A reasonable amount of the refactorings listed are helpful and I learned good things from reading about them. However, too many of them are basic programming heuristics that many of us know already. I would have liked the authors to spend more time on OO design centric refactorings or at least more advanced general programming refactorings. This book would be helpful to the beginner, but more experienced programmers probably already do many of these refactorings on their own.
B000059ZLH|5.0|What makes this DVD special is its documentation for posterity of how extraordinary it is when people truly master a skill. I'd grown somewhat tired of Dream Theater's intensity and self-indulgence over the years, although I could never say I stopped &quot;liking&quot; the band. After watching this disk, however, I have a newfound appreciation for just how amazing and inspiring these guys are as musicians, composers and performers. I've never seen them live, so this DVD provided me with the visual evidence of their skill that I've always lacked. They are &quot;only&quot; rock musicians, yet they are more professional at what they do than any corporate CEO I've ever met.<br />If this DVD doesn't make you think about the sheer amount of effort and dedication it takes to become extraordinary, I don't know what will. Can you believe it--a band from the 1990's that actually earned its own success? To all the manufactured boy and girl bands of the 90's, I'll pay for your copies of this DVD if you'll watch it.<br />On a similar vein, I couldn't help noticing the portion of DT's fan base with shaved heads, Dream Theater tattoos, and piercings. I can only imagine how far the members of Dream Theater would have gotten if their very existence had revolved around someone else's work and ridiculous attempts to look &quot;fashionable,&quot; rather than evolving and attempting something extraordinary themselves. Yes, there is MUCH to learn from this disk....<br />The DVD interface is a little rough, and it takes a while to get from one menu item to the next. It's no big deal, though.<br />For those who complain that the sound is too low: look for a dial on your stereo labeled &quot;volume,&quot; then turn it up to 11. That should do the trick. This DVD shattered my ears at 5.<br />Thanks for the entertainment and the inspiration, Dream Theater. This disk is proof that you've earned your success!
0316666343|3.0|While Sebold writes well,and has managed a rare if not unusual feat in relating the narration from a first person perspective with an omniscient point of view, too many emotional details are sentimental rather than profound.  Fiction invites the &quot;willing suspension of disbelief,&quot; but it must be rooted in reality.<br />How could the protagonist possibly be happy in heaven while viewing the disintegration of her family and the somewhat troubled maturation of her friends while she stays a little girl?If this were told as a fairy tale it would be more successful.  Sebold does, however, capture the attitudes, interests, and vocabulary of a fourteen-year old girl, and there are times when the narrative is quite moving.

B000069AUI|5.0|Every now and then music speaks to you, teaches you, soothes and comforts you. This is one of those times. Coldplay's first CD &quot;Parachutes&quot; blew my mind, as I'm sure it did to many. It was nice being in England and buying the cd a good year before it hit state side. With this second helping of emotive rock, Coldplay once again elevated its emotional threshold. With &quot;Trouble's cousin &quot;Clocks&quot; pivoting the album, only to be followed up 3 tracks later with &quot;Warning Sign&quot; to further reveal the shimmering beauty that is their music. Music that touches you and helps you to move on with things
0553573403|5.0|My actual rating for this book would be four-and-a-half stars, because I've never read a perfect book before and I don't think there will ever be one. But this book is, especially for a fantasy book, as close to perfect as any could possibly get.<br />I'm no stranger to long, epic fantasies, and don't get me wrong; I like reading the sword-and-sorcery epics like those written by Goodkind and Jordan. But A Game of Thrones is a breakthrough in fantasy writing, because of the fact that it's full of imperfect characters that are all shades of grey. This type of writing has been missing from the fantasy genre for a long time, as most concentrate on a main protagonist who overcomes all odds to beat evil.<br />The characterizations are also the best I've seen in a while. For me, characters define how good a story is. No character development, no story. Martin has done a great job in weaving their differing points-of-view into a highly coherent account of a 'game of thrones'. He gets his point across very well: you either win the game, or you die (heheheh!)<br />The only reason I can think of NOT to read this book is the liberal sprinkling of sex and violence. Otherwise, it is a fine read from a good author.
B00000ING2|4.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. This is the type of movie you sit down and watch with friends. If you like movies like &quot;Strange Brew&quot; and &quot;Ferris Buller's Day Off&quot; you'll enjoy the Proxy. <br />A little slow in the very begining and in the middle buy well worth it in the end.
0871137380|4.0|If you like military history or novels, than this book is a must.

Those who are expecting a recap of the movie may be mildly disappointed. However, the book is a documentary unlike the movie, and you can't fault the author or the book for it.<br />Mr. Bowden did an excellent job.
B00005KB9R|5.0|The songs \\"Reincarnated Souls,\\" (Bunny Wailer) \\"No Sympathy\\" (Peter Tosh) and \\"The Oppressed Song\\" (Bunny Wailer) are the major additions to the earlier collection, and these three simply reinforce this \\"Burnin\\" album as the Wailers' best kept secret of excellence! This is the first time I ever hear these three grest additions! What else is still hidden in the Wailers' closets? :-). The whole collection mainly involves songs of revolution and of spiritualism e.g., \\"Burnin' and Looting \\" \\"Reincarnated Souls\\" and \\"Small Axe.\\" Some of the <BR>tunes are simply soothing, and of note here is \\"Hallelujah <BR>Time\\" \\"Reincarnated Souls\\" and \\"The Oppressed Song\\" (in the <BR>sweet voice of Bunny Wailer (Neville Livingstone--which voice <BR>has been praised by countless others) and \\"Rasta Man Chant\\" which is a song-beat by the Wailers as a group. In \\"No Sympathy\\" <BR>Peter Tosh sweetly voices his elusive search for peace, love, rest, happiness, and advice from friends in an excellent <BR>beautiful song. But he still nurses hope. Given the excellence <BR>of this collection, including the music and the lyrics, and given that it was quite a united effort by a Beatles status black African group that was later to break up or take on solo careers, this album takes the status of a collectible whose value will continue to grow with time. Two frequently mentioned titles on this album are \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" and \\"Get Up, Stand Up.\\" I have tended to compare the Burnin' album to the \\"Catch a <BR>Fire\\" album (another excellent effort by the original Wailers that included Neville \\"Bunny Wailer\\" Livingston and Peter Tosh who together with Bob became more famous than the others of the group) and the \\"Natty Dread\\" album. These are all albums I will always cherish, and they are all representative of the Wailers' music tradition.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Oh man, I was starting to wonder if indie rock would ever shake me awake and kick me in the [arse] again.  Well, this album did.  The vocals answer the never-considered question: what would a cross between Ian Curtis and Julian Casablancas sound like?  And the music leaps seamlessly from shoegazy brilliance reminiscent of Ride, My Bloody Valentine, and Mogwai to the driving, stacatto beats of Joy Division...or even Neu!  Yet in spite of its lofty influences, this baby still manages to jump off the shelf and rock one's world.  I may never recover.  Best album of 2002 thus far.
0440219078|5.0|I read this book when I was in fourth grade and I thought it was really great.

B000068FY0|5.0|If there is one band that has made such a strong entrance into the musical mainstream while still keeping their artistic dignity, it is no doubt Supertramp. And though it's hard to choose just one release from their excellent catalogue of albums that exemplifies this musical transition, 1974's \\"Crime Of the Century\\" is probably the best way to start.<br />Many musicians envy the position of keyboardist Rick Davies in 1969. He recruited Supertramp, and all was funded by a Dutch millionaire. After releasing two mediocre albums which hardly made a dent in the charts (one of which was probably only best known for its cover art), their millionaire supporter withdrew his funding, leaving a somewhat bleak future in Supertramp's way. But nonetheless, Davies reformed his band, consisting of Rodger Hodgson, John Helliwell, Bob Siebenberg and Dougie Thompson, and in 1974 released the acclaimed \\"Crime Of the Century.\\"<br />The music within is nothing short of a dazzling spectacle. Blending R&B, jazzy roots, rock-n-roll, and a unique pop element, \\"Crime Of the Century\\" is the backdrop for Supertramp's three other splendid albums of the 70s, and maybe even further on than that. The songwriting of Davies and Hodgson shows them becoming the next Lennon & McCartney (with the exception that the Supertramp duo actually writes quality pop music). The musicianship of the entire fivesome is astounding, topped with sleek production. A great deal of the band's most musically accomplished classics are found on \\"Crime Of the Century,\\" such as the symphonic title track, the dead-on radio staple 'Bloody Well Right,' and the blunt humorless 'School' (you may know it as being more or less ripped off by Roger Waters of Pink Floyd as 'Another Brick in the Wall Part 2' in 1979).<br />\\"Crime Of the Century\\" is, simply put, definitely one of the most dignified pop albums ever made. But the true 'crime of the century' if you will, is the underappreciation of Supertramp's brilliant music. Sure, their albums sold millions, but it remains true that the band remains overlooked for being major contributors to dignified pop music. Nonetheless, recognized or not, \\"Crime Of the Century\\"--like the band's entire lexicon-- remains solid proof that Supertramp are indeed among the true perfectors of quality pop music.sold millions, but it remains true that the band remains overlooked for being major contributors to dignified pop music.

0671027344|5.0|I read this a year or two ago when I was the same age as the main character.  I was instantly drawn to the story of Charlie because I could relate to him.  The only criticism I had with the story related to Charlies experiences.  I believe however that this criticism is what really made the book work.  Charlie has so many different experiences that everyone who reads the book can not only relate to him in some way but can also feel very distant from him.  I think this combination of being able to relate and feeling distant at the same time truely makes the reader understand Charlie.  Also, Charlies experiences range so much that I think if you can't relate to his experiences then you can surely be reminded of a friend or family member who could.  I think anyone who has lived a life at all would enjoy this book and I think that while reading it you can learn a lot about yourself and about others.
0316776963|4.0|Well, I can't certify to some readers' comments that this book is laugh-out-loud funny.  I find it humorous and poignant through out.  Some essays I laughed, some I pondered, and some made me think.  However, I like this book a lot, especially the tapes read by the author himself.
B000002MP2|5.0|We are now in 2002, I have listened to this CD ever since it came out when I was in elementary.  GREENDAY'S DOOKIE IS BY FAR, THE BEST ALBUM EVER CREATED!!!  I have countless memories of chillin' while listening to this CD.  This is the kind of music that you listen to while buzzing and watching cartoons.  Getting a little old, but is no reason to not buy it if you havnt gotten it yet.  We occasionally still play it at parties when everyone lazy'ing off!!! A++++++++++++
6302787068|3.0|This movie has many hilarious parts, especially those with the genie. The dialogue can be quite humorous at times, and the music is quite good. The aspect of the film I was most discontented with is the portrayal and voice of the princess, Jasmine. The sullen voice of the princess standing up for her independence and her right to marry whoever she wants, even if he is a street rat, almost makes you want to gag. But the sappier parts are so dumb they made me laugh rather than cringe. So aside from that rather blatant problem, the movie is actually quite enjoyable as a whole.
B00006G8HX|4.0|I like this Star Trek III:The Search for Spock Special Collector's Edition! It gives new meaning to this beloved Star Trek film. Adimiral Kirk (William Shatner) riskes his own life to save his lost friend Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy). Kirk finds out from Spock's Father Sarek (Mark Lenard) that Spocks Katra is missing. Sarek tells Kirk that in Star Trek II, Spocks body was near death but his living spirit, his Katra must still be alive. Kirk and Sarek findout that Dr. McCoy (Deforest Kelly) was the one that carried Spock's Katra. Sarek persades Kirk to bring both Spock and McCoy to Vulcan so that his mind and body can be put back together. Admiral Kirk is under direct orders from Commander Starfleet not to go to the Genisis planet. Of Course, Kirk disregards the orders and steals the Starship Enterprise with the help from the main crew. Kirk confronts the Klingons and the main Villian in this film is Kruge (Christopher Lloyd) Kirk and Kruge battle to the death but Kirk loses many things in this film. Kirk loses his son David. he is also forced to self destruct the his ship, The Starship USS Enterprise! I like the commentary by director Leonard Nimoy and text commentary by Micheal Okuda on Disc 1. They give more helpful information on how this Star Trek Movie was created. I enjoyed this DVD a-lot and the new interviews with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Harve Bennett, Christopher Lloyd and Robin Curtis On Disc 2 are great! The Movie trailer and other special features on Disc 2 are good too! Buy it! Highest possible Recommendation!
B000067DNC|5.0|Like all of you, I'm waiting for the second boxed set since the first one was released because it's simply the best sci-fi serie I know. But I'm asking you a question, is there anybody knowing if, like the first season, a french track will be included on the DVDs.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect from this movie because I'm not a really big fan of comic books or anything, but I really loved this movie!  I'll be looking forward to the next one.
B000069AUI|3.0|I'm dismayed that no one is here to puncture the airy (and empty) bubble of praise this album is receiving.  I was worried when I heard &quot;In My Place,&quot; which is simply a retread of the sound of Coldplay's first album, PARACHUTES.  Then I read an uncharacteristically sychophantic review from NME which smelled strongly of hyperactive hype, rather than substance.  And, having bought the album regardless and given it many listens, I'm afraid it is indeed hype that's fluffing this beast into an apparently imposing shape.<br />Coldplay's new album isn't terrible.  At best, though, it's terribly generic, and at worse, it strains to be noticed.  The main problem with this record is it reeks of a band trying too hard.  This is apparent in the insipid, cliche lyrics, in the over-produced studio sound, in the feeling that you've heard these melodic tropes many times from other bands (that includes Coldplay ripping themselves off).  (If you're impressed with the Echo &amp; the Bunnymen-like melody of &quot;Clocks,&quot; it's because Echo frontman Ian McCulloch was supervising the song.)  Coldplay want desperately to be Radiohead.  They want to be a Serious Band full of edges and politics and progression.  Nothing wrong with being any of these things, if this is where things naturally lead.  Problem is, rather than simply developing naturally, and possibly happening upon this kind of substance, Coldplay are forcing themselves.  And the Radiohead role is not one they're suited for; this is not where their talents lie.  PARACHUTES had a charismatic simplicity and emotional honesty which made it a satisfying record.  The band was obviously more relaxed, not trying so hard to prove themselves.  They'd do well to develop that quality, as their obvious talent could sustain them while they become a truly accomplished band.  For now, however, they've forgotten that it's authenticity which makes lasting art, not straining imitation.<br />(There's excellent music being made in the genre that Coldplay are playing in, by the way.  Apart from Radiohead, check out the sadly overlooked Elbow or Norway's Poor Rich Ones, for starters.)
B000003JA9|4.0|The year 1971 was one which saw the progressive rock scene begin to come to life, which started to brim with a creative batch of verve and whimsical ideas. Jethro Tull was one such group that could be counted on to deliver the goods, carried out brilliantly both in the musical and lyrical department in linear 'progressive' fashion. Actually, \\"Aqualung\\" is a concept album, as noted on the first generation CD's back cover, with the listing being comprised of two mini-suites: \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"My God\\". Both suites have their artistic moments - with \\"Aqualung's\\" high points being well-stated and scoped out with the classic rock radio staples \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" and the title track, which sees overly-frequent airplay to this day. Other exceptional tracks on the \\"Aqualung\\" suite include the vaguely humorous \\"Cheap Day Return\\" and the thought-provoking \\"Wond'ring Aloud\\", among others. Other standout gems are featured in the \\"My God\\" suite as well, as our hero (Aqualung) is about to meet his fate. Ian Anderson's artistic wit and depth is displayed in full-force in this section, as is displayed in yet another classic rock anomaly, \\"Locomotive Breath\\". \\"Hymn 43\\", \\"Slipstream\\" and the closer \\"Wind-Up\\" are the ultra-rich fabric that holds the rest of this seamless, yet timeless masterwork together. With such a wondrous array of songs interwoven together in a smooth, concise fashion, combined with a neoclassical album cover, featuring our hero (resembling Christ, perhaps), \\"Aqualung\\" is truly a sumptuous feast to the ears, thus belonging in everyone's CD collection. Although \\"Aqualung\\" is an upstanding Tull masterpiece, Anderson & Co. would take their art-rock musical & lyrical skills to the next level with their next release \\"Thick As A Brick\\", as that release would beat out \\"Aqualung\\" by just a small margin. But, no Jethro Tull collection is complete without \\"Aqualung\\" AND \\"Thick...\\" in one's all-important CD library. Grab 'em both, while they're still hot!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Hanks and Spielberg have produced an amazing adaptation of Ambrose's book.  The mini series' depiction of Easy Company's ride through the war is about as honest and realistic as it can get.  The 10 episodes are tough going, especially the depiction of a concentration camp in episode nine.  The usage of interviews with veterans is a reminder that the events really happened, and that war is a horrible thing.
B000069HKH|5.0|Some have been taken off guard because The Rising doesnt sound like anything the Boss has done before.. which is excellent to me. Before I listened to this album, I was afraid that Bruce would simply copy himself and deliver a predictable album filled with cars, girls and youth anthems, which would have been a horrible failure. This is not the 70s and Bruce is not 28 anymore.  On the other side, I was afraid too that I would die of boredom if he delivered another album like The ghost of Tom Joad: intellectual, slow and boring stuff. The Rising greatest virtue is surprise. I never expected something this different yet so enjoyable! The Boss sounds very loose, more relaxed and the most creative in decades. The Rising is about new sounds: there are many strings and feminine voices here, but this is also familiar ground, since he used strings and Suki Lahav in the Born to run era. The best song (and the most Est band - like) is My city in ruins. The single should have been Waiting on a sunny day. On the negative side, Clarence and Bittan's piano are much missed, and there are two fillers: Mary's place and The fuse.
B000069HKH|4.0|I have never been a fan of Springsteen.  Prior to this album I owned &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;.  So I could hardly be called a fan.  After hearing &quot;The Rising&quot; on the radio I was moved to buy this CD and I understand what people see in him.<br />On an emotional level you can feel the fear, pain and sorrow these songs convey.  Springsteen's rough blue-collar voice adds to this image and creates a moving tale of our nation after the 9/11 attacks.<br />I will say that because I am not a Springsteen fan, the album has no fully grown on me.  Currently there are about 5 song I play constantly.  I expect eventually I will come to enjoy the rest of the album
B00003CXRM|5.0|What the Coen brothers have created here is a film that is going to last. It quickly made it into my list of top ten movies. It's the Depression-era story of three escaped convicts and their journey to redemption. And along the way they face many trials and tribulations. It's no wonder the story is such a good one, since the film is based on Homer's classic poem, The Odyssey (which the Coen brothers claim to never have read. I don't know that I believe them, but I suppose they could have read the Cliff's Notes).  George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson do a fabulous job as the leads. And John Goodman and Holly Hunter have wonderful supporting roles. The music in this film takes on the aspect of a character. And while I wouldn't call this a musical, song occurs and affects what is going on--and it occurs in the logical places instead of the characters just breaking into song whenever. In fact, I think the soundtrack made a bigger splash than the film (but give it time, I think that people will begin to realize the importance of this film soon enough). Color and the visual style of the film also takes on the aspects of being its own character. I know that the entire film was put through a digital workshop in order to give it the visual feel the Coen brothers wanted. This movie is destined to be one of the all time greats.<br />Unfortunately the dvd doesn't contain a commentary by the Coens or the stars. It is a shame, because I think a Coen commentary would have helped to round out this dvd perfectly. There is a behind the scenes featurette and a featurette that discusses the post-production digital process, both of which are good. There is a menu option that allows you to compare the storyboard with the completed scene (of the Klan scene and the final scene). And finally there is the \\"I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow\\" music video that helps to complete the dvd. It's a charming video. <br />This is a film I've already seen a dozen times and will continue to watch as time goes on.
B000059QYB|3.0|More is not always better as this album proves. It's very nicely remastered but some of the takes are quite different than the 'Vital Idol' album, notably 'Flesh For Fantasy' and 'To Be Your Lover', which lose a lot of it's impact in the shorter versions. There are some gems here however, 'Sweet Sixteen' being quite a surprise. There are two takes of 'Rebel Yell', studio and live version. A good companion to 'Vital Idol', so stick them both in your CD carosoul.
0142000663|5.0|That's what we learn from reading this Steinbeck masterpiece.  The irrepressible Joad family takes an unforgettable journey west to the promised land of California from their bank-confiscated farm in desolate Oklahoma.  Steinbeck utilizes the setting of the Great Depression to the fullest through his vivid imagery of the colors of grey and red, his naturalism, which makes the land a character in its own right, his transcendentalism and symbolism, both which bring ulterior meaning to many seemingly mundane goings-on throughout The Grapes of Wrath.<br />Steinbeck brings to life characters that I empathize for and felt after 200 pages as if I were a member of their family rooting them on after all they had persevered through.  The struggle of the Joads to put food on their plates at the end of the night after picking cotton or peaches all day long for next to nothing makes me extremely thankful to have food and shelter -things most of us take for granted.  The Joads struggle for their place in society and for their identity, which was unconscionably taken away from them and thousands of other &quot;Okies&quot;.  The Joad family undergoes a stark transformation from naive idealists to destitute pessimists and finally back to optimistic and hopeful for the future.  Te Grapes of Wrath proves to be the definitive novel of the Great Depression and one that every American should read in order to fully understand the most apocalyptic time in American history and fully appreciate our lives today and the many luxuries that we all take for granted.  Undoubtedly one of the top 5 American novels of all time.
B00005RYL9|5.0|first of all let me say that the picture quality on the immortal edition far surpasses the quality of the republic pictures collectors edition. not to mention all the extras you already know about.<BR>as far as the movie is concerned it is a classic.<BR>when i had first seen this i had just read all the \\"CASCA THE IMMORTAL WARRIOR\\" books and thought this would just be a rip off.<BR>but it turned out to be one of my favorite movies as well as the sequels 3 and 4....(i don't think there was ever a 2.....i refuse to acknowledge the existance)unfortunetly the television series far surpasses the original movie (as i own every episode of the six season show i can vouch for that )so that when i watch the original movie it does not have the same zing that it had the first 50 times(just kidding i've only seen this movie about 5 times)but the movie is light enough for repeated viewing as well as always entertaining..it will fit nice in any dvd collection.
B00000K413|5.0|I don't want to write ad nauseaum, but this album (no CD's when this came out) transformed me and related to my inner being in a way that only few artists/releases can.  I have over 2,200 CD's, and this is easily in my top 10 rock/pop releases of all time in terms of sheer likeability, emotion, compositional quality, etc.  I listen to this now in 2002, and it still floors me 19 years after it was released!!!  The music is masterfully 'pop-ish', but retains an intensity and tenseness coupled to simply classy beautiful memorable songs.  The result is one of the most unique and refreshing releases to date.  Every song is super fantastic, with my personal faves being \\"The Hurting\\", \\"Mad World\\", \\"Pale Shelter\\", \\"Memories Fade\\", and \\"Watch Me Bleed\\".  This is, quite possibly, the BEST release of the 80's!
B00006FXB6|5.0|We're talking real rock here kiddies,the thundering guitars and disjointed song structure along with the insane drumming of Dave Grohl make for a hell of a musical experience.The album starts with \\"You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar,But I Feel Like A Millionaire\\" a song that hits you like a speeding train then goes into the poppy & catchy \\"No One Knows\\" ,there's the wonderfully deep and dark \\"Hanging Tree\\" and then there's \\"God Is In The Radio\\" an aggressive yet catchy song ,the whole album is brilliant and the fake radio bits interspersed throughout the album are hillarious!Plus you get the DVD ,chock full of cool ,funny stuff.A must get!

'Aliens' is science fiction, '2001: A Space Odessey' is science fiction, this is certainly NOT NOT NOT Science Fiction!!!<br />I happen to LOVE Jodie Foster, she is a skilled actress as proven by films like 'The Accused' or 'Slience of the Lambs' films which she has both won acadamy awards for; Howver i am pressed to ask the question, Why on earth could such an intelligent woman participate in what is one of the most appauling pieces of transparent religious nonsense? <br />It makes me angry to think that in the first half hour a girl is told that her father died because God 'Willed It' Well what kind of a God or Person is prepared to tell a nine year old child that God wanted her parents to die!<br />If you are religious by all means watch it, it will teach you a lesson, as at one point a reliogous figure KILLS hundreds of people! show it to your kids too, it will show them how dangerous religion is! <br />Why oh why as a Science fiction and Jodie Foster Fan i am asking couldnt they have ended the film with a scientific explanation like of the one in the book 'Choccy' written by John Wyndam, instead of some brainwashing piece of sentimental rubbish?
B00000K413|5.0|I don't want to write ad nauseaum, but this album (no CD's when this came out) transformed me and related to my inner being in a way that only few artists/releases can.  I have over 2,200 CD's, and this is easily in my top 10 rock/pop releases of all time in terms of sheer likeability, emotion, compositional quality, etc.  I listen to this now in 2002, and it still floors me 19 years after it was released!!!  The music is masterfully 'pop-ish', but retains an intensity and tenseness coupled to simply classy beautiful memorable songs.  The result is one of the most unique and refreshing releases to date.  Every song is super fantastic, with my personal faves being \\"The Hurting\\", \\"Mad World\\", \\"Pale Shelter\\", \\"Memories Fade\\", and \\"Watch Me Bleed\\".  This is, quite possibly, the BEST release of the 80's!
0743216385|5.0|Stephen Ambrose has written a gripping account of an airborne infantry company in World War II -- from its origins in a Georgia training camp, through its combat operations in Western Europe, to its eventual capture of Berchtesgaden, Hitler's retreat in Bavaria, at the close of the war.  Ambrose comments tellingly on the roots of personal courage and unit cohesion in the face of violent conflict, cold, hunger and the possibility of imminent death.  On a broader scale, he shows how the grand-scale strategies of General Eisenhower and other commanders become implemented in the specific tactics of Easy Company and other allied units in the field.  I particularly liked the small maps provided for the interested reader to trace the tactical movements of Easy company, and also the photographs of its personnel.  The televised series based on Ambrose's work was interesting, but it could not give us the texture and breadth that the book provides so well.  This is a book that I will re-read in the future and I highly recommend it.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|There aren't many sequels that can actually improve on their originals, but \\"Blade II,\\" one of those rare sequels that's actually better than the original there are stronger sense a more rounded lead performance from Wesley Snipes, first-rate action choreography and a plot that adds new elements to vampire mytholog.<BR>balde 2 is one of the best action/horror flicks this year (2002) you want gore, you want swordfights, fistfights, bloodsuckers, really, really loud rockin' music...this movie is for you.<BR>As for the acting, I'm becoming convinced that Wesley Snipes IS Blade. I can easily see there being a couple more sequels in the series, and just as Sean Connery will forever be associated with James Bond and Harrison Ford with Indiana Jones, so will Snipes be with his creature of the night, Blade. He plays the part perfectly; it's one of those things you just sort of take for granted and don't really think about, but if you do happen to ponder who else would be able to play the role, I don't think you'd be able to think of anyone else. He puts more emotion into Blade in this movie than he did in the first one here he displays his hatred of the Bloodpack, his martial arts skills, and his romantic side In fact this is one of those movies where you really believe the cast are vampires<br />If there is going to be another installment in the series, I sure hope it comes soon.I really don't want to have to wait another four years for it
B00003CXZ4|5.0|MR. GREEN. If your all alone and need a good movie this is it so pick it up. I was so amazed by this movie. it has a great ending. the special features aren't that great so settle for the two disc one. Joe pantiliano is awesome and is a suprise charector in the end. Guy pearce is awesome and gives a great preformence. it is really weird that Christopher nolan got no ascar for this movie it should have got atleat one. for those of you who don't know the movie plays backwards so the end of the story is at the begging and the begging of the story is at the end. Its a great movie about a man called Lenoard shelby, whos wife was killed but he lost his memory and writes himself little notes to help him on his quest to find out who killed her because he cna't remember so he'll talk to people over and over again like he never met them. This movie is cool. Hi my names Mr. Green I'm 14 and i'm going to give my review about the movie memento, i've probably told you all about the review but i can't remember if i did, I Don't remember if i even met you before, its because i have this condition...anyway i'm righting the review backwards to show you what the movie's like.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I am so sick of everyone over-criticizing Britney Spears.  I didn't like her at first, either; but she's won me over and now I recriminate myself for being so uncharacteristically close-minded about her.  I like Britney; she's equal portions of both Janet Jackson and Madonna, and yet has her own style despite those influences.  Her singing has improved and so have her songs.  I borrowed a copy of this CD from the library on a whim and was quite surprised to find how REALLY good it was!!  Her cover of \\"I Love Rock and Roll\\" is a little shaky; she doesn't quite have the voice for it and besides, a good cover will add something new to the song as well as staying true to the spirit of the original--which this doesn't.  Still, I've heard worse.  The other songs are ALL strong and worthy of being singles; my favorites are \\"Boys\\", \\"Anticipating\\", \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Let Me Be\\" and \\"Bombastic Love\\".  She actually uses \\"damn\\" and \\"hell\\", each in different songs(\\"Overprotected\\" and \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\"), in a particular context which I don't find gratuitous at all.  This  album deserves some respect for one of the best of its genre in a long time.  So does Britney.  I, for one, will be proud to admit to owning a copy of this album and defending her right to evolve.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|What was the point of this movie? I think I know: Anyone but a film student knows that addiction and compulsive behavior are abnormal and lead to misery, and thus doesn't need to explore it in typically sensational detail. Keep the exaggerated obskene off the skene, Mr. Aronofsky.    Take it for what it's worth.    Addendum added 9-16-02:    I could care less about the \\"technique\\" and filmmaking procedures involved in the production of this movie. Those things are really not relevant to what one actually sees on a screen. I'm not a film student or filmmaker. What matters to me in a film is the finished product. The finished product in the case of this movie is not good in many ways, most of which are not relevant in an Amazon.com review and would require a great deal more space(and time)to develop. Perhaps the worst part, though, about this flick thought is that it inspires legions of pretensious \\"bohemian/artistic/literary\\" types that are oddly dressed to ponder it ad infinitum. Tuck me in already. . .G'night.
B000002J1U|5.0|While critic and fans all seem to think this quartet's 4th LP is their best (and it is a GREAT LP) I've always had a special fondness for album number 3, released just after the month I was born. The softer, quieter, acoustic songs make this a fine transitional effort from a band that would soon gain legendary status and go on to become the biggest band in the world during the 70's. While the opening \\"Immigrant Song\\" is a terrific, pummeling rocker that recalls the Zeppelin of their first 2 albums, the tide quickly shifts from heavy to acoustic and melodic, even playful with \\"Friends\\". \\"Celebration Day\\" is another fine rocker that picks the pace back up with one of Jimmy Page's catchiest riffs and a piercing solo. The flawless, aching delivery of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is one the finest blues tracks this band has ever laid down and every member is in jaw-droppingly good form. Robert Plant's voice seems to be almost in shreds when the song ends. The other highlight, \\"That's The Way\\" is so gorgeous, you nearly forget that you're listening to a hard-rock band! All of Led Zeppelin's LP's are highly recommended, but to hear the more subdued side of this fantastic foursome, pick up \\"III\\" , it's a fine listen from a band that could do it all.
B000008H1Y|5.0|I'm a big tull fan, and having read all the great reviews for this album, thought I'd buy it, after all i've never been let down by this band. And this was no exception. Some people say it's like the older tull, but i must disagree, the first few albums were bluesy, not folky like this.  The best songs on here are, in my opinion, Cup of Wonder; Hunting Girl(possibly the best); Ring Out, Solstice Bells; Velvet Green..actually, it's all good. Sorry to right such a short review, but if you like Jethro Tull, get this.  If you're just beginning to get into them, go with the essentials, Aqualung, Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play(for anyone who read my stupid Passion Play review, i've changed my view on the it, it's good, very good).
0792844890|3.0|I first saw this film when I was 12, and I remember how much I laughed when I saw it.<BR>This is a spoof of all things science fiction, it has references to Star Trek, and all of the charcters are based on thos in Star Wars.<BR>The story is that a group of charcters known as the Spaceballs, led by the evil Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) and Colnel Sanders ( can you believe it?) plan to steal the air from planet Druidia for their own planet. But first, they need something to bargain with. And so, they plot to kidnap Princess Vespa, the daughter of King Roland of Druidia. She has just jilted her fiance at the altar in search of adventure.<BR>Enter Lone Star and his sidekick Barf ('Barf, Puke. Whatever!), who are hired by the King to rescue her before she is taken captive by the Spaceballs.<BR>The sort of film one would watch at home on a rainy day.
B000069AUI|5.0|Folks, I like discs that are excellent from their first track to their last -- e.g., The Beatles 'White' album, U2's The Joshua Tree, Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, Sting's The Soul Cages, etc.  There are VERY few releases (past or present) that live up to my scrutiny and remain in my player before quickly finding their way to the used CD bin.  That having been said, Coldplay has orchestrated a masterpiece.  In a word, this disc is an experience.  Enough cannot be said, yet too much already has been.  Just do yourself a favor and buy the disc already.<br />Other recommendations (in addition to those mentioned above): The Stone Roses (self-titled), Tori Amos - Little Earthquakes, Travis - The Man Who, Tracy Chapman (self-titled), R.E.M. - Automatic for the People, 10,000 Maniacs - Our Time in Eden, Pete Yorn - musicforthemorningafter, Sarah McLachlan - Mirrorball, Van Morrison - Moondance, and The Sundays - Static &amp; Silence
B00000JG4N|5.0|DR FEELGOOD is the biggest album in MOTLEY CRUE'S collection. This album has it all, sex drugs and rock n roll. The band cleaned up their act, got straight and put out their best album yet. If I can remember, I think almost every song was released as a single back in the day. This album has some great rock songs that will forever be played on rock radio, DR FEELGOOD, KICKSTART MY HEART, S.O.S, DONT GO AWAY MAD, WITHOUT YOU. The less played songs here like SHE GOES DOWN, TIME FOR A CHANGE, STICKY SWEET, SLICE OF YOUR PIE are songs that the listener should give a listen to also. The musicianship on this album is top notch. Tommy laying down some furious beats on the drums, Mick just giving us some killer riffs on guitar, Nikki really worte some great songs for this on and Vince sounded really good on this one. The unreleased material is good also. So all in all I think that this is an album worthy of being added to your collection
B00006AW2G|5.0|This has always been my favorite Rolling Stones album since it was released and this in spite of the fact that I have never thought my favorite cut on the album, &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; was that well-recorded.  However after listening to the SACD version of this for a week now, I am blown away by the sound and the new depth I hear in the album.  Merry Clayton's voice on &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; gives me chills.  <br />First of all, the entire album has much more dynamic &quot;punch&quot; and lower-end focus.  There is more warmth and clarity.  I hear many more details, but the main impression is not what individual sounds I am now hearing but the overall effect of the music -- it just sounds more musical.  Whether listening to it loud, or at a lower ambient level, it's a real pleasure.  I don't know if those who don't have SACD will hear much difference, but on a very good system that has SACD capability, this recording really shines.  <br />Note:  My experience is that in listening to SACD recordings of favorite and familiar albums, I like and appreciate the quality more and more, even in some songs that didn't seem to be very different at first.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|It is an old literature axiom that all good fiction is autobiographical, meaning of course that among other things, writing believably and well about any subject requires not only knowing something about it but understanding it as well. That this idea has merit is substantiated by this remarkable period piece both written and directed by Cameron Crowe. As he did in his quite captivating original screenplay for \\"Fast Times At Ridgemont High\\", he mines his personal background with an uncanny ear for realistic situations, dialogue, and personal experience to pull us deep into the quirky and sometimes surrealistic world of sixties rock<br />The protagonist of the film is a teen-something reporter for Rolling Stone magazine, and like Crowe, has an eyes-wide-open view of everything swirling around him, from sex, drugs and rock and roll to all the happenings associated with the rock and roll lifestyle itself. One finds William (newcomer Patrick Fugit) sucked into the vortex of a fictitious rock band's pulsating experience, and the moment to moment happenings surrounding Stillwater are so realistic, believable, and palpable that we roll along with it all, finding too much to remember from what we recall of the sixties. Also excellent are the ensemble of supposed Stillwater rock musicians, from Billy Crudup to Jason Lee, and the very lovely Kate Hudson showing her future potential as a leading lady in a powerful and convincing role here.<br />This is the closest any of us are likely to come to living vicariously in a rock and roll band. The fact is that Cameron Crowe actually did experience a lot of what goes down here himself as a sixteen year old reporter, and the verve and energy in the film owes to this authentic recollection of those times, and to his uncanny ear for all the elements of the rock scene. This is a terrific movie, and although it is fiction, is also quite representative of the times it purports to describe. Enjoy!
B00003ZKS1|5.0|As it happened with a lot of artists that went solo (Dio, Ozzy, Bruce Dickinson, etc), their first solo record is a gem.<br />This was the case for Michael Schenker´s solo debut, MSG. It´s a master-piece that has endured the passing of time. Firstly, he chose a great lead singer in Gary Barden. Then, Simon Philips´ (needs no introductino, this guy!) drumming is amazing. Roger Glover added a crispy and in-your-face sound. All the songs are great and a lot of them are still standards in his live set.<br />It´s a shame that Michael´s inconstant behavior was responsible for an endless change of line-ups in his band, and this alone caused MSG to have not alasting impact in the metal scenario, altough Michael´s reputation as one of the hottest guitar players on Earth remained intact, and even increased.<br />You can´t do no wrong with this album. It´s just great.
1577311523|5.0|Tolle does an excellent job of explaining how we each get caught up in our emotions and then provides concrete tools that really work to enable us to be with our emotions and others without getting drawn into the drama of the emotions.  His techniques are helpful to realize how to \\"be\\" centered with yourself and with others in relationships.  If you find you are often anxious, angry, depressed, and/or sad, buy this book and learn how you can be different.

0345446798|5.0|I would have written my thoughts on Patricia McConnell's book. &quot; The Other End of the Leash&quot; sooner, but I was too busy reading and rereading this exceptional book. I am the owner of multiple dogs (as well as being owned by multiple dogs), and few books address both the behavior of one and many as well as Patricia McConnell has--and no book has done it better.<br />The Other End of the Leash weaves stories and lessons in a way that will capture every reader. The highest compliment I can pay to this indispensable book is that it was written by someone who really loves dogs, and it shows.<br />Tom Payne<BR>Author &quot;A Company of One&quot;
0767819543|3.0|Central Station is the story of two people on a quest, a retired schoolteacher who writes letters for the illiterate in the Rio's Central Station, and a seven year old boy who's mother came to her to contact her husband, the boy's father. Then, in a scene straight out of numerous Shirley Temple films, the mother is suddenly dispatched by a bus.  But this is not Old Hollywood, nor is it a first world country, and the events that follow, the fate of the boy as illustrated, will shock the average first worlder and American.  That there is no social safety net is only the beginning.  Fortunately, the letter writer, initially a cold and cynical, judgemental, shell of a human being, begins to see a greater calling and she and the boy set off in search of his father.  This is not the Rio of Carnaval, nor the Brazil of Samba and bikinis.  Still, the bleak settings, the sparse dialogue, weave a captivating story that deserves the tears one eventually sheds.  This is cinema!
B000063V8T|5.0|This is the only season I really want, as it is by far the best.  Seasons 3 and 4 were good, but without the polishing and wonderful dialogue & writing of the fifth year. After the peak of the fifth year, things went downhill, with the two-parter-saturated sixth and seventh years, where technobabble soared and real storytelling declined. <br />The fifth year can boast two of Star Trek's best episodes: \\"Darmok\\", a truly Star Trek episode, one where you actually think there are real aliens that don't look and talk like your next door neighbor; \\"The Inner Light\\", which, along with DS9's \\"The Visitor\\" are the only two Trek episodes I ever actually teared up at - is truly outstanding.  <br />I thought \\"Unification\\" was okay, but I think Spock probably deserved a less political and more sci-fi storyline, \\"The Game\\" was fun (just love to see chases through the Enterprise), I thought Ro Laren (\\"Ensign Ro\\", \\"The Next Phase\\"), etc.\\" was a great secondary character I wished we'd seen more of; I just liked that there was someone who didn't just fall into the stuffy chain of command. <br />Overall a solid season with outstanding episode after episode. Other goodies include \\"Disaster\\", \\"A Matter of Time\\", \\"Conundrum\\", \\"Power Play\\", \\"Ethics\\", \\"Cause and Effect\\", \\"I, Borg\\" & \\"Time's Arrow\\".

0786915749|5.0|There are a minute number of books out there in any given genre that deserve elevation above the top ranking. In this case 6 stars and beyond. Weis and Hickman's entire first Dragonlance Trilogy deserves such.<BR>In some respects they are on the same plateau as Tolkien having created and defined an entire sub-genre - the D&amp;D sub genre - that has spawned a vast library of games, characters, books, figurines, pictures etc. etc. that is truly awesome.<BR>The plot of this book has been stated many times in the hundreds of reviews so I won't go into an extremely well trodden path. What Weis and Hickman have achieved, and so few authors do, is create a set of characters where every reader can identify and sympathise with at least one of them and feel a sense of true pathos and exhilaration as we follow their story. A blend of war and peace, anger and love, sadness and joy, 'Dragons of Autumn Twilight' has defined a generation of fantasy fans and irrevocably made an indelible impression on a genre that was has so much potential for the imagination.
0780624890|5.0|This Movie was a kick in the ... awesome movie if you like action and vampire movies you'll love Blade.

B00003CXHJ|1.0|What a nasty, trashy little film this is. I must say that America is doing its reputation abroad absolutely no good by producing films like this and 'the patriot'. I am quite astounded by the number of reviewers saying &quot;this is a movie not a documentary...just enjoy this movie as good entertainment&quot;. You people need to get real.Realise the impact that the cinema has on todays society. Sad as it is some people actually get their history classes while eating a big tub of popcorn. But thats the way it is. I feel Holywood producers should be dutybound not to distort history. Why the need? You have a ready made script for you in any decent history book. And some reviewers have made mention of the historical note tied in with the end credits. Oh, this makes it all right doesn't it? Most people have already upped and left by the time this appears in a cinema, blah-blahing on about how great America was during the war, waving the stars and stripes. Read a history book. You weren't even in the war when a British trawler captured the enigma machine. Fortunately I have seen some American reviewers who are thoroughly ashamed of this film (you are a true credit to your nation). But for all you other mel gibson style 'patriots'; get an education! Just to say about the acting and atmosphere in the film; its okay, nothing special. Has absolutely nothing on Das Boot or the H.F.R.Oct. Not that decent acting or direction would have redeemed it in my eyes.
B00002E285|5.0|Pink Floyd The Wall is the visual realization of Roger Waters' masterpiece, but it is even more than that to those who can simpathize with the main character's plight.<br />I, myself, have often felt the effects of near insanity and reclusive behavior. You see, to those of us who have built our wall so strong that no one within distance can penetrate it, Pink Floyd's epic is a familiar place for us. Instead of helping those of us who feel helpless by simply telling us we are not alone or telling us to be ourselves no matter what anyone else thinks, this piece actually SHOWS us that not only are these feelings somewhat commonplace, but they are timeless. Roger Waters felt these emotions through his life in the seventies, I've felt them in the late ninties. This reassurance and ability to connect makes this, hands down, the most important visual piece in my life.<br />For many of you, you will not identify with The Wall, and that's fine. It is still a visual masterpiece and a wonderful story (though it is a bit confusing during the first viewing). In short, I love this film with all my heart.<br />Plus, it's great to watch while intoxicated (whichever medium you choose for inebriation is up to you). :)
B00002Z88D|1.0|This is a good albumn?? It's worth about as much as it cost the record company to make. Boo...
B00005JKQZ|5.0|As we all know, hollywood takes a true story and adds some embellishment to it.  That said, this film is one of the classics.  Russell Crowe again shows why he's making the money he is to do a movie.  Ron Howard's direction is admirable.  A wonderful movie about life, the struggles that some people have to get through and move on.  I would suggest this movie to anybody who enjoys what movies are all about.
0553288105|4.0|This book, like Asimov's Foundation series itself, took form in the author's mind from the germ of a very small and seemingly insignificant seed (see \\"An Introduction At Some Length\\" for details), but he managed to turn it into a (nearly) full-fledged masterpiece. The book starts out somewhat slow (for those who don't like a lot of technical details), as it has Asimov attempting to make the existence of something (Uranium-186) that isn't possible, seem possible. The average lay reader will certainly concede that he has accomplished the task, and may find the initial part a bit slow; the more scientifically-minded reader will admit that he did as good a job as could probably be done. If you find this part trying, trust me - stay with it. It's well worth your time and effort. The book, which deals with parallel universes, is written, appropriately enough, in a parallel structure: three separate, seemingly unconnected sections, which all stand on their own fairly well, come together in the end to form quite a conclusion. The book's sturcutre is quite similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey, in that it features individual sections that seem not to be related to one another, and then beging to cling together towards the end. The way that Asimov weaves the separate plot threads together to create a coherent whole is masterful, and I won't spoil it for you by describing it here. This is one of the book that you will just have to keep reading - and that will surprise you in the end. The good Doctor acccomplishes some clever things in this book (with chapter numberings, of all things), but something that is particularly of note (as has been well-pointed out by other reviewers) is the absolutely incredible second section. This section starts out strangely and is somewhat hard to follow at first (having seemingly nothing to do with the first part of the book), but weaves itself into such a shocking and masterful conclusion that it will absolutely leave you reeling. This section readsvery well on its own, and would've made an excellent short story all by itself. Its impressiveness is heightened, however, by the fact that Asimov fits it into the general scheme of the book. Unfortunately, the more pedestrian middle section of the book is a bit of a letdown after the incredible middle section. It shares some similarities with the first section, and I can't help but finding the resolution to be a bit of a duex ex machina. Sure, it works, but - it just isn't entirely satisfying, for some reason. One wonders if Asimov had written himself into a corner, as it certainly seems that he perhaps took the easy way out - but then again, it may have just been that I was looking for a shocking conclusion (say, the destruction of the universe), as the book jacket seems to promise. In any case, I'm no one to argue with the Master. A truly captivating and original work that is a notch below perfection for the reasons just mentioned - hence the not-quite-5-stars rating. Essential Asimov, essential science fiction - the two seem to go hand-in-hand.
B000001Y42|1.0|I can still remember it like it was yesterday.  Here I am, a freshman in high school, then next thing I know Korn is all over the place, and Limp Bizkit wasn't very far behind (not to mention Orgy and a few others) to be the new MTV hardcore metal.  Give me a break.  This 1997 debut hardly sold a copy until late 1998 into 1999 thanks to Limp riding Korn's Family Values Tour, and there is a reason that this sold poorly when first released.  While yes, Limp Bizkit does have quite a bit of rhythm and beat on this album, and yes Fred Durst can rap (anyone care though?), it was all heard before and has been heard years ago before (and don't even say Rage Against the Machine or Korn either).  Anyone remember Faith No More?  Or Biohazard?  Or Anthrax joining up with Public Enemy for \\"Bring the Noise\\"?  And lets not forget bands that pioneered in the heavy music scene that deserved half the profits from this album like Corrosion of Conformity, Morbid Angel, and Crowbar.  All in all, just like the rest of they're album catalog, \\"Three Dollar Bill, Y'All\\" is pure uninspired, unadulturated, wanna-be heavy and mainstream music that any MTV freak will no doubt enjoy.
B00000HYXB|5.0|In one word, you can describe Nighfall in Middle-Earth.  Fantastic.  The emotion that the vocalists put into their songs amaze me, and i have yet to find anything that compares to the splendor of Blind Guardian.  People either love or hate it.  People who hate it probably don't have much taste in the heavy metal or relating genres, or they don't like the theme.  Keep up the good work BG!
B00004WLXZ|5.0|Adolf Hitler is making a comeback.  When CBS announced the mini-series (originally adapted from Ian Kershaw's \\"Hubris\\") that takes a look at Hitler before he entered politics created a furor over the idea of giving this man's life any more attention than it already receives or deserves.  The very notion of a network profiting from anything relating to Hitler or his Nazi-based philosophy is a flash-point of controversy.<br /><br />On a personal note, in the 70's I researched and developed a detailed story called \\"Young Hitler's Secret Life.\\"  It was optioned by Bob Banner & Associates and taken to NBC where it was tested by several focus groups.  The concept of a multi-part TV movie that asked \\"What made the man the monster?\\" tested higher than anything that had previously been broadcast.  Nervous potential sponsors did their own testing and concluded that no matter how the material was presented, up to 20 per-cent of the audience would sympathize with the central character.  The network and sponsors' fear was that any attempt to dramatize Adolf Hitler implied understanding him, and for some in the potential audience, that apparently meant excusing or erasing the evil. Or worse, embracing Hitler and his ideas.<br /><br />My approach to the material focused on the unusual pseudo spiritual, occult themes he studied in his youth and how this peculiar German mysticism influenced his politics and eventually tapped into the collective central nervous system of his followers who, in the end, literally worshipped him as a messiah.  NBC eventually dropped the project.  It will be interesting to see how CBS handles this material and the public response.  Networks, like Hitler, are always looking for the target audience's widest base desire, emotion, or pathology on which to hang their hidden agenda -- advertising.<br /><br />Hitler was a nobody.  A failed artist and a dreamer.  From out of nowhere he rose like the  Germanic god of war Wotan and turned a defeated, demoralized third-world country into a blazing world power.  To hide from the reality of the human -- and other forces -- that engulfed the world 60 years ago makes us even more vulnerable to the contemporary spiritual and political winds that are blowing on the hot kindling of chaos that threaten to ignite us.<br /><br />Last month (of this writing) German director Leni Reifenstahl celebrated her 100th birthday.  Although she continues to deny any special relationship with Hitler, the genius of this filmmaker helped propel Hitler into the iconic force of dark power that he so carefully crafted and craved.  Except for the Pope's official visits to foreign countries, no propaganda event comes close to the extraordinary, overwhelming visceral potency of Reifenstahl's  TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.<br /><br />Hitler hired Reifenstahl to make a filmed record of the Reich's 1934 rally in Nuremburg.  Hitler was a film buff (he loved Disney cartoons and was often heard whistling \\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf\\").  He was an ardent fan of Wagner's epic opera's and at one time even made notes for an original opera and its staging.  He innately understood the necessary theatrics of staging public political rallies.  The symbols, the banners, the waiting, the music, the marching, the uniforms, the torches and the message.  It all had to come together with an explosive orgasm of shared emotion.<br /><br />Triumph of the Will is an important film.  Certainly more significant and meaningful than Citizen Kane.  Masterfully designed, shot and edited, TOTW is a witness to the power of beholding that generates change.  To see this film -- no, it won't make you a nazi -- in its entirety is to understand how Hitler cast his spell. Forget the crowds overcome by weeping, hyperventilating hysteria at the feet of Elvis, or the reception of the Beatles at their first U.S. concerts.  What can compare to Hitler parting a sea made up of hundreds of thousands of standing-at-attention and transfixed believers as hemarches to the podium.  Or to see the massive, flaming swastikas made up of hundreds of hand-held torches slowly turning in the darkness like the grinding gears of the gates of hell.  Images staged and yet real.<br /><br />This Special Edition is a new windowboxed digital transfer that exposes all of the film frame. Light black bars appear on all four sides of the image.<br /><br />The interesting audio commentary is by historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro.  Also included is Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 short film, \\"Day of Freedom\\" (\\"Tag der Freiheit\\"). The newly translated -- and removable -- English subtitles are disturbing and compelling.the massive, flaming swastikas made up of hundreds of hand-held torches slowly turning in the darkness like the grinding gears of the gates of hell.

1558908498|3.0|Ok I still believe that the original Scream is the best.  I feel that this sequel could have done better, but I just think that it got too slow for a while, and the bad thing about it being a sequel is that it's pretty easy to guess the killer.  I don't hate this one but it's good to watch sometimes, especially if you have nothing to do with your time and want to sit on the couch.
0380820846|3.0|I am a great fan of Ms. Quinn, and I loved all of Bridgerton series so far.  That is why I couldn't wait to read this book.  But, what a disappointment!!  There was no strong development in detail how and why Colin fall in love with Penelope.  Colin's character (which seemed to be witty, care free in previous series), was not described and developed well (all it mentioned was how he was hungry for food all the time, also literally written he was 'witty' and had a great smile).  Only pleasurable plot of the story was when Colin announced Penelope's secret to everyone.  Oh, well..  I guess I'll have to wait for Elois's story.
6304711875|5.0|Ok to me this is the best out of the trilogy.  Go into the movie with an open mind.  The whole teen thing really doesn't matter.  Plain out serial killer style horror film.  Anyhow the great thing is that you don't know who the killer is, so it's suspenseful and the movie makes everyone a suspect pretty much.  For me this is my favorite slasher film.  Wes Craven makes it enjoyable good writing and music at the right times.  Atleast it's believable, not like Halloween 2(Which still was good) where the killer is more than human.
0790729377|5.0|In \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski gives what is clearly the best acting performance not to win an Academy Award (he lost to Humphrey Bogart in \\"The African Queen\\").  Vivien Leigh as Blanche DuBois, Kim Hunter as Stella Kowalski, and Karl Malden as Mitch all won in their respective acting categories.  Years later, with \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" this same thing happened, with both of the ladies winning that time around.<br />Tennessee Williams' play is one of the major works in American drama, especially after the Second World War, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1947 (with Jessica Tandy as Blanche the only cast change from the film; although I should point out Leigh opened the play in England on stage).  Although Brando's performance is riveting, representing the new \\"modern\\" method of acting at its best, the play is really about the mental and moral disintegration of Blanche, a neurotic former Southern belle whose genteel illusions are no match for the brutish realities of her brother-in-law, Stanley.  The fact that Hollywood changed the ending to reflect conventional morality remains one of the great sins in movie history, but I have always thought the fact Brando's legendary stage performance was essentially preserved on film offsets that in the final judgment.  Leigh's performance is often seen as an extension of the Scarlett O'Hara role that made her famous, but of course now we know her personal life was as tortured as the character she was playing.<br />I heard an argument once that \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" was, at least on some level, a reponsible by Tennessee Williams to Eugene O'Neill's play \\"The Iceman Cometh\\" (then again, I have heard the same argument made, more forcefully to be sure, regarding Edward Albee's \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\").  O'Neill's classic play deals with the human need for illusion and hope as necessary weapons against despair.  If you are teaching American drama in the 20th century, then using these plays in any combination you might like could be quite provocative for your students.<br />Personal aside: I was in New Orleans once and actually saw the bus named \\"Desire,\\" which had replaced the city streetcars.  There was certainly an odd little moment.<br />Most significant line:  It does not seem right to talk about romantic lines with any of these characters, but there is a line that is one of the greatest character epitaphs ever.  Of course, this is at the end where Blanches says to the doctor, \\"Whoever you are, I have always depended upon the kindness of strangers.\\"  I have usually found that at some point in a play there is a line that defines the character so well it could serve as their epitaph.  This line is as clear an example of what I am talking about as you could ever hope to find.<br />If you like \\"A Streetcar Named Desire,\\" then check out these other films on the AFI's list of 100 Greatest Love Stories: #48 \\"Last Tango in Paris\\" and #89 \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\"  Why?  The former give you Brando in another sick love relationship and the latter is the other great American drama on this list.entury, then using these plays in any combination you might like could be quite provocative for your students.  <br />Personal aside: I was in New Orleans once and actually saw the bus named \\"Desire,\\" which had replaced the city streetcars.

6305903182|4.0|Ok the original Scream is better, but this one is still pretty good.  To me it's better than Scream 2 but still some things were really unnecessary.  I think that they could have made the sequel a bang by having Randy be the killer somehow, and have him live, but it's not so...  Anyhow the only problem that I have with this one is that it gets slow sometimes and I think if they had one more killing scene between the grand finale and the 3rd person killed than I could've gotten through.  Also I just don't like how they don't make everyone a suspect like in Scream 1, but has more suspects than 2.  It's a nice film, it's worth viewing if you're a fan of the series.
0743506650|5.0|Except for the chapter about finding a publisher, the advice in this book can be applied to both an avid reader who will never attempt to publish and the new writer.  My favorite piece of advice in this book is to read really good books and really bad books and read a lot of both. There are so many other pieces of advice for those who love to read and for those who want to write. I own both the unabridged CD and book (both are excellent).  Learn about Stephen King--learn about writing.

If you only read one book this year, make it this one. You won't regret it.
B000063S6Z|1.0|I bought this CD based on the buzz about Moby -- shame on me.

B000002KET|5.0|\\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,\\" \\"Sabotage,\\" and their self-titled debut LP are, IMHO, the finest Black Sabbath albums ever (at least from the OZZY years...\\"Heaven and Hell\\" with frontman Dio kicks, too).  <br />With such scorchers as \\"National Acrobat,\\" \\"Sabbra Cadabra,\\" \\"Killing Yourself To Live,\\" and the incendiary album-titled track, \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,\\" this album is the stuff of legends.  Why \\"Amazon\\" doesn't deem SBS as an<BR>\\"essential recording\\" is beyond my comprehension.
B00006EXCC|5.0|First let me say that I do not have an SACD player but the remastering is still an improvement over the original disks. The sound is not nearly as muddy. The Rolling Stones Aftermath album ushered in the halcyon days of the band.  Gone were the blues and soul covers replaced by all Jagger/Richards originals. The US version of the album contained &quot;Paint It Black&quot; replaced on the UK issue by another hit &quot;Mother's Little Helper&quot; but it omitted three other tracks &quot;Out Of Time&quot;, &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot; and &quot;What To Do&quot; which appeared on the UK version.  It is interesting to hear the song selections as they were originally intended.  The set contained &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; (one of my favorite underrated Stones songs) and &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; which led to Stones being attacked in the press for taking an anti-women stance.  The set also contains the rocking &quot;Flight 505&quot; and &quot;It's Not Easy&quot;.  These are balanced by the haunting &quot;I Am Waiting&quot;. The set is also known for containing the longish &quot;Going Home&quot; (perhaps too long).  In addition it contains another hit &quot;Lady Jane&quot; although not one of my favorites.  The three added songs are all good especially &quot;Out Of Time&quot; with its sing along hook. This is the album that gave the Stones their reputatations as rock and roll's bad boys and began their reign as the &quot;greatest rock and roll band in the world&quot;.  <br />I have few quibbles first the remasters conatain no bonus tracks and no expanded pictures or liner notes.  They could have at least added &quot;Paint It Black&quot; as a bonus track to the UK edition.<BR>However, having the album in remastered in its original UK format more than makes up for these drawbacks. The improved sound alone is worth the investment.
B000000QFV|5.0|Instead, the vocalist here is Tony Martin, and he's arguably the finest singer Black Sabbath has ever had.  Enough of these ignorant automatons stating &quot;this isn't the real Sabbath.&quot;  This is Sabbath alright...Iommi's still on the axe, and he's in top form here.  His solos rip, and the late-Cozy Powell's drumming is exceptional.  Neil Murray's bass lines aren't too shabby, either.  All in all, a damn fine album featuring a Black Sabbath with an evolved sound.  And for the price, you can't go wrong.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Blade was a cult classic berthed from a comic book of the same name. To those who know the back story, I apologize, but some are unfamiliar with the franchise. Blade, real name Eric, was in the womb of his mother when she was bitten by a vampire, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). When she died he was taken from his mother's body with a semi-metamorphism into what she was to become, a vampire. Blade inherited all of their strengths included increased strength and regeneration and brushed off all of their weaknesses (silver, sunlight, and garlic). He is the most powerful weapon against vampires, but something else is on the streets, something worth than him to the vampire nation and they need Blade to lead their elite task force to eliminate this new threat before it destroys the world.<br />This is where the Reapers come into play. The Reapers are a new strain of vampire that feed on both vamps and humans, but are more like locust and need to feed every couple of hours to survive, when they do they spread their \\"disease\\" and more Reapers are born and with every one their numbers can increase ten-fold.<br />The surprising thing about Blade was that it is inherently better than the original because of an obviously bigger budget and better backing by New Line. The movie is beautifully directed and produced so that anyone who is new to the series, and those fans of the comic book will be equally impressed. While the movie features far too much CGI work than one would like the non-stop action keeps things interesting and flowing over its two hour running time. Some of the plot points are very predictable, others aren't so much, but it is enough to keep you entertained.<br />New Line's Platinum Series of DVDs have set the bar time and time again in both the video and sound categories. ...Grain has been kept to a minimum and the initial master print looks to be very clean allowing for a good digital transfer. The dark tone of the movies colors come out just as they should, blacks are deep and clean.<br />Sound is awesome and puts your surround system to good use. New Line was so nice as to include the standard Dolby Digital 5.1 EX track as well as a DTS 6.1 ES track that really opens up the rear channels. Positional audio is just as you would expect with the front speakers taking care of most of the work, and the center channel handling the audio. The LFE channel is widely used especially during gun battles and explosions. Both the DD and DTS tracks are very rich and clear without the slightest bit of \\"tin-can\\" sounding dialog and distorted sound effects.<br />The Special Features are excellent on this disc. You get a second disc featuring an interactive documentary about the movie, a director's notebook, art gallery, theatrical trailers, and a survival guide for the Blade 2 video game. You are also treated to two commentary tracks from the director, producer, writer, and star so you get a good overview of the different aspects of the production. A bonus on the first disc is the 5.1 Surround Sound isolated score, which is a hard find on DVDs today. A very solid entry into the Platinum Collection.<br />This two-disc set is a must own for any fan of the comic book series or of just the first movie. The story is very well thought out and manages to fit into the mythology of the franchise perfectly. While there is a bit too much CGI work in the film itself you would be hard pressed to find a more solid disc. With this release it becomes more evident every day that New Line cares about home entertainment and the Platinum Series is the thing to beat in the DVD realm.<br />
0440217563|3.0|The adventure continues to entertain. Davina Porter is an exquisite narrator, and makes the story come very much alive. I like the movement to the West Indies, though I agree that it could not have worked without several contrived coincidences. While I completely enjoyed this one, some things bothered me. I think Gabaldon is a bit careless here. Regardless how sad her relationship with Frank was, Claire never seems to completely convey this to Jamie. As I recall, there is not even so much as a \\"I talked at length about my life with Frank.\\" More incredible, Jamie does not seem interested to hear it; he hints that he would like to learn about those years, but goes no further. <br />The pictures of Brianna...now, come on. Surely someone not familiar with 20th century photo technology, other than Jamie, would have come across them, and demanded an explanation. This was difficult to believe. I waited for that moment the entire 30 cassettes, until...well, readers know when I gave that up.<br />Another careless moment has Clair reminiscing about Brianna's young childhood and recalling sitting with her and reading, \\"One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.\\" Whoops. Brianna was born when I was and Dr. Seuss was not available to me. This particular book was not published until 1960. Brianna would have been a pre-teen, at least, by then. And, while surely her attentive mother would have been reading and bonding with her at this age, such a \\"clever\\" girl as Brianna would not, have sat still for \\"one fish, two fish...\\"<br />The maggot thing is another point of concern. Davina Porter's \\"uuuuuu!!!!!\\" conveyed a marked level of olfactory disturbance connected to the maggot infested substance. The description had maggots covering the object, accompanied by significant stench. It is my understanding as a biologist, and experience as a resident in a farming community, that once a substance is covered with maggots, the amount of rotting matter is greatly decreased, and with it most offending odor. <br />I also recall two conflicting references to the date of Jillian's travel through the stones. I believe both are in chapter 60 - 1967, then 1968. I had thought it was 1968. Can anyone explain this contradiction?<br />Aside from my nitpicking, this is a fine installment. I just wish Gabaldon had been more careful. However, nothing is quite so serious as her not allowing Clair to set the record straight with Jack Randall in Dragonfly. He did not connect with Jamie's soul; only his biology. What a beautiful, profound statement Clair could have made - a statement that could have benefited many of her readers.<br />Oh, and I do agree that too many reviewers give away far too many of the details of plot and story. Such reviews should be omitted.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The folks at Pixar have really outdone themselves with this joy-filled DVD package, which I was lucky to receive about a month before the official release. <BR>If you have not yet seen the movie, have no fear, buy the DVD, do not rent.

Wildly imaginative, totally hilarious and yet filled with deeper meanings and fine acting, Monster's Inc. is first-rate family entertainment that rewards multiple viewings.<BR>And like other Pixar pictures, Randy Newman's unique musical talent is a wonderful antidote to the schlock you will find in other companies' animated pictures.<BR>As for the 2-disc DVD set, the bonus disc alone is worth the price of admission. Most DVD \\"deluxe\\" packages that I have seen to date have a haphazard collection of lame \\"making of\\" features, a few deleted scenes and previews. Not with Monsters Inc. This well-thought out disc is packed with fun games, entertaining documentaries on the movie and on the crazy people at Pixar, and the bonus \\"Mike's New Car\\" short among the hours of features on this disc. Instead of 90 minutes of movie, you are really getting four or five hours of real entertainment.<br />The director's commentary track is also a well-thought out addition to the disc, not just an annoying throwaway that you will find on other discs. My wife and I really enjoyed the story behind the story, and the fun that the Pixar folks had in making this movie is infectious. <br />I can't recommend this enough.<br />Enjoy!
B00003CXN4|5.0|I'm embarassed to admit that the first time I saw Traffic I wasn't all that impressed. However, the film stuck with me and when it came out on dvd I bought it, watched it again and was hooked. This is a great film. The way the stories are woven together are superb. However, I do think the weakest part of this film was Michael Douglas's daughter doing drugs. Oh well. Make no mistake, this movie is an epic, and the cinematography terriffic. I love the way Mexico was shot. And the acting includes one of the best ensemble casts in recent years. Don Cheadle, and Benicio Del Toro are at the top of their game, as is Catherine Zata-Jones. Look for Benjamin Bratt in a cameo role.

0812550706|3.0|It's probably impossible for me to know what I'd have thought of this book when it first came out, since I knew the \\"punchline\\" to the story going in.  On the other hand, a truly great novel would have a lot going for it beyond the climactic revelation, and Ender's Game, well, doesn't.<br />The crippling flaw to the story is that the characters (other than Ender himself) are absolutely flat as boards.  None of them have any nuance or subtlety or distinction to them.  Moreover, large chunks of the book (especially those relating to Ender's siblings and their machinations while he's away at school) are entirely redundant to the story as a whole.  They could have been cut out completely and made the novel leaner and more focused.<br />So what's good about the story?  Essentially, it's a series of high-pressure puzzles presented to Ender as he flies through the ranks of the military (at ages 6-to-11!), and seeing how Ender reasons out how to deal with them (whether they're regularly scheduled combat exercises, or encounters with his antagonistic fellow students) is exciting and fun.  The moral dilemmas which Ender must confront - being violent when he doesn't want to be, being a leader when he's not inclined to be - are real, though they suffer greatly from lack of depth or characterization in the world around him.<br />Ender himself is the only character we really get to know.  I never believed that he was a child - he almost never behaves like one - but that's not so bad, since it's his odyssey - not he himself - which is the focus of the book.  But the potential of his character is largely unrealized, since he's generally forced into making particular choices, and we don't get to measure what sort of a person he is through his deeds, since those choices are taken away from him.<br />In many ways, Ender's Game reads like it was written in the 1950s, an era of flat characters and straightforward plots, which is what this novel contains.  It feels primitive next to its contemporaries from the mid-80s (never mind nuanced fiction from the 70s like that from Varley or Zelazny), especially in its no-frills writing style.  At this point, I don't see what all the fuss was about; it's a light read, but not a very satisfying one.contemporaries from the mid-80s (never mind nuanced fiction from the 70s like that from Varley or Zelazny), especially in its no-frills writing style.

B000000WA4|5.0|This is one album that everyone in the world MUST own.  It's the most commercially successful CDs of, arguably, the best rock band of the 90's.  In a time when too many CD's fall short of 45mins., the two discs provide over 120 minutes of stellar music.  Every track in golden and damn near perfection.  To miss out on this is a crime agianst nature and music.  Billy Corgan is a genius, James Iha is brilliant, Jimmy Chamberlin is bombastic, and D'arcy has an apostraphy in her name.  What more could you want?
B000069AUI|5.0|Rush may very well stand up as one of the finest albums to come out in this decade- I know it's only 2002 but after a few listens you will realize there is something very special going on, ala The Joshua Tree or The Bends. At the end of the decade my bet is that Rush tops most lists. <br />If you appreciate a band that takes it's music very seriously (Turned down $85Mil from The Gap to commercialize their music, Bravo!) and does exactly what great music is supposed to do- get every emotion in your body going- then buy this CD immediately.<br />In these &quot;lowest&quot; days of souless music where everything is over-marketed, over-promoted, and pushed to the masses by MTV it is great to have some new music that matters. <br />Take a listen Boy Bands, Brintney Spears, Creed, and all Hip-Hop players- this is a band that cares about what it is doing and understands it's importnace. You'll be listening to them long-after you've burned out and are sitting around on your millions wondering why no one wants to hear from you anymore.

B00006G8HX|4.0|STIII:TSFS is a fine addition to the ST universe. After the chaos of STII (don't get me wrong, I love that movie) it was appropriate to Star Trek to have number III slow down a little bit. The scope of the movie is about the same as Wraith of Khan but it really turns inward and deep to expand on the final moments of Kirk and Spock in the death seen of STII. I like the emotion and depth of this movie. <br />I cannot write a review of this movie without commenting on the music. Jerry Goldsmith out-did himself with the first movie and James Horner had a difficult task to add-to and change the music enough to be unique but fit well with the series. Personally I love the themes of STII but I really didn't think they were fleshed out as well as they could have been. Mr. Horner got it right in STIII. STI and STIII really standout to me as great movie music. I think it really helped Mr. Horner to have another movie to expand on what he had done previously. It seems the music matured with story. The motif of the Mind Meld between Sarak and Kirk is mesmorizing. The percussion used for the Klingon themes is so powerful. The movie is truly enhanced with this music.

During that day, Michael Myers(Nick Castle), a man who had killed his sister as a six-year old during Halloween of 1963, had escaped an institution and headed to Haddonfield to commit his crime again.

B00005YW4H|4.0|The first time I listened to this album, I became bored after the first few tracks.  I was disappointed that so many of the tracks sound so similar, with very little variety in voice and tempo.  But, I was persistent in listening to the album a few times, and soon I was able to distinguish and appreciate each song for what it is.  This album definitely grew on me, and now it's one of my favorites.  Norah's sweet sultry voice is a real treat, and if you give it a chance, you'll learn to love the music.

B000060MMI|5.0|A:  Put out a great record that surpasses your previous effort.  <BR>Flogging Molly has certainly done it with this album.  While \\"Swagger\\" was full of some great, rollicking cuts, \\"Drunken Lullabies\\" showcases the band's abilities as they stretch their sound into new musical territory.  Longtime fans will be happy to know that \\"Swagger\\" and \\"If I Ever Leave This World Alive\\" have finally made it onto this album.  Dave King's songwriting has come further since their debut, and positively shines in the beautiful \\"Death Valley Queen.\\"  Other songs of note include \\"Another Bag of Bricks,\\" reminiscent of the Pogues' \\"Turkish Song of the Damned\\" and the fastest cover of \\"The Rare Ould Times\\" you'll hear anywhere.
B000065U1N|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be American hype and not really show the gritty side of war or police actions but it did a really good job. Some of the scenes were hype though, like nobody running when a helo comes calling near the end. (If you don't know what I mean by \\"helo comes calling\\" than you were never in combat.) I have read reviews here that stated that Clinton (President Clinton) should have stayed and finished the job, but the job was done and warlords tend to die by their own people. While BLACK HAWK DOWN won't make any young man enlist it will instill pride in comraderie. Now if only Hollywood would make a real life movie about the Panama invasion then the little wars of the last decade of the 20th century would be immortalized
0060506989|5.0|I was interested in this book because of the movie previews (I read the book first, then decided to watch the movie because of the book), but what made me buy the book was a quote from now-retired General Norman Schwarzkopf:  \\"Anyone who wants to know what the Vietnam war (or any war) was really like should read this book.\\"<br />I respect his opinion even more since I read the book.  I was in the Army (also, one of my brothers was in the Vietnam war, and another was in the Persian Gulf war), so I may be a little biased and I can see how this book could be a little boring or dry to some people.  But, if you can get past that and really read the entire book to understand what is being described, it tells an incredible story.<br />Much of what was written in this book, I've never heard before (possibly because I was born in 1970 and really grew up after the war) and it changed my perspective of the war.  Don't get me wrong, my wife is Vietnamese and I've been to Vietnam twice in the past 3 years, so I've instinctively done a lot of research on the war and Vietnamese people.  But, since everything I know about it is not from personal experience, I've always depended on what others have written, and there were many things I read in this book that I've never read before.<br />The bottom line is that if you are Vietnamese or know any Vietnamese people, you were in the Vietnam war or anyone close to you was in it, or you were in the regular U.S. military or you're close to someone who is, this book will move you as it did me.  Even if none of the above conditions applies to you, if you read this book you will have a good understanding of what the Vietnam war, people, and wars in general are truly like.
B000066NW0|5.0|Today, September 10, 2002, means that it has been a week since I first heard the Avril Lavigne song Sk8er Boi! That is one of the greatest songs ever!!!!! This CD is great to get just for that one song! But anyway.......I liked the song Complicated, but I wasn't going to buy the CD. I was just going to wait until it came out on a CD of Various Artists, and get it then. Then, ONE WEEK AGO, I heard the song Sk8er Boi on the radio and found out it was also by Avril Lavigne! I'm listining to that song right now! Anyway, once I knew both those songs were by her, I really wanted this CD and got it quickly after. This entire CD rocks! The songs are so awesome! And I don't know how I could have lived without the song Sk8er Boi! That song will NEVER get old! Anyway, this CD rocks! I totally, completely, highly reccomend it to anyone!
0385503954|5.0|The main characters in this story are: Jack and Emily Tallis, parents of Leon, Cecilia and Briony Tallis; Aunt (Emily's sister) Hermionne's children Lola, and twins Jackson and Pierrot; Robbie Turner, the cleaning lady's son whose education is subsidized by Jack Tallis; Marshall, the chocolate magnate friend Leon brings home for the break.  <br />In the summer of 1935, 13-year-old Briony Tallis witnesses and misinterprets a scene that occurs before her between Cecilia and Robbie.  From a second story window of the house, she sees Robbie standing in silence while Cecilia undresses and goes into a fountain.  Later on, she opens a letter meant for Cecilia (with vulgar language used) and witnesses Robbie forcing Cecilia into a corner of the library.  From these events, she judges Robbie to be a dangerous \\"maniac\\".  During a search party for Jackson and Pierrot one night, Briony sees the form of person running away from an assaulted Lola.  Naturally, she immediately suspects Robbie to be the culprit.  Her testimony to the police and her family grew more certain with each telling, and pretty soon it was accepted fact that Robbie had committed the crime and should go to jail.  He does.  This was also around the time WWII was beginning, and the second portion of the book walks us through a few days in the life of Robbie as he tries to return home to England after being conscribed to fight in France.  The third portion of the book takes us five years from that summer where Briony has had time to mature and realize that Robbie was, contrary to what she thought, passionately in love with Cecilia and that Lola's attacker was also someone else she knew.  She knows she has done Robbie grave injustice and seeks to make amends with him and Cecilia (who has patiently awaited his return from war).  The fourth and final part of the book occurs more than fifty years later (1999) and reveals to us the truth behind Briony's search for Atonement.<br />One can easily anticipate the twistsand turns the author has laid out in the beginning of the book (Robbie grabbing the wrong letter, what Lola's scratch marks meant, Jack Tallis' constant absence from home).  The final section of the book, however, contains a shocker in its last 2 pages.  It was not the ending I was expecting.  But it does leave the reader thinking Briony will write another even happier draft for her \\"atonement.\\"  With each version of the story as part of the penance for her sin.<br />The prose is wonderfully crafted with vivid descriptions of everything from the Tallis home to the British retreat at Dunkirk during the war.  McEwan struts his literary prowess with his metaphors such as Emily's migraine as an all-consuming beast.  Truly enjoyable.<br />On a more personal note, I found it refreshing how McEwan was able to describe how simple love was back then.  How the foundation of an entire relationship could rest on an event as trivial as a bus stop kiss.  Yet be powerful enough to last and sustain one person through the darkest and grimmest days of war.  And how fierce loyalty to someone you love could drive dividing lines between a family.  This is the type of writing that's severely deficient in current bestsellers.<br />Memorable lines:<BR>* \\"I'll wait for you.  Come back.\\"<BR>* \\"My reason for life.  Not living, but life.\\"<BR>* \\"They had... while others sipped their cocktails on the terrace.\\"<BR>* \\"It is quite impossible these days to assume anything about people's educational level from the way they talk or dress or from their taste of music.  Safest to treat everyone you meet as a distinguished individual.\\"<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>============================<BR>L (Language) - 4 (amazing descriptions that put you at the spot, and an ending you wouldn't expect)<BR>E (Erotica) - 3 (without being explicit, McEwan can evoke highly convincing erotica)<BR>A (Action) - 2.5 (mostly during the retreat to Dunkirk in the second part)<BR>P (Plot) - 2 (the plot of the main story is very simple, Briony misunderstands an incident in the past which keeps two lovers apart)
B00004TVG7|5.0|I loved this cd.  It has a professional feel to the music.  It evokes images from the period that are distinct, useful, and complimentary to examination of the time.  There seems to have been a real effort at authentication of the sounds of the era without over stepping the claims of its ultimate veracity.  I was delighted and surprised at its very existence.<br />My only complaint would be that I was left wanting more.  Knowledge of the exact origins and history of each piece would be useful.
0792839749|5.0|\\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" came out in 1968, and I can remember seeing it on t.v. when I was growing up in the 70's.  It was on par with \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" as it was shown once or twice a year on television, and they are both perfect films for the entire family to watch together. You can't say that about many movies that come out these days.<br />Dick Van Dyke plays Caracatus Potts, a oddball inventor, who lives in England with his two blond children, Jemima and Jeremy.<br />He is raising them on his own, and when the children almost get run over by \\"Truly Scrumptious\\", played by Sally Ann Howes, he meets the woman who just may help him out in bringing the children up.  The four of them embark on great adventure and song!  There are a few creepy moments. I especially was always freaked out by the childnapper. Other than that, it is a pure joy to view this over and over.<br />There are a lot of songs in this movie such as the title song, \\"Truly Scrumptious\\", \\"Toot Sweets\\", \\"POSH\\", and \\"Hushabye Mountain\\".  I really like all the music here as it all has it's place in this truly remarkable piece of family entertainment.<br />You can even watch it in \\"sing a long\\" mode and sing along with the cast. I can only hope in a few years, in the days of \\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"Spy Kids\\", that he will still appreciate this classic endearing piece of cinema.<br />There aren't any extras aside from the theatrical trailer, but I love this movie so much that didn't bother me.  One should purchase for the great movie that it is.<br />I am highly recommending you pick this movie up for your family's dvd collection!!
B00005JL3A|4.0|Being a hard core Resident evil fan, I was dissappointed hearing about how the story was going to end up, but it was still a good movie. People who are not familiar with the game should love this movie even more, game fans like me though some will, and some wont. And there are only 3 monsters in the film, and the hunters are not. There are Zombies, Cereberus(the zombie dogs) and a licker (was in the 2nd RE game) which is supposed to be the major killing machine filling in for the tyrant, which is pretty lame really if your a fan of the RE game as well as the novel. I thought the special effects done on the licker where a little too computer fetched too, and it didnt even kill the victims right. According to the game the lickers had a certain way they killed their victims, which was by twisting the victims heads off with its tongue. Coulve been better gore effects as well, if anyone thinks this is the best zombie movie ever made, then you have only seen the original night of the living dead, or no other zombie movie. <br />The acting is good, as well as the excitement. I really cant believe Anderson didnt just read the novel, because it went by the game so well, and was made up as a story. But if he did do it that way, the film wouldve had to at least be 3 hrs. long, but it wouldve been worth it. The actors were perfect though if they still had the same characters: Milla Jovovich couldve played jill. Michelle Rodriegiez couldve played Rebecca Chambers. Eric Mabius(guy who played in the great independent film black circle boys and the crow:salvation) couldve played chris redfield, and they couldve just found other people to play Barry and Wesker. <br />They shouldve gone exaclty by the original story. Some fans of the re game say they wouldnt want to see the same thing over again, but that is something that would be great to see. The game Resident evil had a great story, while the movie was though original. If anyone reads the Resident Evil novel, I think they will bevery angry when viewing the movie of how it turned out. But I gave it 4 stars for the entertainment, the acting, and the monsters effects. However the story couldve gone by the original and the soundtrack couldve been better. Static X and slipknot do not fit this kind of film, it isnt even real music, if you disagree then learn how to play a guitar properly. Anyway the movie is worth viewing. It was good, but could've been amazing. Hey its a really good movie, and I plan on buying it, but I say this,\\"Everyone play the first Resident Evil video game from beginning to end, then read the novel. If your not a fan of video games, then just read the book, and to people who dont like to read either, read it anyway, youll love it\\".
B000063DFN|5.0|ok, i've heard every iron maiden album there is. this is the one, the best of them all. almost every song on here is good.. although i feel Losfer Words wasn't catchy enough. But the rest are fantastic! THe album showcases signature duelling guitars on such tracks as Aces High, Flash of the Blade, The Duellists, Powerslave, and Rime of the Ancient Mariner, the last one being (in my opinion) Iron Maiden's richest both musically, and lyrically. THe arrangement is fantastic.this is THE album to get.. ROCK ON!
0060392886|4.0|Not earthshattering, however, their candor kept me flipping pages.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney's third album \\"Britney\\" is a good (not excellent) album. When I listened to the first single, \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", I thought that Britney had matured a lot, but when I listened to the whole album, I noticed that almost all the songs have the same rhythm as her past hits \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\". The songs \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Lonely\\", \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Bombastic Love\\", and \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" have the same rhythm. The lyrics of the songs are nothing special, even though some of them were written by Britney. Britney is just trying to let everyone know that she's grown up now, but I think she hasn't done a great job. I think she's more worried of her looks than of what the lyrics in her songs talk about. Below is a quick review on the songs in this album.<br />1. \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" - Excellent. This is a cool and danceable song. It's one of the best songs in this album. It has an R&B rhythm with Britney's sexy vocals.<br />2. \\"Overprotected\\" - Good. The lyrics in this song are just talking about someone that is overprotected even though she's grown up already. By the way it sounds you can see that Britney has continued to use her same old rhythms.<br />3. \\"Lonely\\" - Excellent. It is one of my favorites. It has a great rhythm. I was expecting this song to be one of her singles, but it was not.<br />4. \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" - Not that good. In this ballad, Britney is just saying that she's not a girl anymore. That is nothing special. I'm tired of hearing this song. It shouldn't have been one of the singles. The vocals are boring. Sorry Brit!<br />5. \\"Boys\\" - Excellent. This is a great R&B song. Even though the lyrics aren't that good, the way it sounds is very cool. I was expecting this song to be one of the singles and it actually was. It's remix version sounds very cool too.<br />6. \\"Anticipating\\" - Good. This is a type of dance club song. The lyrics are nothing special either, but it doesn't sound bad. I do not think it's apoor song.<br />7. \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\" - Excellent. This cover of the original \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\" song sounds incredibly cool with Britney's voice. It sounds cool even though it has a touch of that typical sound you hear in almost all of Britney's songs.<br />8. \\"Cinderella\\" - Good. This song does not sound bad. It talks about a girl who broke up with her boyfriend for treating her like Cinderella. Pretty cool.<br />9. \\"Let Me Be\\" - Good. This is another good song. It also sounds cool. It's just saying what the title says, \\"Let Me Be\\". Not that Bad.<br />10. \\"Bombastic Love\\" - Excellent. Even though this song just talks about a girl that is in love, it sounds incredibly cool. When I heard the beginning of this song I thought I have heard it before because it begins with the little sound in the beginning of the \\"Overprotected\\" video.<br />11. \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" - Good. Another dance club song. It's just saying how she feels when she's with her lover.<br />12. \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" - Excellent. Britney interprets this song with Justin Timberlake. It sounds extremely cool. This could be a big hit just for the way it sounds. Their voices sound very good too.
B00004RF9B|4.0|Many 50's SF movies are based on pulp ideas brought to the screen with hokey effects and plot lines only a freshman comp teacher could possibly accept. Many of them wouldn't even rate as Saturday morning cartoons. Forbidden Planet breaks that mold.<br />No, the effects aren't what you'd expect 45 years later from Dreamworks, but they are carefully crafted using the technologies of the day. The plot leaves us exploring the gap between technical and psychological evolution (something done well in books like Daniel Quinn's ISHMAEL and Eisler's THE CHALICE AND THE BLADE). <br />Character development is a bit immature and somewhat stereotypical, but this doesn't spoil the movie, it just leaves room for improvement in a remake ... Actually, plot development is prototypical for 60's SF TV. Wrestling with philosophical questions in the context of the imaginary future continued with Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, and Star Trek. Some of the music and sound effects now seem a bit comical and MST3Kish, but that's because they were lifted from =THIS= movie by a whole horde of B matinee flicks.<br />Thoroughly entertaining, the best of its genre for its time, this movie is not one to miss. Well worth viewing, even if science fiction isn't your favorite genre. If I'd seen more character development, I'd have given it a full 5 stars, but the conflicts and mysteries of the movie seem to lead to little growth.<br />(If you'd like to discuss this video or review in greater detail, please click on the \\"about me\\" link above and drop me an email. Thanks!)
B000002J1I|5.0|I bought this album based on the reviews that I read here on Amazon.com.  I am a huge fan of the earlier material, and I quite enjoy the new albums they have been releasing, but I had always heard bad things about this album, and the albums that follow it (The Trevor Rabin Influence).  I'm not much into \\"hit songs\\", and when it sounds to me like a band is trying to write a hit, it turns me right off.  Anyway, that was my WRONG perception.  I am pleasantly surprised by Tormato.  It is an album of shorter songs, sure, but they have great energy and dynamics, as do the best of the best Yes albums.  I'm not sure I'm ready to venture into Trevor-land, but I'm happy I went this far!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|If just one album of this quality came out per year I would be satisfied.  Not nearly enough bands put the thought, emotion, and musicality into their music like Coldplay.  They combine the best of many great bands before them: The melodic sound of U2, the unique emotional style of Radiohead (with a far superior singer), and the musical genious of Pink Floyd.  Combine all of this and add magnificent piano playing, and you get Coldplay's breakthrough album, A Rush of Blood to the Head.  I was never before a Coldplay fan but am now a diehard convert.  Now I just have to get their other album, Parachutes.<BR>Go get it now.  The sooner the better.
B000058983|5.0|&quot;Forever Changes&quot; is a beautiful and haunting album.  The instruments are pared down to guitar, bass, strings.  The lyrics run the emotional gamut from joy, despair, cynicism, and finally a resolve by the singer, Arthur Lee, to accept and embrace his own personal changes in his life and in society around him.<br />I am 32-years-old and have recently discovered sixties underground groups such as Love and have not regretted it.  The reason &quot;Forever Changes&quot; charted low upon it's initial release was probably due to the musical and lyrical complexity of the album.<br />Anyway, I encourage music lovers to purchase this album whether you remember the sixties or not.  This album will CHANGE the way you listen to music FOREVER.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is a classic. Go out and get this one. If not for &quot;Hangar 18&quot; or &quot;Holy War&quot;, then get it because this CD is that good! Two thumbs up!
B000069HKH|4.0|Tiring easily of words like \\"CD\\", \\"album\\", and \\"disc\\", music reviewers often opt for words like \\"effort\\" or \\"offering\\" when talking about new music.  Bruce Springsteen's \\"The Rising\\" is both an effort and an offering to the everyman hero.<br />Out of 15 tracks on the album, five songs (Into the Fire, Nothing Man, Empty Sky, You're Missing, City of Ruin) directly address 9-11.  Not surprisingly, these are the best and most inspired songs on the album.  Their lyrics are stark -- often simple phrases repeated over and over again -- and elegiac.  Consider, \\"Into the Fire\\" : May your strength give us strength / May your faith give us faith / May your hope give us hope /  May love bring us love...  It's deeply moving and affecting stuff.  <br />The rest of the album is a bit of a mix.  Three tracks -- \\"Lonesome Day,\\" \\"Worlds Apart,\\" and \\"Waiting on a Sunny Day,\\" songs of love and loss -- fit well musically within the album.  Two tracks are absolute stinkers: \\"The Fuse,\\" a tale of a midday lusty romp finds Bruce pause before growling, \\"Your bittersweet taste on my tongue,\\" which comes off neither sexy nor humorous.  Likewise, the Jimmy Buffett inspired \\"Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)\\" makes no sense on this or any disc.<br />The other five songs are hit and miss with production levels cranked up to Phil Specter-like mushiness.  Strangely enough, The Rising concludes with a live performance of \\"City of Ruin\\" which has so much rawness and power, it made me wish Bruce and the band had done the whole CD in one take, on the road. <br />Overall, worth owning and the best of any 9-11 inspired pop music out or likely to come.
B000055WIQ|4.0|It's not gone without notice that my own name is the same as one of this film's and book's lead characters. Whatever, this \\"new\\" release with added footage to the original is still as gripping today as it was nearly 30 years ago (Linda Blair's cascade down the staircase is the strongest added punch). Since then, valid differences of opinion have been offered about the film being terror or religious in nature. It's both, splendidly melded in a package of primal fear that also challenges the demons that everyone carries, the challenge being whether our own private faiths can survive the invasion of pure evil. Ellen Burstyn is, as usual, exceptional in projecting her character's sheer desperation in rescuing her daughter from her satanic invader, and the late Jason Miller is perfect as the priest struggling with his own crisis of faith until he meets the devil face to face in this icy little bedroom. Max von Sydow balances the desperation of Chris MacNeil and challenged faith of Father Karras with the dignity and undeniable faith of \\"The Exorcist.\\" Incredibly, after dozens of viewings, the film still manages to impale its viewer with a fear of the unknown. With all said and done, though, we do at least get the hope that divine goodness can save us.
0671027344|5.0|Very beautiful, very touching, very funny. The writing format is one of the most effective and interesting ways I've come across, and breaks the cliqued diary form. Charlie is a sweet, good-intentioned and slightly nieve character who you can't help but love and feel bad for. The ending has a sense of fulfillment that won't leave ya dissapointed like some other similar books. And the characters are so great, you'll wish they were your own friends.
B000053V9F|2.0|Walter Cronkite came up with probably the most accurate assessment of this Oliver Stone fiasco: he called it \\"a bill of goods.\\" More fully, Stone plays recklessly with a pivotal and defining tragedy in American history by putting virtually everyone in the \\"grassy knoll,\\" from the slain President's successor and even to LBJ's successor, Richard Nixon. Along with them is the nation's entire intelligence community, from the CIA and FBI to most every known anti-Castro Cuban-American. \\"JFK\\" is nothing more than a dangerously misleading packaging of virtually every assassination theory ever developed. For anyone who hopes for any credible reason for the insanity in Dallas Nov. 22, 1963, they're not going to find it here. Instead, we're left with the dangerous and (at least because of the lack of evidence cited) unfounded impression that literally everyone in government service was part of the probable conspiracy that ended the Kennedy Administration. Granted, this is only entertainment. But its subject is too important to play as dangerously loose as Stone does with known facts. Pass this one up.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|If this movie lacked of a social message, it would still be great. It has hallucinating visual effects, the music fits very well, a touch of absurd that makes it funny for moments, and it also has a moral: get away from drugs or see what will happen to you. The topic of drugs is not new but the way this movie talks about them is very innovative. There are two parallel stories, the story of this young guy, his friend and his girlfriend; and, on the other hand, the story of his mother. The first story shows what addict people are willing to do in order to get what they need. And the second story shows how an obsessive desire for getting something else, can make us fall down into the addictions world. Anything I can say wouldn't be enough to describe this film and the feeling you get when you are watching it. Just stop reading this, buy it, and enjoy it.
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card has written many fine novels, but this will always be by far my favorite. Many other reviewers go into depth about its content: a young boy, Ender Wiggin, trains at Battle School to defeat the aliens and save humanity. This bare-bones summary cannot possibly convey the multi-layered depth of this extraordinary tale. Many readers do not like sci-fi because they feel there is a lack of characterization, little grounding in reality, and an over-emphasis on unlikely technology. These criticisms are valid for a number of books in the genre, but do not hold true for Ender's Game.<br />Ender's Game is not perfect. The age of the children, even though they are the smartest children on Earth, is still a bit unbelievable. Some say Card's prose is not flowery enough, although I find his style refreshing and particularly appropriate for a book with a high degree of military content. These small issues, however, are beside the point considering that in overall plot, originality, characterization, and themes, Card pulls together a story that is read over and over again because, quite simply, it appeals to almost everyone. You may not like sci-fi, you may not like the idea of small children fighting a war, but you will probably love this book, and you will love Ender Wiggin. His story is a classic of the genre, and a favorite in many readers' hearts.
B000068TPN|2.0|I am a fan of Mel Gibson movies, but this one was no Braveheart or Patriot. There have been alot of great war films like Platoon,Saving Private Ryan, Blackhawk Down, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now. We Were Soldiers is not one of them. This film belongs in the B-grade section  with films like Green Berets , Hamburger Hill, Casualties of War ,Thin Red Line etc.<BR>I thought the acting cheesy and the battles scenes were very unrealistic.<BR>If you love John Wayne movies then you will love We Were Soldiers<BR> If you want to see a great war film grab a copy of Platoon or Blackhawk Down.
0375707972|5.0|I was amazed by the power of this book.  I bought it in the used section for a dollar and didn't expect much from it.  The book was so cheap because it was on Oprah selection so it sold lots.  Take the time to read this frighting tale of obsessional love and you will not regret it.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has done something that only bands dream of . . .strive for - a brillant followup to their amazing first release &quot;Parachutes&quot;. I was hooked from the first few notes of Politik until the end of the album.  I am hoping that this album will push them to the top of many music lovers playlists and give them the recongnition they so rightly deserve.
B00003CXN4|3.0|As remakes go, this isn't a bad flick and there are entertaining parts. Unfortunately the quality acting takes place in smaller roles played by Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle (undercover narcotics officers in CA), and Benicio del Torre and Jacob Guzman (?) del Torre's sidekick in Mexico. They are in fact the only characters that live up to their counterparts in the original BBC Miniseries TRAFFIK.  I would highly, highly recommend purchasing the TRAFFIK mini-series prior to buying this diluted version.
B00005YW4H|5.0|if you've ever been in love, or are so now, you will need this CD. it is everything the heart feels and words would be inadequate to convey ~ xxo
B00003CXSP|1.0|My now, wife paid for me to get into this movie, and am i glad? This film urinates on the grave of silence of the lambs. The plot was slow moving( at one stage my wife nodded off) i myself was trying to see how many pieces of popcorn i could throw at Anthony Hopkins. The one piece of enjoyment i obtained from the film itself is the amount of abuse it warrented on the way home. Hell hath no fury than 6 film go-ers scorned. DONT WASTE YOUR CASH!!!!
0446608955|5.0|I love this book!  It made me laugh, smile, and cry.  The way Landon transforms, and how he unknowingly falls in love with Jaime is amazing.  This is the best love story that I have ever read because it is so innocent and sweet. It taught me about the power of love, and what true love really is.  Hint:  You should read the book before watching the movie.  Whether, you are a hopeless romantic or not this book makes you want to fall in love.  It also shows us that we should be thankful for what we have, live life to the fullest, and that sometimes our &quot;miracles&quot; are in disguise.  Nicholas Sparks is a great author!
B000002N9L|2.0|\\"Chaos and Disorder\\" is the final album Prince recorded for Warner Bros, and it sounds less like an album than an effort to satisfy a recording contract that apparently ended acrimoniously.  The CD sounds unfinished, unfocused, and without direction, filled with several tunes that lack the hooks and passion we've come to expect from Prince.  \\"Dinner With Delores\\" passes along nicely, but elsewhere, it's a nosedive.  Half-hearted rock and funk stompers abound; the lamest of which is \\"I Rock Therefore I Am.\\"  However lackluster \\"Chaos and Disorder\\" sounds, it never approaches disaster. Still, the music represents a pale version of the former Prince who churned out classics like \\"Dirty Mind\\" and \\"Sign O the Times.\\"  A lot of chaos, and much disorder.

B00000099Y|4.0|...Tool. No it is not for everyone. The music is dark and the lyrics are quite deep. And I do mean deep. You will never dissect them fully so you understand what it's all about, but the music is not really about that to begin with. People call Tool Art-Rock. Well, technically every rock band is art rock. These guys are trying to evoke a feeling in their listener, so the lyrics are secondary. As long as you achieve that feeling they consider their job finished. As with any artform, that is always the objective of the artist.<BR>  Maynard does not have the world's greatest voice, but it's definitely on the better side. He has an amazing vocal range which can vary from a whisper to a roar, and it is quite melodic. What makes his voice stand out is how well it fit's the music itself.     <BR>     Some of the songs are quite long, clocking well over ten minutes. People therefor call them prog rock, and lump them into categories with bands like Dream Theater(not that there's anything wrong with Dream Theater). I would like to take a moment and clear up a misconception: progressive rock is nothing more than rock music which pushes the envelope of what is considered to be the normal description of the genre. It sounds convoluted, but it makes sense. Tool and Dream Theater and Pink Floyd all write songs that are epic in length(the norm is considered to be less than five minutes), but that is the only thing they have in commmon. The music style of each band is completely different - completely.<BR>     The videos to the songs are odd, and maybe they are a bit pretentious. However, I don't feel that there has to be a meaning behind ever lyric a musician sings, and every image they show in their videos. As said before, their music is trying to evoke a feeling, and how does one exactly show a 'feeling' through images?<BR>[Another review had] mentioned the Backstreet Boys. This also I was extremely upset about. They cannot be compared. B.B. are talented PERFORMERS. The're like actors with voices. Tool are ARTISTS. The key difference here lies in the fact that Tool writes all their own music. Backstreet Boys do not, nor do many of the 'bubble gum' bands out there. They sing the music they're told to sing, because it earns $$. I do agree that some of it is great music, but I don't think anyone can deny that it is disposable and will disappear off the face of the planet once it's time to change the flavor of the month. There's a hundred other bands doing exactly the same thing they are. And nobody ever said that music has to rhyme, just like poetry.<BR>     The only reason I give this CD 4 stars instead of 5 is because it can start to sound repetetive after a while, but so will any CD that's nearly as long as this one. The artwork is ingenious in the CD booklet(the lenticular cover I especially like), and the music is well thought out. Nothing has been thrown together, either in the packaging or the music prduction itself.<BR>     In the end I recommend this album if for no other reason that it's one of the most orignal albums of the previous decade. Nobody sounds like Tool, no matter how many wannabe's are out there. When a Tool song comes on you know it. Enjoy, and hope it was helpful!!
0316666343|4.0|Fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon was murdered. Rather than that being the end of her story, however, it is only the beginning. She has gone to &quot;her&quot; heaven and is now looking down to Earth watching her loved ones attempt to go on with their lives. <br />In Susie's Heaven, she lives in an apartment with a roommate. She can go to the high school that she so longed to attend on Earth. <br />There are many dogs...because she wants there to be. Susie can have anything she desires in her Heaven...except the return of her life and the experiences she would have had while growing older. <br />All she can do now is watch from above. She sees the investigators trying to solve her case as her murderer destroys evidence. <br />She watches as her first love struggles with the feelings he still has for her and a young girl she brushed past on her departure from Earth becomes obsessed with first Susie and then others like her. And she is the silent witness to the slow descent of her parents' marriage. <br />Life goes on without Susie, but do those she left behind actually live or are they just going through the motions? <br />Alice Sebold has chosen to tell this story from a very unique viewpoint . . . that of a murdered young girl. In this way, the reader is able to feel not only what the &quot;survivors&quot; are going through, but also share in the emotions of a girl plucked from existence before she had the chance to really live. <br />The characters are given dimension and become easy to identify with on many levels. That, matched up with the subject matter involved, makes this a story that will stick with the reader for some time.
B00005JKG7|4.0|Let's just cut to the chase right now and say THIS is THE version of The Fog to own. If you're a fan of the movie, or of John Carpenter (before he turned into a pod person and became incapable of releasing anything but dreck), buy this disc now! The transfer is beautiful: the contrast is high, the detail incredible, the colour rich, and the sound well-balanced. In fact, the overall image quality is better than that of the laserdisc version, with almost no noticeable flecks or scratches, and is almost entirely free of compression artifacting (the only spot I noticed it was after the attack on The Seagrass, when the fog completely covers the screen, and even then I really had to look to notice it). Even the menu screens get the professional touch, with artfully composed looping clips from the movie as well as art and sounds created specifically for the DVD.<br />As far as sound, I'm no expert, but this disc really seemed to clean up all the problems found on previous versions. The levels seem balanced: no playing remote jockey to lower or raise the volume. And MGM even fixed faulty dialogue cues (for example, on the laserdisc version, during the attack on the church, when Father Malone makes his way out of the study to take the gold cross to Blake, and Andy warns him not to, the line \\"Don't go out there\\" plays, and then about five seconds later you see Andy's lips move. On the DVD, the cue and action are perfectly synched).<br />The extras are decent, but nothing to write home about. The storyboard-to-film comparison \\"feature,\\" in particular, is especially disappointing, in that it only shows a very brief segment of the film (the murder of Al and Tom on The Seagrass, about 140 seconds' worth of footage), and even cheats at that (the same art is shown for several shots, although this may have been how the storyboards were actually used). Also, the quality of the film portion of the comparison screen is inexplicably awful. The section is so short and so plainly presented that it seems a cheat to put \\"Storyboard to Film Comparison\\" on the packaging. Instead, it feels like an afterthought, something included because today's DVD consumer expects it, but with as little effort as possible, and no attention or focus at all on how the storyboards were conceived, designed, or used specifically for this film.<br />The outtakes section also dissatisfies, as it is exactly the same as that on the laserdisc, comprising a bunch of unused (and unexplained) special effects and lighting test shots, followed by a scant 2 ½ minutes of actual bloopers (half of which consist of Adrienne Barbeau making post-take faces at the awfulness of her performance, although it is worth the price of admission to see the legendary John Houseman say \\"sh*t\\" after blowing a line), followed by shots of the crew at work. All with very poor sound, or smothered by overbearing music cues. But for those who haven't seen the laserdisc version, it makes a fair addition, in that it also shows many behind-the-scenes activities which are either missing or inadequately described in the voice-over commentary and documentaries<br />Finally, the audio commentary by Carpenter and Hill is also a letdown; while it is fun to hear these two old friends chat away (and it should be noted their synergy is phenomenal), they often fall into a sort of verbal shorthand, leaving any of us without a film degree or fanatical zealot's insider info completely in the dark. Hill's commentary begins to annoy after a while, sounding like a high school TA puffing up her involvement in the film (\\"Those are my hands!\\" \\"That's my quilt!\\" \\"There I am!\\" \\"That's me!\\"), and frequently the contextual information she gives is wrong (at the point in the movie where Janet Leigh's character encourages the townsfolk to stick around and take a look at the statue, for example, Hill claims \\"Here Janet is telling everyone to go home, lock their windows, and be safe\\"). Carpenter tries to give some technical background, but I really don't need to know what town EVERY SINGLE SCENE was shot in, and one can only hear \\"That's Tommy Lee Wallace playing the part of the ghost\\" so many times without wanting to shoot...something. The few times he actually begins to describe interesting or revealing filmmaking footnotes, he either loses his train of thought, or uses abbreviated jargon which leaves the viewer scratching his head in bewilderment.<br />If the disc shines at all in the area of extras, it is for the new documentary made specifically for the DVD. While \\"Fear on Film,\\" made concurrently with the movie, is an abysmally jarring, low-low-budget pastiche of the various people involved blathering on about whatever interested them (Janet Leigh provides such stellar insights as \\"suspense is the fear of what's going to happen,\\" then babbles on about Psycho and Alfred Hitchcock for the rest of her segment) intercut with overlong movie clips that have nothing to do with what the talking heads are talking about, \\"Tales from the Mist\\" presents the entire moviemaking process in a logical, chronological fashion, with movie clips whose content and brevity fully complement the script. Although nowhere near as in-depth or complete as the documentary made for the Halloween DVD, \\"Tales from the Mist\\" is an intelligent, beautifully edited, well-thought-out expose covering all aspects of the production. All in all, its only fault is that it ends much too soon.<br />To sum up, this is a beautiful print which does great justice to a great movie; it deserves a place in your collection on the basis of audio and video quality alone. The presentation is so clean and rich that it looks as if the movie were filmed yesterday. Nor is it a bare-bones edition, with audio commentary, outtakes, storyboard comparisons, and two documentaries...just don't buy it solely for the extras, or you may be disappointed.ut I really don't need to know what town EVERY SINGLE SCENE was shot in, and one can only hear \\"That's Tommy Lee Wallace playing the part of the ghost\\" so many times without wanting to shoot...something.

1587990717|4.0|Nassim's book does an excellent job of explaining (without resorting to mathematics) why randomness plays a more significant role in life than determinism. In my case, he's preaching to the choir as I've always believed in randomness. I was a little disappointed that Nassim didn't offer a way for me to avoid the black swans in life, but I liken his solution to my pet conure who prefers to be out and about rather than cooped up in his cage. Even when he's been waiting hours to come out, when I open the wide cage door, rather than dash out, he struts slowly across the door, standing tall and stretching out his neck, putting on an air of great dignity as if it was his choice when to come out. We should be equally as dignified when we are touched by the black swans of life. (What's a black swan? You have to buy the book to find out.)
B000068PQ0|5.0|I'm in love with this album.  It's spacy & interesting & funky & it grooves.  It's gorgeous & fun!  If you're in need of great, pleasurable music, please buy this!!!
B000002UY5|5.0|ok well my family all likes different types of music and we used to go on long family car rides and you always fight over what station or what cd to listen to, but you put blind melon in and everyone is happy. my dad loves country music and doesn't like a lot of my music, but he loves blind melon. i even remember when i first heard &quot;no rain&quot; i was at my grandma's house and i was flipping through the stations and there was this incredable video that got my attention and the song was amasing. i don't remember how old i was. i know i was older than or equal to 5 because that would be how old i was in 1992. i didn't get the cd tell later though because i was young and my parents made us listen to their music. Then when i got older i had to find out who sang that song that played in my head all the time. i got the cd and i loved it so then i got the other 2 cds. blind melon's music is terrific and everyone that loves music should like any of their cds.
6305718954|5.0|When I first saw the commercials back when Stigmata was released, I cringed at the thought of a &quot;Next Exorcist&quot;. I avoided the film up until TBS finally broadcasted it earlier this year, and I was amazed by it.<br />If you go into the movie believing it's the &quot;Next Exorcist&quot; plot-wise, you will be horribly disappointed. The only ties between the two movies are the use and discussion of religion, religious beliefs, and figures, and possession itself. The experiences of both Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) and the Exorcist's leading character, Reagan (Linda Blair) are drastically different. Whereas Reagan was possessed by a demonic spirit for cruel reasons of it's own, Frankie experiences an extremely different sort of possession. Frankie became possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased priest, Paolo Alameida. <br />Father Alameida, along with two other priests, had been working together to translate a document found near the site of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in Jerusalem. The document is entirely in Aramaic - the language believed to be used during the time of Jesus. The three priests begin to believe that the words in this document are actually words spoken by the living Jesus Christ at the time of his last supper, telling his Disciples how to continue his church after his crucifixion. <br />Once word began to spread in the Catholic church about the gospel (and how damaging it's content would be to the church itself), the three priests were discommunicated and exiled, with Father Alameida relocating to Bel Quinto, Brazil, where he would head a church, and eventually commit suicide before the translation was finished.<br />After Frankie's mother (on vacation in Brazil at the time), sends her a rosary (that was actually stolen from the body of Father Alameida), Frankie begins experiencing wounds similar to those of Christ at the time of his crucifixion. After a priest witnesses Frankie receiving the wounds of the whip across herback in a subway, Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) is sent to investigate the possible appearance of the stigmata, the wounds of Christ.<br />As Andrew's time with Frankie grows, she continues receiving more and more wounds, and finds herself speaking and writing in languages she does not understand - Italian...and Aramaic. Andrew actively works to bring the meanings of the words Frankie is speaking and writing to light, thus strengthening the tension between Andrew and the Catholic church, most notably Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), who originally exiled the three priests working on the translation. <br />The movie shows the negative side of what happens when churches become dictatorships. As the meanings of the words spoken and written by Frankie, as well as the reasons behind (as well as who is responsible for) her possession become clearer to Andrew, the Catholic church tries harder and harder to silence Frankie and to continue making people believe that the church is continuing the faith as Christ wanted, regardless of whether or not a simple exorcism is done to cast out the spirit of Father Alameida to keep him from using Frankie to finish the translation...or by silencing Frankie herself.<br />The movie is a chilling representation of fanaticism and explores hidden aspects of religion and of possession, separating it from the Exorcist and the like. <br />Watch the film with an open mind and open eyes and enjoy what you find hidden below the surface.

B00005JL0I|5.0|Five Directors, tons of random cameos, a hilariously mad and confusing battle sequence, and several James Bonds later I was laughing hysterically at this picture.  This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and enjoying it is not sacreligous to the James Bond series because parody is the sincerest form of flattery.  Sellers, Niven, Allen, some of the best names in comedy shine in this under the radar gem that should definately be given the DVD treatment.  I can't wait to buy this title!
B00005JKZT|5.0|There is absolutley no doubt in my mind that this movie is going to be simpley stunning, and all the people who said that the FOTR dragged, they are going to be in for a treat in the Two Towers. Eowyn is in love with aragorn in the book his aditude about the situation is 'get away from me' but i think that jackson is going to make it seem as though Aragorn had feelings for her too. Ya know just for kix, and to make the plot line a bit more... intriguing...for the ladies. I think it would be fun.
630026999X|4.0|5 Creepy tales told in the style of 50's Horror comic books such as \\"Tales From The Crypt.\\"  A family gathers to continue a bizarre father's day ritual-but there's a special visitor this year.  A man discovers a mysterious meteorite that crashed on his lawn.  A disgruntled husband plans a beach adventure for two young lovers...and more!<br />This film captures the spirit of the old 50's horror comics much better than any of the \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" movies could.  While some of the stories fall slightly flat (witness \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verril\\"-which is more depressing than funny) the stories are generally surprisingly effective.  \\"Something to Tide You Over\\" and \\"They're Creeping Up on You\\" are two of the best.  The atmosphere of \\"The Crate\\" is slightly diminished by the hideously fake looking creature (this would have been much more effective if they'd not shown the creature), but otherwise, the makeup effects are impressive, and they add to the creepiness of the film.  This film was very enjoyable, and is a must-see for King fans.<br />Did you Know: Stephen King and George Romero originally collaborated on this film in order to make enough money to help finance a film version of King's novel \\"The Stand.\\"
B000007T1M|5.0|This CD took a little while to get into, my friend got it a few years ago and I just bought it maybe last year. I like this CD better because it's alot rougher, and it has ALOT more emotion. When they made this cd the first take was what went on the album, Just listen to it a few times though and you'll fall in love with it. It dosen't sound like their new cd because after the self titled album came out they toured so much, they perfected their sound, buy the bundle if you don't belive me. It's hard to tell it's the same band. Just give this cd a try. You'll really like it.
B0000027F8|5.0|George Michael's second solo album is like a panoramic view into the soul of the man himself. The variety and spectrum of the songs on this album reinforce George's multi-level talent. Starting with his famous \\"Praying For Time\\", \\"Freedom\\" (in essence the story of his struggle to free himself from an oppressive record label), George does a 180-degree music turn with the spiritual, if not cryptic, \\"They Won't Go When I Go\\". (a personal favorite). \\"Cowboys And Angels\\" (my favorite song), is George at his very best. In the vein of \\"Kissing A Fool\\" and \\"Last Request (I Want Your Sex, Part 3) from his FAITH album, \\"Cowboys And Angels\\" has that jazz & blues-like quality that touches your innermost being when you listen closely to the words and allow the music to envelope you completely. The contemplative mood of the album continues with \\"Waiting For That Day/You Can't Always Get What you Want\\" and the bittersweet tenderness of \\"Mother's Pride\\". The upbeat \\"Heal The Pain\\" and the jazzy \\"Soul Free\\" are jewels, as is the last cut, \\"Waiting(Reprise)\\". From start to finish this album is extraordinary.
B000069AUI|5.0|\\"Rush\\" must receive a grammy nomination for album of the year this February. Springsteen's \\"The Rising\\" will win that award, but Coldplay must be nominated. \\"Rush\\" is an excellent follow up to \\"Parachutes\\". Another matters of the heart type of collection. I must admit I was a little worried. I wasn't sure if Coldplay could make another beautiful, touching, warm album...but thank God they were able to pull it off because lets face it...90% of the music out there in this moment of time is pure [junk]. The world needs Coldplay. My favorite songs here are \\"In My Place\\", \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", \\"Green Eyes\\", \\"Clocks\\", and the amazing \\"The Scientist\\". But all the songs are wonderful. People will be listening to this album 25 years from now. It has a timeless appeal, and it's just that good.
B00004YRQA|5.0|It is a memory card,  It remembers stuff.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica are speed/thrash metal's kings.  This is their best.  The opening assault of \\"Battery\\" opens up with crippling strength and brutality, and the band does not let up until the fourth track, \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\", and then continue about 45 seconds into the track.  \\"Disposable Heroes\\", the album's fifth cut, goes on eight minutes in enormous guitar blaring and snarling, screaming, and mostly singing by James Hetfield.  Kirk Hammet revealed one of metal's best solos later on in the track, and the whole song is just great and the best on the album.  \\"Leper Messiah\\" follows right after Disposeable Heroes, and is one of the heaviest tracks on any Metallica album.  The song explores how some vague people think about organized religion and another awesome solo by Hammet.  \\"Orion\\", the seventh song, is an epic metal instrumental, complete with several solos and a even a bass solo by Cliff Burton.  The final track, \\"Damage, Inc.\\", allows Lars Ulrich's drumming to stand out almost as well as it does in Disposeable Heroes.  This is rooted in early thrash, and shows how Metallica were becoming stars even before they released their true breakthrough, 1991's self-titled \\"Black Album.\\"  As possibly THE defining album of thrash metal, this is the album you want if you are: <br />1.  Are new to Metallica<br />2.  Are new to heavy metal or hard rock<br />3.  Are a fan of music in general!!!<br />   Anyway, this is clearly a great recording, worth all of your attention.  Enjoy, my fellow metalheads!
B00006DEF9|5.0|Sorry Richard, but SINGIN' IN THE RAIN was released in May of 1952, in optical mono sound. SITR was never released in stereo to the theaters....always mono. Now, later Gene Kelly musicals like Brigadoon an Les Girls were issued in 35mm 4-track mag, but SITR was too early.<br />Anyhow, The new DVD will knock your socks off!
B000069HK2|5.0|This is actually a band from my hometown that I'm actually proud of! They are a great band and they give great music. They're really going into the right direction. I was caught instantly by their single, &quot;The Taste Of Ink&quot; and checked out the whole CD and its definitely NOT a dissapointment. If you're a rock/punk fan, then you'll love these guys! And if you like their new single, you'll love this CD!
6305897786|5.0|This movie was beautifully done and is very compelling.  Like mentioned before, if you are looking for a change from all of the non stop action and loudness that comes with them, this would probably be a good movie to watch.<br />The story is an interesting one, a type of story not often done in many Hollywood movies.  I won't go into details, as you can read the review of it on the product page.  <br />The movie itself is dark if anything.  There is always that lingering fear and tenseness throughout.  The characters are portrayed pretty good.  There are always those people who have said that Depp is &quot;the most selfish person around&quot;, and you really won't like him that well.  Well, you can make your own opinions on that.  It can be argued on various levels.<br />If you are looking for a change in movies, this would be nice to watch.  But I think for the average person, one would have to be in the mood to watch this, as there is little action and the story is kind of deep.  But overall, the movie has been superbly made.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I am not into movie musicals, but this is one of my favorite movies.<br />This movie is great becuase its a simple and fun movie to watch. You know it by heart, and can sing along to it.  I will definately be buying this DVD, especially since I have only seen the movie in TV pan/scan... I never got to see the rerelease in the theaters.  I am so glad that its going to be the 2.35 widescreen.  Please do not buy the Full Screen version, it just won't be the same.<br />I really like the songs, both in English and the Spanish versions that came out for the Mexican version of it with Timbiriche a few years ago.  I actually saw that version in the theater !  Its called \\" Vaselina \\" in spanish.  Look it up on the web, there is a whole album with most of the songs. <BR> <BR>As for reviewer Robert A DelMedico (...rendition of a killer play), I doubt if anybody would disagree with him that the high schoolers looked too old.  But thats always a problem with kids/teens in any movie.  But he is looking at it from the point of the play.  Most people see the film as seperate from the play. They should not be judged against each other.<br />I do agree with him about the missing songs/scenes.  When I saw the play in Spanish ( Vaselina ), some of the songs that he mentions missing where the most prominent in the play.  But that might have also been due to which were easier to translate.<br />Buy this one !  But get the widescreen edition.  And don't buy Grease 2.  Not very good.
B00005JKOI|3.0|I just saw this movie again after not having seen it for a long time.  It wasn't half as annoying as it was when I saw it in the theatre.  Molly Ringworm over the years has become far less irritating.  The Annie Potts chick was far funnier than I remember.  Annie Potts has really run the gamut from this, to &quot;Designing Women,&quot; to being the white half of a biracial lesbian couple battling discrimination in the Deep South in &quot;Any Day Now.&quot;  Well, the soundtrack of this is great but the plot is awfully cliqued and hokey.  Nice rich boy falls for poor girl with heart of gold, but each have hang-ups and friends who do not approve.  Will this star-crossed duo make it despite all odds being against them?  Take one guess, Sherlock.  Also, what really bugs me about this flick is that Ringworm takes Annie Potts' fairly nice Prom dress and turns it into the most hideous creation I've ever seen.  It was terrible!  Not only was the homemade dress ugly, ugly, ugly, but it did not even show off the then-teen idol's smokin' bod.  Three stars for the soundtrack and Miss Potts.
B000028U0Y|5.0|If there ever was a show tailored for it's audience, this was it.  Johnny Cash's landmark performance for a couple thousand inmates at Folsom prison should stand out as a classic of classics.  The performance is immediately listenable the first time, and never wears down listen after listen.  <br />There is something to be said about music that has to be listened to several times to really appreciate it.  On the other hand, it's also nice to hear something that hits the spot right away in it's simplicity.  Buddy Holly and John Lennon were able to achieve this.  In the case of this album, the producers knew they weren't dealing with an audience of rocket scientists.  They needed a show format that would catch on right away, as the odds of this show happening again were very slim.  <br />So we get a song selection where my only problem is the short length of them.  But then, most of Cash's work has been get to the point, then get to the next song.  While all of the songs were not written by him, they fit his style exactly.  For example, we get some humorous songs like \\"Dirty Old Egg-Suckin' Dog\\" and \\"Flushed From the Bathroom of Your Heart\\" which strike the right chord at the right time.<br />But there are also the majority of songs that remind the audience of exactly where they are, why they are there, and what they're missing from being there.  This can be considered a bit cruel, but hey, they were not only getting a free concert by a major act, but were also a part of music history.  So while \\"Cocaine Blues\\" and \\"25 Minutes To Go\\" are rollicking and fun, the real tearjerkers like \\"The Long Black Veil\\", \\"Send a Picture of Mother\\", and \\"The Wall\\" give the work incredible balance.  <br />One more note, and yes, I say get the album and keep it on your high-rotation list.  A few years ago, when Cash looked like he had two feet in the grave, they had a special where a bunch of artists spoke a few words and did a Cash song.  When it was Bruce Springsteen's turn, he did \\"Give My Love to Rose\\", also on this album.  Now you Springsteen fans (and Cash fans) should dig out \\"The River\\", and listen to \\"Wreck on the Highway\\".  As the story of both songs is EXACTLY the same, you have to think that one American icon's inspiration came from the work of another American icon.  And this album is one of the best showcases of that talent.

0375413405|5.0|My first cookbook was Joy of Cooking, my second, Mastering the Art of French Cooking; both were solid, basic, accessible, world-expanding, indispensable guides for me when I was young and learning to do more in the kitchen than I had grown up with.  An appreciation of food and a view toward a larger world started here for me.  It is an excellent place still, this set, to start an education in classic French cuisine.  Julia Child wrote the recipes with an inexperienced cook and American audience in mind, and 35-40 years ago, probably, so the dishes are imminently do-able.  Get all the volumes.
0930289528|5.0|_Moore has created a very accessible anarchist document here. He emphasises that anarchy refers to a system without leaders- not without order. It is just that we've been brainwashed into thinking that the world cannot run without it's immense bureuacracy of leaders, bosses, experts- and their hired muscle. We've given our power away to monsters and paracites out of nothing more than our own stupidity and complacency. Well, Moore has written a well balanced story that emphasises both the inherent evil of toltalitarian governments, as well as, the complicity of the common man in their continued existance.<br /><br />_One thing did jump out at me here, the fascists take over in England (apparently the Scots are still resisting) with the SUPPORT of the major corporations- not unlike the way our corporations prefer to do business with oppressive dictatorships in the Third World (democracies are too \\"messy\\", unpredictable, and disorderly.)<br /><br />_In the forward, the author expresses his disgust with Thatcher and the Conservatives and describes Britain as a \\"cold, mean place.\\" I can't help but wonder how he is liking the U.S. these days under Bush and Cheney....
0441172717|5.0|One of the greatest science fiction epics ever written. This book has it all: mind-expanding drugs, human computers, political intrigue, interstellar economics, and big-... worms. The reader should take from this book a sense of grandness of scale. The messianic fervor of the Fremen, the calculated patience of the Bene Gesserit eugenics program, the ecological ambition of Liet Kynes, and the universal-historical vision of the Quisatz Haderach, all ought to awaken us to the necessity and danger of human activity on the universal-historical timescale. That is the scale on which we all operate, whether we know it or not. Some of the themes in this book, which was written in the mid-1960's, foreshadow the adolescent field of chaos theory. In particular, the notion that seemingly insignificant local events can have calamitous effects on future history is analogous to the butterfly effect. Also, Herbert's conception of prophecy as a probability tree branching infinitely through time enjoys some endorsement from quantum physics.

The only element some might call fantasy is his account of \\"yetis\\" in the Himalayas. But his account is so matter-of-fact in all other aspects (if in fact, ANY of the trek really happened), its hard to discount it. He was only looking to survive; he was not on a \\"monster-hunt\\"; and by the time his account was recorded, he surely knew he could be labeled a \\"nut\\" for including this in his account. As other reviewers indicate, in fact, it might have been nice if some of the British soldiers in India, or somebody, had been contacted to CONFIRM this trek.<br />   Anyway, that wasn't the reason we loved the book. How many people would have dared those unimaginable distances, full well aware of how distant any freedom or repatriation might be? There are many-better documented-accounts of such journeys. These books are also a cautionary tale to archaeologists (which we are), who are (by profession) insecure with the concept that small bands can cover huge distances, leaving no material trace of their passage.

Its a stunning story that deserves more than the historical obscurity it has.

0316666343|3.0|Disturbing, sad, and beautifully written, THE LOVELY BONES is as inconsistent as the sentence I just wrote.  Alice Sebold's moving account of a 14-year-old girl's metaphysical oddysey following her brutal murder evokes more questions than answers.<br />The protagonist, Susie Salmon, gives us a first-person account of her death, her experience in Heaven, and the lingering effect of her death on her family with a detached aloofness that often suspends credibility.  How...how on earth...can this tragic character relate the events of the story with such emotional sterility?  It's as if another person were killed, and Susie is giving us the grisly aftermath as an objective reporter.  Her transcendental afterlife, as she moves freely between Heaven and earth, rings hollow, almost purgatorial:  there is an inconsistent lack of an emotional investment.<br />That said, Alice Sebold provides a haunting, well-written narrative.  Good, but less than satisfying.

What had me completely turning pages was watching how the grieving family dealt with MR Harvey, the killer,  living in the neighborhood as a free man.  But the book seemed to lose coherance about the time he left the neighborhood.  Characters started to act in ways I found unconvincing....the &quot;falling out of heaven&quot; and overly sentimental reveries reminded me of bad soap opera with a ghost.....
B000066F6H|4.0|Veni Vidi Vicious is the future of indie rock. The Hives jump in your face with crazy guitar parts, killer drums, and insane vocals. Sweeds know how to rock. They might be a little cocky on stage but that's ok cause there cd rocks. Songs like the catchy Hate To Say I Told You So and the imfamous Main Offender give them an excuse to be conceited. The only downside to the Hives is the first 4 times through the cd all the songs sound the same except their vein attempt on a ballad (Another Girl) which comes out as monotonus. With the growing populatirty of the hives, Indie Rock might be on the rise. 8/10

0679722610|5.0|Dashiell Hammett took the mystery story out of the drawing room and put it squarely into the American street with his stories of his nameless Continental Detective Agency Private Eye during the 1920's. Known as \\"the Continental Op\\" Hammett's hero, a short middle aged, slightly fattish loner was a break from the past as regards mystery stories. Hammett, along with Carroll John Daly and other BLACK MASK MAGAZINE pulp writers revolutionized the detective story with their gritty realism and adventurous stories of gats, guns, and molls.<br />RED HARVEST is probably the Continental Op's best know adventure, pitting him against the forces of corruption and crime in a small town named Personville. The Op calls the burg \\"Poisonville\\" and the cast of villainous characters that he encounters and goes up against make the nickname quite apt.<br />If you've seen the movies \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\", \\"Last Man Standing\\", or \\"Yojimbo\\" then you have a general idea of what the tale is about. While none of these follows Hammett's intricate plot, the premise of a lone gunman outsmarting and out dueling the whole town is what the story is about. From the time that the Op breezes into town to talk with his client, whom is murdered before the Op can ever meet with him, till the end of the story, there is lots of violence, murder, double dealing and cynical observations by the narrating detective. While we never learn very much about the Op his driven and unswerving dedication to riding the town of any and all opponents takes on the role of obsession and vigilantism by the end of the novel, so much so that the Op himself even begins to have some doubts. Not enough to stop him from completing the job however.<br />Hammett's spare lean style of writing isn't for everybody, especially those who want in-depth character studies where the protagonist spends a lot of time mulling over the state of the universe and his own personal angst. However if you want action and good tight writing then he's your man. A justly acclaimed classic ever since it came out, this novel is the one that started the \\"hard boiled\\" school of writing ball rolling.your man.

0380733358|5.0|The Needle<BR>Ken Follet<BR><br /> Henry Faber alias, The Needle, is a German spy who works for Germany during World War II.  He is tall, handsome, intelligent, well built, German aristocrat who works fast, in a  shrewd manner, cleanly, and without leaving a trace.  He is very close to Hitler. When a person becomes a danger to his identity or whereabouts, he uses an \\"stilletto\\" to utterly kill without almost any evidence. <br /> The Needle or Die Nadle, discovers a British military secret that if given to the Germans on time would, no question about it, make the Germans win the war.  Then the British find out about it, then starts the run, hide and go of The needle.  All the Allied and British military intelligence are looking for him with no results  But nobody but a woman, Lucy Rose, who lives in a stormy  and far away island , can get to him...<br />The novel is excellently written and keeps the reader interested until the end. It also depicts all the knowledge about military intelligence, spies and world War II that the author masters.<br />I strongly recommend this book as a novel to entertain, and \\"A Place Called Freedom\\", also written by Ken Follet
B000001FO4|5.0|Cinderella made a classic with this one. This is the best heavy metal record of 1988. The blues influence is real and not forced like some bands would later do.(Poison anyone?)

B000069AUI|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Coldplay perform many of their new songs from this wonderful album on a special MTV show, a week before its release. I was immmediately blown away by how much they have progressed musically since \\"Parachutes\\"!!! Don't get me wrong, that is a great cd as well, but I have to say that between the two, \\"A Rush of Blood to The Head\\" is far stronger and diverse. There is not a bad song to be had, but if I had to pick my favorite tracks, they would be \\"Clocks\\", \\"A Whisper\\", and the one that tops my list, \\"Daylight\\"-I particularly love the psychedelic, Beatlesque vibe going on with that one. I will have to admit, without a doubt, that this is one of the best cds I have picked up yet this year...and I know if anyone asks for a good-no, excellent-musical recommendation, this will be one of the first ones I mention. Coldplay has proven that they will just consistiently get better with time; with such skilled musicianship, emotion, and of course Chris Martin's sincere vocals, how can they go wrong? Buy this album, enjoy again and again...you won't regret it!!
B00005LOUP|2.0|I LOVED the original Suess cartoon The Grinch.  I have watched it every Christmas Eve for as long as I can remember.  The music, the animation, the voices, the story... EVERYTHING was great!<br />I am also a big fan of Jim Carrey since he was In Living Color.  I own most of his movies and love him as an actor/comedian.<br />This combination was supposed to WORK!!!  It had the production money, the right costumes, the right actors, and the right direction, but there was something missing.  Carrey's voice was nowhere near as good as he is capable of.  The story was changed around quite a bit.  The narrator's voice was off.  The whole thing just reeked of \\"Not Dr. Suess\\".  If you want a good movie, get the original cartoon, and Carrey's Truman Show or Me, Myself, & Irene.  Sometimes you can't combine two great things successfully...
B00000F1D3|5.0|I bought this album in 1999, it was the very first Cher album I purchased, and after listening to it, I was definitely a fan.  This was Cher's most popular album in many years.  She has recorded different styles in her career, and this is one of the best.  The songs are great for a dance/pop music lover, or a fan of Cher.  My favorite tracks are: Believe, Runaway, Strong Enough, All or Nothing and Dov'e L'Amore.  I would definitely recommend this.
B00005ATQI|4.0|Stanley Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; is totally inferior to the book and the miniseries, but Jack Nicholson does a fabulous job portraying the rantings of a madman. Without Jack Nicholson and the character of Delbert Grady, the film would be a disaster. A mindless, bloody, violent film, failing to live up to the expectations of true horror movie lovers. The only famous actor in films I can think of who would play this part just as brilliant or more brilliant than Jack Nicholson is Robert De Niro, who excellently portrayed the role of pyschopath Max Cady in &quot;Cape Fear&quot;. Anyways, this movie is all-in-all great, if you don't compare it to the book or miniseries. I recommend it for fans of horror.
B000068QZK|5.0|This album doesn't have the sound that Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman had, but it is still great.  I would say that it has a mixture of The Ultimate Sin/No More Tears.  The material is, once again, excellent.  The band has a great sound.  This is the first album with Zakk Wylde, and it is an excellent debut.  Unfortunately, this album wasn't as well known as Ozzy's others, but fans will really appreciate this gem.  My favorite tracks are: Miracle Man, Devil's Daughter (Holy War), Crazy Babies, Breakin' All the Rules, Bloodbath in Paradise and Tattooed Dancer.  I would also recommend purchasing the 2002 remaster with The Liar and a neat live version of Miracle Man.
B000002H97|2.0|This album marked the sad point when Metallica discarded the incredibly cultivated, dynamic sound they had nurtured for most of the 80's and simply became another sellout band.

B00000DI06|5.0|John Rutter is one of most talented composers I know of. I would suggest any music by Rutter for any classical music &quot;beginner&quot;. The Cambridge Singers give me chills every time I hear them.
B00005RFQ5|2.0|Just because it's Prince, doesn't mean it's great.  I'm as big a fan as there is of his music but I can see mediocrity for what it is.  Musically, he has floundered and flailed for about ten years now.  There have been bright spots here and there, but nothing he has done has worked on the same level as his music from before the early 90's, plain and simple.<br />This album is a prime example.  Like most of his albums from the last decade, there are a couple tracks that stand out, and the rest are completely unremarkable.  I hate to say it, but as an artist, Prince would never even be mentioned or known if his career had started ten years ago.  If we all hadn't fallen in love with his music in the 80's we never would have bought a single album from the last ten years.  It's the sad truth.  The only material he has produced that is really good has been stuff from the vaults such as \\"Crystal Ball\\" and \\"The Vault\\".  There ARE excellent tracks to be found here and there, but none of the albums he has released compare as a whole to the early works.  \\"Emancipation\\" could have been a good album if he had trimmed a couple discs worth of blandness out.<br />There is one highlight on \\"The Rainbow Children\\":  1+1+1=3.  It is an excellent, funky, energetic prince track.  Love it.  <br />But the rest is riddled with mostly forgettable stuff.  And tracks like \\"The Work\\" and \\"The Wedding Banquet\\" are truly awful.  No, they are beyond awful.  They are laughable.   Only the most starry-eyed, blinded, die-hard fan could begin to defend these tracks.  <br />And all the Born Again rhetoric in his lyrics is nauseating.  <br />Skip this Prince album.  Even \\"Rave\\" was a gem compared to this.
B000002U9W|4.0|\\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is truly one masterwork that contains all of the above-mentioned ingredients...INCLUDING the kitchen sink. Although the album's cover features a rather slick bovine sporting its front, \\"AHM\\"'s three middle cuts features some minor \\"anal\\" abrasions, as particularly found in the Richard Wright-penned \\"Summer '68\\" and in the Roger Waters composition \\"If\\". As far as the latter tune is concerned, it isn't the Dylan-esque folk flavor that gives it such a down-in-the-mouth atmosphere - instead, it's the depressing lyrics about Waters dealing with his good friend's (Syd Barrett) departure from Pink Floyd, and being unable to fix his troubled mate's problems. \\"Summer '68's\\" \\"slow as molasses\\" fervor is redeemed by its somewhat killer rock edged coda towards the end of this track. \\"Fat Old Sun\\" is the least \\"dense\\" of the middle three, and contains nice lyrical and guitar work from David Gilmour. \\"Atom Heart Mother\\"'s bookends make it the ulimate psychedelic ride of a lifetime, as displayed in grand Floydian fashion in the opening \\"AHM Suite\\", complete with a barrage of varied musical instrumentation, with horns and orchestration thrown in for good measure (even a horse's neigh is buried beneath somewhere!). Since EVERYTHING is found in the \\"AHM Suite\\", it means THE KITCHEN SINK is there in the other brilliant bookend \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\"...it's LITERALLY there, people, take my word for it! All the sounds and nuances of preparing breakfast will just make your mouth water, so come with a healthy appetite! But, this breakfast isn't complete without a hint of psychedelia as an after meal treat, as Pink Floyd brings epic proportions to the table. Even though \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" has just a few weak spots somewhere in the middle, it's worth having in one's CD collection for both the suites and that cute cow on the cover. As Roger Waters would later state in a future popular single: \\"Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash\\" down to your local retailer today, and make this \\"cash cow\\" your pet today, before someone buys up the entire farm!tailer today, and make this \\"cash cow\\" your pet today, before someone buys up the entire farm!
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Poses is an extraordinary CD, a great achievement.  One track begins with a woman's voice, \\"It's very difficult to keep the line between the past & the present.\\"  This CD straddles that line exquisitely.  \\"Cigarettes & Chocolate Milk\\" has an offbeat melody with wonderful piano, \\"And then there are those other things which for several reasons I won't mention, everything about them is a little bit stranger, a little bit harder & a little bit deadly.\\"  \\"Greek Song\\" sounds like a Geisha lovefest, \\"You turn me on\\" sung fast 3 times.  The title track has a gorgeous melody with Rufus' voice high & smooth as velvet.  Vocal harmonies give an expansive feel on \\"Shadows,\\" \\"I could be a great star, still I'm far from happy.\\"  \\"California\\" is a bright energetic pop exercise, \\"So much to plunder that I think I'll sleep instead.\\"  \\"The Tower of Learning\\" has a lumbering melody and an extensive lyrical vocabulary, \\"I'm looking for the copious prize.\\"  \\"Grey Gardens\\" has a lush sound, \\"My heart can be a pin, a sharp silver dragonfly.\\"  \\"Rebel Prince,\\" where the Marigolds revolt has a McCartney-like melody including French lyrics with urbane sexual conflict and Martha Wainwright's gorgeous backing vocals.  Perhaps \\"The Consort\\" is a gender bender lyric \\"Beautiful queen in a blood red moon.\\"  How does one interpret Rufus' dad's \\"One Man Guy\\" in this context?  It is perfectly positioned on this CD.  If Edgar Allen Poe were a rock star, \\"Evil Angel\\" might have been his dreamy tune followed by the pretty pensive \\"In A Graveyard.\\"  \\"Poses\\" is a major work, brilliant both for the breathtaking innovation of the songwriting & arrangement as well as the masterful voice.  If David Bowie had been a Beatle, his solo albums might have sounded like this.  Best of the year quality.  Don't miss it.

B00004U2G1|5.0|SACD, as a format, is a stunning breakthrough in both realism and sonic integrity.  This SACD, though only a remaster of the original 2 track master, does well to illustrate the formats potential.  Yes, Tom's original mix is still intact, although the dynamic range has increased a tad.  Upon first listening, I felt like I was listening to the album again, as the CD never really carried the impact for me that the original LP did.  Upon closer scrutiny, however, I began to realize the depth in the recording that I had never heard before.  Indeed, it is a very slick, very well produced recording.  SACD, however, lends increased dynamics and punch, as well as a much warmer bottom end, and as mentioned above, depth.<br />A must buy, in my opinion, as it is one of the all time great albums, and it really shows some of the capabilities of the SACD format.  Now, if someone would remix it in 5.1, (Come on, Sony!), I'd be ecstatic!<br />(As for the 24 bit comment in an earlier comment, 24bit, 96kHz DVD-A would not lend itself any greater clarity or impact, as bit depth has no relevance to the SACD format.   And In my professional experience, as far as formats go, SACD exceeds the capabilities of DVD-A in an A-B comparison shootout.  Now we just need more new titles recorded and mixed for DSD-SACD from the start.  Then, we will really experience a truely unique and unapproachable by any other format musical experience.)<br />Hey Sony, don't let this format go the way of the Betacam, ok?  It's a winner, if you'll really support it.<br />Just my $0.02.
0316666343|4.0|There is nothing so tragic as the violent death of a child. It's something that can tear apart not just the family of the lost, but anyone even remotely connected to them. And this kind of grief is something authors have struggled to describe since the dawn of storytelling -- weaving that sorrow into some of the most painfully beautiful works ever. Until now, however, no one has really explored the grief the dead child experiences -- at having their life taken from them, at having to leave abruptly from the secure warmth and ease of their families and friends.<br />This is a unique and incredibly moving and tender novel written from the point of view of 14 year old Susie Salmon, brutally murdered by a neighbor. The story begins in Susie's first days in heaven, a place where she finds she can have anything she wishes for, except that things she wants most -- to be alive and allowed to grow up.<br />Susie can see the world from heaven (note that she uses a lowercase \\"h\\" herself for the word \\"heaven\\" until the end of the novel) and so her story tracks not only her own journey of grief, but also that of her parents, her sister, her brother, her friends. Each of them struggling in their own, wholly individual ways. Her father is desperate to catch the killer. Her mother, desperate to move on -- to get away from the horror and pain. Others are consumed by feelings of guilt or anger or fear, sorrow, confusion.<br />Despite the fact that this sounds like it must then be the most depressing novel ever written, it truly isn't. The pain is very real, but Susie herself is actually a rather delightful narrator. She's funny and smart. And a bit on the devious side. She made me laugh, broke my heart, and kept me reading long into the night. She will not easily be forgotten.<br />If you love books that truly impact you -- books that have the potential to change you -- then this is one to add to your list. And while I generally feel a need to warn parents away from stories about lost children (for example, I won't be renting \\"In The Bedroom\\" with my mother), this is one I think anyone who has lost a loved one could benefit from reading. Because it wills you to believe \\"that the dead truly talk to us, that in the air between the living, spirits bob and weave and laugh with us.

Amy Tan put into several short stories, what Nancy Friday put into a pyschological guide.<br />Before any woman can be free to live her own life, she must understand, accept and appreciate where she begins and her mother ends, in each of their interactions.<br />And societal expectations can play a big impact on this challenge for all of us.<br />In this novel, 4 Chinese mothers, who grew up during China's war with Japan pass on that universal and unspoken rule that says that to be female is to not process your thoughts, and speak through your own voice.<br />I recommend everyone read this book, while you think about your own experiences, and how they compare.  You will be amazed at how Ms. Tan has told your childhood story, no matter what your race or socioeconomics are.<br />And as you note your story, through this story, share your stories with other women and girls, so that we all benefit from knowing that we can love our mothers, while we break free of the symbiotic bond that has for too long held us back.
6305327041|4.0|I think this is Tim Roth's best performance in a film to date.  Ted the Bellboy goes from wacky situation to wacky situation, and gets funnier every time! (I've got problems - plural!) The movie gets funnier as it goes along, and Antonio Banderas also gives his funniest performance in this film as a [angry] dad determined to do New Year's Eve right, leaving his horrible children in Ted the Bellboy's care.  If you like quirky, sometimes dark humor, this is definitely a movie for you!
B00004U2G1|5.0|SACD, as a format, is a stunning breakthrough in both realism and sonic integrity.  This SACD, though only a remaster of the original 2 track master, does well to illustrate the formats potential.  Yes, Tom's original mix is still intact, although the dynamic range has increased a tad.  Upon first listening, I felt like I was listening to the album again, as the CD never really carried the impact for me that the original LP did.  Upon closer scrutiny, however, I began to realize the depth in the recording that I had never heard before.  Indeed, it is a very slick, very well produced recording.  SACD, however, lends increased dynamics and punch, as well as a much warmer bottom end, and as mentioned above, depth.<br />A must buy, in my opinion, as it is one of the all time great albums, and it really shows some of the capabilities of the SACD format.  Now, if someone would remix it in 5.1, (Come on, Sony!), I'd be ecstatic!<br />(As for the 24 bit comment in an earlier comment, 24bit, 96kHz DVD-A would not lend itself any greater clarity or impact, as bit depth has no relevance to the SACD format.   And In my professional experience, as far as formats go, SACD exceeds the capabilities of DVD-A in an A-B comparison shootout.  Now we just need more new titles recorded and mixed for DSD-SACD from the start.  Then, we will really experience a truely unique and unapproachable by any other format musical experience.)<br />Hey Sony, don't let this format go the way of the Betacam, ok?  It's a winner, if you'll really support it.<br />Just my $0.02.
6301966562|5.0|Needless to say how sweet and romantic this movie is, just browse thru all the reviews on the net and you know it's a movie that &quot;must see&quot; , and definitely over and over again. I still can recall I first saw this movie when it was released in 1983, later I was able to get a copy of the Laser Disc (lucky me ! b'cus them were soon out of print). Beside the beautiful story line and nice picture setting (San Francisco,the City by the Bay), it's the sountracks througout the movie that makes this movie enjoyable. I watched this movie in LD in number times over all these years and everytime I just love it even better. Unfortunately, Warner Brothers never bother to release this movie in DVD format which offer much superior quality in picture and sound (surround sound, my LD only plays stereo) over VHS, VCD and LD. I urge the studio to re-release Electric Dreams in DVD and they won't be disappointed, based on it's excellent credits and popularity !!
B00005B36I|1.0|This isn't actually a one star album, but I felt the need to rate it that way in an attempt to counteract the rabid and useless five star reviews from Tool fans.<br />This record isn't awful, it's just not very good. The musicianship is above par, but not groundbreaking. The song writing is meandering and slathered in pretense. The lyrics, which are my major issue with the record, are awful and actually work to the detriment of some of the more interesting musical moments on Lateralus, making the record as a whole a less than satisfying musical experience.<br />The overall impression I'm left with from this album is that Maynard James Keenan has read too much of his own press. Gone is the self-effacing tongue-in-cheek attitude of songs like \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" or \\"Prison Sex.\\" Instead, Keenan seems to have re-envisioned himself as some sort of gnostic guru, and the lyrical content has been reduced to the weaker moments of Tools earlier records. The lyric's read like something lovingly scrawled on the back of a disenfranchised highschool freshman's three ring binder.<br />The thing that always set tool apart from the neo metal garbage that has overtaken heavy music was the fact that they didn't buy the angsty constipated pathos so common in the genre. Aenima was an album based on the work of a comedian and poked fun at the bands fans as well as other bands in their genre in songs like Die Eire Von Satan and the aforementioned Hooker with a Penis. They even engaged in a bit of cheeky self mockery by including an organ intermission and an angry answering machine message (Message from Harry Manback) left on one of their machines.<br />Lateralus has none of that sophistication, and instead reveals a band that is caught up in their own P.R. as purveyor's of intelligent metal. What \\"intelligent metal\\" means is evidently dimestore buddhism and pointless wandering song structures.<br />I can understand why a kid who doesn't know much about eastern philosophy or art or poetry might believe that there is something going on in this record. But anyone with any sort of refined sense of aesthetics should probably give this one a miss. The suffocating pretense is nothing short of insulting to anyone who takes the time to think about it. It's disappointing when a band with as much potential for true greatness comes to this sort of dismal and unworthy an end, but it would have been a little bit easier for me if I hadn't wasted fifteen bucks in the process of discovering it.
B00005LB9O|5.0|Travis is one of my all time favorite bands, and this album, one of my all time favorites as well.  Travis' songs, each one, are thoughtful, beautiful and lush.  The melodies are compelling and rich.<br />This whole album shines and is constantly in my CD changer.  If you're looking at Travis for the first time, this is a great album to start with, as well as The Man Who.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B000002AVF|5.0|This is my most favorite CD ever.  Every song is perfected.  Fantasy the first single is one of Mariah's greatest songs.   There is also One Sweet Day, Mariah sings sooo beutiful in this song and Always Be My Baby what an awsome song.  There are also many other great hits.  Her voice is amazing on this CD.  Also Forever another great song of a great CD.  If you dont' have it you should really buy it.  You won't regret it.

B00005QCYC|5.0|Hollywood found a way to make summer blockbusters redeemable again with this series, by creating a movie franchise that not only is a heap of great fun and nail-biting excitement, but also has some MERIT.<br />The plots of all three of the Jurassic Park movies are interchangeable: humans travel to remote island, perform a bunch of highly stupid activities that ... off the dinosaurs, then the dinosaurs make them pay, typically by eating them. All except for the heroes, of course, whom always manage to just escape the dinosaurs vengeance with incredibly improbable good luck. Over and over again. All the stuff that makes for a great popcorn thriller.<br />But who cares if the story lines are silly. It obvious nobody was attempting to upstage '2001:Space Odyssey' for profoundness. These three films are entertaining and rewarding on several levels.  First, little time is wasted in each film before the dinosaurs show up and start wrecking havoc. The special effects are state-of-the-art, and then some. The dinosaurs ACTUALLY SEEM REAL. The makers of these movies obviously consulted with top paleontologists to insure the dinosaurs look and behave as realistically as possible. And the action scenes rank up there with the best of the saturday afternoon adventure thrillers.<br />As far a blockbuster with MERIT goes, think of the countless kids (and probably grown-ups too) who were fascinated enough to inquire more about dinosaurs, whether in school, in books, or watching the Discovery channel. Any movie that is both entertains and inspires the viewer to new ideas and thinking definitely possesses some merit. (And how many other summer blockbusters can you name that provoke ANY intellectual thought afterwards?)<br />As far as the DVD's go, the picture and sound quality is excellent. The Trilogy set is nicely packaged, with a fourth 'bonus' disk containing out-takes and making-of footage.<br />If you're looking for a way to own all three Jurassic Park movies, this Trilogy is a great value. And if you really want to be in dinosaur heaven, get this set and the BBC-TV produced \\"Walking With Dinosaurs\\". lr* Sep 10,2002.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.reat value.

B00004YC2F|5.0|It is remarkable that the most effective romantic piano concerto was not written at the time of Chopin and Liszt, but rather during the first decade of the twentieth century.  The consensus view is that Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto provides the most spectacular showcase in existence for a pianist's talents.<br />This performance by Volodos lives up to its reputation as one of the best performances ever of this masterpiece.  In many ways it surpasses the legendary performances of Horowitz.  The listener cannot help but be enthralled with the perfect control, the apparent ease with which the most difficult passages, containing infinitely many notes, are presented.  In comparison with Horowitz, one never gets the impression that Volodos might be showing off---even the unbelievably rapid filigrees in the middle of the third movement sound appropriate to the artist's conception.<br />If there is one defect to this recording, it is that sometimes the volume of the orchestra seems deafening.  I've heard at least a half dozen performances of this work, by Cliburn, Bolet and others, but none of them is better.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Alt-country's OK Computer? Maybe. Wilco's beautiful alt-country tunes get manipulated into something even more beautiful. Songs fall apart (\\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart,\\" \\"Ashes Of American Flags\\"). Jeff Tweedy sounds passive, yet his lyrics are off-the-wall or heartbreaking. Pianos and strings spiral about (the gorgeous \\"Jesus Etc.\\"). Nothing like this has moved me since, well, maybe Radiohead's opus OK Computer or Kid A. This is the one album of 2002 to own next to The Flaming Lips' Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots. You will not regret this purchase.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|My dentist was showing this film as he did root canal work on me and even at that I was laughing out loud - what more can I say?
B00005JKWJ|4.0|\\"Blade II\\" is one of those sequels that is as good as the first movie, but strangely enough, a lot more illogical.  As Blade (Wesley Snipes), the half-human, half-vampire slayer recovers his presumed-dead mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), he runs afoul of vampires bringing surprising news.  A new kind of vampire (known as Reapers) have appeared on the scene, and basically are killing ANYTHING to control their thirst.  With a pack of vampires (trained to kill Blade), Blade and crew try to contain the spread of the Reapers, but may be betrayed by forces within this teneuous alliance.  Directed by Guillermo Del Toro (\\"Cronos\\", \\"Mimic\\"), and boasting some shocking visual effects (such as the Reapers method of draining blood), this is definitely a good ride for \\"Blade\\" fans.  The DVD includes some funny commentary tracks with director Del Toro and Wesley Snipes, a detailed \\"making-of\\" documentary, a humorous batch of deleted scenes, documentaries on the visual effects, and a lot more.  This one is recommended (but not for the squeamish).
B000002C4J|3.0|Since the beginning of the 1990's, Celine Dion was already on top of the world, scoring a massive amount of hit songs on the radio, and a happily ever after marriage with her manager Rene. Surprisingly, she didn't feel the need to make a album at the time, but the labels suggestion put the album into motion, with another soundtrack song, that soundtrack song, My Heart Will Go On, from Titanic.<br />Her 1997 album, Let's Talk About Love, remains as a classic only just for one song, but there are so many other joyous delights that are featured here, including Tell Him with Barbara Streisand, Immortality, written and perfomed with The Bee Gees, and Let's Talk About Love, written by Bryan Adams.<br />Although many people only bought the album because of My Heart Will Go On, Let's Talk About Love is a decent album, but not the best album by Celine Dion. Perhaps her previous album, Falling Into You, would be a better purchase.
B00003CXRM|5.0|It's MYTHOLOGY....and that's what makes it work so well.  A \\"road\\" picture to end them all....a visually alluring, dreamlike journey that manages to evoke the fantasy feeling of<br />the epic legends and myths of the past, told in a distinctively quirky, off-beat style.  Wonderful music throughout. A one-of-a-kind film experience --totally unique.<br />I haven't read all of the 460 Amazon customer reviews, but has anyone mentioned the obvious homage to the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" in the KKK rally scene?  Both films have their 3 heroes perched above<br />a scene filled with militaristic marching troops (who, in the \\"Wizard\\", were chanting the dreaded \\"Oh-ee-oh\\" tune!), and plotting to resuce someone by disguising themselves and infiltrating the march.<br />It's delightful, hilarious, and thrilling, as is the rest of this film.  But as you watch, remember.....it's a fantasy. a dream.....it's Mythology.
0312958455|4.0|Harry Bosch is on involuntary stress leave after putting his supervisor through a glass window.  Not only is his career in doubt, his house has been red-tagged after an earthquake and is slated for destruction.  Sylvia Moore, Harry's one-time squeeze, has run off to Venice, presumably never to return.  And the coyote that used to roam the canyon behind Harry's house hasn't been seen since the earthquake.<br />In this outing Harry is both more reckless and more human than we've ever seen him.  We see more of Harry's early past than we've ever seen before.  We learn a little more about Marjorie, the mother who was both prostitute and murder victim.  Marjorie remains a rather shadowy figure, yet Connelly lets us see tough-guy Harry's love for her and makes us think we'd have loved her, too, for all her faults.  <br />The plot is Connelly's usual stew of bad doings in high places, and, as in most of the Bosch books, it's pleasurable but secondary to the characters.  Harry is more alone, and more vulnerable, than in the previous books, and his single-mindedness will lead to tragedy--Harry won't be this reckless again.  Even the dread deputy chief, Irvin S. Irving, will continue his slow evolution toward being almost human.  And, as in all the Bosch books, Hollywood itself is almost a character, from the cheesy corner where Marjorie's body was dumped to the absurdly rococco mansions of the rich and powerful.<br />Two words of caution.  While Harry is as finely drawn a character as you'll ever find in detective fiction, and other male characters, such as Irvin S. Irving, are vivid if sometimes simple, Connelly has yet to create and sustain a believable female character.  Sylvia Moore, introduced in \\"The Black Ice,\\" seemed promising, a wise, somewhat weary cop widow and school teacher aware of Harry's darker corners.  Indeed, at the end of \\"The Concrete Blonde,\\" she and Harry seemed committed to the affair.  Yet by the beginning of \\"The Last Coyote,\\" she has disappeared--toVenice, of all places!  on a teacher's salary?--with no explanation.  Harry's grief is understandable, but it seems unfair to a reader to have a character built up over two previous books to behave in such a flighty fashion with no warning.  You'd think that a woman who'd have sex in her newly-deceased husband's bed with a man she'd just met--even if that man is Harry--would be hardy enough to live with Harry's warts.  Sylvia's disappearance is a disappointment.<br />The other word of caution deals with the lady offered as a love interest in this outing.  She is even less believable than either Eleanor Wish or Sylvia Moore, and the romantic interlude here is essentially pointless.  It adds nothing to the plot and little to our understanding of Harry--the one revealing moment with \\"Jazz\\" is really just a continuation of a revelation begun in Harry's mandatory counseling sessions, and it could as easily have been handled in that fashion.  Unfortunately, the presence of this female leads to an ending which seems at odds with the rest of the book, and which will, in the next Bosch novel, be completely ignored.  So the whole episode could have been removed from the book without injuring either the plot or the character development.  Strange that the most compelling female character Connelly has developed in this series is the dead Marjorie, who never speaks a word and lives only fitfully in Harry's memory.<br />Those two caveats aside, this will please anyone who likes a good  detective story or anyone who loves Raymond Chandler's atmospherics.  Connelly's LA is never as dark or as twisted as James Ellroy's town, but it has plenty of shadowy corners and shadowy doings, and a fitting guardian in its lone-wolf lover, Harry Bosch.
B00000IMCW|5.0|\\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is (and always will be) the best horror movie ever made. Not only does it have great special effects but also a great plot. The idea that the world being taken over by the living dead is not only an interesting concept but also terrifying which adds to the horror of the movie. <BR>  George A. Romero is (for lack of a better word) a genius. I don't think anybody other than Romero could have come up with an idea so frightning In conclusion I must say that \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is a must have movie for anyone who even remotly likes horror. Lucio's \\"Zombie\\" I wouldn't waste your money on renting.
B00006G8G1|4.0|It has almost become a trend. Ever since the age of modernization has dawned on us, having 20 cameras per live concert is almost inevitable. As much as I enjoy the 20 different camera angles, one cannot stand it switching between them every 2 seconds ! Review all tapes of concerts of old, e.g. Raising Hell by Iron Maiden and you'll see what I mean. The camera knows where to stay, when to stay, when needed. Minus the direction, this DVD comes off pretty darn exciting !<br />Where should I start ? Oh yes, the Wickerman ! very few artist have the manhood to begin a show with songs from their new album. Only Iron Maiden (and Ozzy) have I seen do that ! Things are frantic, guitars are screaming, bass is thumping, drums are banging. Bruce Dickinson sounds almost as if he was recording Number of the Beast all over again. The glamour, the fortune, then pain, all included in this very tight, energetic performance. How does one make room for 3 guitarist ? who plays what solo ? Watch this to find out ! It's hard to keep 3 lead guitarist happy, but Maiden has found a way to split the workload evenly so that all 3 are cheerily playing their parts. The set list is awesome ! No complaints about that.<br />  The second disc is basically a bunch of spontaneous interviews with the band members on their day off. It is not a bad account of what they do, and it is refreshing to see Maiden as \\"normal\\" folk. The dvd further contains a photo gallery with commentary for those die-hard Maiden fans who don't mind flipping through one-by-one.<br />  In short, a handy DVD to have around, but hard to watch 2 hours all over again. You would also need Surround Sound, if not Janick Gers' guitar will be missing for sure, leaving empty gaps during solos and intros. This would have been five stars if not for the direction. The second disc also does not really seem like a necessity, but like I said, it is a refreshing look at Maiden. Unfortunately, that second disc does bump the price up a little. However, all-in-all, superb performance by the band, showing that they still got it after 30 years of heavy metal. Maiden has truly set a mark for the rest to follow. Let us hope Motley Crue do no try to follow that though...

B000060K4O|5.0|\\"Ghostbusters\\" is one of the best 80's movies ever made! The DVD is great with special features including the original featurette and trailers and the 1999 star featurette. The movie deals with three scientists (Bill Murray/Dan Aykroyd/Harold Ramis) who got kicked out of university and decided to set up the shop in an old firehouse to become Ghostbusters trapping ghosts, spirits, haunts, and poltergeists for money. \\"Ghostbusters\\" is a movie for you to own on DVD, if you have a DVD player. I think you will not be disappointed.
B000002J1O|5.0|I first discovered this album as a 10-year old in 1980, it was lying on top of my parents' wardrobe in the midst of discarded jubilee mementoes, Christmas decorations and prophylactics. Having decided to give it a spin on my ancient record player (complete with &quot;stacking arm&quot;) I was from that moment transformed, I would shut myself away in my bedroom and insist on playing the full album at least twice through after which I felt spritually &quot;cleansed&quot;. The stark exposed introduction to &quot;Dancing with Moonlit Knight&quot; has a medieval quality and is quintessentially English in tone as is the whole song with its reference to &quot;Green Shield stamps&quot; and Wimpey the construction firm, whilst the restatement of the song's melodic theme during &quot;Aisle of Plenty&quot; is absolute genius as are the cariactures contained within &quot;Battle&quot; which almost reads like &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Definitely the band's highlight of their career, &quot;Lamb&quot; comes close but suffers from a lack of editing whereas this album is perfectly executed in terms of content, length and performance. And it still affects me much the way that it did in 1980....
B000002IWQ|2.0|Unbeliavable that a reviewer below could think that the song &quot;NOBODY´S HERO&quot; may have been written for the heroes of September 11th,2001, when this album was released in 1993... Incredible...<br />As for COUNTERPARTS, it´s plain dumb, as most of Rush´s work of the nineties. The production is utterly commecial, no wonder they brought in producer Peter Collins to do it... A shame.<br />I really do not like this album, and put it in the same league of the dreadful HOLD YOUR FIRE, in the &quot;fireless&quot; category.
0316666343|1.0|Although summer brings on &quot;light reading&quot; madness, and often some real pleasure to even the most serious readers (of which I am one), those lazy hours in the sun are far better spent on a snooze than in reading this feather of a book.  The idea is dopey, the telling of the story clumsy, and the plot thoroughly unbelievable.  I finished it for a book discussion group, but wished that I hadn't.  It is one thing to present an adolescent's view of the world and the afterlife for what it is, quite another to present it as a serious framework for a story about a family's tragedy.  There are much better books being published today - thank heaven!
0780624890|5.0|When watching Blade the first thing you have to keep in mind is that it is primarily an action movie. It's not in the horror genre, and really isn't trying too hard to be a 'vampire movie.' It's an action movie where the bad guys happen to be vampires. That said, it is a great movie. Sure Wesley Snipes has acted better, but this is an action movie, not a drama. There are some great fight scenes (and I think Snipes was in on the fight choreography). Stephen Dorff is just plain evil in this movie (good job--really believable). It has a crips look to it and the techno soundtrack moves it all along. It's really a good movie.<br />The dvd is loaded with extras. There's a commentary track with Wesley Snipes, David Goyer (writer), Theo Van De Sande (dir of photography), Peter Frankfurt (producer), Kirk Petruccelli (production designer) and Stephen Dorff. And these guys give a great commentary. It's one of the better I've heard. There is also an isolated scroe with commentary by composer Mark Isham. It's almost worthless. Half the time he's talking over the music, or we're missing out on source music (music Isham didn't score and came from radios and such). It's choppy and disjointed. It would have been better to have a 15-20 minute interview with Isham and then an isolated score, with no commentary, and including all source music. As it is, it's tough to hear how important the music is to the film. This isolated score track actually makes it seem like Isham's score was unimportant. Also on the dvd are biography/filmography of cast and crew, theatrical trailer, sketches and prodcution designs. There's also the \\"House of Erebus\\" which gives the 'history' of each of the twelve tribes in the vampire ruling council. It's interesting, though not essential to the film--just a nice extra. There are four featurettes. 1) La Magra - which has the original ending and discusses the stories evolution. 2) Designing Blade 3) The Origins of Blade - which discusses comics and especially dark comics (including an interview with Stan Lee) 4) The Blood Tide - which is a look at vampire mythology and in literature. That one is a really good featurette, especially if you are interested in vampire mythology. <br />You can't go wrong here. It's a great vampire movie. It's a great action movie. And it's a great dvd.
B000000HZT|5.0|I don't see how anyone could be critical of the vocalist, Kim Beacon. Everything about this album is wonderful. It really covers the whole Tony Banks sound. I guess the record sounds somewhere between, \\"Trespass\\" and \\"Duke\\", but with it's own unique sound. If you like anything about GENESIS, get yourself a copy of this CD. If ever there were a \\"deserted island disc\\", this is one...
B00005YW4H|4.0|I think that this CD was an extremely good purchase. I have listened to it several times, and never seem to tire of it. I don't believe that she is overrated, as others suggest, because I feel that she has a truly beautiful and unique voice. I particularly love the smoky sweetness she imparts in &quot;Got to See You Again,&quot; and the pleasant mellowness of the title track. The only reason I didn't rate it with 5 stars is because I still would buy Diana Krall (in my opinion, the most amazing jazz singer) before Norah Jones if given a choice, and not every song on her CD appeals to me (I do forward through one or two tracks), whereas on Diana's, I do not. But all in all, it's a worthy CD of your attention and will provide you hours of listening pleasure. I'm sure we'll be hearing much more from her in the years to come.
B000002JSH|5.0|Bad Co.'s second album is as good as the first. \\"Good Lovin' Gone Bad\\" could be about any relationship, romantic or otherwise, on the rocks, \\"Deal With The Preacher\\" and \\"Wild Fire Woman\\" express pure lust, and \\"Shooting Star\\" warns against overindulgence, while \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\" shows feeling of genuine devotion. This is an album of incredible intensity from the most straightforward English rockers of the 70s.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Before The Fellowship of the Ring, I never paid much attention to Howard Shore, but after I heard his excellent score, I started to get more music composed by him.  The music revolves around four basic themes: The theme for Isengard, the theme for the Black Riders, the theme for the Fellowship, and the theme for Hobbits.  The range of music is extremely wide.  The Black Rider theme is a very dark, gothic theme, while the Hobbit theme is very light and playful reminiscent of an old countryside folktune.  The theme for Isengard is very strident percussion and brass with emphasize the evil building under Orthanc.  The Fellowship theme is a very bold theme, only heard in its full glory 2 times on the soundtrack on tracks 11 and 13.  The hints of most of these themes play in almost all the tracks of the film, however all of these tracks stand alone.  For exapmle Amon Hen track 16 is one of my favorite tracks, because it provides a visual picture of what is happenning on the movie screen.  The cd is over 70 minutes long, and I wish it could be longer simply because the music is so enjoyable.  Shore's score to this epic film belongs on the top ten score's of all time and it truly deserved the Academy Award that it won.
B00005K3NR|4.0|'Carrie' has always been my favourite Stephen King novel, i have read it numerous times. I was a little annoyed that Brian De Palma saw fit to deviate from the book as much as he did. But, back then when films were based on novels, the two always looked vastly different.<BR>In this movie, the main character is a girl named Carrie White. She is unpopular largely due to the fact that the whole town thinks she and her mother are freaks. In all truthfulness, her mother is deeply religious as well as psychotic. Carrie is in a constant struggle between the old world and the new world (ie. the need to please her mother for fear of enraging her, and the need for acceptance by her classmates). Carrie wants to live like her classmates, but the slightest sign of recalcitrance sees her locked in tiny closet to 'pray for forgiveness'.<BR>But what nobody knows is that Carrie is telekinetic, meaning she has the ability to move objects by simple thought.<BR>One day at school, Carrie gets her first period in the shower at school. Her classmates laugh at her and throw pads and tampons, not thinking that she has no idea of what's going on. When she is sent home early the school principal keeps getting her name wrong, proving just how unimportant she really is to others. One of the girls in the class Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels badly about the prank and asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom to make it up to her. But there is another girl, Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen), who is hellbent on ruining Carrie. And the best chance to do that is at the senior prom, so she plots with her boyfriend (John Travolta) to humiliate Carrie in a bizarre, but very ugly way.<BR>This was a fair adaption, but I feel that there was a lot of excellent material that should have been used. Concepts such as the old world versus the new world, the struggle that all teenagers face of wanting to make their parents happy but wanting to be 'cool' to their classmates. The metaphor of blood, God versus Satan,and the destruction of the world (ie. Armageddon).<BR>Brian De Palma was also an Alfred Hitchcock alumni, he changed the name of the school from Ewen High School to Bates High School (as in Norman Bates).
B00005OWIU|3.0|I am not a fan of Harry Potter, never read the books, never saw the movie, but I am a John Williams fan so I bought the soundtrack.  The music is standard John Williams.  A fine main theme and several other supporting themes.  Williams' Hogwarts theme captures the essence of magic in this score.  However, many of the supporting themes are seem to be derived from many of Williams' other scores including Superman and Empire Strikes Back.  Does this make Harry Potter any less enjoyable? No it doesn't.  The music is still Williams' and therefore exceptional.  Those looking for more original Williams music may be disappointed however.  As a I wrote before standard Williams score.
0671042858|2.0|Story is about a 9 year old child who is lost in a forest. The story is very monotonic and did not excited me. I only liked the last chapter and after reading that one i got near to cry. All the story passes in a forest and contains some references to her past experiences. She is a little shysophrenic becouse most of the time she &quot;saws&quot; Tom Gordon (also she know he is not there :)).<br />Book may be can be used for a reference book: &quot;How to survive in a forest&quot; bot not for getting excited.<br />Kings little &quot;excited&quot; tellings did not made me feel so. It may be a great book but did not gave me what i had waited for. May be was not my style.

The author's style is easy to understand and the recommended strategy has been working for me.  Read: THE SHORT BOOK ON OPTIONS
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie was enjoyable for the whole family.  We absolutely loved all of the characters.  I recommend this movie to EVERYONE!
B000066C87|5.0|This film is a bitter pill examining class and wealth, wrapped in an entertaining, tasty movie that makes it easier to swallow.  The disparity between the very wealthy and the poor is evident in every frame, especially when the two classes must relate to one another.  Observe how deferential are those who actually work for a living, toward their capitalist master who can choose to give or withhold &quot;his&quot; money according to his whim.  The way John Hammond just waltzes into Dr. Grant's and Dr. Ellie Satler's trailer and opens their champagne never fails to infuriate me.  I weep when the two paleontologists, after a show of defiance, wilt into obsequious obedience when Hammond dangles money in front of them.<br />Not to say that this movie is dull or preachy about its anti-capitalist values.  The dinosaurs are pretty cool.  Plus they obviously represent the lowest levels of society, who will one day throw off their manipulating masters, rise in rebellion, and eat lawyers right off their outhouse seats.  I don't know which I enjoy more, the fight between the classes or the fight between the velociraptors and the T-rex.  I do know that seeing Maggie Smith (starring as Dr. Ellie Satler) in tight shorts and t-shirt is a treat worth waiting 50 million years for!

B0000025D0|5.0|Bruce Springsteen had the unenviable task of following up 'Born To Run,' considered by many the greatest rock and roll record of all time. As if that basic pressure wasn't enough he also found himself in a huge legal battle with his management that had him siphoning hit songs off to other artists while he waited for the dust to settle. It was three years between 'Born To Run' and 'Darkness' and it's obvious the songwriter of 'Darkness' is a touch more world-wise than the one who wrote 'Born To Run.' The E Street Band, as expected, proves completely up to the task of bringing Bruce's new music to life.<br />But this record is astonishing. From the opening pounding of the legendary 'Badlands' it's obvious that not only did Bruce keep his momentum from 'Born To Run,' he had clearly progressed as a songwriter to levels American rock hadn't seen before, and still haven't seen.<br />As said earlier, this is a dirtier record than 'Born To Run.' The dreamers are still there, but they can see the shadows the sunlight casts. A song like 'Something in the Night' is haunting and distant. The title track is the same way. 'Badlands' and 'Promised Land' are as big and bawdy as Bruce has ever been. We know Bruce has been up and down but when he exclaims 'it ain't a sin to be glad you're alive' it's all we need to hear.<br />As usual, Bruce can tell a love story and describe that perfect date. 'Prove It All Night' and 'Candy's Room' deliver the love. Meanwhile, 'Racing In the Street', takes us down an emotional and musical road that is as complete as opera, and far more moving.<br />This is not a down album. It's the opposite. It's an inspiration. It points out the darkness, absolutely, but then points us to the top of the hill where the sun is always shining ... in the promised land.<br />As good a rock and roll record as there ever has been.
B00006FXB6|5.0|What can be said that hasn't been said already? This is definitely one of the best albums for 2002. It's that good. The Queens of the Stone Age have raised the bar yet again for how music should sound like. In a society that's bombarded by cute boy bands, fluffy pop princesses, pop punk posers, and \\"rock\\" bands, it's certainly a relief to see that good music is still alive and ready to kick... <br />\\"Songs for the Deaf\\" is how QOTSA thinks the radio should be, hence the radio DJs in the musical interludes. It's hard to disagree with them. Each song is very different from each other and from past offerings from the band. It opens with \\"...Millionaire\\", which makes for an explosive introduction that showcases Nick Oliveri's vocal chops. Josh Homme's sweet crooning on \\"No One Knows\\", \\"Do It Again\\", etc. is an excellent change of pace compared to Nick's. Mark Lanegan's vocals on \\"Hangin' Tree\\" and \\"God Is Radio\\" is... breath-taking. Having songs with different lead vocalists is something that not every band is able to do, but QOTSA does and does very well. All of these vocals are presented against a backdrop of rifftastic jazz chords from Josh, hard basslines from Nick, and hard rockin' beats from drum god, Dave Grohl. These are just the main instruments. QOTSA enveloped many of the songs with all sorts of instruments not usually found on a rock album... flutes, some sort of jug-thing, assorted string and percussion instruments. All of which makes this possibly a classic rock album. This sort of praise is thrown around casually nowadays, but holds true with \\"Songs for the Deaf\\".<br />This CD is an awesome treat. The music can rev the listener to go out and do something or just chill out on the sofa. Plus, it comes with a free DVD. Is there really a reason to not buy this? If you don't buy it, you're surely missing out.
B00000255F|5.0|It's hard for an album to live up to expectations, especially 20-some years after release.  Rock music tends to date itself, to become nostalgic and lose its vibrancy. But 'Born To Run' didn't follow any trends then and it still doesn't today.<br />The perfect rock record. The hits are classic rock staples and the lost songs are better than the hits. This album is magic. It can't be defined, predicted or stopped. These songs sound so fresh today they must have been downright alien at the time of their release. Springsteen and producer Phil Spector create their 'wall of sound' that amplifies that flawless layering of The E Street Band and brings forth the messages of love and magic in these songs.<br />The songs go without saying: 'Thunder Road,' 'Born To Run,' 'Tenth Avenue Freeze Out.' A song like 'Night' is overlooked only because everything else was so noticed there simply wasn't time to point it out. In 'Jungleland' Springsteen created rock's one song opus, as fine a popular musical composition as there's ever been. For ten exhausted minutes Bruce takes us up highs and lows in a town most of us have never visited but we can see ourselves walking down those streets with him. It's indescribable, exhausting, too loud and too long but once its over you have to start it over, at least to hear 'Thunder Road' again, then 'Tenth Avenue.'<br />'Born To Run' is the ultimate teenage rock and roll album. Later teen angst'ers don't get it. It's not about anger, it's not about desperation. It's about dreams and spirits and kisses on summer afternoons.<br />It's about Bruce Springsteen. And this is the album that proved that. It still does today. An album like this hadn't come before and won't come again. It transcends itself, its era and its performers.
0316666343|2.0|...Just a lot of pushing and shoving and you still come out with very little at the end. <br />This book leaps out of the gate at the beginning. It starts strong, grabbing you by the collar and giving you a good shake. The tale opens with the aftermath of a young girls rape and murder. The dead girl looks down from heaven, watching her family face the sorrow and confusion, for her murder has not been confirmed, no body has been found, and she has been labled as missing. <br />Alice Sebold did an excellent job with character development. The people in this story seem quite real and she truly managed to capture their grief quite accurately. <br />However, as promising as this book seems at the beginning, don't be fooled. It is only starting a slow, downward spiral. Throughout the book, many loose ends are left untied, as if the author had made specific plans for where the story should go, and then thought, \\"Nah.\\" This novel did manage to make me quite angry, not so much for the senseless murder, but for the purely wasted potential. Reading this book, I knew it could have been something great. The options for a truly riveting and compelling story were there, but the author didn't use any of them. <br />As I neared the end of the book, I literally said out loud, \\"Please! Don't bail on the ending! You have to give me SOMETHING remotely interesting for Pete's sake!\\" <br />Wow, was I ever disappointed. It was as if the author thought her work was done, just for coming up with the idea of having a dead girl as the narrator. Then, once she felt that she had givin the story enough length to call it a novel, she just pulled a simple, cookie-cutter ending out of the air and slapped it on there, so she could call it quits. <br />The hype of this book writes a huge cheque that the story can't cash. If you are looking for something GOOD to read, with a great story, in-depth characters, and something that delivers, then skip this book. Instead, check out \\"White Oleander,\\" by JanetFitch, or \\"I Know This Much Is True,\\" by Wally Lamb.
0316666343|1.0|Even the dullest teen would people heaven with more imagination than Susie. I picked up this book hoping it would be at least as good as her husband's recent novel, Carter Beats the Devil which was imaginative, and in places quite deft.<br />When she's not forcing the language and imagery, Alice Sebold has got the characters acting on unexplained impulses which baffle and perturb the reader. It feels like it was written in a seminar course and that too many ideas were developed by the group, and then dropped by the writer who couldn't commit. The author's handling of dialogue was particularly clumsy.By the time Susie returns to Earth for a tryst with her sweetie the reader is incredulous at how lame the ending is shaping up to be. Save yourself the time and money and wait until the movie comes out. It will be a big hit with teenagers everywhere.
B000068QY7|4.0|which is at least twice as good as anything else we're getting these days.  So what if they're 'nicking' from The Beatles?  As Ringo Starr once said, &quot;All rock 'n roll is nicking from someone else.&quot;  The album starts off with the same feel as &quot;(What's the Story?)Morninglory?&quot;, so in that respect they're ripping off from themselves (which John Fogarty once got SUED for!  The music business is a very strange business indeed).  A couple of songs are weak, only &quot;Songbird&quot; really annoys me (if they were going to write a song that shallow and simple, the least they could've done was thrown in a bridge).  But the bulk of the album is extremely good, which will make Liam even more obnoxious, bless his irritating little heart.
038533558X|2.0|I've loved all of Coben's other novels, but this was a disappointment.  I thought the characters were implausible and the plot strained.  My book club picked this for their summer beach read and we split about 50/50 over this title.
B00005JKNF|4.0|Inside \\"Gosford Park\\", which is a good movie, is a great movie that never quite gets out. It can be taken as a standard parlor murder mystery or as a study in class warfare, but it comes up a tad short on each count. The movie opens on an appropriately dank and gloomy twilight in the English countryside, at a manor house which is the scene of a weekend party during which milord will turn up most foully murdered. Sound familiar? It's been done before, a dozen and more times; and of course we learn during the subsequent unraveling of the mystery that the old coot richly deserved what he got. There is some delicious interacting between upstairs and downstairs; it's hard to tell who are more snobbish, the upper-class guests or their servants belowstairs (the servants have their own hierarchy which is as rigid, if not more so, than they entire British class system), and at the film's end, we finally find out whodunit. But despite some really marvelous performances by Maggie Smith as the snooty countess (she's priceless lounging in her boudoir with those cucumber slices over her eyes), Helen Mirren as the head servant with a skeleton in her closet, Alan Bates as the butler (no, he didn't do it), and Kristen Scott-Thomas as the rich man's wife, we're somehow left with a feeling that this film is lacking something. The ending seems curiously flat. One comes away from watching the movie with a feeling of \\"Is this all?\\"<br />There is a serious problem with the DVD which bears mentioning. The sound quality is terrible. At first I assumed it was me, since I am hearing-impaired; but even with the volume on my TV jacked to the max, it sounded poor. After checking the sound on a few other DVDs, I realized it wasn't me or my TV; the problem was the sound engineering on this DVD. However, the closed captions are excellent and let me follow the script with no trouble.<br />Overall, \\"Gosford Park\\" is an enjoyable film. There's just this realization that great sets, great costumes, and great performances don't add up to a great movie. It's a good movie, but one that could have been better.nd great performances don't add up to a great movie. It's a good movie, but one that could have been better.
6302636779|4.0|Based on a true story, \\"The Nun's Story\\" is basically a movie about a young woman (Hepburn, as Sister Luke) who struggles with her decision to become a nun. The movie is set in the years prior to and during WWII, and it was made in 1959. Most of the movie takes place in Belgium, but about a fifth of the movie is set in the Belgian Congo (later Zaire, now Congo again), where Sister Luke is sent to work as a nurse in a hospital -- her desired assignment all along, but one that she had to wait for. There she works with a brillant but difficult doctor (Peter Finch) who has his own demons to battle.  Their strained relationship is the emotional crux of the story.<br />It is this portion of the movie that may be of interest to Africanists. The scenes set in Congo were filmed there, evidently in Kisangani. There is something of a documentary quality to much of this part of the film: Congolese people at work and play, life around a missionary hospital, colonial officials and uniformed native soldiers, colonial architecture, etc. It is really a sort of window on the past, and while the movie is not about the Belgian Congo, it does give a good idea of what part of the Belgian Congo looked like, and what life was like for the urban inhabitants in the Belgian Congo.  As far as I know, this is the only movie you are likely to find in your local video store that has anything like that.  Recommended for anyone interested in African history; and the part about the nun and the ex-pat doctor makes a pretty good movie.
B00005B1EX|5.0|a scintillating, concept-pulverizing delight for the senses.<br />Halford and company deliver the goods in this comprehensively explosive offering, taking the listener on a musical tour de force and showing the world how it's done.<br />Halford has been at this game long enough to take his inherent talent to extremes, elevating metal to high art and generating one of the more entertaining live performances of this century.<br />Bravo!
B00003W8NM|5.0|When Fight Club was released in 1999, it was panned by many, if not most, movie critics who dismissed it as no more than a twisted waste of film.  What wasn't expected however, is how Fight Club has become a modern day cult classic that no one ever saw coming.  I won't waste time with the storyline, you can read about it in the Amazon review, but what I will say is that director David Fincher has come quite a long way since his directorial debut helming the dreadful Alien 3, the way he seamlessly infuses CGI with the film is amazing.  Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter give knockout performances.  Norton's narration throughout the entire movie is unexpectedly hilarious at some parts and chilling at others.  While yes, the film is quite brutal, but it is nowhere as violent as perceived to be, and I love the package design (the fact that negative reviews of the film are featured in the booklet is genius), and the commentaries and deleted scenes are worth owning the movie alone.  All in all, Fight Club is a stunner of a movie that will keep you wanting more long after the credits end.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|It doesn't happen very often that a sequel turns out to be better than the original. But, this is just one of those cases. If you loved the first one (which many of you do), you're guaranteed to like this one. Those new creatures were strange, but it all somewhat made sense in the end.<br />Of course every movie has it's problems. I found that story wise, it could have been a bit better. But then again it's only an entertaining horror/action flick. One major problem was the computer generated fight that took place in front of that display of lights. That was just plain ridiculous.<br />All in all, this movie got what it deserved on DVD, a great DTS track, and a second disc with a fair amount of extras that would please any fan of the franchise.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is definately one of the best Mini Series events ever to grace the TV screen. There are a lot of elements, characters and action that everyone would enjoy. The show is very reminiscent to Saving Private Ryan, and this is a good thing. I didn't like the story as much in Ryan as I did here, I mainly loved how the show was captured. The grittiness really helps in making it seem more realistic and interesting. I myself am really looking forward to this release, everyone has to view this. I have to thank HBO, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg for making such a great collaboration on such a great series.
0316666343|3.0|Alice Sebold chose an unusual perspective from which to tell Susie Salmon's (like the fish) horrifying tale.  Perhaps the story makes such an impact because it comes on a spate of other similar stories of unsuspecting children who have recently been lured or abducted and who have been subsequently robbed of many, if not all, of the developmental life stages Susie so poignantly desires for herself.<br />Susie is viewing her portion of the earth from her own piece of heaven.  It seems that heaven is very much a designer place, a creation of each decedent's own creation.  There is no religious vantagepoint, no deity in residence.  The deceased can pretty much come and go as they please, appear or almost appear to family members and friends and observe life as they left it.<br />Holly for example, one of heaven's inhabitants, still loves to assist people in her new heavenly home because on earth she was a social worker.  There seems to be some unspoken transition from life on earth to getting settled in eternity.  Susie has not yet found her niche, though, because she is still very much pre-occupied with the devastation caused by her own disappearance.<br />The reader knows, step-by-step, what occurred and who the perpetrator was but her remaining family members are suffering because of what they don't know, other than the fact that the amount of blood found would indicate that Susie is dead and a body part was unearthed by a neighborhood dog.<br />Sebold's description of Susie's abduction is chilling, perhaps because she was the victim of a brutal crime herself.  Interestingly, she also seems to have a knack for describing how lives are subsequently changed, how some survivors become stronger, how others suffer to the point of illness and how still others are resentful of the unspoken ghost that pervades family life in the ensuing years.<br />Though very clever, the story at times becomes extremely fanciful and syrupy as Susie keeps wondering what her romantic life would have been like.  It was abruptly ended right after she had experienced her first kiss.  Her post mortem seduction of the now grown and college educated student who had given her the first kiss is just one of those \\"far out\\" moments!<br />Susie has also had an unexpected impact upon another earthling, Ruth, one of the proverbial unpopular high school girls to be found in most adolescent settings.  Susie's spirit literally bumped into Ruth as it was escaping her body following the abduction, rape and murder.  Since that time Ruth has sensed the spirit world and often can tell what murder or brutality happened in any given area in which she passes.<br />Overall, even with the New Age touches, the story is well told and often humorous amongst the agonizing pain, suffering and disruption experienced by the Salmon family.

B00006G8G1|5.0|I love the camera and editing work on this DVD.  It is top notch.  Headaches?  I don't think so.  It is a blast to watch.  The sound quality could not be better.  True, in regular stereo mode if you do not have your DVD player set up correctly the volume will rise and fall but that is because the disc is meant to be played on 5.1 systems or something.  This happened to me at first but I now have my DVD player set up correctly and it sounds phenomenal.  One of my favorite concert DVDs.  I love the triple guitar attack.  The duel solo from Adrian and Janick in The Trooper is very cool.  I can't wait to get a 5.1 system and listen to this thing the way it was meant to be heard!
B00000F2M4|4.0|i saw this movie when it came out in 1985 - and i've seen it many times since then. i highly recommend this movie for anybody who plays music or dreams of it. it is an amazing look a the way a professional band works. <br />sting is the center focus, and can be a bit pretentious at times, but a huge amount of footage is given to the other members of the band - kenny kirland, daryl jones, omar hakim - all of whom are amazing players at the top of their game. their interaction during rehearsals and on stage is pretty cool.
B00006G8G4|1.0|Granted the first say 15 minutes of this movie was ok, but the rest has led me to label this movie one of the biggest disapointments and over praised movies ever.  As a casual fan of spiderman I thought the visual effects seemed childish to the mastery of the visual art as presented in Star wars attack of the clones. Further the love story was even worse.  The best movie of 2002 was not Spider Man. That honor i would humbly give to Atack of the clones or the Oedopian Minority Report.
079073463X|5.0|There is always a risk of combining modern music with a historical setting where such music would not be appropriate -- this of &quot;A Knight's Tale&quot; as an example of this.  But &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; uses modern music to underscore the intensity of the scenes not to distract from it or to entice the characters.  The three main starts do excellent jobs both on their own and in the characters' interactions.  I'm used to seeing Rutger Hauer in &quot;B&quot; grade films so this was a pleasant surprise.  Broderick is good in almost any role he takes and Michelle Pfeiffer's work mays you feel for her character's tragedy as well as see her strengths.  I probably watch this VHS version at least once a year.
B00005JA2B|5.0|Arguably, Kansas is to America, what bands like Yes, Genesis, E.L.P., Queen, The Moody Blues and Jethro Tull are to England--progressive rock with mystical and patriotic tendencies. The other resemblance to these bands is their constant hybridization of musical styles. But, make no mistake--they are original, not clones of the above English counterparts. Throughout the early part of Kansas' career (i.e. the 1970's), Kansas mixed the worlds of hard rock with blues, classical, jazz, country and more. This can be heard throughout their classic years--which brings us to _Leftoverture_.<br />_Leftoverture_ deserves all the recognition and praise it gets. It's a solidly crafted progressive rock album that happens to be catchy, while containing an amalgamation of musical styles, and all along, still manages to save room for extended instrumental jams. Carry On Wayward Son is the big hit of the album--the greatness does not end there. The Wall is an anthemic rocker. What's On My Mind combines funkiness and hard rock. Miracles Out Of Nowhere is mystical and dramatic progressive hard rock at it's finest. Melodic vocal harmonies can be found here as well. Opus Insert features vocal harmonies reminiscent of CCR and Queen. Questions Of My Childhood features some country-esque influences. Cheyenne Anthem starts off with some nice acoustic guitar passages, then segues into a quirky romp/waltz. Magnum Opus ends this gem perfectly as mostly quirky, virtuosic instrumental insanity.<br />Kansas is arguably the most _accessible_ progressive rock band. If you want melodic, dramatic and mystical music, armed with diversity and touches of ambiguity and accessiblity, check Kansas--and this album out.<br />5 stars? Asolutely!
B000066NW0|4.0|I bought this album because I know someone who works for Avril and he said I should check it out. I wasn't too sure at the beginning - I've never been a big fan of mindless hooks and 'surfer songs' (ska8er boi embodies both of these) but as the cd went on I discovered that her lyrics are meaningful with some of the melodies and vocals really powerful. You know what? Let me put it like this: Lavigne starts the album like Pink, and rounds it up like Michelle Branch. So really it depends on what kind of music you're into - if you want hard riffs and bouncy vocals then buy it for the beginning. If you're looking for guitar driven power teenage-angst songs, then get it for the end. If you don't like any of that? Hey, check out Daphne and Celeste.
B00006FXB6|5.0|For the longest time I refused to buy any new music. Last year I caught the tale end of Monster in the Parasol on MTV2 and ran out and bought their Rated R album. I must have listened to it more than 50 times and enjoyed it each time. So of course I ran out and bought this new album Songs for the Deaf the first day it was available and I was not disappointed. As good as Rated R was, this album is a step up for them in musical genius. Some songs rock, some songs groove, and some belong in a category all their own. The variation never leaves you fumbling for another CD to pop in the player. The album would be wasted on the deaf.

B000068PQ7|2.0|Sorry to say, but I must respectfully disagree with all of the 5-star reviews above. Quite often, revisiting an old album can make you cringe because of some overblown production that seemed like a really good idea at the time. Unfortunately, in the case of \\"White Light,\\" the opposite is true; the spare style can't help but expose some real flaws, namely the pedestrian bass lines and Gene's less than stellar vocals. Plus, some of the VERY strange lyrics make you wonder what dear Gene was on; consider, \\"finding out that facts were older, and that life forms are insane\\" from the opening track. Maybe the most annoying aspect of the CD though are the extended harmonica solos -- the last refuge of the truly uninspired.     \\"With Tomorrow\\" and \\"Spanish Guitar\\" are standouts, and in hindsight, \\"1975\\" sounds as if it could have come off of George Harrison's wonderful \\"All Things Must Pass.\\" However, compared with Clark's best -- \\"The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard and Clark\\" -- this album sounds tired.

But with the weight of such episodes as The Best of Both Worlds Part II, one might hear a collective gasp from Trekkers who find that there's actually someone who enjoyed another episode more than the gripping conclusion to Season Three's nail-biting cliffhanger.<br />I love The Drumhead - it is my favorite episode of this season. An excellent courtroon drama directed by Jonathan Frakes with a style reminescent of Stanley Kramer's &quot;Judgement At Nuremberg&quot; and penned by veteran series writer Jeri Taylor, The Drumhead is an intelligent and often thought-provoking exercise in the dramatic.<br />After an explosion aboard the Federation flagship Enterprise, a Klingon exchange officer is found guilty of spying on behalf of the enemy, the Romulan Empire. Once cleared of being involved with the explosion, Admiral Satie (Jean Simmons) begins a witch hunt for a saboteur and finds him in crewman Simon Tarses (Spencer Garrett) on the grounds that Tarses' paternal grandfather was a Romulan.<br />This is television entertainment at its finest; on par with the best of Law &amp; Order and JAG. Expertly directed with fine performances all around and presents a fine message that holds true especially today. The Drumhead is an excellent episode and one not to be missed, even if you're not a fan of the television series.
B000062YAZ|5.0|While this was not the first Slayer album I heard, it is by far my favorite.  From the primal scream of Tom Araya on \\"Angel of Death\\" to the tremble of thunder at the end of \\"Reigning Blood\\", this album is outstanding through and through.  I've only been listening to death metal since about late '94, but I consider myself a versed expert on the subject.  Slayer is by far the most brutal and unforgiving metal band out there, and Reign in Blood was there crowning achievement,...
B00005RYL9|1.0|First, I am really fond of this movie. But, each iteration of DVD has been hugely disappointing. The wit and imagination that crafted the movie in the first place is nowhere in the minds of the people doing the DVDs.<br />For instance, the opening scene (in Madison Sqr Garden) originally piqued your curiosity by showing a fight scene that is surprising (to say the least) for the time and setting... but in this new Immortal Edition, they've spliced in scenes from 16th Century Scotland BEFORE the parking garage fight even begins.  What could they have been thinking?<br />Worst of all is the technical quality of the DVD: the video transfer is mediocre at its best; the sound is worse, with volume and clarity fluctuating all over the place; and the subtitles - are simply MISSING for most of the dialog. <br />Like the other digital versions of this movie, the Immortal is a half-hearted and half-witted effort! If you like this film, as I do, buy the VHS version, and keep hoping the owners/producers eventually join the digital age.
B00004U45G|5.0|First off, the Crows are a great live band.  I wasn't even interested in the Crowes until I found out that Jimmy Page was touring with them.  Being a die hard Led Zeppelin fan, I immediately took up interest in the Crowes, and got tickets for one of their shows.  <br />This CD is mainly Led Zep songs, which I am thrilled about.  The songs are very faithful to the originals, and they play some diverse songs.  Now beginning Led Zep fans might not like this, and wonder where Stairway, and Rock and Roll, and songs like that are...But serious Led Zep fans should appreciate songs like Nobody's Fault, In My Time of Dying, and Ten Years Gone- a song which would have been virtually impossible to do live if it weren't for the three guitarists.  Of course that's not to say this album is devoid of the Zep songs that seem to play on the local classic rock station every 15 minutes (not a bad thing) They play Whole Lotta Love, Heartbreaker, Custard Pie, and the Lemon Song.  <br />They also venture outside of Zeppelin.  Some of my favorites other than the Zep tunes are the cover of the Yardbirds Shapes of Things, where they mix the Yardbirds version, and the Jeff Beck Group version into one great song, the BB King cover, and one of my favorite selections, the cover of the Peter Green/Fleetwood Mac classic Oh Well, which they nail.<br />  All the Crowes are in top form, especially Chris Robinson, who does an alarmingly good job of covering Robert Plant, which is a daunting task for any vocalist.  Jimmy is in good shape too!  After all, he's the main reason I got this album.  Jimmy sounds like he's having a lot of fun, and from the interviews I read, he really was.  Unfortunately, Page blew his back out on the tour, and had to stop midway through, cancelling a large chunk of tour dates, including the one I bought tickets for (don't feel too bad for me, I still got to see The Who).  <br />If you like the Crowes, you should like this album even though they don't play their songs, and if you're a Zeppelin fan, especially a die hard zeppelin fan like myself, you should enjoy this album.  It doesn't really break any new ground, but they weren't trying to.  <br />All in all, it's a fun album, and hopefully it will motivate Page to get back in the studio, like both the surviving members of Led Zep did this year.  This is a great album.
0609610570|3.0|I met both Bodissy and Charan on separate business occassions, and I was entirely impressed by both. But, I had mixed feelings about this book because it was a bit too high-level for a practical discussion of business issues.<br />Bodissy sat in &quot;corporate level&quot; with a 40,000ft view of a conglomerate and Ram is management consultant for people of this level.  In contrast, good &quot;Execution&quot; can not be entirely understood or expressed by people at that level because they are merely reflecting on what they have seen as a response to their own management style and initiatives.  True &quot;Execution&quot; can only be told by his direct reports, who can compare the differences.  In a way, I think Andy Grove talked about &quot;Execution&quot; a lot better in his last book.<br />Excluding the long introduction chapters and re-summarizing ending ones,  the book attempted to put forth a &quot;model&quot; for good Execution based on some common fundamentals:  focus, followups, HR quality, etc.  However, these were not specific with people or processes, rather they were stories told by Larry and reflected by Ram.  And, on many occassions, it seemed they sarcastically criticized other &quot;guru&quot; management books as a waste of time.  For instance, &quot;strategy can be bought on any corner store&quot;  -- but shouldn't the reader come to his own conclusion that this book is somehow more insightful?
B000002L68|5.0|By far this was the best of Prince's albums. The film was not that great, but the soundtrack slammed! Purple Rain doused the fire of Michael Jackson's Thriller in the summer of 1984.<br />One question, since this is the CD age, why are some of the other excellent tunes by Pince and background music (such as the lovely &quot;Father's Song&quot;) not on remastered versions of this? But that's a minor complaint. What is on here is bloody good as it is.
B00005R1N3|5.0|I first saw this back in the eighties on late nite cable and it stayed with me for days afterward. Nobody saw it but me and apparently no one I've ever met has seen it since then. That's a sad thing because this is the best movie of it's kind out there. And it's out there...I've seen copies here and there. In fact, that's how I found it on Dvd...just digging around \\"out there\\". I am so pleased that it's a clear transfer---sound and all---because it deserves to be discovered. Directed by Bob Clark (who later trashed his career with the \\"Porky's\\" series) the film shows what a capable director he is and that he knows how to make a scary movie. Perfectly cast and well acted, this sleeper pulls no punches in it's depiction of an unknown maniac terrorizing 3 sorority sisters stuck in their house during the Christmas holidays ...alone. Or are they? They are menaced by some of the most terrifying and bizarre phone calls I've ever heard in this type of film. The atmosphere is heavy with cold and snow (you can FEEL it) and even the Christmas lights look forlorn and dreary. The carolers that come to bring songs are interrupted and sent home because of the news of a murder in the park behind them---further isolating the girls from the outside. But the worst is yet to come as they begin to realize how sick the caller is and that he's closer than they think. Moments of humor do not distract from or diminish the terror that engulfs the girls as well as the audience as the film builds to a crescendo and then ends on a frustrating note. At least I found it frustrating because you come to care about the girls (especially the lead, Jess) and want everything to wrap up OK. I recommend this to anyone who likes a truly frightening movie. But don't watch it with anyone who scares easily....
B0000696I1|4.0|OK, so this movie doesn't feature uber-villain Shredder, but this is one great entry into the TMNT series.  Though not as good as TMNT: The Movie it is ten times better than TMNT II.  The story starts with the Turtles down in their new subway lair (discovered in II) just hanging out now that Shredder is dead and buried.  April stops by with an ancient Japanese device she picked up for Splinter at a garage sale.  The device turns \\"on\\" and transports April to feudal Japan, a young Japanese prince taking her place.  The Turtles spring into action and travel back in time to save their friend.  Of course complications ensue and the Turtles find themselves in the middle of a revolution of sorts between the prince's father and the prince's rebel girlfriend.  The great part of the film is that the Turtles must decide if they want to stay in the past, where they are accepted and revered, or return to the present and remain outcasts.  <br />And perhaps the best part of the film: No Vanilla Ice!!!
B00006690G|5.0|to me, this album is to rap, as Thriller is to pop music. i originally stole this cd from my brother to make him mad. i have always liked stuff like movie scores, pop, and classical music.  never did i dream that i would one day put a rap cd into my player and be entertained like i have been.  eminem put on one ... of a show. this cd has been in my player for three days straight now and it isnt going anywhere for a while.  excellent material with the music video \\"cleanin out my closet\\"<br />unlike all the other rap videos that have nothing better than girls dancing at a pool party, this showed everything i look for in a song.  powerful lyrics, entertaining video, and just over all a fresh look at someones life that wasnt as fortunate as some other.  i fely bad, happy, and excited with the entire album... way to go eminem!! way to go!
B0000027I6|5.0|After seeing Roger Waters performing several songs from \\"Amused\\" live in Manchester 22/6/02 only underlines what a fantastic album this is.He is without doubt one of the best music writers of the last couple of decades.For me the stand out tracks are\\"Perfect Sense 1&2\\",\\"The Bravery of being out of Range\\",\\"Three Wishes\\",\\"It's a Miracle\\" & \\"Amused To Death\\".<BR>Roger Waters stands out as a fine musician & lyricist and only goes to show what Pink Floyd are now missing as he was the driving force behind the band,although David Gilmour is a fantastic guitar player (one of the best ever)and a fine songwriter they were both when combined together a fantastic partnership(one can only hope)!!!!
B000003BEV|3.0|One basic fact that most of us didn't recognize when this album came out was that the Rolling Stones were then and still are the greatest blues band of their generation. Far better than other groups who were \\"officially recognized\\" as blues-rock acts. That was probably why they felt compelled to march to the beat of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Don't get me wrong--there were several such albums of that era that I still love to this day, \\"Old Sarge\\" included--but an absolutely brilliant band can still be absolutely wrong for the whole concept album thing. The best way to approach this album and appreciate it is to pretend it isn't a concept album, and you will find that it has just as many memorable songs on it as most other Stones efforts. Songs like Bill Wyman's \\"In Another Land\\", which combines a pseudo-madrigal sound with an eerie vocal effect consisting of Wyman routing his mike through a guitar amp with the tremolo on (back in those days, tremolo was the only guitar effect that had yet been invented). \\"Citadel\\", with apocalyptic lyrics on a standard Stones arrangement. \\"2000 Man\\", which proved long before \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" that the Stones can handle country. As well as give a country song futuristic lyrics. \\"She's a Rainbow\\" got enough overkill on the air that I pass on that one--I was one of the \\"twentyboppers\\" beaten to death with it. \\"Gomper\\" and \\"The Lantern\\" are also worthwhile if you ignore the fact that Mick & Co. leaned a bit too much on a sci fi theme throughout the whole album. Even though \\"Gomper\\" had so much of Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett to it that it could have been the b-side to \\"See Emily Play\\". The secret is to ignore the first part of \\"Sing This All Together\\" and \\"On With The Show\\" as an overture and finale to the imaginary \\"command performance\\" that this album should never have been, and groove on the second part of \\"Sing This All Together\\" as a change-of-pace instrumental jam that the Stones don't really give us often enough. That's how I can still cherish my copy of this paradoxical work which is at once a total flop as a concept album, but still a fairly decent Stones album.t's how I can still cherish my copy of this paradoxical work which is at once a total flop as a concept album, but still a fairly decent Stones album.
0767817664|4.0|Just thought I would let those of you who are interested in buying this DVD know that it states that this DVD has both Widescreen 2.35:1 and Full Screen Presentations...NOT!  Even though the discs say Widescreen on Side A and Fullscreen on Side B, BOTH sides are WIDESCREEN 2.35:1!  The cover is also a lot darker than the one pictured.  DVD has NO special features, and NO bonus material, other than the trailer of the movie.
B00003CX8J|1.0|This movie did no justice to the wonderful characters of the X-Men. They took the characters and their well known storylines and basically changed and butchered it to their liking to make a very <bad> movie. The X-Men themselves are not a big part of the movie. Most of the movie is all about Wolverine. The characters of the X-Men are the title role but obviously not the main roles in this movie. They also left out so many great characters like Morph, Beast, and Gambit.

B000065U1N|5.0|This movie was excellent. It really showed the ugly side of war, not that there ever was a pretty side of war but definitely not a glamorized version of war. This movie was done purely on the side of the American soldiers so do not expect to watch it and see storylines of the Somali people or the reasons why. This movie focuses on the soldiers themselves and what they had to do and the motto &quot;never leave a man behind.&quot; Make sure and pay attention because if you don't you may miss who is who(a lot of the soldiers look alike.) In fact it might take a second or third time of watching it to finally say &quot;Oh OK, that was that guy.&quot;<BR>The DVD left a lot to be desired however. It has one special feature, the behind the scenes making of black hawk down. If you are really wanting a copy of the movie then by all means buy it but a special edition DVD is being released in 2003.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Caught this one in a Belgian cinema with a friend. I had no idea what to expect. I played the video-game a few times, but never really took the time to sit down for it. I saw the trailer, it looked good to me. Milla Jovovich? Oh yeah, I remember her from \\"The Fifth Element\\"; the girl wrapped in toilet-paper.<br />Resident Evil starts well. The underground laboratory known as \\"The Hive\\" is sealed when a deadly (sort of) virus is released. A team of S.E.A.L.s is sent in to rescue possible survivors.<BR>How does Milla Jovovich fit in? She can't remember a thing, but she's been inside the Hive before. As the team advances through the hive, the computerised defence-system mercilessly sets out to destroy them. And that's before the zombies are unleashed!<br />The good part of the movie is the atmosphere. I really like the dark rooms, the beautiful scenery. And it's got plenty of GORE! And I really enjoyed this movie at the time, but I don't really feel a need to watch it again. ...
B00005JKDR|3.0|I was very excited to see this movie but disappointed when it didn't live up to how funny it looked in the previews. Though I'm sure children will adore this movie. The movie was worth seeing for one thing, Boo the little girl. Every moment she had in the movie was precious and she sounded so darling.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is one of those vintage refreshing movies. It was recommended to me by a friend over diner (thanks, Lot) and I went to the cinema to find out what the fuzz was about!<br />Boy, it's a gem! From the weird, swift and wonderful introduction to the heroes and heroines to the speedy camerawork and the unfolding of the delicious story. <BR>Amelie is a young parisian woman who's been wrongly diagnosed for a heartdisease by her father as an infant and therefore she spent most of her youth indoors. <br />Finally on her own feet, she finds herself influencing the lives of other people. In this 21st century fairytale Amelie finally falls in love and goes about it in her own personal way!<br />It's brilliant! It's original! It's energetic! Go on, see for yourselves!
B00006AW2G|5.0|Let it Bleed is simply one of those albums that pulls you in, shakes you around, and never lets you go.  I bought it when it first came out (am I that old?) after hearing them perform \\"Love in Vain\\" on Ed Sullivan (think ol' stone-face ever heard of Robert Johnson?)  In 1969 the Stones sounded dangerous. In 1969 the Stones WERE dangerous (Now we have Eminem.  Please!), and this album bears that out.<br /><br />Let it Bleed is the album that turned me on to the blues.  I heard all these vague atmospheric traces of Howlin' Wolf, Robert Johnson, and other Delta denisens throughout.  Of course, at the time, I didn't know who those people were, but when I started looking back, it all made sense.  Thanks to Mick and Brian and Keef and the boys for reorienting the pop compass.<br /><br />I've been waiting forever for this to come out in re-mastered form (never even picked up the original CD), and now that I have it, I'm as blown away as I was from the first listen.  The remaster is amazing.  You hear fingers rubbing against strings, lips cascading against harmonicas, menace in every lyric.<br /><br />Get Let it Bleed for yourself AND for everyone you care about.  Because, we all need someone we can bleed on.
0316666343|1.0|An interesting idea and good beginning but it soon trails off into a rambling and unconvincing story. Yes, the recovery of the family is well done but the novel moves in fits and starts and eventually has a really contrived ending. Like another reviewer, I'm reading this for a bookclub or I would never have bought a copy!!
B000067DNC|5.0|If you enjoyed season one, you're going to love season 2 and it's at a lower price.  Season 2 is where things really take off for SG1.  The episodes are much better because the actors have really defined their characters in the previous season and are finally settling in to their roles.  I just can't wait until they finally release seasons 3-5 on DVD.
B000068QVN|5.0|This is howe they recorded a live performance back in \\"71 find a better If you can ?

0385505833|5.0|This is the first book I have read by John Grisham.  And what I've been told is that this is far from what he normally writes.<br />I loved it!  It should be a motion picture released at Christmas.  Definate potential to be a classic book & film.  I read this book in two days I couldn't wait to see what happened when his daughter got home.  The characters were so realistic.  I think the response of the town is exactly how my own townspeople would respond if we skipped christmas!!!  I highly recommend this book.
B00005OAIE|5.0|The only question I'm left with....from what mental disorder or hearing disturbance does the editorial reviewer employed by Amazon suffer?  He/she is clearly off base given all the raving and raging John Mayer reviews by normal (and tasteful, no less) Americans....no mention needed for this debut artist's overwhelming musical talent.  My message to the reviewer: enjoy your N'Sync or No Doubt while I, no doubt, bask in the wonder of Room for Squares.  Bye now.
B000002AGN|5.0|&quot;Blue Rondo&quot; and &quot;Time Out&quot; are experimental songs that are surprisingly catchy and feature beautiful playing.  The album continues with odd time signatures, though they don't stand out to a casual listener (i.e. a listener not going &quot;1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5&quot; in time with the music) as strongly.  The music swings, and is &quot;important&quot; if only for the time signatures.
B00001R3GC|5.0|The editorial reviewer above credis Mick Taylor with the stunningly brilliant slide guitar work on Sister Morphine.  If I'm not mistaken -- and as you can quickly discern on the first listening -- that wonderful solo work was done by Ry Cooder without proper credit.  According to RnR lore of long standing, the decision not to credit this work was the reason for the parting of ways between Cooder and The Stones.<br />I've already purchased the first set of discs offered in this new remastered series, and I can attest that they are wonderful improvements over the earlier CD's of those albums.  The SACD layer is just delicious, and the standard layer still sounds great.  No matter who played slide on Sister Morphine, I can't wait to lay my hands on the remastered version of Sticky Fingers.
B000002MTR|4.0|This album has the Pepper's most fun song - &quot;Aeroplane&quot;.  The others range from funky to straight-forward rock.  Unfortunately, a couple of tunes sound like the funk was a little forced (Dave Navarro, though excellent, wasn't a perfect fit with the band).  The generic-sounding songs make it a 4-star effort.
6302973724|5.0|Yeah i totally agree with [other posters] on reading his review.Pls release this item on DVD.<br />i've been a DM fan since the mid-80s and although i dun listen to them much these days,i must say that this is their best work. Period!!!i've been to their concert when they were here in Singapore and i was totally blown away.Any fan would agree that this particular concert is DM at its prime!!There's even a scene whereby Dave Gahan took a camera from one of the audience and actually took pictures of the whole arena.<br />PLs release this in DVD format equipped with DTS soundtrack.I had a VHS version of it but its really old and worn out so im waiting for the DVD version(if there is).
B000002U82|5.0|This carefully recorded masterpiece is one of those albums where every sound is memorable and the listener can't imagine a single note ever being changed.  The songwriting is strong, performances classic, and the recording was groundbreaking for its time.  A must-have for all rock fans.
6305633177|4.0|Some strong performances by these boys.  Seeing the last moments with cliff was a truly sad thing, yet great in a way as well.  Cliff by far is or was not the greatest bassist ever, his work on all metallica albums in the 80's wasnt produced that great, even though it had its kick ass moments with Anesthesia, for whom the bell tolls, and Orion.  Steve Harris of Iron Maiden without a doubt is the greatest bassist ever if it came about.  Your fingers dont get as fast as his on a 4 string ol fender.  Still a terrific show and cliff was still an excellent bassist, extremely overrated now, but was still great.  <br />Seeing Mustaine perform is even better, you want to talk about a great performer as well as a godly guitarist, watch mustaine crunch those riffs.  Then Hammet came along, who as well plays great, but he by far is no dave mustaine and never will be, but replacing dave is beyond comprehension.  <br />This was great, and this is when metallica were all about the music, and all about the fans.  Sad to say, all that is dead now.  Still we have the memories and its in this video. Get it if your a metalhead, even if you hate what metallica has become now, like me, still this was when they rocked. (Cliff RIP)  Metal reigns!...
B0000028UK|4.0|Recorded without the studio polish of \\"Ten\\", but without the muddy sound of most of the later albums, \\"Vs\\" has great songs and performances. All of the songs on the disc are good, each hit different moods. The lyrics are excellent and the guitars are strong. Definitely \\"grunge\\" near its best.
B00005B36H|2.0|I think this band is SO overrated, first of all why are they so geat..hmm they can play a simple riff over and over again, and its called BRILLIANT!... But seriously these guys arent anything special
B000002OX7|5.0|Forget &quot;Tommy&quot;, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, or any of the others... this is the Who's best work.  Originally going to a concept album, &quot;Who's Next&quot; instead became a classic of alienation and rebellion.  It's notable that when the Who played at the 9/11 tribute in Madison Square Garden, all three songs they chose were from &quot;Who's Next&quot;.  This album also features some revolutionary synthesizer work by Pete Townsend, and the best rock scream ever by Roger Daltrey.
B000068TPN|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie. It's one of the best performances by Mel Gibson I've ever seen since braveheart and<BR>the patriot. My boss is a vietnam vet and he says it's the most<BR>realistic vietnam movies he has seen in a long time.So if you <BR>want to get a taste of what fighting in vietnam was like, Buy<BR>this movie and watch it again and again.You'll be glued to your<BR>seat.It doesn't show you everything that happened but does give<BR>you a really bloody,informative and entertaining idea of what it<BR>was like over there.
B00005JLDW|3.0|This film does seem to be fit for early teens. This film's dragons are pretty real-looking although they were not nearly seen enough. I find it hard to believe that in 2020, the world will be taken over by fire-breathing beasts. This movie also has some plot holes like most movies do. For instance, where do Van Zan and his crew fuel up? The action scenes were exciting and fun. This movie stars Christian Bale (American Psycho) and Matthew McConaughey (The Wedding Planner). Izabella Scorupco(Vertical Limit) stars as a dragon-slaying helicopter pilot. We know so much more about Bale's character, Quinn, than we do about McConaughey's character, Van Zan. We know enough about Quinn to sympathize with him. Van Zan is another story. Christian Bale's performance was good, including getting his butt kicked in the fight scene. Matthew McConaughey did not deliver his best performance when his lines come out so breathy that you crack up right there in the theater. I give this movie's special effects an A. I personally like this movie because I like action movies. Go see this movie for the action scenes but don't expect much else.
B00000D9TK|5.0|A great recording for any fan of Celine Dion and she sings so beautifully in her native French language.  There are lyrics provided to sing along with.  As a student of French, I find it very appealing.  Highly recommended!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead didn't release two albums here, simply two halves of one album--one of the greatest albums ever.<br />Don't believe me?  Do this:  Put Amnesiac in the CD player.  Put Kid A in another CD player.  Start both at the same time.  Blow your mind.  Nothing can argue with the music.
B00006FXB6|5.0|What first caught my attention to the album was David Grohl on drums, which I can't get enough of.  But everything falls together on this album perfectly.  Straight up rocked my socks off.  If the album is this good, I can't wait to see the live show.  Trust me, grab the album now.
B000002C1W|5.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Waters as a lyricist, and if there's one point against A Momentary Lapse of Reason, it's the lyrics. But they aren't bad - just not Waters. But there seems to be absolutely no objectivity in many of the reviews here of this album. A few points I'd like to Counter:<br />1) \\"This doesn't sound like a Pink Floyd album.\\" - Perform a little experiment: take someone who has never listened to Pink Floyd before and have them listen to Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and Momentary Lapse of Reason back to back. Now ask them if the albums are by the same group.<br />2) \\"This album sounds so obviously eighties.\\" - Next experiment, have the same listener as before listen to Piper At The Gates of Dawn and The Wall and have them try to identify which decade they were produced in.<br />3) \\"There's more filler here than good music.\\" - Now that the \\"new\\" listener has heard The Wall and A Momentary Lapse of Reason, ask them which album contains more filler.<br />I prefer A Momentary Lapse of Reason to Animals and The Division Bell, two albums that I think are great. I'm happy to have purchased the remastered AMLOR, because a second criticism that could be aimed at it was that the sound fidelity on the original cd was terrible.<br />AMLOR contains several tracks that should be considered in any `best of' compilation and many secondary tracks that overshadow those musically. It's a solid album from start to finish songwise and is held together by a soundscape that is lavish and well executed. The filler arrangements of A New Machine Parts 1 &amp; 2 play well in the soundscape, even if they can't be considered proper tracks. This is a great album and should be highly regarded.
B00005RY7X|5.0|The first track opens up with grinding powerchords, loud stomping drums and a guy screaming at the top of his lungs \\"iT'S TIME TO PARTY!\\". God...how long I have been waiting for an album like this to come out. Do you know how long it's been since we've heard a band like Andrew WK sing about partying, girls, and not to mention enjoying life, rather than whine about it like Korn and their moody mook-like minions? That right there is such a huge relife. Not to mention this is one of the biggest love/hate albums I have ever listened to. It will either make you get up, want to party, or make you dismiss it as a \\"joke\\". I can't see how it is a \\"joke\\" since how could someone take a band like Andrew WK so serious that their music has to be serious. For once just kick back and have fun people. That's the whole vibe of this album; just have a good time. The music is loud, catchy, and not to mention has a ...-load of energy. Try mixing Motorhead, Black Flag, A Flock Of Seagulls and Elton John-piano keys and that is what you get. Loud happy music. Definately one of the best albums of the year!
B000068TPN|1.0|The real horror of war is having to endure over the top Hollywood trash such as this movie. Here is a small list of the absurdity in We Were Soldiers...<br />99% of VCs die by charging straight into American sights. Of all the war movies I seen recently this one takes the cake for the worst action sequences. Everything just seems so Hollywood and FAKE. Its like they didn't even try.<br />I thought the battle took place in Vietnam? The terrain looks like it took place in a glorified paintball park.<br />The VCs are cartoonist extras from Rambo. They spend most of their time dying in the most idiotic way possible or barking at each other with their stereotypical and hilariously over the top acting. If this is Mel's attempt to humanize the enemy then he failed miserably.<br />The list goes and on..
B00006AULI|4.0|It is unfortunate that this was an independent release because it was the best horror film of 2001 in my opinion.  It truly puts recent mainstream horror releases such as Dracula 2000, Halloween Resurrection, Urban Legends, Eight Legged Freaks, etc. to shame. Session 9 has probably the most tense buildup of any horror film of the last 20 years.  What I mean by this is that you will be on the edge of your chair trying not to watch, yet at the same time wanting to see what will happen.  There are some well-done scares that are not just sudden loud noises but they are deeply unsettling images.  Although it hs a couple bloody moments, the film overall has little gore and instead scares with psychological horror, isolation, and helplessness.  You will never interpret the phrase \\"abandoned insane asylum\\" in quite the same way again.  My reason for not giving 5 stars is the ending is a let-down.  But still, the film is well worth watching.  See what good horror films are supposed to look like!
B0000640VN|5.0|It's very romantic, and funny, you wont get cloying, very sweet actually, hugh has a great performance, and meg its so good, so modern..... It's generally very good
B00006ALGL|5.0|This guy really is very special and the CD is brilliant - possibly the best I've heard this year. If you like the Frames, Mundy, Mazzy Star and Cold Play then I expect that you'll love this.<BR>Its really great when you hear an album that surprises you and this album certainly does that. It's clever and well produced and Lisa's voice complements damien's so well. <br />I think we'll be hearing a lot more of Damien Rice in the future.
B00006BXI0|5.0|Holy Cow! I'm so serious, this album is the greatest album. If you like Blind Guardian, Dream Theater and others like them, then this is perfect for you. One of the songs is over 20 minutes long. The New Mythology is also a good one. These guys are becoming my fav, next to Queensryche, Dream Theater and Blind Guardian.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer must have been hit over the head with the Muse's baton. There is not a wrong note on this album. Even the 80's retro pop feel of &quot;Neon&quot; (track 5) doesn't irritate. Of course, &quot;Wonderland&quot; (track 4) is simply luscious- the kind of love song that doesn't depend on profanity but on a silver tongue. If Ovid were alive today, this is the music he would play at a dinner party. David Gray meets the Dire Straits with a dash of Bruce Cockburn's lyricism make me utterly glad I paid full price for this album- which I normally don't do. Tracks to listen to first: &quot;Back to You&quot; (track 10) and the tight harmonic lullaby of &quot;St. Patrick's Day&quot; (track 14.) All in all, a marvelous CD.
B00005UEAR|3.0|Like Queensryche's Operation mindcrime, Dream Theater out did themselves with Scenes from a Memory. And like Queensryche's Empire album after Mindcrime. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is okay...but not as good as Metropolis pt2.<br />I'll keep it short, the album is good, I'm glad I got it. But it's a fair addition to their discography.<br />I had the same feeling with Blind Guardian's A Night at the Opera. It was okay, but not as good as their previous album.
0316096199|2.0|Americans can't get enough of Crime TV so American readers may like this book.  It delivers bludgeoning description - graphic, straight and true - individualizing the experience of a torture at once the most personal and pervasive, but assuring us the good guys win. Delivered without the annoyance or bother of challenging analysis, and without the awkward courtesy of informed contemporary assistance to others similarly situated, the book asks nothing but that we read on --and most will not help but do so.  The paperback will be popular, and no doubt, the made for TV movie.<br />Americans will like a book about an alienated and alienating teen who suffers and survives, all the while sustaining a wide eyed belief she has gone it alone, triumphed over the odds, and by golly, you could too if you would just give the legal system a go. Never mind that this rape survivor finds a note in her file fifteen years later that betrays a difficult truth:  Despite her demographics the police do not believe her any more than a thousand other \\"lucky\\" victims they have already seen, will continue to see, and see to this day.  We wait for the author to divine the appalling significance of this note, to put aside the emerging potboiler, sniff the air, and seriously reconnoiter.  We wait in vain.  Breathtakingly naïve, the memoir offers us the author's twenty year head start on contemporary adulation of police as heroic.<br />Unfortunately, the odor of disbelief is plain to readers from the outset.  It scents the air in every interaction and institution with which the author comes in contact.  It steams from her very own pages, but Sebold is the last to know.  Even now she does not seem to detect the stench as it wafts from police to an incredulous parent's question, is deodorized by a patient feminist attorney's empathy, suspended by a waif's unassuming ministrations, or ramped up by a slimeball defense attorney's assaults.  <br />This undetected fragrance would be bittersweet for readers - she is, after all, only a kid at the time - if  only the intervening decade or two and the file information would give the grown up author pause.  If it seems to readers that the passage of time and the passing of this file will call for a new and more sophisticated perspective, well, for Sebold, things remain just what they seemed.  Reflection on those times, on our own, and on the hard work that makes change possible -- as per Blumenfeld's Revenge, or Kaysen's Girl, Interrupted?  No such complications attend this work.<br />But it is a memoir, and so we want to hear her out.  If the author is fond of the particular over the pattern, where does she convey why this particular memoir is necessary or just?  Beyond personal catharsis, beyond her tedious hair-trigger competitive instinct and unseemly love of celebrity, what justifies this tell-all?  What moral vision does this book offer that justifies, for instance, the vivisection too hastily inflicted on her parents and sister in these pages?  A rape survivor does not owe us philosophy, but a memoir has to try.<br />What are her motives for writing?  What sophisticated view of justice does Sebold offer to balance the pain she delivers the hapless but heartrent young people she describes, real people who will read their offers of aid in paperback caricature twenty years later?  What larger purpose recompenses their secrets and sexualities exposed?  And most of all, what practical, social, or moral vision does she offer the other victims she \\"outs\\", with only the merest scrap of a name change? These are, after all real people whom she describes.  <br />It is a testimony to Sebold's talent that she can tell a real story in a real way. But it is her moral failing to have done so recklessly, with so little concern for real others.  Memoir is not fiction (at which the author is much better-see The Lovely Bones).  And, this is not (yet) TV; these real people weep, and we are asked to watch in a posture of wry detachment, scorned for our squirming.  Why?<br />And what are our motives for reading?  I do not care, as some reviewers appear to do, whether or not her professors reek of voyeuristic curiosity.  Theirs are not the only mixed motives in the sex crime to memoir nexus; why shouldn't a wounded teen find such people wise and diverting? But memoir is not fiction.  Did she learn from these professors that it would be enough to relate a 20 year old tale \\"authentically\\", no matter the collateral damage?  That it is sufficient to say that the world is divided into good, evil, and ridiculous?  That cop lingo is romantic?  That when evil befalls us naive determination, sharp wits, and an even sharper tongue will yield the good?  That the world is full of suffering, but that it is one's own that counts the most?  That even if it changes the way the world regards them, unique women should tough it out , tell the violating details, or have them told for them, and  words will make things better?  What, exactly, justifies this recklessness?  <br />This memoir could have been important.  It offers genuine, wrenching tales of upper middle class adolescent angst made exponentially more bitter by pointless tragedy, courageously described.  But this is a harrowing passage from which the author has clearly not escaped.  In this instance, adolescent angst is made more destructive by the author's continuing generosity in sharing it; even now she cannot keep a civil tongue in her head.  Some may find this witty and arty and lively but I find it sad, empty, and hopeless.  The honesty of Sebold's passages can break your heart, especially for the sense that the author is still lost in a time warp, with nothing to show for it but a drug problem, an enduring mean streak undisguised by considerable literary finesse, and a legal victory over, we hope to God, the right man.
B000067JHW|5.0|And the Oscar goes to . . .unfortunately not this superb work.  This must be the best movie I have seen in my entire life.  The theme, humor, cinematography and acting is all first-rate.  Combining an occasional randomness that reminds one of one's own life with the clever presentation of its message, the result is an absolute masterpiece.
0515123447|5.0|Even though I read about fifty books a year in the Mystery/Thriller genre, this is my first introduction to Lee Child.  He comes highly recommended and I'm now wondering why I waited so long to pick up one of his books.<br />My immediate thoughts on this author are that I like his writing style.  He writes like we speak -- shorter sentences and gets right to the point.  My second discovery is his use of surprises.  There's nothing I like more than reading a book where I don't know what's going to happen at the end of a chapter.  I love having some of those \\"Oh, No\\" moments when settling down with a mystery.  My third and probably most important reason for liking this book is the main character.  Finally, I meet Jack Reacher -- 6'4\\", 36 years old, a former military policeman and, best of all, he's not a wise-guy.  I don't know why most authors think they have to resort to the wise-cracking main character in order to have a successful book.  To me, Jack Reacher is a refreshing change.<br />The setting of this book, Margrave, Georgia, is reminiscent of a Stepford town.  Everything is perfect, everything is clean, everyone is happy with their lives....until dead bodies start showing up.  Reacher, who just happens to be wandering through Margrave, is immediately considered a suspect simply because he's an outsider.  But little does this town know that it's the \\"insiders\\" they have to worry about as Reacher sets out to prove his innocence and seeks revenge for the death of someone from his past.  And when Reacher sets out to seek revenge, he means it, as he has no problem at all in killing bad people.<br />In the beginning of the book, he won't know whom to trust and neither will the reader.  As the story progresses, however, you will become amazed at Reacher's intelligence and will become attuned to his deciphering of even the smallest clue.<br />Jack Reacher has now moved right up on top of my list of favorite main characters in a mystery series.  I've looked past the fact that he has no problem killing people.<br />I'm just so glad that this is a series because it means that I get to visit with this pantheon of human pulchritude again and again and again.  Next up....Die Trying.act that he has no problem killing people.<br />I'm just so glad that this is a series because it means that I get to visit with this pantheon of human pulchritude again and again and again.

0679731377|5.0|The novelty inherent in Julian Barnes A History of the World in 10 ½ Chapters isin partthat it is not really a novel.  It is more of a comically tragic reminiscence of Joyces Dubliners than your standard long-prose work, complete with protagonist, antagonist, and the typical one-plot, one setting structure.  Its 10 ½ stories bluntly give us a non-revisionists history of the world by traveling from a tale of unclean woodworm stowaways upon Noahs Ark to Barnes conception of Heaven.  It is realist and fantastic at once, telling how it was, is, and is to be with such honesty, depth, and sensitivity that its classification should be a sort of jocular Capotesque non-fiction novel.<br /> A History of the Worlds most curious feature is its division.  Ten strikingly different stories and one half-chapter side-note are seem as if they are randomly slapped together until the reader starts to make the connections.  The woodworms stowed away on the Ark are in a subsequent chapter tried for the destruction of church property and blasphemous offence against God when their progeny take residence in and consume the Catholic cathedral of Mamirolle.  The trial sings with critique of mans distortion of the religious impulse and social commentary.  The Ark comes up in nearly every chapter, establishing a sort of nautical theme tied together with the wreck of the Medusa, a 17th century French naval frigate and the theories of the modern humans ascent from the sea from an amphibious state.  Barnes also maintains a religious theme throughout the work, adding a discussion of Jonah in the whale, a timely leap into Middle Eastern religion turned politics, and a philosophical treatise on the meaning and purpose of heaven.  All of this is weaved together to form a mystical collage of human nature and history.<br /> As one might surmise from the title, the ½ chapter is of great importance to the unity of the narrative.  Entitled Parenthesis these 19 pages of side note seem to be a larger version of the aside in which the author speaks directly to the reader.  Barnes includes this personal commentary to reveal the main theme of the work: an exploration of love and its value for the human species.  Love is the only tool we have to beat down the history of the world and make life plausible, give it some meaning.<br />History isnt what happened.  History is just what historians tell us.  There was a pattern, a plan, a movement, expansion, the march of democracy; it is a tapestry, a flow of events, a complex narrative, connected, explicable.  One good story leads to another.And we the readers of history, we scan the pattern for hopeful conclusions, for the way ahead.  And we cling to history as a series of salon pictures, conversation pieces whose participants we can easily reimagine back into life, when all the time its more like a multi-media collage, with paint applied by decorators roller rather than camel-hair brush (240).<br />Because of the confusion of sentient existence, Our random mutation [love] is essential because it is unnecessary. (238) We dont NEED it, thats why it means something and how it empowers us.<br /> Simply stated, Barnes novel (alright, I admit, it is a novelhowever NOVEL) wants us to be more conscious of what a blessing it is to be a sentient, thoughtful beings capable of reading novels.  It wants us to not get tied up in historical facts and to realize that we can get more out of a fictional account of history which admits to this condition than from revisionist histories around the world that disguise themselves in FACT.  Or maybe, it just wants us to read it and enjoy it.pages of side note seem to be a larger version of the aside in which the author speaks directly to the reader.

B000068TPN|4.0|I enjoyed this film a great deal! I spent time in VN,after this action. And this is technically a great film. I'm not sure Mel Gibson was the best choice for this film. And I really like Mel, just not five stars worth in this film.<br />It's not a film for the faint of heart.<br />And after you see this one, check out 84 Charlie Mopic my favorite VN flick
B000002B30|3.0|This CD from Bruce Springsteen is really fun to listen to. It contains some of his greatest hits such as &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot;, &quot;Born In The U.S.A&quot; and &quot;Glory Days&quot; and even &quot;Secret Garden&quot; along with some other neat tracks, but unfortunately, I would not call this a greatest hits album...why?...because it is not complete. There are many more greatest hits by Bruce Springsteen that are not on the album. For instance, &quot;Fade Away&quot;, &quot;Cover Me&quot;, &quot;I'm On Fire&quot;, &quot;I'm Goin Down&quot;, and &quot;Tunnel Of Love&quot;, were all top hits from Bruce Springsteen according to Billboard. Why these tracks are not on here...I don't know but they should be because most of these songs were some of his most popular ones and they aren't even on here. I do like the CD but it would be much better if there were some other hits on here.
0679411585|5.0|I'm a Vietnam Vet, and I can recommend this book strongly enough for anyone interested in this heroric battle. Our top sargent was a survivor of this action. And his recollections echo this book.<br />It's not a bad movie either, but my personal  favorite VN flickis 84 Charlie Mopic.<br />This is a fast and easy read.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer does a wonderful job in expressing his inner self, and the inner self in all of us in this soulful, rock compellation! It is a c.d. for people who are ready to wind down at the end of the work day, or just listening to that college professor who puts you to sleep! He sings of words that we all can sympathize to. It's a great c.d., I highly recommend it to all lookin for something new to listen to! John Mayer, Room for Squares, order it at Amazon.com!!
0694003611|5.0|This author is one of my favorites. Her books are gentle and loving and sweet. This is one of my favorite books. It is a reminder that everything is there and everything has a place and it's time for bed and everything is ok.<br />Playing find the mouse and each page helps your child develop spatial skills, memory skills and eye and hand coordination as he/she points to the mouse.<br />It is not a long book and that makes it easy to read over and over again. The pictures are gentle and sweet and only enhance the text.<br />Enjoy.
B000000H5K|4.0|Its one of those absurd situations. We have a metal band going straight up to total stardom, releasing two succesive highly successful album, CHAOS A.D. and ROOTS. So, what happens? DUe to some silly misunderstanding, thet band singer and frontman, Max Cavalera, leaves the band. What happens nexte? Neither the new Sepultura, nor Max new outfit (Soulfly) manage to be great anymore. ITs a really sad history.
B000022TSW|5.0|This is absolutely the funniest movie of all-time.  I am not a fan of the show and I haven't watched any of the episodes.  Why?  Because I saw the movie and i thought it was so funny that I don't want to ruin things in case the tv show isn't as good.  This movie is just TOO funny, you'll be laughing after you watch it a 100 times.  I wish I had seen it in theaters because I'm sure it would have been nice to laugh with everyone else.  Anyways, when it comes to the dvd it doesn't have a lot of special features (just trailers) but I am glad they also added a french audio track, it's also funny but not as much as the original english audio.  Personally I would have rathered if they cut some of the scenes between Sadam Hussein and Satan, but that's just a minor complaint.  There are so many great and funny scenes, it's just a 10 on 10.  This movie is DA BOMB!!!

B0000060NF|5.0|Having just approached the one year anniversary of September 11, I'd thought it be a good idea to revisit Marvin Gaye's 1971 masterpiece, &quot;What's Going On.&quot;  Originally recorded as a commentary of the socially turbulent 1960s, &quot;What's Going On&quot; has lost none of its power after more than thirty years, and its messages still possess relevance in today's climate.  Gaye addresses the environment (&quot;Mercy Mercy Me&quot;), the future of our children (&quot;Save the Children&quot;), and war (the title track). The brilliant finale &quot;Inner City Blues (Makes Me Want to Holler)&quot; obviously wasn't written in reference to the WTC attacks, but I can imagine many people relating to the frustration and anger with which Gaye sings this song.  But &quot;What's Going On&quot; also possesses spiritually uplifting messages of positivity, and these messages couldn't be needed more urgently as the survivors of 9/11 struggle to adapt and move ahead.  The beautiful &quot;God is Love&quot; is still tough enough to move this grown man to tears, while &quot;Wholy Holy&quot; inspires us to come together, believe in Jesus and &quot;rock this world's foundation.&quot;<br />September 11 was a day that forever rocked this nation's comfort zone, forcing us to reassess our lives and priorities.  But instead of conforming to the often dubious forms of patriotism that keep surfacing in this country, let's revisit this still-stunning classic and learn from its messages of optimism and faith.
B00003CWN3|5.0|i first watched the movie version - and it really struck me. <br />How fragile life is, and yet some people just snuff it out as easy as snuffing out a candle flame. <br />Hilary Swank portrays Brandon very well - and it was a well deserved award she won. Brandon at least had the desire and courage to search for his niche in life, and to follow his dreams. How many people actually achieve that in this day and age? <br />The roughnecks didnt understand him (which is understandable cos of the way their lifes were structured and their nurturing from young). <br />This is exactly the kind of discrimination that goes on even in freedom proclaiming USA, what more other homophobic countries? <br />Everyone artiste in this film had a vital part to play to keep the film moving, which is exactly what they did. <br />Its not one of those 'brainless' movies you can just pop into your player and watch, but it still deserves a place in your video cabinet for the messages of hope and dreams it carries.<br />In some ways, its an inspirational movie.
B000001ESN|5.0|Neil's lyrics reach a new level of excellence here, since he has dropped some of the abstractions of previous work.  When most people say Neil is the best lyricist in rock, they usually start with this album and work their way forward.  \\"Freewill,\\" \\"Entre Nous\\" and \\"Natural Science\\" are some of his best.  The musicianship goes without saying; on this album, nobody can touch Rush for sheer excellence on their respective instruments!!  When Alex rips into his solo on \\"Freewill\\" and Geddy and Neil tear it up behind him, rock nirvana is achieved.  Sound-wise, it's crystal clear, and I have the original CD version.  The remastered sound would probably make my jaw hit the ground, but that's a risk I'm willing to take.  Certainly one of the five best CD's these masters ever released.
B000006TRV|5.0|The wall is one of rock's finest hours. This is the ultimate nihilistic psychedelic breakdown album. This is infinitely superior to Tommy musically and lyrically. The album should only be listed to in its entirety.  Listening to the songs out of order prevents one from following pink as he descends into absolute insanity. Like a modern day version of Kafka's Joseph K., Pink gradually recedes from reality, until he finds himself in a Freudian nightmare of neuroses.  David Gilmore's guitar work shines on this album and Roger Water's voice sounds the best of his career.
B000002UUX|5.0|Though I believe Metallica has more great albums to choose from in the metal genre, I think Megadeth's &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; just might be the BEST offering in the thrash genre (yes, even better than &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;).  Nick Menza's pummeling double bass, combined with some of the wickedest riffs ever put to wax, make this absolutely indispensable.  They took what was pretty good on their previous albums and turned it up to 11!!  The first time I heard this, I think I drooled all over the floor at the thought of what my ears were hearing.  EVERY single song hear is dynamite, from the opening crunch of &quot;Holy Wars&quot; to the closing salvo of &quot;Rust in Peace.&quot;  I can see why soldiers listened to this so much during Desert Storm; it makes you want to go really really FAST!
B000021YQV|5.0|im a huge fan of music like this. its kinda like fear factory only a little better. but i cant compare then like that. first of all, i like the guys voice...the way he says the world Brutality or other words with Br words with R period. the way he announciate &lt;---[dont know if thats the right spelling] words anyways its one of the best music out there. of cource if you can handle the kind of music where the guy screams and so forth so on. the music got great bass, and I like Bass all the way. great CD i recomend it if you like heavy rock music.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Anyone who doesn't like this movie is either crazy or doesn't like Josh Hartnett. I would recomend this movie to people at least the age of tweleve who love tear-jerker movies or just thinks Josh Hartnett is hot.
B000002L99|5.0|5150 is my favorite sammy album and song. The rest of the album is great too. Every song could have been a hit single, except Inside, which is probably their weirdest song, and it is amazingly cool.
0784011680|4.0|This is a cinematic masterpiece.  Wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed.  Robert Downey Jr. could not have done a more masterful job portraying the great Charlie Chaplin.  The film flowed well, leaving out very little of the major events in his life.  The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 was that it only made subtitle available in Spanish!  For the life of me I could not understand why the subtitles were not made available in English!  This was a major problem if one had difficulty understanding the clipped dialogue of the English accents used in the film.  I would love to have the same DVD availablle with English subtitles.<br />Dr. Don Priola
B000002LPD|3.0|it's better than 0U812. The singles are excellent and the filler is pretty good too. I mean, what else are you going to buy, VHIII? Yeah, right.
0316666343|3.0|The Lovely Bones is a beautifully written story full of compassion, feeling of loss, frustration and despair due to loss, and finally healing. There were actually a couple of parts in the story, where I was in tears. In the midst of the sorrow, the author has managed some subtle humour, so the book doesn't leave you feeling stabbed in the stomach. So, basically I recommend this book for everyone. However, there are some things that bothered me, but I clearly blame it on the fact that this is the author's first book...things like - the voice of the 14year old is too mature and understanding for a 14year old..which is not what her character was actually like when she was alive. Also, things like entering a person's body, etc., steals some of the book's credibility. But despite of this I believe the author has true potential, and I hope she writes more. Three stars!
B000002LEM|3.0|but still very good. the singles and fast songs are great, but the filler is not up to 5150 standards. but like I keep saying, what else are you going to buy, VHIII? Not.
B0000640VO|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time..  This film gives you hope, happiness and joy to your heart.  It's funny and dramatic at the same time. It didn't win an oscar out of the multiple nominations that it had, but i think at least this film deserved the foreing language award.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol has thrown in a fantastic debut this year, really catching this listner off-guard. I had already pegged The Doves or David Holmes as my favorites of the year, but then along comes this wonderful thing.    Like the Strokes did last year, Interpol has dug up some much needed gritty influence of the past. Where the Strokes was a lighter pop affair, Interpol has gone right into the alleys and seedy clubs of both Manchester England and NYC. The record takes on a lot from Joy Division, Talking Heads and even Television. But it's the spooky quality of Joy Division that's adds some drama and beauty to the dark landscape within. Interpol draws from the past but keeps things sounding new and fresh. Songs like Untitled and NYC are as impressive as any I've heard this year. Like the Manchester music of the late 70's and early 80's, Interpol trys in vein to break out of their grime-laden roots. The result is an honest and soulful exchange delivered with art-ful passion. Matador have once again expanded their library and stumbled upon some truely great rock-n-roll. Turn on your ears to this great disc!
B000002AZX|5.0|Oh, my God, that's a great album! Here you will find essential Christianity presented popularly and in disguise of popular songs.<BR>Can be compared with &quot;John Weshley Harding&quot; by Dylan and with books by Clyve Lewis.<BR>It's a VERY good album.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Unlike Woodstock, this film shows you the reality of teh 60's.<BR>I can't really judge since i wasn't born. but when i saw woodstack, it seemed too good to be true and this made it unrealistic. It starts with an amzing performance of &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot; which will pin you to your seat. My only negative comment is that the commentary on the DVD is not about what you're seeing on the screen at that moment so you don't feel like listening to it. Also, i was annoyed by the way the producers were complementing each other all the time.<BR>Overall, a great DVD with great features
B00005QIPH|5.0|The strokes kick butt. They seem mellow, but listening close to their lyrics reveals a different side. This is made much harder since the cover didn't contain lyrics. This is a obvious minus, but listening close has it's own advantages. Sex, drugs and some serious rejection are some big themes. The guitar solos are short, but good, with a Santana riff that fits the song perfectly and another one that sounds decidely old style. THe studio editing gives everything a clean,fresh sound in contrast to the music, which is nice.
B000002LAC|5.0|The collaboration of Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt is one of life's true pleasures, making TRIO a very special album. The simple, down-country tunes are easy listening, and inspire you to either hum or sing along. Personal favorites are, &quot;Making Plans&quot;, Hobo's Meditation&quot;, &quot;Telling Me Lies&quot; and &quot;Those Memories Of You.&quot; And there are many fine memories to be had from this album. Although one song is titled &quot;I've Had Enough&quot;, you won't feel that way as the album draws slowly to a close. In fact, you'll feel like little Oliver Twist saying &quot;More, please!&quot; TRIO is a triple delight. Indulge yourself!
0783225970|5.0|Hands down. This is the best gangster movie i have  ever seen if not the best movie i have ever seen. Al pachino was great in taxi driver and I loved the gangster movie good fellas and casino but this one tops them all. Common the famous say hello to my little friend? This movie shows gore and the reality of a true mafia gang. The part where the guy gets sliced up in the bathroom...classic. But he got his alright. It shows how the man went from rags to riches...
B00005QG9J|5.0|If you are looking for something with a new flavor, a new perspective, unique guitars and rhythms, then this CD is for you.  It sounds a lot like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, only Brandon has a much more diverse voice in my opinion.  You get everything you could ask for in a CD.  The one song that gives you the best representation of the entire album is Wish You Were Here.  There are heavy, edgy songs to pump you up, like Blood on the Ground, (a great song for someone who recently broke up, or is just [mad] off) Have You Ever, and Circles.  Some of the songs that surprised me were Just a Phase, (which starts off flowing and soothing, and knocks you off your feet at the end) Nice to Know You, and Under My Umbrella.  Are You In is the funnest song on the album, and Echo is the sweetest.  If you are in the mood to relax, Mexico is wonderful, but sad.  But to REALLY relax, and you feel like drifting down a peaceful river, the last song on the album, Aqueous Transmission, is the most unique and innovative song, ending with the sound of ribbiting  frogs.  But, my all-time favorite song on this record, and by incubus is Warning!  This song has the whole package.  Amazing lyrics \\"She woke in the morning, she knew that her life had passed her by.  And she called out a warning, don't ever let life pass you by,\\"  and \\"I suggest we learn to love ourselves before it's made illegal.\\"(THERE'S something to think about!)  That's about it.  It's the best CD, and you'll enjoy it a ton.  If you like this CD, you'll also like Make Yourself.
B000066I6N|1.0|This cd reminds me of three day old leftovers served up at an unappetizingly luke warm temperature. The songs on this cd are incredibly boring and bland, and would lack any flavors, except like leftovers left in the refrigerator too long that pick up the flavors of other foods, Robert has given them his own flavor, and it isn't tasty by any means.  The old blues, and sixties folk song remakes have passed their expiration date. If you really must have this cd, wait until the CD appears in the bargain bin, and it will. I don't think you will have to wait long either. Like supermarkets that put dented cans, and foods that have passed their expiration dates in bins marked &quot;Reduced for Quick Sale&quot;, this CD of mostly remakes have passed their expiration date will also wind up in the CD store bargain bin;  your music store's version of a quick sale for stale music.
B00000G3Q4|4.0|Filmed way back in 1979, Evil Dead hit cinemas late 1982/early 1983.  Back then the special effects were truly amazing.  Looking at it now, the effects are pretty dreadful (looks like the filmakers spent time at the Halloween/Wig/Costume shop.  But please keep in mind, the producers did it all without computers and that's what makes this film so special.    It's far from scary now though, but will give you the best laugh.  I was in hysterics, and it's nice to see it again after many, many years.  What's annoying about this movie's release to DVD is that there are different versions of the DVD floating around!  I've got the 'Exclusive Widescreen edition', but be warned, it's not true widescreen (it originally wasn't even filmed in widescreen)so they've 'doctored' it, as such, to get away with it.  DVD marketing itself has taken off in the world, with different versions coming out of a range of movies. Special editions, basic editions, deluxe editions etc etc.  Evil Dead is getting this treatment.  Investigate fully before purchasing this title to ensure you get the one you want in your collection.
B00005RIKD|1.0|I've been waiting a while for all of these songs to appear on one album and when they finally do, it's a live performance and they don't even sound like the original songs.  I could hardly recognize &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot; and &quot;Fields Of Gold&quot; is sung off beat.  All of the other songs sound like remixes as well.  Save your money and wait for a greatest hits album to be released.
B000066NW0|4.0|but i do actually like this album nonetheless.  See, usually being into emo/punk/whatnot in the vein of Jimmy Eat World, Hot Rod Circuit, Grade, and the like, one would not expect me to enjoy such teen-pop fare as Avril Lavigne.  But, alas, as one would have it, I do, and here's why:<br />Okay, totally ignore the fact that &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; is perhaps the worst song ever written.  Listen to the rest of the songs.  It's standard girl-pop fare.  But who can argue with that?  I love Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton and the like, and this, depsite it's &quot;PUNK RAWK&quot; attitude and image, is a teenage girl and her guitar writing songs about being 17.  And honestly, being 17 isn't anything that should be held against somebody.  It should be embraced, as didn't we all once have the same feelings that Avril has?  Considering that she's Canadian, we'll afford her this one slip up (the aforementioned track &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;), but otherwise, as with her megahit &quot;Complicated,&quot; it really is a relatively solid, unoffensive, even at times *gasp* enjoyable album.  Granted, everybody over 20 will think i'm crazy, and maybe i am.  But I honestly think this is a really good album.
B000068FXR|5.0|Ah, a golden oldie. And why not, eh? Nowadays we get Eminem. You can't go wrong with this CD. Well, you could slip on it while it's on the floor and fly out the window and end up in traction but then you could listen to it for a couple of months, so you haven't really gone wrong. Wonderfully maudlin for such circumstances, too.
B0000640VO|2.0|Are all French films the same? This plot was predictable and not that enticing. I didn't find this uplifting (If this is uplifting, I don't want your life.) either, but was amazed at how many people there are with no life. If this is the French idea of sex, how boring! If this is a typical French life, ditto!

0060930187|5.0|\\"The Bell Jar\\" by Sylvia Plath is such a great book.It is so honest & real when dealing with mental illness. I found myself unable to put it down & the main character so admirable. It was based upon the author's life & it just seems like a legacy. I definitely consider \\"The Bell Jar\\" a classic. I think everyone should read it to get a real glimpse into mental illness. I thought the story was so original & enthralling. GO READ IT!
B00005QATY|5.0|Seeing the movie &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot; is an enjoyable experience, if only for the brillant soundtrack. Everyone knows the song &quot;I am a man of constant sorrow&quot;, if anything. The visuals are very well done : this is a skillfull movie.<br />It is not just a skillfull movie, but also a witty and intelligent movie. I don't want to sound like a sycophant for saying that, but I really think it is. <br />It has a &quot;happy-go-luck&quot; attitude as to its subject matter. It is, ostensibly, a modern version of The Odyssey, and it does spoof the Odyssey in an intelligent and somewhat credible (but most importantly, funny) manner, but it is much more than that. <br />Some people have said it was just about laughing at rednecks, but I would say that's only the first level. The two themes I see as most important in that movie are its spoofing of the Odyssey, and skepticism/freethought (especially about religion), as exemplified by the main character. <br />This movie is definitively enjoyable. It was nominated for two Oscars, but is evidently too much of an intelligent movie to have actually gotten any. If you are smarter than an Oscar judge, you will love this movie.
B00000272N|4.0|In leu of the death of the late Layne Staley, this album has perhaps grown in terms of importance and nostalgia, a throwback to the early days of grunge rock. And, certainly, after a listen or two through this little diamond in the rough, it is not hard to fathom why Alice in Chains etched such a tangible place for themselves in the rock industry. While this is clearly not their best work, it shows a great deal of promise for what their sound would be melding into on later albums. While listening to gems like \\"Man in the Box\\", \\"We Die Young\\", \\"Sea of Sorrow\\" and \\"It Ain't Like That\\" you catch a glimpse at the band that would one day cultivate enormous songs like \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Dam the River\\", \\"Grind\\", \\"Heaven Beside You\\", \\"No Excuses\\" \\"Down in a Hole\\" \\"Got Me Wrong\\" and numerous others. For a debut album from a then obscure, little known band from Seattle way back in 1990, this album is worth its weight in gold if not as a testament to what the band would one day become but rather as a testament as to the kind of wallop the band packed from day one. If you're a fan of music, this highly influential band and album should be in your collection.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I felt like I had to get this album because of all the hype sourrouning it. \\"Their gonna save rock n'roll!\\" I wasn't sure about that but I bought it. When I first heard it I was extreamly disapointed. I skipped to \\"Last Nite\\" and was again disapointed. I would then give THE STROKES another try. They began to grow on me and I was catching myself humming and softly singing many of their tunes. I was hooked, and I still am. THE  STROKES have managed to bring a great fresh sound to rock. Some say they have copied many previous bands. All music is built up from other bands and artists. Cut em some slack. <BR>  THE STROKES, besides having a great sound, song list, and being all around good musicians have such a coolness to them. They are well known but not popular. It's always fun rooting for a band no one has truly heard before. So many bands are getting too popular for no reason. Linkin Park, in my opinion, ... . They really aren't good. It seems whatever MTV plays repeatedly gets popular. Maybe people don't wanna look around for some good music, so they go for the over exploited bands. Anyway the cd the guys have put together is amazing. They have a great steely sound to them and Julian Casablancas's weary vocals are amazing. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is getting a little tired of boy bands, the new rap, Britney, or the new rock/rap hybrid music....make up your mind guys! If you dig getting stroked, cheak out the White Stripes too. Start listening to some GOOD music.
B00005R2M3|2.0|After hearing her amazing Donde Estan Los Ladrones? album I was thrilled to hear that Shakira was about to release her first english album, Laundry Service. Then when I heard the first single, \\"Whenever, Wherever\\", and how it had some world fusion in it, I could hardly wait to get my hands on her recent crossover offering. When I actually bought the album, however, all of my high-hopes diminished almost instantly. To me the lyrics seemed like those written by a love-sick 12 year old with uninspiring songs that became quite mediocre after about two or three run-throughs. There are, however, a few good songs on here that apparently saved me from selling this album to a used CD bin, such as \\"Objection (Tango)\\" which has a twisting dance vibe thats got a bit of latin ska to it. At first I didn't particularily care for that song but now it's growing on me. I also think that \\"Poem For A Horse\\" is a catchy song with (FINALLY!) thought-provoking lyrics. The best song though would have to be the arabian/middle eastern \\"Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)\\". The spanish version is better, I think, but it's interesting to hear her sing the words in english. I personally feel that she should stick to songs like \\"Ojos Asi\\" but then she wouldn't get any airplay, now would she? That's pretty much what the music industry is coming to... Mindless pop dities. I also find it sad how spanish artists like Soraya get such little notice in the mainstream world for her crossover albums are so much better than this.<br />Just throw some caution to the wind and consider something by her instead...<br />Now I do credit Shakira for writing her own lyrics, despite the fact that (at the time) she wasn't too fluent in the english language, but maybe that says something... She should have waited another year! She didn't though so, while I do recommend her spanish albums, I don't recommend this.<br />Better luck next time, Shakira...

B00006BTCA|5.0|If you've ever wondered whether you'll be around for the appearance of another truly great band that transcends the ordinary of pop music by delivering the raw emotions few others can, take a listen to Turn on the Bright Lights.  Untitled and Obstacle 1 introduce the listener to the atmosphere being painted by Interpol, with blurry guitars and dark distant vocals, while driving bass and punchy drumming keep your heart pounding.  Screams of &quot;stabbing yourself in the neck&quot; echo in your ears.  The peak of this album is reached early, with NYC and PDA.  NYC is sad and cathartic as it walks the streets and subways of New York, while PDA plucks at the nerves like a violin from many drunken nights of desperation.  Stella is a later highlight, with richly layered guitars and again the dank echoey vocals inviting you into her story.<br />Interpol's debut reaches the greatness of such icons as Joy Division and Nirvana.  Like Unknown Pleasures or Nevermind, the album holds up to repeated listenings, and begs for more.  But just like Nirvana or Joy Division, the pressure will be on to see whether these guys can deliver on their promise, or whether they will implode under the expectations.<br />Who cares if this is a commercial hit?  It might be better if it is not.  If you've had your eyes out for something different and a cut above, where the emotions feel real, your wait is over.
B00000ILBK|1.0|I have always thought that there is a difference between Star Trek fans (myself and others like me) who simply enjoy watching the TV shows and movies, and the sort of people who confuse it with reality.  The prior reviews pretty much prove I am right.  Any objective analysis of this film leads to the inescapable conclusion that it is awful.  The plot is weak, the characters more clowns than heroes, and the script preachy and unrealistic, even by ST standards. It is a shame to see such a great actor as Patrick Stewart acting like a feminized buffon, but that is essentially how Captain Picard behaves in this piece of tripe.  Worf stumbles through his scenes more confused than anything, and the old \\"Data goes nuts\\" theme has been used so much it reeks of decay.  The piece with Troi and Riker in the tub together might have been nice 10 years ago when they were in their prime.  By the time this film was done, though, it reminded me of the scene from \\"Friends\\" where the gang sees their neighbor,Ugly Naked Guy, being intimate with his equally ugly girlfriend.  Middle age paunches and wrinkles do not a sultry scene make.  It is almost unbelievable that this film followed \\"First Contact,\\" which by my estimation was the best ST film ever. I must give it one star because I cannot assign it a lower rating, otherwise it would have a big fat zero next to it.  Trust me on this one - just let it die; just let it die.
B00006AUIG|2.0|The creepiest thing about this movie are the images of the asylum itself, however, the director fails to use the creepiness to it's full extent.  Showing eerie rooms in wide angle, and blinding broad daylight hardly adds to the suspense.  Take a few pages out of David Fincher's playbook, and get back to us.<br />This movie really is just weak.  The acting is awful (Especially the young kid with the mullet), the direction is juvenile, the script is pretty bad, and the casting... well... it's no surprise that David Caruso is the &quot;big named talent&quot; for this piece of junk.  <br />The worst part of this movie, is the extra footage, showing an interview with the writer-slash-director, who talks about &quot;his creation&quot; like he created the next &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.  Talk about being pompous.  This guy needs to get a clue.  He is one inch away from directing &quot;10-10-321&quot; commericals (come to think of it, I can safely say, that at least would hold the audience attention more than this steaming pile of clap-trap!)<br />The big mystery previously left unanswered is this:<br />I gave it 2 stars, instead of 1, because I live close to  Danvers, MA, where this film takes place.  That's it folks.  That's the reason.  Locale.
B000002572|5.0|I don't know what I can say that has not been said already. This album was an instant classic. It was a heavy rock record, so metalheads were pleased. It also had melodic tunes, so top 40 and radio fans were delighted as well. The band never quite put out a record as good as this again. Some people think this was made with computers and synths. It was 100% real life players. There are no drum machines. There are no studio musicians. This was the entire band, playing on their own record. The five guys you see on the back of the album did everything. That's pretty good given this records perfection. It is rare for a band to make a record with this lush sound, using only guitars, drums, bass, and keyboards. If you are a fan of 70's heavy metal, you MUST own this record.

B00006FXB6|5.0|Are you tired of hearing all of that nu-metal stuff on the radio?  Had enough of bands that can't spell their names right?  Well then, this is the band for you.  Queens Of The Stone Age are the most brilliant band to come out in the &quot;hard rock&quot; genre in many years.  I have been a huge fan for a few years and this album destroys their previous work.  If I were in a band, this is what I would want to sound like.  Musically, they are the most talented group I have ever heard.  Dave Grohl is on drums for petes-sake.  Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri are the best team in rock, hands down.  The records itself is like getting three different records in one.  The songs with Nick singing are very rough and fast, almost punk.  The songs with Josh singing are very melodic and rock at the sametime.  The songs with Mark (formerly of Screaming Trees) are both dark and heavy as hell.  If you like rock in general you will not be let down if you purchase this one.  I can't say enough good things about this record or the musicians that are on it.  It's too bad there are only 5 stars to give.
B000050XEI|5.0|I first heard Enya when I saw the movie 'Lord of the Rings' and was captivated with the song 'May It Be'.<BR>Words can't start to describe this 'Day Without Rain' album. It's also difficult to put it in any category. Is it pop, celtic, classical, christian?? Or all or none of the above??<BR>She plays all the instruments and does all the vocals on this magnificent album. How much talent can one person have?  I usually listen to an album at least 3 times before I try to write a review, but in the case, I just kept playing it over and over and it got better the more I listened to it. <BR>If you have surround sound available, you'll get an added bonus effect. Awesome!

B000007PSR|5.0|Well,everyone knows the story already...after leaving(or being left behind - only the Floyd can say for sure)Syd went on to record two studio albums and leave some scattered songs and instrumentals in the vaults.For years most was available on bootlegs of various sorts,mostly of bad quality.I was very happy to see this disc come out and fell in love with it on the first listen...the title track is one of the most compelling songs he ever wrote(David Gilmour-who produced most of his recordings- did not remember this song and it probally just slipped through the cracks and ended up in the vaults at EMI)and is a testement to just how out there and alone he really was.  Yes, it has versions of songs already available on the first two discs but it`s the title track and the odd bits of instrumentals that make this disc stand out.  Given the state of our world it is great to know that even if it costs them everything,the really great artists will always find a way to shine.Syd isn`t gone...not really - he just got lost and shared with the world just how it really felt to be alone with no way back.Spooky,brilliant and worth adding to anybodys collection.  I just found out that Syd died July 7th.....rest in peace man.

B00003CXZ4|4.0|I think I'm the only person out of my entire sphere of friends and family that actually liked this movie. I mean I really liked it, I think its great. Pierce does a great acting job, and the film doesn't insult your intelligence, it makes you work to follow key plot points. People actually have to pay attention to what is going on, which is something that is highly unusual in &quot;mainstream&quot; American cinema. So if you are a fan of somewhat more difficult films you should check this one out.
B00005B58Y|5.0|I'm rather shocked that only a few reviews have been written for<BR>this classic gem. I was expecting to see at least 50-100 avid Davis fans singing praise over one of the tightest and most talented lineups in Davis's recording history. If one of Davis's first Prestige recordings represented &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;, then this recording represents &quot;Cool&quot; in its prime. Tunes like &quot;Straight No Chaser&quot; (which I prefer much more than Monk's original version), &quot;Two Base Hit&quot;, and &quot;Sid's Ahead&quot; feature great muscianship and playfullness that will make this recording &quot;Cool&quot; for a long time to come. Davis and Coltrane are simply brilliant at their respective instruments, and Philly Joe, Paul Chambers, and Tommy Flanagan (?) keep the rhythm tight and bouncy. Anyone who is interested in developing a Davis collection which represents his various musical eras, *must* include &quot;Milestones&quot; in the collection. In fact, it seems hard to omit any Davis recording without losing an interesting piece of his history. &quot;Milestones&quot; may not carry the same weight of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; (but what can???), but nonetheless a classic in its own right.
0060920084|5.0|This book was my introduction to the cynical, twisted but always hilarious mind and writing of Bill Bryson.  The basic premise was to re-discover America after years of exile(?) in Great Britain by driving around the country and observing how life had changed in his absence.<br />A number of reviewers are put off by the fact that he does not hold everything that he encounters in mystical awe. He does on occasion, approach a mean-spirited tone, but more often than not his comments hit the mark. Others point out that he never stops and talks to the people of the country, but simply drives through.  Well, isn't that pretty much what America is today, a driving society.<br />All in all, a funny book that will bring back memories of that great institution, the Family vacation.  If you've enjoyed Bryson's other works, by all means check this one out, you won't be dissapointed.  If you're looking for an earnest travel log or some gentle folksy humor, you'd best look elsewhere.
0060989157|3.0|The essential message of The Dirt seems to be that excessive drugs, alcohol and sex will ruin your life, unless you are a member of a gritty, determined metal band, and then they will ruin you life, but you will be (in)famous.  Reading the book could be equated to a mile-long car wreck on the side of the road involving everything from 18-wheelers to Mazeratis--you just can't not look at it.<br />While the Pulitzer committee won't be calling anytime soon, the story is a fascinating one and benefits from being told by at least four independent points of view.  Readers looking for scintillating tales of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll won't be disappointed, but what actually makes the book worth reading is that ultimately, through their own words, these guys are revealed as human in the sense that the average non-rock star can identify with the outlandish members of Motley Crue on some level.  Not normal.  Not average.  But still human.
B00004W52U|5.0|This album is packed with wholesome sugar and fortified with ... Their energy overwhelms you so much that you find you can't sit still. And the songs stick with you all day long to give you energy that won't fade. Truly a classic for third wave ska and likely to be remembered for generations to come.
B00005A46T|2.0|They can't write a decent song.  Joey Jordison knows what he is doing.  He's a great drummer.  The best part of this 9 piece band(which only actually needs 4 or 5 members).  I have to admit, Corey Taylor is a pretty good vocalist, he can scream pretty well.  His lyrics ... though.  Mick Thompson IS a good guitarist(I heard him play in a magazine that came with a cd, he actually can play), but why didn't he play any solos here?  There were some spots where a solo would have fit right, but no, Mick didn't play any.  Anyway, though there is some decent talent in this band, they have not managed to write a whole good song.  A few songs have their moments, but there is not a song on this cd that I can fully enjoy.  If you like this though, do check out Slayer, because they are obviously the band Slipknot wants to be but can't.  I recommend listening to some Slayer if you like this, then continue checking out some other real metal bands(Pantera, Meshuggah, older Metallica to name a few).  Soon you'll forget all about Slipknot and Nu-metal in general.
B000001FTJ|5.0|Tom Waits output from the seventies was very good.  His Beat influenced barfly personna playing a blues/jazz/Tin Pan Alley hybrid made him a unique artist.  With Swordfishtrombones he took unique to a new level.  Employing odd instrumentation, bare bones percussion and Marc Ribot's dirty guitar sound, Waits created the sound of a demented carnival.  The lyrics also take a giant step forward.  Johnsburg, Ill., A Soldier's Things and Frank's Wild Years show the for detail of a great fiction writer.  16 Shots(From a 30:6) and Gin Soaked Boy sound like authentic blues from the delta. This is the sound of a master bringing his art into focus.  And this was only the beginning (See Raindogs, Bone Machine and his two latest efforts Alice and Blood Money).  One of my all time favorites.
B00006AW2E|5.0|Granted, this version doesn't have the group's biggest hits, but it flows together nicely, with the soul covers and &quot;She Said Yeah&quot; brought together on the same CD, plus such fine originals as &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; and &quot;I'm Free.&quot;  While he is no Otis Redding, the young Mick Jagger brings passion and personality to the proceedings here, and the other members can more than hold their own with Booker T and the MGs, even without horns.  (And with them, they went on to give us _Sticky Fingers_ and _Exile on Main St._.)  The consistent excellence of this early album arguably makes it better realized than either _Aftermath_, even if the latter (which relies exclusively on original material) is generally seen as the turning point for the group as albums artists.  <br />Others might disagree, but I think that buying both the US and UK versions of this album, together with the weaker _December's Children, is completism run amok, too much redundancy for your money.  Instead, I recommend simply supplementing the UK album with _Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass)_, which will give you the stereo version of &quot;Heart of Stone,&quot; plus the famous hits from the US _Heads_ and _December's Children_ (&quot;The Last Time,&quot; &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; &quot;Get Off of My Cloud&quot;), featured with the rest of the group's American hits up through 1966's &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown.&quot;
B000005HCQ|5.0|Once again--what can be said in the face of sheer greatness? This album falls into my \\"possible greatest of all time\\" category.<br />Art Blakey is awesome. He takes his companions to the woodshed in the title track. If ever one single song was worth the price of an entire disc it has to be \\"Free for All.\\" There is no other song quite like it.<br />It'd be one thing if Blakey were blowing away your everyday jazz masters, but he's taking on the likes of Wayne Shorter and Freddie Hubbard here...no scrubs.<br />Don't let my focus on the opening track deceive you. The rest of the disc is outstanding as well. \\"Hammer Head\\" s one of my favorite songs to space out and drift away to.<br />\\"Free for All\\" earns my highest recommendation. The only shame is that I can only give it five stars.
0380820846|3.0|As the other reviewers profess, I too, was quite disappointed with this novel and the character development.  The identity of Lady Whistledown was highly unbelievable and while I was surprised, I didn't like who Julia chose to be Whistledown.  It just didn't work.  As for Colin, he's the worst brother in the family.  The other brothers were fantastic and had great personalities; however, Colin's problems with his writing and being horrible to Penelope was bogus.  That part of the book was awful and just dragged on.  Penelope should have shot him.  All in all, I would only recommend this book because it's a part of the series, but you certainly don't need to read it to continue with Eloise.
B00006AW2E|5.0|Let's put it this way, this is the end or culmination of the early Stones, the final album devoted to blues and R&B covers before the middle period of original Elizabethan/Victorian/Blues/Folk/Pop/Rock.  Though there are always exceptions in every period.    If you like this period, you will love this album.    Yes, there are noticeable track differences between the USA and UK versions, and, these have already been noted.  You may purchase several USA CDs ('The Rolling Stones Now!', 'Out Of Our Heads', 'December's Children...') and not need to purchase this CD.  But I have always preferred this track order and if you are so inclined I highly recommend this CD.    Musically, the material is strong.  The original compositions show that Mick and Keith have been paying attention.  It almost makes you wonder how did they come up with something as strong as 'Heart Of Stone' as if it was really written by someone much older and experienced in songwriting and life.        Technically, I don't recall this album ever being released in stereo (other than electronically reprocessed). The fact that 'Heart Of Stone' does exist in stereo implies that a stereo version of this entire collection might be created.  Barring that happening, the new remaster sounds great and I have enjoyed pumping up the volume at home and in the car.    My favorites:  Have Mercy  Hitch Hike  Gotta Get Away  Talkin' 'Bout You  Heart Of Stone  The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man (not a B-side in the UK)  I'm Free (I very much like what I call the George Harrison inspired guitar break)    So, yes, for an album without a big hit single (as was the case for many of their early UK albums), The Stones equalled the material they showcased on another of my favorite early Stones album from the UK, 'The Rolling Stones No. 2'.

0064407667|4.0|I've been expanding my reading in Children's and Young Adult literature of late. I have read some really great authors for the first time. One author who strikes me as particularly engaging is Lemony Snicket. His books have not only riveted the attention of my children, they have spoken to me at the same time but on a higher level.<br />In my experience, \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" the first in Snicket's \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" series, grabs the attention of children. They feel for the Baudelaire children. Their main reactions have been to the injustice of what the children are forced to go through. They celebrate the Baudelaire's eventual pseudo-triumph.<br />Yet all the while, what I relished in Snicket's writing was the dripping irony and sarcasm (the book is soaked in it). A particular joy for me was the narrator's simplifying definitions of big words for the kids...they serve to put quite a spin on things.<br />These books are rather short--you can read them in a day if you're adult (and they must make a fortune for the author). My wife has listened to books one and two on tape (read by the terrific Tim Curry) and says they are hysterical.<br />Getting unanimous approval for anything in my family is tough. So this book must either be pretty good or pretty weird. I think its both.<br />I recommend Lemony Snicket's \\"The Bad Beginning.\\"
B000065V1V|5.0|Ever since Ziggy Stardust every David Bowie album has a theme or concept - &quot;concept album&quot; is the term I often see reviewers use.  Ziggy Stardust, Diamond Dogs, Station-to-Station, &quot;Heros&quot;... all have their underlying concept or theme.  Thus Bowie has the reputation for being a &quot;chameleon&quot; - he is at home with many different concepts.  (There is no doubt in my mind that Bowie is a genius.)<br />On Heathen the theme I detect is the appreciative-to-wistful-to-angry rememberences of prior experiences and acquaintences.  I've been listening to Bowie since the early 70's; his music was part of the culture at a time when I met all kinds of interesting people and formed great friendships.  And I lost a lot of them.  And lately I myself have grown nostalgic for the way things were and I wonder how those people made out.  I wonder how I made out.<br />Into this consciousness walks Heathen.  It's rich in nostalgic feeling.  By &quot;nostalgic&quot; I DON'T mean in any way that this music is in any way a retread of old sounds - to the contrary, the music is fresh.  It rocks.  What I mean is that this is Bowie being nostalgic, reflecting on his past life and letting us see the thought processes and feelings he's gathered through the years.<br />Some of the tunes are wistful, some rock.  There is a wide range here.  And every tune is worthy.  My favorites are &quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Cactus&quot;, &quot;Slip Away&quot;, &quot;Afraid&quot;, &quot;I've Been Waiting For You&quot;, &quot;I Would Be Your Slave&quot;, &quot;Everyone Says Hi&quot;, and &quot;A Better Future&quot;.  (Which is most of the album, I guess!).<br />With regards to nostalgia, most of these tunes are obviously related to that theme.  I would point out the appeal of &quot;Everyone Says Hi&quot; (you are remembered by others nostalgically, too!), and both &quot;Slip Away&quot; and &quot;A Better Future&quot; (remember that your children are forming their memories now, which they will reflect on for years to come).<br />Maybe this album is meant for the older fan of Bowie.  Fans who want look back on the contours of all those years and understand what they see.<br />It strikes a chord with us.
B00005T30L|5.0|It's been almost 20 years since I left high school.  Seeing this movie brought back how I felt at the time I was at that age.  The surprising bit is that I still feel the same way, more or less, about the world around me.  Young people have the uncanny ability to see the absurdity and the hypocrisy in the \\"adult\\" world.  Most of the young people, after they enter the world of adults, will become the \\"adults\\".  The character Seymour perfectly captured the essence of that rare adult who still can see the absurdity and hypocrisies among his fellow men without being bitter or sarcastic.  Sure, the world may see Seymour as a looser, but 1% of humanity will embrace him as something original.  The characters, the passing commentaries between them, and the current consumer culture it portraits remind me so much of what I've been feeling all along.  To me \\"Ghostworld\\" is not a teen movie, it's a movie that speaks to me and speaks my thoughts.  Check out David Sedaris' \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" in book-on-tape form if you loved \\"Ghostworld\\".  Sedaris, being in his 40's, is still an alienated teenage at heart and can see the world around him much like Enid did in this movie.
1577311523|5.0|This is the most life-changing book I have ever read.  Eckhart Tolle is not only a spiritual master, but has that special gift of being able to communicate his understandings through writing in an accessible manner.  The Power of Now would be on my VERY short list of books to take with me if I were to be stranded forever on a desert island.  Reading this book with an open mind and heart will end all of your suffering - no matter what kind or how intense - forever: guaranteed!
B000005H40|4.0|What is there to be said about Blue Train that has not been said? If you're looking for a great Coltrane album, you could do a whole lot worse than this one.<br />Here we have a more laid back Coltrane. This is swinging, loose and stylish music at its best. Blue Train is an exceptional recording--from beginning to end.<br />This is in no small part due to the group of musicians Coltrane surrounded himself with: Curtis Fuller is nothing short of amazing on trombone; Lee Morgan is more than memorable on the trumpet; and the rhythm section here simply cannot be beaten.<br />Words come up short when trying to describe the greatest music. That is the case here...get this CD. You will not be sorry.
B00003CXXS|2.0|JURRASICK PARK III is a movie that I remember asking myself - did Sam Neil (Merlin, Bicentennial Man, Event Horizon) read the script before doing this? Yes it's got state-of the-art CG (Computer Graphics) dinosaurs and incredible integration of live-action, animation and animatronics but it didn't have the most important element, a story. Sam does an incredible acting performance as the `Dinosaur Man', but even he can't save this one. And now I know why Spielberg just produced this one.<br />The premise is very simple, two, not-to-intelligent people hang glide near the Isle's of Prehistoric land and one happens to be a very resilient child played by Trevor Morgan (The 6th Sense, The Patriot, The Rookie). Of course the two divorced parents played by Tia Leoni (The Family Man, Deep Impact, Hollywood Ending) and William H. Macy (Pleasantville, Boogie Nights, Air Force One) convince Sam Neil and young and impulsive scientist played by Alessandro Nivola (Inventing The Abbots, Love's Labor Lost, Carolina) to come along and the rest is completely predictable. The new twist is that the Raptors now communicate with each other and plan and plot. All they needed were suits and ties and they would lawyers. There were several eat-away characters (people that you don't know as talent that end up being Dinosaur lunch) that didn't stand out except the limited comic relief of the talent of Michael Jeter (The Green Mile, Patch Adams, Mouse Hunt ).<br />This one was directed by Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer, October Sky, Jumanji  ) and it seems he went for the predictable sure camera style in giving us the threat of danger and it seemed the performances might have been pushed and more formula then natural and developed.<br />Technically the film is sharp and interesting to look at, but it reality it is a slow moving and typically cheats with camera moves and jump scares in very obvious places. Overall the young crowd will like the dinosaur attacks and actions but the adults, like me might yawn a little. (9-9-02)ht yawn a little. (9-9-02)
B0000399WI|5.0|I just had a few comments. One interesting thing about this movie is that it occasionally shows up as the #1 movie on lists of the 100 top movies of all time--a movie that many people probably wouldn't have thought of for that rarefied honor. But whether or not it deserves such an august place in movie history, there is no doubt that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the most engaging and memorable films of recent years, and perhaps of all time. It's one of my favorite movies, and one of the few movies I have been able to watch more than once. For me, that's extremely rare and is another indication of how good the movie really is. The movie has a great story, great acting by Robbins and Freeman, and a great ending. You can't ask for much more in a film, and whether or not I would vote it the #1 position or not, I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly a superb movie and good enough to be on any serious movie afficionado's must-see list.
B000066NW0|5.0|I keep seeing reviews of this cd (and of Avril Lavigne in general) that are of the opinion that since she is not the biggest punk since the Sex Pistols that we ought not only avoid her cd but also drag her out in the street and stone her.<br />I don't know how punk she is, frankly I'm not entirely sure what punk is (how exactly do you define it when you hear of everybody from Blink 182 and Greenday to the aforementioned Sex Pistols being included in the category?).  However (to paraphrase the old adage) I may not know punk but I know what I like.  And I like Avril.  <br />That said, I can only say that while neither the lyrics nor the musical talents of the band are the greatest I've ever heard, Avril does have a good voice and she knows how to use it.  Most tracks on this cd are catchy, the king that you find yourself humming while driving.  <br />The standout tracks (in my opinion) are \\"I'm With You\\", \\"Anything But Ordinary\\", \\"Naked\\" and (the possibly overplayed) \\"Complicated\\".<br />If you're open-minded and interested in a rising star with an excellent voice, give Avril a try.  But don't bow down and worship this cd because MTV and I tell you to and don't burn effigies of Avril because some cynical reviewer tells you to.
B000066F6H|5.0|I normally hate this type of music, but The hives are a great example of rock. Just pure rock. This is going back to the old school.
B000069I1H|4.0|SHOWTIME is a really a funny, funny movie. I think Eddie Murphy (I Spy, The Nutty Professor, Mulan) is one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood. And teamed up with Robert Dinero (Analyze That, Casino, Midnight Run), who is doing a lot of comedy these days, the acting pair creates some very funny stuff.<br />The story is about police officer(and actor) Murphy and real detective Dinero being teamed together for a reality based TV show produced by Rene Russo (Adventures Of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle, Ransom, Outbreak). Of course they are complete opposites, they hate each other and they don't want to do this with each other. As an advisor they hire none other than T.J. Hooker himself, William Shatner (Star Trek, Miss Congeniality Dumbfellas) - excellently playing himself the actor, to advise them on being TV cops. The rest is bad guys vs. good guys and a lot of comedy in between.<br />Of course the end all is that they bad guy gets his due, the ladies get their man and both Murphy and Dinero earn valuable lesions in friendship and trust. Not mention they even include the bloopers during the credits - and I love when movies do that. A lot. The film was directed by Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) in his second feature film<br />The DVD extras feature a great and interesting commentary by the director and the producer and a lot of behind the scenes and deleted scenes. Also there is a cleverly written making of special that has William Shatner as the host. Bill is obviously having fun doing this and he doesn't mind making fun of himself too. And, at near 70 years old, he can still run and role and jump over car hoods. Not bad Bill!<br />I enjoyed this movie and DVD a lot. It has some great car crashes and chases and some interesting staging of events as well as the clich&eacute; `Hollywood' types that give Hollywood its public impression. I would get this just for the `fun' of it! (9-9-02)
B00005NB0H|5.0|This may be the greatest live album ever made. At this point in their career, The Who put on one of the best shows in the business. For todays young listeners or those not familiar with the band's history, you will recognize the incredible influence these guys have had on Rock from Punk to Grunge to Garage. The C.D. also makes a convincing case that Keith Moon was the greatest drummer ever, and John Entwistle the premiere bassist. For diehard fans, this is simply a must have. If you've only heard the abbreviated version of this album, get the deluxe edition. The former is like judging a movie after viewing the trailer.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Though John Mayer's voice may seem like Dave Matthews, but his music certainly doesn't. His songs are not only unique but intelligent.  \\"No Such Thing\\" is a wonderfully insighful song about college. While \\"My Stupid Mouth\\",\\"Neon\\", and \\"Why Georgia\\" are great also. \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" is a bit upbeat for the mood of the song but has well-written lyrics as well. Great-fell good music. I highly recomend it!!
6305090564|5.0|Deep Rising is a really fun film, filled with excitement, humor, and gruesome special effects. My only complaint is that the monster occasionally looked hokey, but most of the time it looked good. The movie is obviously set up for a sequel, but I doubt there's going to be one. The DVD only has a trailer and a recommendation list for extras, but the sound and picture are superb. Great score by Jerry Goldsmith.
B000067G3C|5.0|SPEED is a fun movie with a lot of action, explosions, action, humor, car crashed, action, suspense and did I mention action? Screen directorial debut of renowned cinematographer Jan De Bont. (Twister, The Haunting, Tomb Raider 2) He did a fantastic job with camera, action capturing and keeping the camera always moving.<br />The story is very interesting and some incredibly believable performances. Keanu Reeves ( Chain Reaction, The Matrix 1 & 2) and Jeff Daniels (My Favorite Martian, Terms Of Endearment, 101 Dalmations ) play two SWAT officers assigned to rescue several people trapped in a high-rise elevator by a disgruntled ex-police office brilliantly played by Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, Rumblefish, Hoosiers ). His plan fails and as a result Dennis gets really made and seeks revenge. Enter innocent Sandra Bullock as a regular gal thrown into a situation that makes her character stronger and extremely likeable. Enter the bus, a regular MTA bus that becomes the `real' star of the movie.<br />Keanu and Sandra have some great chemistry going and the action that this bus goes through is non-stop. Everything that is thrown at them is figured out rationally and then something totally believable is thrown at them again. AlanRuck (Star Trek: Generations, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Young Guns II ) gives a great performance as an out-of-towner who happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br />The DVD extras are great. Several interview sequences with the cast and the director as well as several technical featurettes that explain the 12 busses needed to make this film. There is a music video, trailers, promos, scripts and artwork and storyboards. This film is very technically clear and educational for the novice who really doesn't know much about stunts and filmmaking.<br />This is a great DVD collection and series and with the commentary Jan De Bont is very enlightening as well. As far as action films this is a good film to have in your collection. `Speed' this one home. (9-9-02)e home. (9-9-02)
B00000DFMM|5.0|I first heard Dr. Mabuse in march 1984 in a discomix broadcast show in our country (which was called \\"In the mix\\" at the time). I was immediately struck by the haunted beauty of the song... Ofcourse I heard the 12 inch-version first, so I had to get my hands on it while I was just getting into Propaganda. After this great single it was quiet for more than a year for the group and they didn't release anything during this period...Then they released Duel (eye to eye) and this was their 2nd groundbreaking single-release... Finally their 3rd was, ofcourse, P-Machinery (together with the long awaited album A secret wish). I never forget those moments when I heard these singles (specailly the first!), because they were SO AHEAD OF THEIR TIME, just like other stuff from ZTT in the 80's. This album deserves a great remaster WITH all the b-sides and extended versions. It should be the icing on the cake, really...
0441009425|4.0|This is a rich, rich world, full of mysteries.  Comparable to Niven's Known Space, but 21st century in outlook.  Reynolds does a great job of setting things up on a collision course.  The collision itself is somewhat disappointing, especially at the end, but he effectively sets up new challenges for the series.  I will definitely look for the next book.
B00003CXB4|5.0|If you have good stereo system this movie is great to see,<BR>especially if you have all speakers set-up in \\"surround\\" studio or layout you'll hear the sound effects crystal clear.<br />Some examples in the movie:<br />1) Simba meet Uncle Scar<BR>2) Simba's dad (Fauso), got angry with the laughing Hyena...<BR>3) Towomba & pomba singing<br />Just to list a few that I can remember...<br />Have fun
0553212737|5.0|Unlike some of Austen's other famous works, EMMA centers around a beautiful young woman, quick and clever.  Though at twenty-one, she is sitting a bit high on the fence as regards marriage, this is of little importance.  Emma the character professes not to desire marriage.  This is a decision of privilege, and one that is not seen much in many female characters appearing in novels of this time.  The reason Emma has the luxury to refuse marriage is not her strong will or great intelligence, it's her great fortune.  Emma need not marry because she does not need the money and thus security that a husband would usually bring a woman of lesser fortune and social status.  Emma will inherit from her father, and she already enjoys a high position in society.  It is therefore not necessary that she marry for any reason beyond love, and when we first meet Emma, we find her skeptical of love and determined to progress slowly into old maidenhood. Long before Maslow developed his Hierarchy of Needs in the field of psychology, Jane Austen understood intuitively that one had to remove physiological need and want before one could get to the greater things of life, like love and self-fulfillment.  The beauty of Austen's setting and the social status of her characters, is that since the accumulation of wealth by any one character is virtually a given, and that to speak of money directly is an almost unpardonable social error, these characters are freed to go about their vain, frivolous lives completely unencumbered by thought of where the next meal will come from, or whether or not it is prudent to send one's child to school or to keep him at the farm.  Actually working for one's living is definitely unfashionable, and the best position to have is one where you've accumulated so much wealth that you can sit on your estate, live off the interest and not discuss how much money you have or where it came from.  True, social status counts for much, and much of social status is determinedby the amount of money in one's bank account-but the greater determinant of social rank lies in birth.  The daughter of a character with little money but a good name might still be a good catch.  The daughter of character who has amassed a great fortune, but done it in some vulgar way or not married well is not such a good catch.  In either case, it is not really the amount of money one has, but one's position on the social ladder that Austen wants us to pay attention to.<br />As usual, Austen addresses her characters with great wit.  Of her title character in EMMA, Austen wrote \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\\" and sets about doing her best to fulfill this prediction.  From the first, Austen seems to regard her character with a smirk and a wink.  Within the first few paragraphs she is characterized as \\"handsome\\" and \\"clever\\", yes, but Austen also speaks \\"of the real evils of Emma's situation,\\" namely \\"the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself.\\"   Yet it is clear that by the end of the novel Emma's character will have changed from one of vain frippery to that of a good, noble woman, modest and sure of her true responsibilities.  You always know how an Austen novel will end before you even start it; the fun is in GETTING that far.  EMMA is no different.  An excellent read for a rainy day.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Personally, I didn't find much of the music after 1980 all that interesting. Then I through a friend found QOTSA, and was home. Songs... is by far the best album yet. I've heard most if not all music associated with Queens/Kyuss/Mondo Genereator, etc.,and this album absolutely kicks [***]. Non stop from the engine starting ala Kiss/Destroyer right through to \\"Not saying goodnight, just saying...\\". The Mosquito Song is so dramatic, the constant build gives just enough tension to make for a striking climax and a beautiful finish to the album. My personal fave is \\"Song for the Dead\\", Grohl's drumming is miles above par on this track, and Lanegan's vocal is just awesome. Nick Olivieri's \\"Millionaire\\" is the perfect kickstart to the album, with just enough drive to make you want more. And Josh as always writes a most interesting and amazing pop-styled song. \\"No one knows\\" is truly stonerrock at it's best, Grohl's drumming on this track builds unlike no other song from this timeframe.I also love the complete 360, turning to early 60's pop for \\"Another Love Song\\". This is the band that will save rock and roll, and this album is their calling card.
0553213105|5.0|You are going to read many a review of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE [P&P] wherein the author of said review will, with great superciliousness, state that this novel is NOT just a chick book, NOT just a piece of fluff, but instead a work of such great sociological importance that its message cannot be ignored.  I'm here to tell you different.  P&P is most DEFINITELY a chick book, ...<br />This isn't to say that P&P has no value to its readers.  Certainly it must or English instructors would stop putting \\"OPTIONAL: AUSTEN OR THUMBSCREWS' on their syllibi.  But what IS its value?  The great moral lessons it imparts?  Its grave lessons in proper deportment?  Of course not.  P&P retains its value simply in being a good read.  This is perhaps the most finely crafted love story of all time.  Without the aid of a tip sheet from Harlequin, Austen manages to hit all the high points of a typical romance [excepting the lamentable lack of a sex scene], & still provide enough social commentary & moral/ethical guidance that even the most unromantic among us cannot but be interested.  It is in this manner that Austen has for years been able to fool Academia into believe that her work is anything but a sweet little love story, albeit a decidedly complex one.<br />Novels are read for different reasons.  Some novels are important, and they are knighted with the celebrated title of \\"literature\\", and though no one truly knows why, or what makes them good literature, there is the vague idea that such works much teach you something.  That nebulous idea of imparting some great knowledge or insight into our existence is imperative-it's one of the 3 miracles needed for a work to achieve the saintly shroud of \\"literature.\\"  Some novels are just ..., but are read by the masses on the sly, tucked into their laps as they ride public transportation; the half-dressed, windswept maiden & man or the bloody, dripping knife on the cover safely hidden from view.  Austen's P&P truly fits in neither of these categories, though its square peg can be stuffed into \\"literature's\\" round hole with little abrasion.  It is simply an ESSENTIAL novel, a must read for every generation, owing to the fact that it is an excellent story.  It doesn't have to teach us anything.  It simply has to be entertaining, and PRIDE & PREJUDICE is, to the utmost degree.
B00003CXXP|4.0|This move is full of answers for not yet formulated questions. Fifty percent of the story is explicitly told, the other half if revealed through the film's unique atmosphere.<br />Watching A.I. you learn what R.I.

B00006EXDM|5.0|Containing 21 classic Rolling Stones hits from the period before fame got the best of them, \\"Hot Rocks\\" is the perfect collection for the casual fan.  Although the Stones have managed to survive for more than three decades since this anthology's 1971 ending date, they haven't recorded as many great songs in those thrity-plus years as are included here.  The track listing reads like a playlist for classic rock radio, \\"Satisfaction,\\" \\"Get Off My Cloud,\\" \\"Paint it Black,\\" \\"Brown Sugar,\\" \\"Ruby Tuesday,\\" \\"Under My Thumb,\\" \\"Jumping Jack Flash,\\" \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" etc.  All of these prove that in their heyday the Stones were among the best singles bands ever, even if their studio albums tended to be more uneven.  Even one of the few less well known songs included here, \\"Wild Horses,\\" is a masterpiece which was written for Gram Parsons and was the signature tune for Parsons's influential band, The Flying Burrito Brothers.<br />Overall, a classic double disc anthology album that will be of interest mostly for fans who want the Rolling Stones's biggest hits without having to buy all of the albums.
B00005RIKD|5.0|For many, many years I have said the same thing after buying a \\"major album\\" release from this man. This is his best work yet!  I would exclaim, then immerse myself in the album luxuriously for several weeks -- driving my friends and family mad from such selfishly languid repetition.  But this live concert took the horror of the day's events and transmuted it into pure and simple, stripped down Sting -- in the raw and dripping with meaning and emotion.  I have never appreciated him more.
B000002JSN|4.0|Though not quite on par with Led Zeppelin's masterpiece albums (that would be albums I, II & IV, though not necessarily in that order), \\"Physical Graffiti\\" is still an outstanding and ambitious album proving once again that Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and company were the best heavy metal band ever.  Sprawling over two CDs and leisurely paced, the album adds exotic Eastern sounds to the usual Zep heavy blues, most notably on the eight plus minute signature song \\"Kashmir,\\" which may be the best guitar playing of Page's amazing career.<br />Other Zeppelin classics on the album include another eight minute opus \\"In the Light,\\" a title track left over from their previous album \\"Houses of the Holy,\\" the lamentful \\"Ten Years Gone,\\" the playful \\"Boogie With Stu\\" and slow dirge \\"In My Time of Dying.\\"  Zep imitators like Deep Purple and Whitesnake couldn't achieve half this level of mastery on their best days.  Only the occasional slow moment keeps the record out of true five star territory.<br />Overall, a classic that turned out to be the last great studio album from Led Zeppelin.
B000066JES|4.0|The long awaited Manowar album has finally arrived. ... this is the very album die-hard fans have been salivating over.<br />After releasing two live albums between 96 and now, Warriors of the World is 45 minutes of bone crunching and triumphant symphonies. Many may view this as a toned down effort, with odd tributes (one most notably to a bunch of Elvis fans), the album still comes off as a typical concentrated effort from the Kings of Metal. Eric Adams sounds better than ever, and with such lyrics as \\"I'll hunt you down and tear you limb from limb\\" one can be sure that Manowar has not lost their edge.<br />There are, however a couple of surprises, like the famous operatic Nessun Dorma, and this is where Eric Adams truly shows his versatility in vocals. 6 year absence, two stellar live albums, and now this, Manowar truly show that they are Warriors of the World, fight for metal, metal that's real.

B00003CXTG|2.0|Mix the following ingredients on a wide-screen:<BR>65% predictable, maudlin, melodramatic script.<BR>15% computerized special effects to appeal to male audience members.<BR>10% bad acting using the combined lackluster efforts of Ben Affleck & Josh Hartnett for teenaged girl sex appeal.<BR>5% somewhat flavorful acting from Evelyn Beckinsdale.<BR>3% poetic liscence for historical inaccurracy.<BR>1% presentation of the Japanese enemy.<BR>0.7% predictable, flavorless acting from Alec Baldwin as the Navy pilot commander to Affleck & Hartnett.<BR>0.2% aged Jon Voight playing President Roosevelt.<BR>0.1% political correctness using Cuba Gooding Jr for an African-American Navy cook.<br />Bake for 183 minutes in front of a live audience of bored adults and swooning underaged girls.<br />This recipe changed little from Michael Bay's preceding directorial work of \\"Armageddon\\", except that he increased the teenaged girl sex appeal by adding Josh Hartnett to Ben Affleck and he also lengthened the baking time by 40 minutes.<br />Michael Bay had no intention of creating a war film with \\"Pearl Harbor\\".  Instead, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was merely the backdrop for the primary plot: a ficticious love triangle between Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsdale.  Had this film been less than 2 hours in length, it would have been far more palatable.  Few adults can eat marshmellows for three hours.<br />If you want a film that is more substantive and historically accurate, watch \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\".  If you want fluff, watch \\"Pearl Harbor\\" instead.
B00003CXDV|4.0|Ahhhhhh.... science fiction conventions. Promoters love them. Fans love them. The egotistical main star who is hung up on himself loves them. The only people who don't like them are the supporting stars.    No, I'm not talking about the cast of \\"Star Trek: The Original Series\\" (though it sure would apply). I'm talking about the cast of the Galaxy Quest television series.    Twenty years after the cancellation of their show, the crew of the NSEA Protector is still making the convention circuit rounds, and resenting the star of the series, Jason Nesmith (played by Tim Allen), who hogs the spotlight, doesn't seem to understand the concept of being on time, and is so hung up on himself that he can't see that everyone else resents him.    During one of these conventions, a race of aliens from outer space, who have mistaken the old Galaxy Quest television series for historical documents, come to recruit Jason's alter ego, Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, to help save them from their attackers. Can he and his resentful crew of washed up actors save the aliens?    \\"Galaxy Quest\\" takes a little while to get going. While the first several scenes are needed to help set up the rest of the movie, it does seem to take forever. The movie doesn't really pick up steam until the second half, but once it does it really gets rolling. It becomes a very funny and entertaining movie, more than making up for the slow first half.    If you are a fan of all of those old \\"outer space\\" television series, or just like to make fun of them, you will want to see this movie.
0140284087|5.0|Previous: The Inimitable Jeeves<br />While some of the stories in this collection pre-date The Inimitable Jeeves, it was published as a collection two years later, and so I'm calling it the second book in the series.  The stories in this set are all stand-alone and unrelated.  While many of them are charming, there is one that stands out far and away more noticeably than the others - the ingenious Bertie Changes His Mind.  I will not give away the wonderful twist of this story, except to say that Wodehouse pulls it off with flying colors, and it is surprisingly hilarious.  If the first couple paragraphs throw you a little, keep reading - you'll catch on, and you will be utterly charmed.  Another notable story in this collection is The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy, in which Bertie looks like a genius in comparison.<br />Next: Very Good, Jeeves
B00005JKJA|1.0|What does the script for this movie look like? Does it even have a script? This movie has no story/plot. The only good qualities of this flick are David Lnych's direction/cinematography, Naomi Watts (acting), and Laura Elena Harring (Damn she's fine). His writing is like whoa. This movie was 2:30 of nothing. It didn't explain anything. It's like a bad dream on drugs. Who are these people? What's going on? My friend and I watched this \\"masterpiece\\" and were not as convinced. This was supposed to be a murder mystery movie - it isn't. I wouldn't call this a movie at all - just images. This isn't a movie. He tries to show the viewer a story with images and no kind of dialogue. It's a nice trick but it doesn't work for most people. Most people will not like this movie. Amazon.com reviewer David Stewart will explain the flick but when you watch it I doubt you'll dig it as much as he did. It's not a hard movie to follow if you look into it but I must say RENT BEFORE YOU BUY. NOT EVERYONE WILL DIG THIS.
0394720288|5.0|Previous: Right Ho, Jeeves<br />This was my first excursion into the Wonderful World of Wodehouse, and remains my favorite (though others are in close contention).  The plot is simply brilliant, tightly woven together with twists and turns and ingenious irony, and flows directly from the story in Right Ho, Jeeves.  Between silver cow-creamers, little leather notebooks, ferocious dogs named Bartholomew, police constables and their helmets, angry neo-Nazis with buried secrets, and the looming threat of the soppy Madeline Bassett, laugh-out-loud comedy is inevitable.  Funnier still is the fact that once Bertie arrives at the dreaded Totleigh Towers, all the action takes place in one day and night, making this the most fast-paced of the Jeeves books.  This is one instance in which Bertie is never to blame for the soup in which he finds himself-it is thrust upon him by others, either by cajoling or blackmail, and Bertie's ever-good-hearted nature is taken advantage of to full extent.  It is Jeeves to the rescue once again.  The ending will leave you smiling-and finally able to take a deep breath and relax!<br />Next: Joy in the Morning (Jeeves in the Morning)
B000068TPN|5.0|In a review dated 9/9/02, &quot;Jason&quot; of Kentucky predicts &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; will sweep the next Academy Awards.  I certainly hope he is right, although I suspect any nominations it gets will be minor, while lesser &quot;Event&quot; movies grab the glory.  This film is profoundly moving, made so by a combination of  affecting moments, acting, musical score and editing.  The scene showing the nighttime departure from Fort Benning is made all the more powerful due to its being understated.  No long, drawnout goodbyes, just a nod from one wife, and three words from another (which is the only dialog in the scene).  Watch for Mel Gibson's small, sad, knowing smile as Chris Klein approaches him under the lights as they wait for the buses that will take them on their first steps from home to a nightmare.  If this scene doesn't make you cry, as it did an entire theater, you mustn't have tear ducts!<BR>All in all, this is a great movie.  Perfect, no, but a classic nonetheless.  See it. Support it.

0140284095|5.0|Previous: Thank You, Jeeves<br />One of the most popular of the Jeeves novels, Right Ho, Jeeves brings us to Brinkley Court, the lair of Bertie's Aunt Dahlia, who is by far my favorite secondary character in all the books.  This book is overshadowed by a decidedly antagonistic relationship between Jeeves and Bertie over a certain white jacket with brass buttons, and one can practically see Jeeves snickering in the background when his brilliant solution to the problems at hand is accomplished at Bertie's expense.  Nevertheless, he does \\"rally round\\" when needed, and saves Bertie from a fate more hideous than death, viz. marriage to the loony Madeline Bassett.  There are moments of laugh-out-loud hilarity in this book, notably Gussie Fink-Nottle's prize-giving at the local grammar school after drinking a jug of spiked orange juice, Bertie's very ill-timed question about haggis (a personal favorite of mine-the line, not haggis), and Aunt Dahlia's calm suggestion that Bertie go out to the garden pool and drown himself.  This is comedy at its brilliant best.  A wonderful beginning to a chain of events and characters that will follow in many books to come.<br />Next: The Code of the Woosters

B00005JKG7|5.0|i am, i suppose, a horror buff. since a young age i have enjoyed being scared by rollercoasters, walks at night, and, above all... horror films. i have seen many, and i must say that john carpenter's early work are among the best horror films one can sit through. His first film, HALLOWEEN, has been endlessly redone, its vast appeal and originality is still unrivaled today. But, lets forget about HALLOWEEN, shall we? mr. carpenter's follow-up, THE FOG, is what i would like to speak of for a moment. considered by critics to be a failure, THE FOG is the complete opposite of its hailed upon brother, HALLOWEEN. its is a deliberately paced, spooky little ghost story of revenge set against a beautiful widescreen ocean locale called antonio bay. the leader of a leper colony and his crew is sent to a watery death 100 hundred years ago by the denizens of a small community looking to set up their township with the colonie's riches. the waterlogged ghosts come back to do away with the progeny of the original townsfolk and retrieve the loot that is rightfully theirs. Carpenter, a master of mood and build, opens his tale with a right frightful montage of the town going crazy--car horns blaring, lights flickering off and on by themselves, etc. he brings back jamie-lee curtis, her presence always enjoyed, and the wonderful hal holbrook as a worried priest. then comes the true star, THE FOG itself. Carpenter makes us believe that THE FOG is an entity, creeping about as if it had a mind. THE FOG holds those unfortunate dead, and as it creeps closer, carnage ensues (though gore is at a minimal by todays standards). it all culminates at an old church with the principles in peril trying to escape with their lives.<BR>the dvd is a treat at the price. a wonderful commentary track with carpenter is divine, along with two documentaries, trailers, and a neat storyboard comparison. and as ghost stories go, this is among the best. highly recommended.

6305784116|5.0|I loved this movie as a video tape. So much in fact that I had to get it on DVD. I find it a pity that you can only choose between the English and a French audio track, I would have enjoyed a bigger variety of versions, but be it as it is. The trivia game is cute, my 5-year old daughter could answer almost all questions and was very thrilled. And I liked the story book read-along with options for smaller or bigger children to have it read to them or read themselves. All in all a great DVD for the whole family and I can only recommend it to all Disney fans!

B00003CXCQ|5.0|Okay, how do I put 7 stars as a rating? This is certainly the best buy I've made in a while! And a very good reason to buy the DVD even if you own the video tape already. I do and I'm glad I got the DVD because it has such an abundance of extras you can spend hours just reading, looking and listening. It contains not only a history that is presented charmingly and lively, a lot of galleries where you can check out the individual object at your own pace but also so many \\"goodies\\" like character studies, camera tests, abandoned concepts etc etc etc - I'm not one to praise if I'm not convinced BUT THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY times over! Not just for die hard Disney fans but for everyone!
0780623703|2.0|As a whole, the concept of the film and the visuals were great!  But there was a serious lack of continuity and just far-fetchedness.<br />For instance, we would believe that Pleasantville had no outside world.  Then who did they lose the basketball game to?<br />Even more curious, Maguire's character who so longed for family at the film's start, was not concerned at all that his TV mom would leave his TV dad.  In fact, he smiled about it.  This was supposed to be growth in him.<br />Somehow marital fidelity and sexual purity ... is as dark and foreboding as book-burning according to the screenwriter...  The film could've had something to say...
0451196716|4.0|The best King book I have read. Actually it's the only good one I have read. As usual he ruins another book by a terrible ending. A great read though. Would have been a five star book except he quit when it came to the ending. Make up your own ending and enjoy this read. Another problem I have is, why couldn't we have some politicians on this walk...lol....
B000068TPN|3.0|The movie is okay, good action and exploding body parts, so you won't be dissappointed, but don't expect any revelations about the war (other than - we were right). It's chilling to watch this movie and \\"Black Hawk Down\\" because you can feel yourself actually cheering when we blow up people in their homelands. So from that perspective, I think this was a little too patriotic and the timing kinda sad as well. It's like the movie makers assume we have no idea that Vietnam was largely about money and resources ... The other strange assertion the movie makes is that this is supposedly the first battle that ever took place between Americans and \\"Charlie\\". ...<br />One thing that did actually have integrity, and was in a way the basis for the movie, was the viewpoint from the average soldier as the war started. He thought to himself \\"I'm fighting for my country, I'm scared but it's for a good cause\\". And the movie did convey the average soldiers ignorance for political motivations, bravo.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Take notes.  There WILL be a test.<br />American Beauty is perhaps the most controversial film to ever win the Academy Award for Best Picture.  To understand why it won, and why its triumph was so disagreeable to a large segment of the American public, I offer the following observations as a public service:<br />American Beauty is a satire of middle America that exposes its hypocrisy comedically while massaging those parts of the American psyche (mostly big city sophisticates or well to do suburbanites) who feel superior to the bourgeois mind.  As such it makes those members of the audience who had expected to see a sort of Titanic of Suburbia uncomfortable while greatly pleasing fans of, say, Pulp Fiction or Blue Velvet.     <br />Another way to look at American Beauty is as an exercise in fantasy wish-fulfillment.  As such it delights those whose fantasies are realized and offends those who had different fantasies or whose fantasies remain repressed.  Annette Bening's character gets her unspoken fantasy fulfilled as she is sexually liberated by \\"the King,\\" a real estate salesman \\"clearly superior\\" to her mediocre husband, Lester, played by Kevin Spacey.  Lester of course gets to live out his fantasy, that of telling the boss to shove it while winning the heart of the teen queen of his adolescent dreams.  And Ricky Fitts, the boy next door, who might be your standard loser who eats his sack lunch behind where the drama geeks hang out, is in fact a smooth operator who deals dope discreetly (and successfully), gets the other beautiful girl and goes one or two up on his fascist dad.  He is a sort of Homer Simpson denizen turned into a Humphrey Bogart for the new millennium.  Note too that the gay guys down the street (except for their...uh, persuasion) are indistinguishable from any other over-socialized adorable yuppie couple just joining the community church.  This is a little joke on the heartland, and a sly, oblique wish-fulfillment for some Hollywood homosexuals.<br />Since about half the audience really did expect to see Titanic or its equivalent, and instead got satire (something they can never really understand) you've got to expect some outrage.  After all this was an Academy Award winning film entitled \\"American Beauty.\\"  What we should have here is an \\"America the Beautiful\\" kind of opulent production (perhaps with the \\"Heartland of America\\" feel of a Chevy truck commercial) done with the usual duplicity and an assuaging mentality.  Any picture the Academy votes as best picture of the year ought to make us feel good about ourselves, don't you think?  If we wanted \\"art\\" or liberal propaganda we'd have gone Off Broadway.  Instead we are made uncomfortable about our secret desires and our hypocritical life style and the little lies we tell ourselves and friends.<br />As for those who merely think American Beauty was over-rated: you get a B+ because you're right, it was.  If you also pointed out that Hollywood beat a few already very dead horses here (the war lover who is a closet gay or the straitlaced frigid wife who really just needs some vigorous sex) you get extra credit.  And for those who think this was a great movie, it can be said you might be right.  But any contemporary work of art, especially one that has as its subject matter the contemporary scene, can only be judged \\"great\\" some years down the road since we have, as yet, no real objectivity about ourselves or our culture.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|I do not understand why they bother remaking a movie which, the original version, was already a fine one.

B00000729S|5.0|Somebody -- I can't remember who, and I don't know why -- but somebody gave me the Monks collection, \\"Five Upstart Americans\\" and I listened to it a lot and really liked it.  They sound like a garage band, y'know, that does a little surf music, does a few songs about girls, probably wouldn't have looked out of place appearing in \\"Pop Gear\\"....<br />And I like it all right, and started looking into what other tunes I could get by the band.  At the time, they only had one other disk out, \\"Black Monk Time,\\" so I ordered it.<br />When it came, I looked at the songs and -- damn -- the songs were almost all the same as on \\"Five Upstart Americans.\\"  I was, like, \\"Shoot, these are just different versions of the same songs.\\"  <br />But I got home from work and put in the CD anyway, plopped my headphones on and thought, \\"I hope it's at least marginally different....\\"<br />And then it kicked in.<br />Bang!<br />You know that scene in movies where everybody's at the hop and nobody wants to dance and somebody puts a record on and all of a sudden everybody springs into action?<br />That's what this was like.  I literally sat straight up in my La-Z-Boy and dropped my jaw.  My legs, involuntarily, began to do what I believe is the Jitterbug and my hands reached toward the ceiling, trembling going \\"amen.\\"  <br />Yeah, these are the same songs, but here they're re-worked, streamlined, and gassed up full of juice.  The banjo sounds like a paint shaker and the organ sounds like a precision laser.  Trust me, that's a good thing.  It may not sound like it.  But it's a Good Thing.<br />And years later, this is one of those albums that I drag out every few months and listen to, I can't get away from it and wouldn't if I could.  This music puts chase sequences and \\"Endless Summer\\"-esque surf footage directly into your brain.   <br />Get this CD, even though you can't listen to snippets of it.  Get it, even though you probably never heard of the Monks.  Get it.  Get it, and maybe someday, everybody will know who the Monks are.
B000066AXE|4.0|This is a great film!  <br />I never really considered, much less understood, how a schizophrenic actually believed the hallucinations that spoke to him or her.  A Beautiful Mind actually allowed me to understand how this happens.  The film introduces three characters as real people who were, in reality (so to speak), not there.  Since the viewer is introduced to the characters as real people, it comes as quite a shock that they are hallucinations.  This same shock, though infinitely deeper, was experienced by John Nash when he was told these people did not exist outside his mind.  What a loss this must have been for him.  Thanks to A Beautiful Mind, I have a much clearer understanding of schizophrenia.  <br />Beyond providing me with insight into Abnormal Psychology that my teachers were never able to provide, this is a great film.  The storyline is magnificent, even if aspects of the true story were embellished.  John Nash went from being a brilliant mathematician, to being a plagued pauper, and back  - ultimately winning the Nobel Prize.  <br />All the way through this film the acting is superb.  In fact, I think this is the best acting performance by Russell Crowe.  It certainly has been his greatest challenge to date.  I thoroughly enjoyed Gladiator, but I think A Beautiful Mind was a more challenging role.  I was an extra in The Insider, and I know A Beautiful Mind was a more difficult acting assignment for Crowe.  I anxiously await his next project.  I believe he will get better with time.  <br />All the co-stars (Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany and Judd Hirsch) were solid performers as well.  I especially enjoyed Ed Harris in the role of Big Brother.  And, Jennifer Connelly was great too.  Her role was very emotional and she played the part extremely well.  <br />This film deserves the acclaim and awards it won.  Oscar winner for best picture, best director for Howard, best supporting actress for Connelly, and best-adapted screenplay.  Now that I have seen the film, I'm not so sure that Crowe didn't get robbed of a second Oscar here.  <br />If you have not yet seen A Beautiful Mind, I do not think you will be disappointed by it.  To the contrary, you will probably have a deeper appreciation for those around you after watching this film.

6305128952|1.0|Reviewer: mags from Concord, CA United States<BR>This movie was HORRIBLE.  I had seen the previews and thought it would be great. Although beautifully filmed, visually pleasing and a bit romantic, this movie stank. Afterwards, for reasons I cannot fathom, I read the book. The book was absolutely brilliant. For some strange reason, the people who collaborated to make this movie saw fit to massacre the book by completely changing the message and skipping important events and adding things that never happened in the book that certainly didn't add to the movie. The book was beautiful and poignant and had a better ending.

I get weepy over lots of movies, but rarely animated films (&quot;Bambi&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; begin the exceptions that prove the rule).  I think this especially surprised me because I did not think that &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was going to be that kind of a film.<br />The story is about Monsters, Inc., a corporation in the Monster world that sends scarers into the bedroom of human children all around the world to capture their screams, which are used to provide energy.  James P. &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan is the best of the best, and Mike is his assistant.  They are going for the all time record when something really, really bad happens: Sully accidentally brings back a little girl from the human world.  At this point, wackiness ensues.<br />The promotion for this film really made it seem like it the main character was Mike Wazowski, the frenetic one-eyed green dude voiced by Billy Crystal.  But this film is really about James P. Sullivan, the hairy blue giant with John Goodman's voice.  I was sort of disappointed that Crystal was not really stealing each and every scene, sort of like Eddie Murphy did in &quot;Shrek.&quot;  But this film is clearly Goodman's show (how did they ever avoid giving this man an Emmy for his flawless work on &quot;Roseanne&quot;?), and he shows you what he can do with just his voice.<br />Any doubts I had about the rating to give this DVD were quickly settled by the second disk.  You can read the list above of all the goodies you will find there, but the chief joys are (1) the hilarious &quot;outtakes&quot; Pixar always managed to come up with for their films; (2) the Original Treatment, which tells the earliest storyline about Johnson, the monster who dreams of being a star scarer; (3) an all-new animated short film, &quot;Mike's New Car; (4) &quot;For the Birds,&quot; the 2001 Oscar winner for Best Animated Short Film; and (5) a behind the scenes look at Crystal and Goodman recording &quot;If I Didn't Have You.&quot;  I think you will find that with numbers (1), (3) and (4) you might laugh more than you do while watching the actual movie, especially on (3) and (4).  My stomach hurt I was laughing so hard.<br />So, that's the &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; DVD in a nutshell.  You cry, you laugh.  What more do you need to know?) an all-new animated short film, &quot;Mike's New Car; (4) &quot;For the Birds,&quot; the 2001 Oscar winner for Best Animated Short Film; and (5) a behind the scenes look at Crystal and Goodman recording &quot;If I Didn't Have You.&quot;  I think you will find that with numbers (1), (3) and (4) you might laugh more than you do while watching the actual movie, especially on (3) and (4).  My stomach hurt I was laughing so hard. <br />So, that's the &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; DVD in a nutshell.  You cry, you laugh.  What more do you need to know?
B00005JKJA|4.0|Be prepared; if you don't like having to think about a movie, Mulholland Drive isn't for you. It is unlikely that everything would click for a viewer the first time that they watch the movie anyway...although viewing Lost Highway might be a suitable primer.<br />In many ways, Lynch seems to have issued the same challenge to viewers in Mulholland Drive as he did in Lost Highway, a bending of timelines and juxtapositioning of identities. It's as if the director is saying, through Mulholland Drive, \\"Perhaps I didn't make myself clear to you the first time.\\" For some reason (I don't know -- is it really the lesbian scenes?) the second attempt has been more popular. I find both movies compelling, unsettling, and entertaining.<br />That's the review. Here's an explanation.<br />The knee-jerk response of many reviewers has been that Diane dreams of being Betty, but wakes up to the cold reality of being Diane, and ultimately kills herself. That would make the movie run from Point A to Point B, which is what movies usually do.<br />But the dead Diane appears in Betty's world, and that was my first problem with this tidy explanation. Also, if you think the movie is purely linear, then Diane is psychic, because she dreams of Coco (the landlady) before she ever meets her in reality (the director's mom). Ultimately, Betty's world is no more of a dream than Diane's is; it depends on point of view, like a Mobius Loop. The reason one side is accepted as real is because of where the Mobius Loop is cut: right after Diane \\"sleeps\\" (dies). Splice the movie ends together, and you can't tell the \\"dream\\" side from the \\"reality\\" side. Much of this Mobius Loop is made of cycles:<br />* Betty begets the blue box; the box, once opened, begets Diane and the old couple; the old couple drive Diane to suicide but beget Betty; ad infinitum.<br />* Betty becomes Diane, and Diane becomes Betty -- not just the actresses, but the waitresses, too.<br />* Rita (Laura Elena Herring) of Betty's world coexists with Camilla (Melissa George). In Diane's world, Camilla (Laura Elena Herring), whispers to, and kisses a woman (Melissa George), at the party near the film's end. Maybe that woman should be called Rita. After all, everything else switches.<br />* Camilla (Laura Elena Herring), despite surviving an attempt by the limo driver to kill her, is effectively \\"eliminated.\\" She has to be replaced. She is replaced by...Camilla (Melissa George). When Betty becomes Diane, Camilla (M.G.) becomes Camilla (L.E.H.). And so on.<br />* Diane falls into the red pillow; Rita falls into the blue box. The Red World is Betty's/Diane's dream come true and Rita's/Camilla's nightmare; the Blue World is Betty's/Diane's nightmare and Rita's/Camilla's dream come true.<br />* Betty's apartment (Aunt Ruth's) is red and yellow; Diane's is blue and green. Many other warm/cool color motifs correspond.<br />* The red singer \\"dies\\" on-stage, and is effectively silenced, as the Red World reaches its twilight, and the blue box is discovered. The blue-hair in the balcony cries \\"Silencio\\" at the film's end, when the Blue World reaches its twilight: Diane's blue-smoke demise, but also Camilla's demise as well, as she will soon lose her limo ride, her movie role, and her memory. <br />Most importantly, the Silencio theater is a metaphor: What appears real -- a trumpet solo, a singer singing -- is false. In effect, Lynch drops the biggest hint: If you are looking for the reality in this movie, you won't find it.
B00003CXSP|2.0|Jodie Foster could have easily made $10 Million plus by agreeing to be in this movie.  Thankfully she put her integrity in front of her bank account.  She read the script and knew it was trash and refused to do this.  Jodie, I respect you for that decision.  What we have here is an elegant Friday The Thirteenth movie.  Silence of the Lambs was an intelligent psychological thriller.  Hannibal on the other hand is a big budget slasher film.  The plot?  Mason Verger, a man who was severely disfigured at the hands of Hannibal Lecture, seeks revenge by hiring thugs to kidnap Lecture and feed him to wild maneating bores.  At the same time Clarice Starling is disgraced by the FBI for an arrest gone wrong.  First, anyone with half a brain would have known the bloodbath at the beginning is no the fault of Starling.  He disgrace is merely a plot device.  So as Hannibal comes to the aide of Clarice he is captured, but not before he whipes out of team of Mason Verger's thugs in Florence, Italy.  In the scenes the cameral lingers long and close on the gore.  The purpose of this movie is not to entertain but to shock.  Ridley Scott did gore much better in his 1979 movie Alien.  The gore here is just redundant after awhile.  And then there is Ray Liotta.  He was so good in Goodfellas.  Now he's reduced to playing a crooked authority figure (He did it again in the equally bad John Q) who gets his brain fried and eaten.  Then there is the film's final scene in which Hannibal shares a piece of brain with a little boy on an airplane.  This in a nutshell is how tacky the movie is. Let's hope Red Dragon is better.
0790729628|4.0|Like most Philip K. Dick novels, this was a good story that was heavily revised, and turned into a great movie...with some strings attached.<br />When Blade Runner was originally released, it featured a film noir style narrative by Deckard (Harrison Ford). This was added supposedly at the behest of the producers, who sensed the movie was going to go over most people's heads. They were right, and Blade Runner still went over most people's heads, despite the narrative.<br />That spelled initial box office failure, or at least less than the expected science fiction movie success. On a gut level, the public thought they had this movie figured out, and it had to be Han Solo kills some naughty robots. Yet, instead of thrilling slam-bang action every minute, the public got a pensive examination of one of the greatest ethical issues raised in science fiction: How will we treat artificial intelligent life?<br />Fortunately, a large segment of the public has since warmed to Blade Runner's core theme, as well as to Blade Runner's rich, palpable cityscapes, which became the template for nearly every cinematic future-world wanna-be: Fifth Element, Judge Dredd, even the later Batman movies. Like most things copied, none of those movies could match the atmosphere of Blade Runner.<br />These key successes in Blade Runner are still present on the DVD, but...<br />...the re-release of Blade Runner in the early 1990s brought a few significant changes. Blade Runner had aged like a vintage wine, and audiences who had acquired the taste had no need for the narrative. Even to the uninitiated, an open and thinking mind was all that was ever necessary to keep up with the most important parts of the storyline. However, Ridley Scott also tempered his ending with a considerably less optimistic tone. Furthermore, and perhaps most controversial, was the scene in which Deckard dreams of a unicorn.<br />Director's Cuts are a controversy in themselves. But Ridley Scott wasn't just adding simple clarifications, or restoring footage cut to fit an optimal theatrical duration. Scott made a blatant change in the reality the movie projected.<br />Suddenly, Deckard's unicorn dream now played against the already-standing footage, later in the movie, of Deckard's sidekick, Gav, leaving an origami unicorn as a calling card. The implication is a strong one that Deckard, like Rachel, has implanted memories that the authorities know about -- that Deckard is an android, like those he is paid to destroy.<br />Unfortunately, like a hip Rick Berman idea for Star Trek, it's chic for a moment, but wreaks havoc with the established universe. The Director's Cut transformed Deckard into the android the cops picked to stop other androids. Unfortunately, he must have needed his annual tune-up. Deckard gets tired, he can't run as fast or jump as far as his quarry, and he responds to pain quite realistically through near strangulation, beatings of the face and head, neck wrenching, nose mangling, and having a couple of fingers broken backwards -- all of this from single combat with the androids he's supposed to retire. Maybe the authorities should have invested in a Nexus 6...preferably the combat model.<br />Well, like the idea or not, there was the Director's Cut. Which would be fine if the DVD let us watch both versions. Unfortunately, the original version of the movie is not on the disk. Most other movies with differing theatrical and director's cuts feature both versions on the same disk, inserting or bypassing scenes to present the appropriate version. The absence of this option is the greatest dissapointment in the DVD issue of Blade Runner. <br />Like Captain Bryant says, \\"No choice, pal.\\"
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I agree with the reviewer from south bend. This get 3stars because of the songs and the fact that this is the only place you can get these songs digatally remastered even though it is the sloppy stereo mixes. Apple and capitol did not have the beatlefan in mind with this (same thing with the upcoming Elvis and Stones hits collection) I understand the concept is number one hits from both sides of the atlantic but by sticking with this concept they eliminated some of there best songs (some of which are on the red and blue albums) like STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER and NORWEGIAN WOOD. This was designed for the TRL fan while that is o.k. it would have been nice to introduce them to some of there other masterpieces. This does not give their more innovative songs. For us beatlefans will have to wait for apple to finaly digitally remaster the entire catalog. The Stones just did theres.
0307120007|5.0|A friend gave this book to my son for his first birthday.  At first, he didn't mind it at all, since the cover is in pastel colors.  But soon after, it became his favorite book!  He does all the tricks ahead of me, like patting the bunny and putting his finger in the hole.  He just loves it!  We read and play with it at least 5 times (yes, 5 times, i memorized it already!) each time he picks it up, which is at least 2 or 3 times a day.  Instead of just reading to him, get him involved with books. And this is the perfect book for the job!
B000002KLZ|5.0|I see that people are complaining about the quality.  Remember this was a live recording originally released in 1980.  I had the Fleetwood Mac live 8 track **Actually I think it was even a double 8 track** for this CD for goodness sake.  For the time period and the type of recording available back then, this CD rocks and is a must buy for all Fleetwood Mac fans.
B000063UR2|5.0|I have always loved this movie since I first saw it in the 80's.  This DVD is great, although I wish it had more on Tom Cruise in the interviews.  The theatrical release continues to be my favorite.  I can't get through the Director's Cut without laughing every other scene.  First of all, Lily's singing gets irritating...and the melody isn't even attractive.  Then there's Jack, who has even cheesi-er parts that I'm GLAD they removed from the theatrical release (ex. jumping and flipping in the air, watching him eat a cookie..etc).  The music is *The Sound Of Music* style...and i prefer the enchanting fairy-like sound of Tangerine Dream's music on the theatrical release.  It seems to fit more.  Princess Lily seems more of a spoiled little girl in the Director's Cut.  Jack begs her not to touch the unicorns, but she turns and looks at him as though to say &quot;Just try and stop me&quot;....which angers me.  Darkness was very well done by Tim...and the fairies and other little creatures are fun to watch.  I just prefer the Theatrical Release.  I believe it's a better experience and doesn't drag out so much.  Buy the DVD for the sharp picture and extra features.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Many people thought that not many war films could reach the brutally realistic environments created in Saving Private Ryan, how they were so wrong! <BR>Even though not a film but virtually a continuing 10 hour one, Band Of Brothers has to be one of the most shouted about DVD collection coming out November 2 2002. The series is based upon an American C Company in world war II. They train at home and then find themselves in volved in one of the biggest human assaults in a single day. The Company have been trained as para-troopers who can parachute behind enemy lines and then function as a soldier. <BR>The series carries on from there with some very graphic scenes similar to that of Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. Each episode has a kind of sole meaning throughout each, differing from episode to episode. In my opinion it has to be one of the best series on tv and now coming to DVD wil allow us all to view behind the scenes footage of the silming and actors comments.<BR>Forget Friends, this series will simply blow you away. And for a measly (Money) for 6 discs who could argue with that, Bargain as David Dickinson would say! BUY IT!
079284632X|1.0|I saw &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; on September 22, 1972 with 2 of my friends.  I was 16 years old.  We only made it through about 1/2 the movie.  We left when the huge knife flung up.  This movie was gruesome, and I can hardley recommend it.  I was so shaken up about this movie I could not sleep for weeks.  Even now I feel upset writing this.  I have since rented the movie to compare how I felt then to how I feel now.  It still has an impact, but not as much as it did back then.  I believe that is because movie content has changed over the years and there are far more disturbing movies out today.  I had no idea what was going to happen in the movie and was shocked to see what happened to the 2 girls that hitch hiked into New York City to see a concert.  If you like gore and watching psychos in action, rent this movie.  I guarantee you will feel sick after you see it.
1401207529|5.0|After deconstructing Batman in THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS and changing the way comics are written in the process, Frank Miller tackled the history of Batman by examining Bruce Wayne's first year as Batman in BATMAN: YEAR ONE. Personally, I enjoyed this novel much more than DKR. Gotham is a gritty place, full of corruption and slime. However, it is redeemable. Lieutenant Gordan (not yet the commissioner) and the new vigillante Batman illustrate that through the work they accomplish. However, though Gordan and Bruce Wayne are heroes, B:Y1 points out that they are only humans too: Gordan has an affair with another officer during his wife's pregnancy and Wayne is almost killed in his first attempt at crime fighting. The book is full of emotion and character and much more humanity than some of Miller's other work, and it makes for great reading.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Well, I don't have that much to say on the film, except for the fact that they could have called this &quot;Titanic 2&quot;.  Same love story, just not as interesting because we had seen it all before.
B000006IUQ|5.0|When famed writer David Mamet turns his attention to the fascinating subject of man's nature and his struggle to survive in the wilderness, the likelihood is that a fascinating movie will result. And with this depiction of a small group of men, including a reclusive and introspective fifty-something tycoon (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a shifty and conniving fashion photographer (Alec Baldwin), Mamet sets the stage for a mammoth struggle for the survival of the fittest as he pits the men against both a wily Kodiak bear as well as against each other. The other members of the stranded party is killed by the bear in quick fashion, leaving only Hopkins and Baldwin try to improvise some way to figure out how to get back to civilization and outrun this bear with an appetite for humans.<br />There are a number of subplots running through the action sequences, and a number of plot twists that serve to illustrate that it isn't necessarily the strongest that survive so much as it is the smartest and most adaptable of the antagonists. Yet this is not merely a testosterone-enriched script, for there are a number of elements in the story that lend themselves to viewing the characters (including the bear) with compassion and understanding of the complex ways in which the way we behave both actively and indirectly influences our chances at surviving.<br />In the midst of all this action and plot activity remains the singular beauty of the landscape, and in all their travails the characters are consistently outshadowed by the sheer scope of the topography, climate and setting of the great Alaskan wilderness.  It is almost as if the director is suggesting we get ourselves sand our petty personal concerns in context and perspective, and seen against the shadow of the great outdoors, their troubles seem much smaller and more manageable indeed. This is a great movie, a film with a great story, interesting dialogue, and a terrific ensemble of actors supporting the thrust of the tale. Enjoy!!
B00003CXI1|4.0|Wonderful DVD for almost all ages. This is a charming tale beautifully told. The characters are endearing and well crafted. My wife and I surprisingly watch it again and again. If it has any weaknesses it has to be the special features section. The pulsed video effect and clunky interface was disappointing. Take my advice and just skip the &quot;tours&quot;.
0385720920|3.0|Let me preface by stating this is only the second Palahiuk novel I have read. I understand what he is trying to do and say here, but heads up folks, this is not for the queasy. Nothing by the likes of Easton Ellis has ever really gotten under my skin like the two books by Palahiuk have. \\"Choke\\" is wrenching (pun intended.)
0380789035|1.0|this book is just terrible, and i regret that i even spent a moment of my time and money for this nonsense. first of all there was no plot and evrything was vague. i was kept wondering what the real story was wether it was about the gods, about the main character shadow or laura who rose from the dead. the writer did not seem to know how to connect these characters together and just went from scene to scene which were irrelevant. i don't know what the hoopla is all about this author and i'm purely disappointed. after reading the reviews on the first page of the book i expected to at least enjoy the story but sad to say this is a terrible book.
B00005JKJA|5.0|The first time I watched Mulholland Drive, I didn't know what to make of it.  It made no sense to me, and I couldn't make head nor tail out of it, but I wanted and needed to see it again.  The second time I finally managed to understand most of it (there are still some things I don't get yet), and I came away with a new outlook on the film.  David Lynch knows how to craft emotional and haunting moments, and Mulholland Drive is no exception.  Lynch pulls out all the stops just as he did with Blue Velvet (although I still feel Blue Velvet was a superior film and Lynch's best) and takes you on an emotional, heart wrenching roller coaster that will haunt you long after viewing it.  Naomi Watts' talents are greatly underrated, she absolutely shines here, as does most of the rest of the eclectic cast including Justin Theroux, Laura Elena Harring, Ann Miller, Dan Hedya, Angelo Badalamenti (who also composes the music to the film, as well as many of Lynch's other films), Billy Ray Cyrus, and Robert Forster.  All in all, Mulholland Drive is not a movie for naive audiences; those expecting a straight forward thin storyline should look elsewhere.  Mulholland Drive is a dizzying, addictive mind trip that those looking for a film with intelligence will enjoy.  If this is the first David Lynch film you've seen, pick up the new special edition of Blue Velvet too.
0802130208|5.0|Simply put, Confederacy is an American treasure and quite possibly the funniest book ever written.
0375703861|4.0|It is really a good book but too many details.And sometimes I am bored. But the book is really good and sometimes I felt Irie isa friend of mine.
0316666343|5.0|I could not put this book down. I literally stayed up all night just so I could find out what would happen next. It wasn't even a matter of suspense, it was just that the range of emotions brought out by this book kept me reading until I reached the last page. It's got a bit of mystery, a bit of love, a bit of suspense, a bit of sex, a bit of fear, etc....(I think you get the point). My point is: READ THIS BOOK!!!!!
B00006GA4C|5.0|As I was reading some of the other posts, I couldn't help but notice that someone posted saying that the Canada release of the CD was equal in sound.  You have got to be kidding me!!!!  When I purchased this Cd, I entered it into my car stereo and the clarity and raw power including mel's bass blew me away.  David Tedds did an exceptional job on the rematering of the Album.  Also I noticed the post included that the bonus material wasn't worth it.  Well I on the other hand loved the \\"Nothing is the Same\\" demo.  It has a whole different sound to it and different melodic breaks and tempos.  Also there are some very nice fill-ins on \\"Mr. Limosuine Driver\\"  Overall in my opinion this was Grand Funk Railroad's prime album.  I loved everything else that they ever completed, but this was at a time when Grand Funk was the heaviest and loudest band on the planet.  The only others that could compete were maybe Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath at the time.  After ON TIME was released in 69, there were several things that Mark (farner) wanted different.  For example the drums on ON TIME were put in front while Mark's guitar took a backseat, as did mel's bass.  But on \\"GRAND FUNK\\" (RED ALBUM) Mark is in full force driven by the most powerful bass player in the history of rock, and the best drummer ever to grab the sticks.  Every note on this album is perfect. Don is exceptional and Mel makes the bones in your body vibrate.  Mark is playing his Messenger, which sounded great and gave the album that rusty, edgey feel. The combination of Blues/hard rock takes this album and makes it one of the best albums ever.  songs like \\"Please don't worry\\", \\"Got this thing on the move\\", \\"In need\\", \\"Paranoid\\", and \\"Inside Looking out\\" showcase the band's talent.  One thing about Grand Funk is that no one song of the bands has ever sounded the same.  So in response to that one post, this album is obviously worth your hard earned money, you won't be sorry.  You might even cry a tear after hearing the musical ingenious that went in to the album. 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Also check out the other 3 remasters in the package-ON TIME, CLOSER TO HOME, THE LIVE ALBUM.  Enjoy
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay Has Outdone Themselves Once Again! Parachuttes was a great cd with tracks like yellow,trouble,high speed, ect... But Coldplay once again has done a great job on releasing another cd! A Rush Of Blood To The Head Contains Great Tracks like Track1 Politik Is Great song to begin this album Track2 In My Place Was a great single to release their album Track3 God put a smile upon my face has great guitar and piano sounds! its good &amp; In My point of view the best song on this album would Be Track5 CLOCKS! What A great song, from begining to end, It has so many elements (Piano) that make it a song you just want to listen to over and over again! Not only these Tracks are good, the hole Cd is as well. All In one, This Album Is Great! Its Does not deserve 5 stars, It deserves 10 stars! If anyone is thinking in buying this album, STOP Thinking, buy this album you will have not regrets what so ever! You Will Be hooked to it very quick, You will love it! COLDPLAY Is A Unique band and I hope To hear more new music From Them in The Future! ROCK Rules!
B00006BCAZ|5.0|For those who lament that recent Porcupine Tree albums have moved toward a more song-oriented structure, &quot;Metanoia&quot; is the cure for what ails.  Recorded during sessions for &quot;Signify,&quot; this album full of improvisations never fails to impress.  Of particular note is the muscular and rhythmic team of Colin Edwin and the now-departed Chris Maitland.   Worth your time.
0060392886|5.0|I was a club owner (gentles club) in the mid eighties when the Crue was at there peak, I can tell you that this book is a very acurate protrayal of there life. It's a great book, Each of the guys tell there storie, and it's all very wild, SEX, DRUGS, more SEX! When ever they came to Houston, there management would lease out the club for a private party and pay all the girls very nicely. It was one big Party All Night for two nights str8. I've seen Vince at my new club a couple of time in the past year, and we still talk about the old days, and the parties!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I thought Harry Potter was a pretty good movie.  The acting was great (especially Snape and Dumbledore), and the so were the special effects.  There was just one problem.  It stayed wayyy too close to the story.  I've read the books and I love them, but I still think they should have made it somewhat original.  I'm sure some people like it completely accurate, but I found it became boring, epecially since most of the dialogue came directly from the book.  Still, it was a good movie, even for people who haven't read the book, and I think if you have the time it's worth watching.
B000066NW0|5.0|I luved this CD. it is amazing. Avril is a new, fresh taste of music and it rocks! She is doing well to have signed a deal with such a well known record label. Some bands take 10 years to join! and she had one at 16!--her lyrics speak directly to the teen troubles most of us gurls are going through(boys).<BR>The Canadian rocker looks like a (prettier) member of Sum 41, sounds like a slightly less angry Alanis Morissette and has the streetwise 'tude of Pink. Thus, her tunes range from the pop-punk of \\"Sk8er Boi\\" to the perfect pop prance of \\"Complicated\\" to heart-tugging ballads like \\"I'm with You.\\" Overall, This CD is a must buy!
B0000524E5|1.0|I was forced to watch this film with my girlfirend. I admit to being a film snob, and ask alot of the film i watch. But when it comes to mindless Buckhiemer stuff i really dont mind them. Then i saw this. Badly acted, scripted and directed. This film represents the kind of mindless stagnation that hollywood seems intent on sticking with. Films like this are a disease on what sould be and is ( sometimes) one of the most creative and efective media forms of the modern day. Please for your own sanity dont bother.
B000063V8T|5.0|Season FIVE of the beloved Star Trek NG was incredible because of the ongoing character development. ALL of the major characters, of which there are many, are maturing and incredibly distinct from one another. From acting, writing and plot development - Season Five was incredible year for the NG team. The show is just now getting ripe and boy, oh boy, does it taste good! ;)
