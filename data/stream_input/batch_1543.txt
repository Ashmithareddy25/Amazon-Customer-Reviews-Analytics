B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read a lot of love stories and this book was entertaining from the beginning to the end. My heart fell for the bad boy and I loved the tension between the two main characters. I couldn't put the book down.
B004W648Y2|5.0|Well, VILLAGE GREEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY certainly didn't deliver on the commercial front, did it? Never mind that it would go on to become the most acclaimed and biggest selling non-compilation album of their careers! Still, that must have smarted a bit for the Ray and the band. Surely, now that their artistic statement, their self-indulgent art project, their bigtime themed album wasn't an immediate sales success, The Kinks would return to a formula that would tilt them more towards huge commercial success right? RIGHT?!!<br /><br />Psshaw. The Kinks were just getting warmed up. In early 1969 there was approached by Granada TV to work them and develop a program that would feature songs by the band. They were keen on the project, although by this time Pete Quaife had left the band and was replaced by John Dalton. Still, they cut the album over the summer of 1969 and while the TV play/movie never ended up going into production -- much to the frustration of Ray Davies -- the album dropped that October anyhow. Loosely inspired by the emigration of elder sister Rose and her husband Arthur to Australia, the album retained something of an overall storyline but really felt more thematic then anything else. It echoes the traditions of the past but now in a more restrictive light; \\"knowing your place\\" and all that. There's also the loss of servicemen for King and Country, the resolve of the British character, but all for what really? A house, a car, maybe a TV set or a radio. The loss of children, to bullets, to distance, to a new world of changing social mores. What's the sum game? Sometimes the love you take is a buttload less than the love you make.<br /><br />As detailed in the liner notes, Arthur was definitely not named after a Once and Future King, but of the third son of Queen Victoria, who was safe and married and traditional.<br /><br />Well anyway... all of this is fine and dandy, but how is ARTHUR(Or The Decline and Fall of the British Empire) as an album? I'd say, pretty freakin' great. REALLY great, another classic album in a long line of classic albums. The album's production values are the finest to date, the songwriting and arrangements lush and assured, and a sense of driving purpose carried over from VGPS to create another lasting work of artistic vision. The result is one of the band's finest albums, and yet another top-notch work from a premiere band at the height of their prime.<br /><br />The songs are eclectic enough, but united by theme. Victoria rocks right outta the gate, catchy as sin but a grounded rocker with layers of overlapping guitars and centralized driving riff. The proud brass lines that accentuate the bridge are a great touch, but first and foremost this is a strong guitar-driven rocker. Switching gears immediately, a military-styled snare opens up Yes Sir, No Sir, a more theatrical number loaded with strong horns, orchestrations, and Ray's affected, slightly (and purposefully) off-kilter delivery. The song switches gears halfway through, a strict authoratitive response to clamp down on any potential individuality that opens the song. \\"If he dies we'll send a medal to his wife...\\" It segues into the slower, sadder Some Mother's Son... the song is a really quite heavy-handed, but the descriptive moment of Arthur's son's (or brother's) death, and the image of the mothers waiting for news of their sons at war contrasted against that of mothers waiting for their children to come home from school -- pretty hardcore.<br /><br />Drivin' is more of a VGPS throwback, indicative of Arthur's yearning to ignore (or deny) the troubles of world in favor of a simple family drive. It's a swingin', backbeat musical hall number that's catchy as all get out. We get back to the RAWK with Brainwashed, which indicts Arthur's acquiescence to a servile, know-your-place-and-shut-up mentality. Check out Dalton's funky bass playing, those strong R&B horns, and Dave's sweet distorted guitar tone. Great song, totally cooks.<br /><br />Now we get to the album's two centerpiece songs: Australia and Shangri-La. One represents a newer world, one free of repressive traditions of Britain, whereas the other represents the comforts of home and quiet virtues of steadfast humility and servitude. But it's not as if the album decides one is better than the other. There's certainly a mocking attitude towards the starry-eyed optimism of Australia, which is unique so far in The Kinks output as it ends with a long, lenghty jam by the band. The \\"jam\\" element has been both criticized and praised. My reaction is to it is pretty muted but slightly off-center towards the positive side. I dig it, but it's not exactly mindblowing. But it doesn't really need to be.<br /><br />Shangri-La is ABSOLUTELY EPIC. This is one of my favorite Kinks tunes, ever. It starts soft and acoustic, and builds into this total beast. The song pities Arthur's life and home situation, driving home that he's stuck in life and can't really go anywhere with himself. On the other hand, he owns his house (and \\"most of his car\\"), but he's locked in place for life. Which is preferable, the promise of Australia or the certainty of Shangri-La? With an song as amazing as this one, who really cares? This is TOP NOTCH KINKS.<br /><br />Mr. Churchill Says is probably my least favorite track so far, although it's far from a weak song. Musically it's far more interesting than its lyrics. I love Dave's minor-key solo and band noodling that closes the song out, which definitely elevate the song from meh to decent. She's Bought A Hate Like Princess Marina is pure theatrical Kinks (and a harbinger of the upcoming RCA era if there ever was one). Good song for what it is, especially as a more caustic riff on the absurdities of life at Shangri-La. When it turns into pure ragtime, you're either loving it or you're moving on to the next track. I was loving it personally. I'm a big fan of this kind of swing. So eat it, Harvey.<br /><br />The album's first portrayal of real unmasked emotion comes in the ballad Young And Innocent Days, a simple lament for the loss of innocent optimism. I'm particularly a big fan of the vocal harmonies between Ray and Dave on the verses and chorus. It's a lush, beautiful number. The acoustic licks at the song's end are quite lovely. Nothing To Say is the emotional flip side to Young and Innocent Days, in which Arthur's son basically lays it out to his Pop that \\"we can't do tomorrow what we did yesterday\\". It's probably the most \\"pop\\"-like song on the album: very musical, catchy chorus, solid and steady beat.<br /><br />Finally we wrap everything up with Arthur, a satisfying ending to a great album. The tone of the song is guitar-driven and rockin', with an almost uplifting chorus that feels just about as upbeat as you can imagine. Too bad the song just totally DAMNS Arthur as an unsatisfied loser, even though it understands and loves him for it. The world is passing poor Arthur by, and he's lost to his traditional ways, ones that keep him kept down and trivialized. But at least someone out there loves him for it. Or whatever. It's a fine song and a great ending to a fantastic album.<br /><br />It took me a very long time to warm up to Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) as an album. It's definitely one that didn't grab me from the get-go, like VGPS or Something Else. Looking back it's hard to say why, exactly, because I think the album is absolutely killer. If VGPS is still my favorite Kinks album, Arthur is right behind it. At least for now. This is yet another ESSENTIAL Kinks album and a classic in its own right. The Kinks weren't just firing on all cylinders at this point; they were the ENTIRE melon!! No idea what that means...

0399230033|5.0|My baby loves this book. A zookeeper says good night to the animals only to have them follow him home, thanks to the shenanigans of the gorilla. The illustrations are colorful and even beyond the different types of animals at the zoo, it is full of things to point out to your little one (where is the mouse and banana? what kind of toy is that?).<br /><br />There is really not much text to read in this book, and I find myself supplementing the story with commentary (\\"oh my, there's a gorilla in their bed!\\") As the mother of a baby boy who for a long while wriggled his way into bed with mommy and daddy, I find the end of this book relatable and endearing.

0812992792|3.0|Part One of this novel concerns the title character, Pak Jun Do, the Orphan Master's son, who grew up in an orphanage work camp and as an adult learned English and became a sort of professional kidnapper. For me his story was by far the best part of the book. Part Two The Confessions of Commander Ga, seemed strange, confusing, and somewhat surreal. Things never became clear to me (the big scene near the end being especially unbelievable), although up to the final page I believed that if I were patient and paid very close attention (which I tried my best to do), all would be revealed and what happened up to that point would then make perfect sense. Unfortunately, such was not the case. Although much of the book was pretty bleak, the story had an occasional uplifting and/or positive moments.<br /><br />Had I not recently read several non-fiction books about North Korea \\"NK,\\" I think I could have enjoyed The Orphan Master's Son more. The most recent, Nothing to Envy Ordinary Lives in North Korea by Barbara Demick, is one of the best non-fiction books I've read in a long time. Its info combined with that of Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West by Blaine Harden (which I'd read just prior) and two others that I'd read nearly 18 months earlier (Euna Lee's and Laura Ling's memoirs of their experience as captives of the NK government) provide a lot of information not only about \\"ordinary lives,\\" but also the famine, the prison camp system, the social hierarchy and, of course, the country's leader who was revered as a godlike entity. Prior to reading the aforementioned titles, I'd watched an excellent, though heartbreaking documentary entitled The Megumi Yokota story which concerns the NKn abduction of Japanese citizens. Having absorbed a decent amount of NK-related information from various sources, I probably ended up spending too much of my time thinking about the various occurrences in the story and trying to fact check my memory against what I knew to be true based on these other books. Then again, if I hadn't read them I may not have had the interest to bother with this novel. In summary, engaging story (Part One) becomes confusing in Part Two. Better (if you only have time for one book): Nothing to Envy Ordinary Lives in North Korea by Barbara Demick.my memory against what I knew to be true based on these other books.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I never read these types of books but I heard a review and was curious. I have to say as an open minded (but yet fairly conservative) 30 year old I was oh so pleasantly surprised. From the reviews on the radio I did not think I was going to like Christian at all but surprised even myself by not only liking him but finding him in my regular thoughts. A really good page turner, spice up the love life, heart pumping kinda book. I would not call it BDSM. Its not too boundary pushing but packed full of \\"moments\\". 5 Stars ?

1606995359|5.0|Uncle Scrooge \\"Only a Poor Old Man\\" is another fantastic volume in the Fantagraphics Books' immense undertaking of reprinting the entire works Carl Barks in affordable and accessible volumes.  When I first started getting into comics as a kid I heard about the great stories done by Carl Barks, but there wasn't an easy way for me to read them and see what the big deal was.  Up to this point I have read more Duck stories by the great Don Rosa.  Rosa tied many of the classic Barks stories into a coherent continuity which makes these original tales all the more interesting to finally read and enjoy.<br /><br />For those of you who picked up [[ASIN:1606994743 Walt Disney's Donald Duck: \\"Lost in the Andes\\" (The Complete Carl Barks Disney Library)]] (and if you haven't, what are you waiting for?!? Buy it too!), FB has made a few adjustments to the presentation in their second go-around.  Lost in the Andes was split into three sections with three separate table of contents;  Long stories, 10-pagers, and gag pages.  This Volume has one table of contents at the beginning of the books.  The longer stories, shorter stories, and gag pages are intermingled throughout the book, and in my opinion this is a better way to introduce this work to new readers.  Again included are notes on each of the stories and a short bio of Carl Barks as well as a re-printed introduction by George Lucas.<br /><br />As an adult I can safely say that these books will be enjoyed by anyone of any age that enjoys colorful characters and fun adventure stories.  I can't say enough about the great job and care that has been put into presenting these classic duck tales.  This is the best way to read these stories.  Everything from the paper quality to the coloring job is outstanding.  I'll be looking forward to each subsequent release in this series.  My hat is off to Fantagraphics Books for making these stories available and at such affordable Prices.  Unca' Scrooge would be proud!

B004LSO6YI|5.0|Life captured at each emotional step. This story could be about my partner and me. This is a story about encountering, so unexpectedly, the one to be your soul mate. The story winds through discovery, connection, complication, longing, denial, unwinding, and resolution of love. I felt each moment with Elena and Peyton. I wanted to be them. In one movie, the intense desire that a woman can have for a woman, is proclaimed to the viewer, to me. You will be absorbed into each moment that the women have together. I wished it could be true life for Elena (Necar) and Peyton (Traci), and you will, too.  I cannot say this too strongly, you will want Necar Zadegan and Traci Dinwiddie to really be in love, to have a life together. I have watched this many times; if you are a loving, feeling, yearning woman...for another woman, I know that you will, too.

B000002UB2|4.0|I was almost extremely happy when I opened this new vinyl of Abbey Road and saw the apple label on the center of the record, then I noticed the capitol label insignia stamped in small print. I said to myself you can't have everything, so I put the disc on the turntable and the sound quality was not what I had expected from a new vinyl. I thought it may be my stylus, or cartridge. I then put on my old copy of Hey Jude and though there was some crackle at the lead in, the LP sounded like the Beatles were right there performing. For an old original Apple pressing that is over 30 years old to out perform a brand new pressing is quite a shame.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really tried to give this book a chance. I read 150 pages in before I was overcome by the cheesy writing. First of all, the sentence structure is short, and not in a Hemingway, to the point, good way. I give the writer credit for at least researching S&M, and maybe that is why some people may like it. Maybe they have never read other works about sex.  Second of all, character development is weak. You have two big typical pre-teen romance protagonists. Case in pont: Our lovely heroine has to be taught to shave her armpits. Finally, Poorly crafted sex scenes might make you laugh. You do not need to read this mindless drivel. Low moments: You are a vigin? Why didn't you tell me?! We need to \\"take care\\" of that right now!\\" You CAN find eroric works that do not stoop to such lows. There is great erotica out there and not all of it is in the erotica/pornography section. Try the human sexuality section next time you are in a bookstore if you are curious about sex. You'll be writing your own story without wasting money on these books. Ive read bathroom walls that are more erotic.

B008KNUKVI|5.0|Ever since their time on the Sing-Off (now cancelled, regrettably), the world is discovering the truly creative, mesmerizing potential of a cappella to not only mimic but elevate the source material in today's mainstream pop.  In a musical age less driven by vocals and more diluted by autotune and synth sounds, Pentatonix reverses the evolving paradigm by showcasing vocals that can capture all aspects of modern record production.  The five voices behind Pentatonix provide a truly harmonic and robust sound that features a versatile, heart-pounding bass, an eclectic and dynamic percussion, and a stirring melodic line replete with runs and riffs and textured with amazing supporting vocals.  Their innovation in building an electronica hip hop arrangement is on display in their lead cover single \\"Starships\\" (originally performed by Nicki Minaj) and their music sensibilities and ambitious arranging really shines through in \\"Aha\\" (originally performed by Imogen Heap).  Their direction as a group lies not only in taking the most difficult songs by a cappella standards, but also creating their own original material that undeniably blends with contemporary sounds and beats.  \\"Show You How To Love\\" (written by the bassist, Avi Kaplan and percussionist, Kevin Olusola) achieves this feat remarkably.

0439023513|2.0|I enjoyed reading the first two books, but, the third one I was trying my hardest to like it. I feel the ending was strange only because there were a few things that happens that made no sense. Katniss almosts seems to have a different personality in this book from the others. I would say from Chapter 20 to the end is when I was finding myself no longer liking the book.
0439023521|5.0|So I realize I'm behind on this \\"Hunger Games\\" phenomena, but I've finally jumped on that bandwagon. I recently bought the entire series, and in less than 24 hours I've already devoured the first book of the series.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a thrilling futuristic tale of a country and government gone terribly wrong. The country, Panem, is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol. The Capitol forms the government that pretty much controls all districts, and on a specific period of every year, there occurs what is called the day of the Reaping. The reaping involves randomly choosing one boy and one girl of every district to participate in the annual Hunger Game event. With 24 participants, there can only be one survivor. The purpose of this appalling game? To remind the people who is in charge, and who is in power by punishing their children after the districts attempted to rebel against the Capitol many years ago.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is reality TV at its most realistic. It is a fusion of Big Brother and Survivor, only at its most extreme. With the cameras, the government surveillance, the public mind control and the political agenda involved it reminded me so much of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four - which is another futuristic, yet classic novel written in 1949. To me, this almost seemed like the young adult version of it, and I think that's fantastic. About time someone ventured to write such a serious novel, placed in a fantasy fiction setting with a blend of romance, for the younger generations to read. In fact, parts of it (specifically those that took place in the arena), was very reminiscent of Lord of the Flies in its savagery, and other parts of it reminded me of Harry Potter's Goblet of Fire tournament.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins, you are a genius. Finally, another good series I can obsess about - the last one being J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.<br /><br />Okay now, off to read the next installment!

030758836X|1.0|Gone Girl had me asking myself..\\"huh?\\" most of the time. The main characters were not realistic- they were very contrived. Too many superlatives and trite descriptions used to establish their characterization. Many of the characters in the story were described stereotypically which was disappointing reading. The story line was so convoluted and weird it wasn't plausible. Her over use of gratuitous sex descriptions seemed like a banal made for TV movie. Finally her general characterizations of women throughout the book made me wonder what the author has against women? Amy was intelligent but psycho, Go was sweet but somewhat witless to help her brother, Boney seemed too gullible to be a good cop and Amy's mother and other mothers were portrayed as manipulative. The writing was tight in some spots however this book was a disappointment.

0345803485|1.0|There's been plenty of valid criticism about this book already but I wanted to weigh in with some thoughts.<br /><br />Reasonable people will agree that this book is terribly written and contains obvious logical flaws, but I think the more troubling aspects of this novel are the characters and their relationship.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is quite simply the most unattractive woman imaginable.  She has no interests, no confidence, no hobbies and barely enough love for herself to actually question whether it's acceptable for men to control her.  The constant self-deprecation is bordering on self indulgent.  It's ridiculous to think that Christian would have even the most remote interest in Anastasia.<br /><br />Christian Grey meanwhile is a classic misogynist sex addict who manipulates and objectifies women, which is somehow acceptable because it is codified in a legal document.  Without direct knowledge or experience with BDSM culture, it is hard to believe that the relationship between Anastasia and Christian could in any way be considered healthy.  Christian's language is pretentious and affected, his treatment of Anastasia is condescending and beyond controlling; he insists that she drive only a car he provides instead of a car she herself owns.<br /><br />My issue with this novel is that it somehow validates very unhealthy attitudes about gender roles.  The only redeeming quality one could potentially find in Anastasia is that she is well-read; somehow she skipped over feminist literature.  Anastasia feels so powerless to do anything for herself, her existence so banal that she allows herself to be controlled and even beaten just to have a man in her life.  Is this the kind of character we want to define our popular literature?  We have some real thinking to do if Anastasia is the voice of the modern woman.<br /><br />In summary: It's very alarming to think about the many women who have such low confidence to identify with Anastasia.  A very sad reflection ofour society.

It came with a lot of cool stuff like Bunnie's toe, a cool mug, patch, and a lot of other awesome stuff but I'll be honest, I only got it for the rug mouse pad. this mouse pad really ties my desk together.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This cable is so bad that Amazon should recall it.  As reported by the other people who gave it one star, the cable insulation totally disintegrated, and the cable no longer worked.  I guess and hope that Amazon has already refused to have any more dealings with the fly-by-night company that manufactured it for them, and have found a legitimate supplier.
B0056JJY2K|5.0|Shane, will in my opinion live on forever. It is truly one of the great 'CLASSICS OF ALL TIME'. If you have never heard of it, buy it, if you have, have not seen it, and love westerns, they don't get any better than this. This was not only a excellent movie, but in my opinon, if they had chosen any other actors, and actress to play this part, don't think would be the 'TRULY CLASSIC IT IS\\". Do yourself a favor, (only if your a 'TRUE WESTERN PERSON'b buy it, you will never forget it\\".  clee1234ok@yahoo.com.

B005LAII94|1.0|There is not a bus large enough to throw this film under.  It qualifies as a Drive In second feature when the fourth film playing is the one you paid to see.<br /><br />Dialogue is incredibly poor.  Written at a third grade level, this movie danced around the homosexual side story while continually pandering to the ongoing three person relationship.  While these two ideas are irrelavent to the main story, law breakers and their lifestyle, they become annoying through redundancy.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro, who is both capable and always worth watching, could not draw this bucket of trash movie back from the abyss.  Taylor Kitsch fans have another performance to enjoy but his character is not sympathetic. Selma Hayak, at the waning end of her sex appeal, fared no better with this script writers poor attempts at dialogue.<br /><br />This should be the last time Oliver Stone is given money to put a film together.  His 28th attempt at entertaining us has fallen so far short of the mark as to aggrivate all viewers in the theater,<br /><br />Seriously, save two of your life's valuable hours by refusing to waste them watching this.
B007Z9R69M|4.0|Haywire is your typical action movie. If you turn your brain off and enjoy the ride, it's a great action movie. If you're looking for excellence in film making, writing, acting, and social commentary, you'll have a bad time. Gina Corano is of course the main draw of the movie. She actually does a good job acting; of course there's not a lot of depth to the character. Considering there are many actors out there that can make even a shallow character portrayal painful, it's refreshing that she does the job right.<br /><br />The protagonist is played in a relatively realistic manner, she's not running around easily beating the hell out of guys much bigger than her, each fight she takes quite a beating--indeed, some scenes are almost uncomfortable as she's getting the tar knocked out of her.<br /><br />Overall a good 90 minute action movie that doesn't try to be more than it is.
0761158820|5.0|this is a fabulous creative book I have a grandson thats eight with the attention span of a nat because of his disabilities I was amazed he sat for hours no I mean days to put each and every one of the monsters to gather. He showed his brother and his friends how to put them together.  directions where clear and easy to follow. Having each tab marked with the corresponding numbers and letters made it easy to follow the instruction each child had a wonderful time reading the stories that came with each monster at the end of the day the even started a trading monster post with his cousin and the neighbor boys I have not seen him this exicted about something in a long time he wants me to orderd this activity book again and that not like him to want to work on same activity more thenw<br /><br />I hope youll have grear fun as we did. gmom
B005OCFHHK|1.0|I wish I could give this NO STARS.  How careless I was not to read the reviews of this item.  When I saw it had almost 5 stars compared to the 1.6 stars for The Wizard's Collection, I purchased it.  When we watched the first movie and got to the scene where Hagrid comes to rescue Harry from the island his uncle and aunt take him too we were wondering where the full scene was. We have it on the DVD we bought years ago, but now have Blu Ray.  Then we found other extended scenes were missing.  As we only bought the first three movies on DVD years ago, we decided to get the Blu Ray set.  How disappointing this set is.  And I hear The Wizard's Collection is even worse.<br /><br />For us die hard fans who were so hoping for the extended editions and more, there is a petition on the internet.  I think you cannot put a direct link into the review so I will break it up.  It is at: [...]
0345803485|1.0|Bought the book at the early part of the hype and was surprised to see how poorly written it was.  The author wrote about characters from the NE part of the U.S. but they spoke with the formality of a person from the UK so I had a hard time relating with that.  Then it appeared she found a few favorite words out of a Thesaurus and used them over and over again.  Quite frankly, would have been more interested in character development outside of the bedroom rather than the sometimes disturbing and often too graphic sex scenes.  I found myself often skimming over them trying to move onto an actual story line.  Bottom line is... I was very disappointed!  Wished I waited to let the hype die down so I could hear that it was more a kinky sex book rather than a touching, romantic novel.  I'm not a prude but the kind of sex in this book is not the kind I'm into. I'm not so bored in my life that reading this poorly written book added one iota of joy into my life.  No interest in finding out any more about Mr. Gray so I won't be going onto books 2 & 3.<br /><br />P.S.  Author needs to go back to Creative Writing 101.
0345803485|4.0|While I hear what other reviewers are saying about this read being juvenile and repetitive in some respects and I agree with those points, I also loved this book and am already on book 2.  These are quick and simple reads and I really just enjoy being whisked off into the lives of the main characters and loved to see them grow in their relationship and somewhat identified with Ana.  I've had what I call \\"unhealthy\\" relationships in my past and where I call \\"foul\\" on this read, is where Ana thinks she is changing Christian and in this book, appears to be doing just that.  In real life, we cannot change another person simply by loving and accepting them and hope that they'll turn into who we want them to be.  In my perception of book 1, she is hopeful this will happen.  As for all of the hype regarding the explicit sexual parts....they are there and I was impacted but in a positive way.  After a while, it's kind of the \\"same old thing\\" with them but it was still a good read and I would still recommend it.

B0086700CM|3.0|I have an Ipod, and I really like Temple Run on my Ipod, but on my Kindle Fire the game freezes way too much and when I make the player jump he doesn't move, so I end up losing the game. I hope Amazon can fix that, but for now I guess I'll have to settle for the freezing game or my Ipod. Also, it seems harder to get coins and harder to save enough coins for things like Boosts or a new player.

B000002UWW|1.0|This CD totally sucks.Don't get me wrong,I love the RHCP,but the songs on this album just blow! The only song on here that I would call a hit,is \\"Under The Bridge\\".What the hell is a great song like that doing mixed up with all these bullcrap songs anyway??? \\"Under The Bridge\\" was released on the WB label,and this CD is from EMI. I could never figure that one out. My advice would be to skip this crappy CD and pick up their REAL greatest hits album that ALSO includes \\"Under The Bridge\\" along with other great songs around it,and don't waste your time or money on this awful album.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|It all started with a video called Heat of the Moment. As a junior high kid at the time, i remember just playing the first side of the casette over and over hearing the hits. Never seeing them live back then, i only had the MTV videos to visualize what they would be like seeing them perform. Hearing this new album is amazing! Every member sounds AWESOME!!! From Wettons VOX to Howes riffs, Palmer pounding the skins and Downes opening up everything with those broad strokes of the keys... Simply cannot say enough about this OUTSTANDING effort from one of the greatest bands of all time. At least, in my time! God bless you guys! Thank you for making me truly happy listening to good music again. Cant wait to see you guys Live! Would be a dream come true and my lifes musical journey going to shows made complete. CHEERS to ASIA!!
B007X4ECLY|4.0|An entertaining knock off of John Carpenter's [[ASIN:B003O7I6L6 Escape from New York (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]], \\"Lockout\\" has some top notch actors (Guy Pearce always a delight in everything he's done and Maggie Grace)and some exciting action sequences in a fun b-movie with some clever one liners.<br /><br />Although everything in this hodge-podge science fiction thriller is borrowed from something else (including elements of [[ASIN:B000W4HIX6 Die Hard [Blu-ray]]] and a conclusion right out of [[ASIN:B000PMLFRA Star Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) [Blu-ray]]])and although the conclusion is about as asburd as can be imagined, \\"Lockout\\" still manages to be entertaining primarily because of Pearce (please someone find this guy a great action movie). \\"Lockout\\" is entertaining and very self aware that its derivative having fun with the films it \\"borrows\\" from coming across like a hyperactive adolescent. It's not deep nor does it pretend to be.<br /><br />CIA operative Snow (Pearce)finds himself falsely convicted of committing espinonage amd headed towards a new space prison. When the president's daughter Emilie(Grace) during an investigational visit is taken hostage after the prisoners are thawed out, Snow finds himself in the unique position of being the only person that could possibly save her from a psycho prisoner (Joseph Gilgun) and his brother (Vincent Regan).<br /><br />The visual effects range from exceptionally good to just a step above a video game (the bike chase opening sequence)but given the small budget for this film ($20 million) \\"Lockout\\" LOOKS pretty impressive overall.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks terrific--blacks are inky, detail is amazingly rich and the image quality remains sharp throughout the presentation.<br /><br />Audio kicks butt--it's powerful and uses the surround speakers quite well.<br /><br />The special features are disappointing. We don't get any commentary track (I'd love to hear from Pearce and Grace on shooting the film in Serbia and the issues they had)we do get two featurettes on the creation of the film including \\"Breaking into Lockout\\" a behind-the-scenes glimpse with bits and pieces of animatics, green screen unfinished studio footage and an interview with Stephen Saint Leger co-writer/co-director. Pearce and Grace also chime in discussing their characters.<br /><br />\\"A Vision of the Future\\" gives us a peak behind the design and look of the film. We get interviews with the production designer as well as a discussion of the visual effects design.<br /><br />There are also quite a few previews but no trailer for this film included.<br /><br />While \\"Lockout\\" isn't deep, it's a fun thrill ride. If you can overlook the large gaps in logic, the large amount of coincidence and plot holes, you'll enjoy \\"Lockout\\" as the tongue-in-cheek thrill ride it is. Pearce is the real reason to watch the film and his cynical, humorous take on Snow is a variation on John Carpenter's Snake Plisken.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was a book I could not stop reading! Well written and thought provoking. I was sad when it was over.
0240815807|5.0|I expected this book to talk about matching beats and lining up tracks with some discussion of overlapping instruments balancing sound. I was a little confused at first because I didn't see chapters on that. Instead I got a REAL introduction to using much more sophisticated techniques. I knew a little about using delays, reverb and equalizers but this guy talked about them in ways I hadn't really thought about and added a lot to my knowledge of EQ-ing drums. I also never fully understood Bus compression which he explained in depth. I would not have initially picked this book for bedtime pleasure reading, but it kept me curious enough about the topics to creep onto my nightstand. Highly recommended for those who want to delve further into the art of Mixing.
0525478817|5.0|I really loved \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\". It was easy to like all of the characters -- even as they're going through some pretty horrible circumstances. John Green tells a really engrossing story that easily sweeps you in and doesn't let you go until you've come to the end shocked at the journey you've just taken.<br /><br />After finishing the book, I found I was haunted by the characters (in good ways) for several weeks. If you have a young adult in your life who loves a good book -- clue them into this and everything else by John Green. Or if you're an adult looking for a great book to read -- then get to reading because I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|I may be the first one to review the Blu-ray release of Singin' in the Rain, and I will be brief: SPECTACULAR!!!. The restoration of the picture (4K) and the DTS multi-channel English track will knock your socks off!<br />This 60 year old classic looks like it was just filmed, except in glorious TECHNICOLOR. For those of us who were lucky to see revivals of this film in theatres with prints from the IB Technicolor masters, it is such a joy to see this quality in our own home theaters looking so beautiful. For the newer film fans who have only seen this movie on a TV screen, you don't know what you are missing. This is a classic you MUST see on the largest screen you can possibly view it on. There aren't many extras , and the trailer is standard definition, but the most important thing for me is the absolutely stunning quality of the main feature. I recommend this release on Blu-ray. It is the closest to classic movie heaven you will get!!.
0394826817|5.0|I can still picture this book sitting in the drawer in the end table in my grandma's living room. I loved everything about this book as a kid. Now over 30 years later, I'm thrilled that I can pass this great book onto new generations in our family.<br /><br />While some of the scenarios are dated, I don't think the manners being taught in this book and Richard Scarry's other books ever go out of style.
B000WAEJZ0|1.0|I was very excited to find this CD for my sister on Amazon.com, as my sister is a big Whitney Houston fan and this particular CD had all of Whitney's best songs in one purchase. The package arrived quickly, was undamaged, and in time for my sister's birthday.<br /><br />Imagine the shock at my sister's birthday party when she loaded the CD onto her stereo and the very first 2 songs skipped! The rest of the CD played well, but every time the first two songs were played, they paused and skipped entire phrases of the songs. We tried other CD players (even the car!), but the first two songs were always flawed. Unfortunately, these were my sister's two favorite Whitney Houston songs. So it sure reflected poorly on my choice of gift. :( Usually, I'm happy with my purchases from Amazon (even 3rd party vendors), but not this time.<br /><br />Do we have any recourse? Can I get my money back?
B0063IH60K|3.0|its a pretty good game. it would be better if it would tell u when u lost and if it would send u right to the next game instead of having to press play and choose if u want random or winning game.

B0068LYEHA|5.0|Moran's book is extremely funny - for me, laugh out loud a lot funny.<br /><br />Her theme, interwoven with her experience of \\"becoming a woman\\" from age 13 on, is why we should be feminists.  When I read parts out loud to my partner, he was annoyed by her sarcastic, humorous approach to some serious stuff and felt that her argument was not terribly persuasive. (Even though he's a feminist.)  But she manages to make some really important points in between all the joking around.<br /><br />My personal favorite is that women who engage in editorializing against feminism are reaping the benefits of feminism.  Just the fact that these women are given the platform (a major newspaper, a TV talk show, etc) from which to present their opinions, and their assumption/hope that anyone will listen to them, is a direct result of feminism's legacy.  Moran alludes to some important ideas from basic feminist critique without ever being a theorist, philosopher or pundit. She puts it all in the context of real life.<br /><br />I don't agree with her all the way through, and some readers might find her chapter on abortion seriously off-putting, but she is a very funny writer.<br /><br />I really recommend this one.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|would have approved of the movie version (RIP Jonathan). I thought the movie was extremely faithful to the stage musical. The first time I saw the movie I didn't think so, but after seeing the show a few more times and seeing the movie again I have come to the conclusion that the movie did the stage musical justice. Yes, they should've cut the weddiing scene in half and kept the rest of \\"Goodbye Love\\" and \\"Halloween\\", but you can't have everything the musical has. I also loved how they subtly used some of the lyrics of other minor songs as dialogue. Honestly, I'm glad \\"Contact\\" was cut. That song didin't need to be in the movie. I still think the stage musical will always be better, though. Since there are so many liberties these days with adaptations movie musicals don't follow the stage musical as faithfully as they used to. I'm not saying they don't follow them at all. They do. Just not as exact. So, I thought Rent was one of the better adaptations produced in the last decade.
0374275637|5.0|This was my first summer read.  The most immediate result of my reading this book is that it has made me more critical about EVERYTHING.  Anything someone tells me, I look for the lack of evidence or the faulty construction of their story.  This book will cause you to use your \\"System 2\\" (he discusses what your system 2 is) more than ever before!  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a better glance into our decisions and the rationales we quickly make on a daily basis.<br /><br />One caveat: if you are not a math wizard (I teach English), then you might find some of the chapters a little trying.  But I'd say 95% of the book is fairly easy to grasp and ultimately rewarding.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|Pretty good movie!  Keeps your attention, and Pearce is fairly funny throughout this action packed CGI fiasco of a film!
0345803485|1.0|Just an observation here. And a question.<br /><br />I click on the 5 star reviews and the first 9 in a row have very short, simple reviews and ALL have 4 out of 6 agreeing with them. Suspect reviews to lift the overall ratings? I definitely think so.
B00701L5XS|4.0|This app is great! Every knot is shown in its construction in complete detail... I have only two minor complaints... 1. Add more knots, and b) please make the controls for the rotation and visual aid... If the controls were effective in any way this would be easily worth 5 stars... Regardless this is an excellent app for if you ever need to know how to tie a certain knot...
B007X4ECLY|4.0|I read previous reviews on this movie and noticed that alot of viewers were bashing it. I'm glad I didn't follow their beliefs of \\"Lockout\\". I decided to rent it before making a decision about purchasing and I gotta say this movie was very entertaining. There is action from start to finish and Guy Pearce was the perfect actor to cast the lead as \\"Snow\\". His sarcastic way of humor really lightened the edge of the movie. I will give you a brief summary of \\"Lockout\\". After a maximum security prison, IN SPACE, is over run by escaped convicts, the secret service enlists an ex agent, Snow, to rescue the President's daughter who is held hostage by the world's worst of the worst convited felons, before blowing this space prison to pieces. This movie has good plot twists, action, comedy, thriller and a little bit of suspense all in one. Will I purchase this movie and add it to my collection of Blu-rays? Yes!

B007P6VLRS|5.0|Having been a fan of the Smashing Pumpkins since the 90s, I've been devouring the songs on this new album. Appreciating the different approach taken in this one, not loving too much the Teargarden project. I feel like this is much closer to the experience anybody should expect from Billy and the Smashing Pumpkins, as well as closer to the roots of the Smashing Pumpkins.
0345803485|5.0|This was incredible, classic when boy meets girl, if your into mystery  drama and romance you will love this. People talk about the BDSM but there is real romance involved and that's what kept me captivated, read the other two books and you won't be able to get enough!

B005G4TJUC|3.0|Liked it, but not true to form from the first movie. Hope a fourth comes with original damsel.  T3 damsel just not what I anticipated nor looked forward to.  Bring back the brunette at any price.  She was worth it.  The blonde just had no spark.  I will look forward to number four if you put the brunette back in where she belongs.  If you forget where you come from, you will never know where you are going.  Some fool forgot that the brunette brought spark.  The blonde brought nothing to her character except a stupid kind of normal.  I was disappointed in T3.  But I love that Bumble.  He is my kind of cool.  If your producers understood people at all, they would have recognized that with our current economy, people need to see loyalty and responsible conduct.  If you build a T4, I will watch that one too if you bring back the brunette and show America we are truely loyal and steadfast! Suspenseful. Intriguing. The blonde was a let down to the original theme.  Somebody thought too much and ruined T3 for me.

B0007ODLCS|5.0|This collection delivers a whole lot of Townes for the money. There are 86 songs from the period between 1968 and 1978, all written by Townes (except for Nine Pound Hammer) in a dizzy variety of styles. Did anyone know that Townes wrote a few gospel songs in his day? This collection also includes four studio outtakes including Buckskin Stallion Blues and At My Window. Devotees such as myself have to endure a few examples of the horrors of over-production that threaten to drown out our beloved Townes with sappy, dated strings slopped all over everything, two examples being Kathleen and Rake. There is also, however, the weirdly haunting; The Velvet Voices, complete with a hokey chorus, and the epic, Silver Ships of Andilar that could have been the soundtrack for some sixties Hollywood movie.<br />In spite of the carnage, this collection is loaded with enough absolute gems: Our Mother the Mountain, My Proud Mountains, Greensboro Woman, Tecumseh Valley, Flying Shoes, to cause any Townes fan to disappear under the headphones for days at a time.<br />I was listening to this collection during evacuation of the High Park Fire in Colorado. My company had let me set up my computer in one of their offices, (I usually telecommute). One of my co-workers walked in just in time to see me wiping away tears as I listened to My Proud Mountains, knowing that all mine were on fire.<br />My Townes never fails to touch my heart. I highly recommend this collection.

0553582038|3.0|Short version of the review is that the book is only \\"okay\\" but doesn't live up to George R.R. Martin's earlier standards. Also, beware SPOILERS below!... though honestly not a lot actually happened in this book.<br /><br />Let's start with the characters. Yes, as others have mentioned, that horrible harlot Cersei eats up a large portion of this book. I guess it's interesting to get a glimpse into her mind, but given the horrific things she's responsible for in earlier books, none of it is really a surprise. I don't know if Martin was trying to justify or make us understand her behavior by making us see that she just wants to protect her children, but if that was the case he failed, because she is not a sympathetic character even from the perspective of a mother. In fact, she is so terrible as a mother--something that we, again, already knew--that you can't help but wish for Child Protective Services to take Tommen away from her greedy clutches. On the other hand, I immensely enjoyed watching all of her half-baked plots explode in her face again and again and watching her spaz out over Tyrion, like he's just going to come out of the walls with a knife and stab her. The fact that she seriously believed that Tyrion would do the same to Tommen just shows how utterly clueless and stupid she is. Lioness. Ha! More like a yapping chihuahua. Anyway, aside from probably unintentional comic relief her chapters don't really tell us much else about her and just sort of push the story to its next catastrophe. Even the part where she relived the fortune teller foretelling her doom told us nothing new because by that time we've already gone over that moment roughly a billion times.<br /><br />Other characters also don't add much. Brienne's quest amounts to wandering around aimlessly, the reader knowing all the while that she won't get anywhere. Indeed, it seemed pretty damn obvious to me that she wouldn't find Sansa in this book, as Martin obviously has not made her suffer enough,and anyway how the hell is she going to find someone who's cooped up in an absurdly designed castle that's so hard to access that I find it hard to imagine how it was even built in the first place? Then there's some scenes with the Ironmen, but frankly I hate all of them and their horrible, barbaric way of life and hope they all die as painfully as possible. And there's this Dornish princess who tries to pull off some plot, but fails, and then we have to read about her being confined to quarters and having nothing to do. Wow, glad we covered that ground. Lastly, Samwell is a blubbering putz. There, I said it, and I'm not sorry. Of course, there's more, but it left little impact on me. You need to pick your protagonists better, Martin.<br /><br />I don't suppose anyone has noticed this, but the Game of Thrones books have too often resorted to making one character travel around and around, and have another character or two follow them, willingly or not, and I guess they might learn about each other in the process or even respect each other. And I guess that's a common trope in fantasy books, but Martin does it far too often and eventually you may start to wonder if you're reading a chapter you already read.<br /><br />The problem with the Game of Thrones series, I think, is that, at the moment, it has lost its momentum. It had a rip-roaring, amazing start, but now it's just grudgingly plodding forward, tying everything up. I think there's a few reasons for this. One, too many damn characters and plot threads to follow. I mean, Martin has no problem killing characters we like, why can't we just prune a few that we could care less about? Two, speaking of killing characters we like, yeah, all the horrible events we've endured so far--Eddard Stark's fate, the Red Wedding--were pretty shocking, but the result has been to leave us with nothing. There's almost no one left to root for, and many of the characters that we might still give a damn about aren't even in the book.Oh, they're in the next book? Great, why did I bother reading THIS thing, then? Really, though, Martin did what few other writers dare to do, and now we're finding out exactly why they don't. It's like if there was an episode of G.I. Joe where Cobra wins and kills all the Joes, and it's not just a dream or time travel or something. Okay, what now? Exactly. Nothing. Third, and this relates to point two, WHERE IS TYRION!? He's the big, bright, shining star of the series and you're not doing anything with him? Wow, bad idea. I sorely needed a classic quip from him as only he could deliver... but I was denied, and he only appeared in the form of a hilariously evil phantasm in Cercei's malformed brain.<br /><br />It's not all bad, really. We do learn a few things, and there's a few events of import which could mean big things in future books. And there a couple interesting scenes, like with the strange Faceless Men collecting bodies and gathering seemingly useless information for some mysterious purpose. Even so, there is, as you can see, much to criticize, and it's hard to emerge from reading this book and feeling astounded or moved at what occurred within it. I think you could safely pass on this book and wait for it to be adapted to the HBO show. Oh, and HBO? One season will cover this book nicely, thanks.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|totally addictive. easy enough for my 8 yr old but challenging enough for me. highly reccomend this game to anybody.
B007MJ9LA2|3.0|This album didn't have any songs that were really memorable in my opinion. They were well put together but did not showcase Carlos's beautiful tone as well as most of his other work. I have been a fan of his for 43 years, and it takes only one note to recognize him.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big easy to read display. Love it. Has all of the standard functions. Not meant to be a Scientific Calculator.
0142428272|5.0|This was the very first book I have EVER read of Follett. My late husband loved him and read him all the time. I was thinking Ken Follett wrote books more for Men. Was I ever wrong! \\"Fall of the Giants\\" is fantastic! I loved every bit of it.I always read Audio Books and sometimes, the reader makes the book even better, and in the this case, he was very good, but the content of the book made it remarkable. Don't pass this book up!I will say I didn't care for Eye of the Needle. But, I am anxious to read the other 2 books in this Century Trilogy. Keep writing books like Fall of the Giants Ken, and I will surely be reading them!
B0087DFIOU|5.0|Bought this today from Best Buy & Watched it with some folks from work.<br />We all enjoyed it very much.<br />Action, Corrupt cops, Drug Lords, Jokes & Action through out the movie. What's not to like.<br />Regaurdless of if you like Mel Gibson's private life or not... His movies always give you what your looking for, unless your one of those folks that watch a movie then pick it apart. Sit back watch this movie and just enjoy the ride!
0345803507|1.0|In the interest of saving time, I will not repeat all of the other crticisms about how awful this trilogy is.<br /><br />I will just say this, this trilogy made me seriously consider writing a book of my own. If this trilogy can make millions, I'm sure I can do the same.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I really loved this movie. this is possibly the best movie of 2012. I thought it would be corny but it was the exact opposite. Must watch if you want a good laugh
B004WCTLNY|5.0|It was so cute! I know, understatement, but I really liked it. The plot, the actors, the everything! But I always had that one question in my mind: \\"Why can't they be together?\\" and I also wanted to shout to the adjustment bureau \\"Leave the couple alone! They belong together! Anyways, I recommend you watch it. Action (I guess you can call it that...?) and romance in one!--and drama! :D
B0064U8GYC|1.0|I grew up on Basic, C, C+, and even assembly. I have taught myself HTML, and Visual Basic. I am also a hands on learner. If I see a bit of code I want to type it and see how it works. Try to mess with it and get a better idea of what is going on. If this is your style don't bother with this book. There is nothing logical about it. It jumps all over the place. The code samples are incomplete at best. Changes are made with just a wave of the hand. I have spent more time trouble shooting code errors (not from typing, but from incorect or incomplete examples).
B002XUL6QC|4.0|Camera work is excellent, the script inventive. But why is the acting so plain awful? Especially the leading actress. Gee, she can't act! I hope some Hollywood director can do a remake of this film, with a top-notch actress for the leading role. Annette Bening, for example.
B00701L5XS|4.0|Knots are visually appealing with enough. information to tie knots myself.  There is history and usage information making this app a great resource for anyone wanting more choices than the few knots most of us learner as a child when first tying our shoes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game challenges you but it is amazingly fun it never gets boring, it only gets funner each level and is a 5 star game to me. this game has never given me a problem
B004SZHIR6|5.0|Regular Dvd buyers should be fine. I have PS3 and Sony bluray player and the Bluray doesn't play. Amazon supports this so it is worth trying to have this piece of art on Blu-Ray. I tried on a panasonic and it didn't work but others - friends - have told me that it works on their players which include panasonic and onkyo and I think toshiba. Regardless, my panasonic is in the bedroom and I want to watch this in the living room. Return was seemless since I just had UPS come by and pick it up. Still - I would rather have it. I would recommend buying and trying. This receives a 5 star rating for just trying to get the thing out on BluRay.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|First, let me say, the way this film was dismissed during its original release was a disgrace.  It deserved many Oscar nominations including one for Bandaras and Madonna.  Bandaras stole every scene he was in and Madonna rose to the occasion in a role that is very daunting to play.  The harshest and dumbest comment by critics was \\"The longest music video\\".  Guess what?  The piece is sung completely.  That is the way it was written and to do it any other way would have been an insult to the original creative team.  Mr. Parker's direction and the screenplay are far superior to the stage version.  The stage version is vacuous and uninvolving and the current version in New York now makes that even more apparant.  Mr. Weber's best work was given the treatment it deserved on screen and the Blu Ray is stunning in sight and sound.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|As you see from the title they fixed the tc and I loved it, I had played on my friends ipod and immediately wanted it for my kindle. I would suggest you get this... I know I loved it!
0439023513|1.0|This book was great until the author got tired of writing!!!!!  Kills off Prim, makes the love triangle, unresolved &depressing and just ENDS!!'. Whatever.  The last chapters makes me HATE all 3 books!!!  What's the point!
B00884GR0W|5.0|great game just make sure all the settings are set perfectly to your device otherwise it can be choppy. other than that great game best part is if you start a new game the terrian is completley different.
0345803485|5.0|I have been hearing about \\"oh this book called 50 shades of grey....you should read it\\".  Ok...so I order the trilogy on my kindle.  WOW!!!!  I don't want to put my kindle down to rest my eyes.  If I didn't have a small herd of children at home, I would likely read from the time I get home from work until I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer.  The very best book I've read in a very long time.  This book has fantastic writing that will keep you wanting more.  I can't wait to finish book one to dive into book two.  Oh how I love me some Mr. Grey!  Ahhhh.  Enjoy this series...and MEN...you should read it too.  :)  Just sayin'.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun! That island is SO BEAUTIFUL!!  It's great movie and people in it is a lot of fun and funny! This is the movie you will watch it often and is MUST to have in your DVD collection for years to come.
B0086700CM|5.0|I dont know why these guys are giving it bad reviews. works great for me and only sometimes lags! And it's free? cmon! this app is definitely a must-have.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I now have read all of the Jack Reacher books.  I believe this is the best of all.  The story line was entertaining and credible.  Jack Reacher epitomized is true character.  I don't know, however, how Tom Cruise will be able to reflect Jack Reacher's character.
B00856NOJK|5.0|I got the re-release of Pisces Iscariot on vinyl. It is 2 180g black LPs in double fold. No mp3 download code.<br /><br />The quality of the vinyl is good. Feels exactly the same as the other two re-releases on vinyl in 2011: Siamese Dream and Gish.<br /><br />Would recommend to SM fans.<br /><br />Looking forward to the other releases of the Smashing Pumpkins later this year.
B003VANOFY|1.0|[[ASIN:B003VANOFY Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound]]<br /><br />I bought two of these headsets, and had to send them both back because the USB plug got pushed into the headset and couldn't charge. the USB connector on the head set is held in place with really thin plastic rivets. Second issue I had you can't seem to program the G keys on it and if you do the setting last till you turn it off and back on, they keep reverting back to control windows Media player. The second set I am having problems like the first set can't program the G keys, and now I am having trouble even keeping it on. This has to be the worst Logitech product ever made. I buy lots of Logitech gear, keyboards, harmony one, mice, and some of the low end micropho<br />ne head sets which work a whole lot better then this expensive piece of crap.
B0000707YX|4.0|OK I ordered both parts on vinyl from 2 different sellers. The UYI I came and it is not 180g vinyl. Does not have mp3 download code and nowhere says it is a re-release. Says made in US on the back. The UYI II came and it is definitely 180g vinyl and says Re-release and has mp3 download code. Also says made in EU on the back.<br /><br />So I am really confused about the first part. It does not seem old to be original release, but has no mp3 and not 180g. So I am wondering if they did a wrong press or is there a regular additional press of 2012 that is not Limited Edition 180g.<br /><br />Would like to know the answer.
B002UM5BXW|2.0|The book is very entertaining - or at least it has the potential to be. The Kindle version is so horrendously and unforgivably riddled with grammatical errors and absent punctuation that all the mojo of the narrative is hopelessly drained from the experience. If Kindle books are going to have a price tag higher than buying a used paperback someone should have the decency to at least have these things proofread. Atrocious.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Purchased this for my daughter's birthday and can't wait to give it to her! She is going to love it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have this on my phone and Kindle fire! its the best game ever! okay maybe not the best but its pretty great!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|great graphics. save the gold spend the silver. slow advancement if you don't buy gold but that's part of the fun
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game. Play it all the time. It is quick to load. It also runs very smoothly.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I really don't know why I don't just uninstall or even bother trying other apps.  This is the one I use.  The clock, the hourly, the ten day, info amount, quality and presentation are just what one needs and more.<br /><br />The only problem I had was when I was in the UK, the hourly precipitation was not accurate enough to smaller London regions, and I found myself having to get the UK the met app and UK weather apps to supplement to know when I could get by without an umbrella.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|it has a good interface... but puzzles are easy to do. i rather play Router which have more complex puzzle
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Intriguing...naughty...quick read.  Wasn't sure about this one to start, but came so highly recommended by others, had to pick it up...then proceeded to read all three books in the trilogy.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I was totally pumped to get stuck into this book I had heard so much about. Loved the first two books but by the third I was over it. I think the author could've condensed into 2 books. Initially didn't think much of Christian but as the books went on got to love his character. Not sure how many 22 year olds would agree to siging a contract before embarking on a relationship? Must say I did learn a thing or two whilst reading the books - so that's a definite plus!
0345803485|1.0|This is so repetitive! I didn't think anyone \\"mutters\\" and \\"mumbles\\" as much as these characters. You can see when the thesaurus came out and the author used words just to try and make the book seem more mature. The girl was annoying and the guy was not believable. I just kept thinking how so much was ripped from classic novels (wannabe Austin, Bronte characters except put in sexual situations) then you have a dysfunctional \\"grey\\" character set in grey Seattle (grey's anatomy covered this play on words already) with a sexually odd, emotionally distant character names Christian (nip/tuck). I am sure there are more \\"been there done that\\" parts that I missed as I jumped through the book trying to find the spot that made it worth reading. Everyone says the next two are better- with the bar so low, it would be near impossible to be worse!
B007JMW46U|5.0|Why download this version and not a public domain or competing edition? The Top Five version features 104 of the Sidney Paget illustrations many of us love, and these are more sharply defined than in other versions I sampled for my Kindle. The table of contents works, and as with their edition \\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,\\" it comes across appealingly on screen.<br /><br />Alex Lubertozzi offers a brief overview of what these twelve stories aim for, and about Conan Doyle. This provides an ideal introduction or, in my case, reminder of what I first enjoyed reading as a child. I look forward to more from Top Five, who promise in addition to \\"Adventures\\" and \\"Memoirs\\" of Sherlock Holmes--the best two collections of the detective's short investigations--other installments at what cannot be beat for affordability (as of this writing!) and handsome presentation.
0984183523|4.0|Very good material for someone from a non-consulting background. In my opinion, stick to the ideas mentioned in the book rather than trying to invent something new on your own in the case interviews.
B006WR0A8W|5.0|I first saw the X-Mini in wired form and loved it so much that I went out and searched for one of my own. I found the bluetooth version X-Mini and even though it was considerably more expensive I went with it. Same great sound as the wired version but you can choose to either go wired or wireless. Battery life is dramatically reduced to around 3 - 4 hours on bluetooth. Wired easily gets 7 - 8 hours. Love that I can use this in wireless mode as a speaker for cell phones.  Now when I rent a car that does not have bluetooth... fire up the X-Mini and I can wirelessly talk on the cell.<br /><br />Great product!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Based on reviews, I decided to get into Jack Reacher, right?  I have to say I loved the book from page one.  But I have one problem that if it continues in the sample of the second book, will make Killing Floor the only Reacher book I read, right!<br /><br />One character might over use a word like \\"right\\" way too often, but for all these people from different backgrounds to use it on almost every page, gets a little repetitive.  I almost wonder if this is a global search and replace gone nuts.<br /><br />So, I will try book two.... Right?
159562015X|1.0|If you want to take the test don't buy it used. I bought it used and the seller was nice enough to provided the login info but it still wouldn't work. The book it self is very brief and has one basic theme. I'll sum it up, We focus to much on improving our weakness, when instead we should identify our strengths and lean into what we do best. If you want to take the test that identifies your personality strengths, buy it new or go take the test directly for $20. Below is the link to take the test directly. The test was actually informative and useful, I only gave it a 1 star so people were more likely to see my review. The test I would give 5 stars.<br /><br />[...]
B0086700CM|4.0|this app is fun and rather addictive but the monsters are creepy and the part that tells about your death is rather gruesome if I could I would get rid of that altoghether.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the number of free puzzles. That being said it's not perfect. The optional piece rotation doesn't seem to work right and dragging the pieces can be hard. Overall though I really like this game.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Very entertaining, great light read. After reading Fifty Shades it made me go and buy the next two episodes, so I have plenty of entertaining reading ahead of me.
B007N0REX6|1.0|How the hell does someone who made appetite for destruction and Use Your Illusion's suck? Slash,,,who is known for super creativity keeps on making these bland lame albums... Have you heard velvet revolver libertad? This album is like that one...
B003UESJH4|5.0|There are many messages to take from this film, for example; stuttering can be a stigma if you let it, learn the ins and outs of public speaking, embarrassment is not a crime, etc. Suffice to say it appeals to a very large audience, and I would recommend it for everyone.  I would not label it as a check flick.<br />The product was packaged well, properly addressed, and received in excellent condition. I have purchased other dvd's from Amazon with the same great results.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is really fun the only reason you have to use wifi is when you start the game and its like smurf village
B0054JZC6E|5.0|def a great way to waste some time good for the kids as well very nice distraction lots of different games
0156030306|5.0|Amazing book about intelligence, kindness, finding yourself, relating to others, the harshness of reality, and the value of love. Read, read, read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fantastic book well worth reading the series. Are well written a must read for the summer. Recommend to all my friends.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I bought this album for \\"State of the Art\\", which is an amazing song but I was really surprised by the album as a whole.  The wide variety of song styles is appealing in that it never seems to run together or become monotonous.  If you are avoiding this album simply because hearing \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" everywhere is driving you nuts; you are missing out.  There are far superior tracks that deserve the attention of music fans that appreciate well written songs.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I bought this because I had a Speck Candyshell case which allowed me to plug in nothing other than the iPhone computer cord. I had doubts whether this thing would work but it fit perfectly! And it allows my old iPod accessories to charge my iPhone too. Finally, it also has a usb port on the side if you need more power or if you want to sync.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This Gamecube controller works great with the WII console and opens up a wider range of product selections for our family.  Our boys love it...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very entertaining - free-flowing.  Light reading.  Nothing serious.  It's a story that has multiple meanings and political overtone - but grabs your attention.
B000K4X5XA|5.0|I still remember the day I saw this in Phoenix, Ariz. 12-26-1978 my birthday to be exact.  The number 1 song on the radio was Olivia Newton John's WITH A LITTLE MORE LOVE which was played every 20min.  The time is 11:00am and my parents and I cannot get in until the 3:30pm showing.  This movie was HUGE and the wait seemed like a eternity.  Skip forward to 3:30 and as my parents and I get into the theatre it is so crowded that I had to sit six rows infront of them.  STOP!  The lights go out!  The curtains pull apart and for the first and only time in my movie expierance history their is not one preview?!  The movie starts with the famous 70's WB logo and again (on film this time) the curtains open to reveal ONE of the greatest movies of all time.  After watching this GEM I knew in my heart not only was this one of the greatest films of all times, but a film I will never EVER forget.  I know I am suppose to talk about the film but after over 400 reviews I felt that would be boring.  I have to say now that SUPERMAN the movie is on BLU RAY it is more magical than ever!  All the actors are superb (cheese) but it is the unknown Christopher Reeve that on BLU RAY looks like you can reach out and touch him and made all of us believe that a man could fly.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun to play. keeps me interested. lots of games to play but it needs to give more coins so that we can play them.
0345803485|1.0|Well well well.<br /><br />I discovered this book by observing young women (all of them between 18 and 25 approximately) sitting at the poolside in my hotel resort, being absorbed by this book I became intrigued and discovered... very little.<br /> After reading the first pages, I can say I am simply appalled by the writing. The whole plot it so cheesy, it feels like someone is pouring cheese and olive oil on my soul with a hint of frying pan fat to top it off.<br />It is classed as an erotic novel, but the way intercourse is described feels like I obviously having met the right man yet. Mr. Grey is a hero of an unknown planet, being  Mr Perfect all along- speaking French, dressed immaculately AND to make him even more attractive with 57890238904890283498239048 $ in his bank account.<br /><br />But fiction is fiction, which this book clearly is. The writing reminds me of those kitchen-sink romance novels you could purchase from a news agent for 50p.<br /><br />I won't read any of her books again to add to her already well-established fortune.<br /><br />And keep in mind: If Entertainment Weekly is calling this book 'a masterpiece' or something along those lines: KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF IT!!
B0086700CM|5.0|all you people who says it. sucks you are stupid. and you have no life this game is one of the best game ive ever played but on kindle it may freeze for a second and cause a death so its good to always have resurrected wings ready
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|I'm not good at writing movie reviews; but I wanted to rate this movie, and to do so Amazon requires a twenty-word review.  So... I liked it; not too much, but enough. The fight scenes were different; I liked them, too. For her first movie, Ms. Carano had a big role and carried it off pretty well. I hope she makes another movie, I'd like to watch it, too.

0385342063|5.0|Oh my goodness! This book was a wonderful surprise to me! I have read other Sophie Kinsella books, and while I enjoyed them (I read many of her independent novels, and one or two of the shopaholic series) none of them really stood out or hit me as spectacular.<br />This book, on the other hand, was absolutely fantastic. I cracked up throughout the whole story, and I enjoyed all of the characters. None were absolutely ridiculous that you can't relate to, and Poppy and Sam's dynamic was great. I especially loved the whole text/email dynamic. This wasn't just a book that was written through texts/emails, but it was interspersed just enough to make it seem just like life- occasionally you pause and text, and then there's moments where life happens.<br />Furthermore, I am a huge fan of text one-liners. If you don't like texting, or you're bad at sensing the tone of voice behind texts, you probably won't like this. But for me, my favorite type of humor is dry, one liners, and Kinsella hits the bulls eye in this book. Sam and Poppy's conversations and quick worded texts, as well as Poppy's narration had me laughing till my stomach hurt! On the whole I absolutely loved it. The ending was good, beginning good, middle good, characters good, etc.<br />**The one warning I'd make is DO NOT get this on audiobook or read it via audiobook. Because texting and email is voiceless communication, putting a voice to it will most likely make it stilted and not get the right feel across. So this is one you're going to have to go hardcover for!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Simply one of the best artist of our time.  Great song writer whether it was his solo work or Genesis.  Great selection of songs here.
B0031RS64G|5.0|I'm definitely gonna rate this book as a 5 stars one. I enjoyed every bit of it but I can see why people are pretty much annoyed by it. The reason is simple - reader is thrown into the story and there is no pampering or handholding through it. From the beginning you have no idea whats happening but as the story reveals one can see an epic work behind it.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wanna read true epic fantasy book (series) and have enough patience to let the author tell it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a super fun game if you like games that make you think I play it all the time it is a must get
B004RWYNT6|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  If you like Led Zepplin and classic Black Sabbath, you will like this album.  I read a couple of reviews and thought that it might be too bluesy for my taste, but I bought it anyway, and now I think it's one the best albums I've bought in years.  It's one of the few albums that I can listen to constantly, from beginning to end, without skipping tracks.
B007R41E8O|5.0|A very good game with an interesting story line-I like it a lot.  I really. like the mini-games and the graphics are awesome.
B007XNAOS0|4.0|This is a really good album, but for my taste, it could easily have been a single album instead of a double.  Standout tracks for me are: Twinkler, Cocanium, Back Where I Belong, Collapse, Psalms Alive, and Stretchmarker.  In general, I like the the mellower direction of this album, but I can't help but be a little disappointed that Yellow & Green is not more like the Blue Album; which is my favorite to date.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|[[ASIN:B0070NSPCU Raven's Shadow Book One: Blood Song (Raven's Shadow)]]<br /><br />Love it .. such a great book.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Minor editing mistakes but the book is so good.  I will definitely buy the second book when that release.
B005GSY23M|5.0|As soon as I heard the Chromatics \\"Tick of the Clock\\" playing during the opening sequence of the film, I knew I was going to love the music of the film and I was right. The soundtrack consists of some very retro sounding tunes that were actually recorded decades after you'd initially think. The score is synth heavy and equally retro, like music from an 80's Michael Mann film. If you've seen the film and enjoyed the music, this is a very easy recommendation to make.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|thus far this game is really fun and entertaining especially for the younger crowd my niece just loves this game and I found myself addicted to it as well...
1892005034|4.0|This book goes in to a great deal of details. You need to read and study it and take time to apply the information to your life. It is not a book you want to read for the sake of reading. It deals with angry feelings, unmet needs, and communication. I have not finished it but what I have read gives cause for pause. I know it does not contain all the answers for life but it is a place to start. If you deal with anger issues this would be a good book to help you rethink your responses.

B0086700CM|5.0|Really awesome app! Everyone should have it! I am sooo happy that kindle fire got this app! I love this app!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I recommend this book to every female and male. I have told all of my friends about it and my friends who are male I have suggested them buying it for their girlfriends. My husband was even happy to help watch the babies while I was reading these books. These would be the books I'd take if I was gonna be stranded on a island for the rest of my life.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I just wish they would raise level cap, only took 5 days to get Max level, of course I had some help, but nice game all-around
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I am Fifty and had heard so much about this book Am enjoying the read and getting a real education at the same time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really awesome and difficult at the same time . I think that everyone would get this app. I can not
0525478817|5.0|I heard about this book from one of my college professors, we were talking about kids with cancer and she brought up this book. It sparked my interest because she was saying that this book wasn't really about the depressing parts of cancer,it was about living even though you have cancer. I myself was a 19 year old with cancer, and 2 months into remission at the time back into my first college class after chemotherapy. I bought this book right after my class ended that day and finished it the following day. To say that this book made me almost crazy was an understatement. I have never had a book that has made me feel so many emotions. When reading this book it really made me feel like someone understood the life of a cancer patient. I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone who has had cancer, or even without. This book shows you what true love is and what life is.  BUY IT! It is 100 percent worth it.
B0086700CM|4.0|I find this a very addictive game, and have fun playing it. I dont like the gem cost, but understand that is how money is earned
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Maybe it's because I heard \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B\\" on the tour already that the opening tracks grabbed me so immediately --but I doubt it since from the first listen live those tracks just rocked.  I wondered aloud at the \\"this is their first concept album!\\" chatter--after all they did several concept sides (Fountain of Lamneth, 2112, Hemispheres).  While I can't point to a super memorable riff ala Spirit of Radio, Limelight, Freewill, or even Digital Man, the songs are all strong.  Would love to see this performed start to finish in concert...something I haven't said about a Rush album in a really really long time.
B00782O7NE|5.0|Especially if you own a Jack Russell dog.  The dog steals the show, but the entire movie is good.<br />The blu-ray disk quality is good, no play problems at all, at least on my Sony player.<br />Get the movie.  And the dog.
B000003TA2|4.0|Released in the summer of 1990, this album was a staple on college radio during the early 1990's while its videos were played heavily on \\"120 Minutes\\" on MTV.  No wonder ... this album is really good.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are:<br /><br />Dirty Boots<br />Kool Thing<br />Disppearer<br />Titanium Expose<br /><br />This would be a great place to start for people new to Sonic Youth.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|good game for adults or older children not so much for very young kids but fun none the less. its like the Sims but with Ice Age characters

0345803485|1.0|this was the worst book I have ever read.  It seems like two horny teenagers got together and came up with this idea.  The referring to 50 Shades several times in the book was stupid.  the \\"Inner Goddess\\" references were immature.  There was no romance (I thought it was a love story).  It was smut and not even the least entertaining.  The sex scenes were so boring and predictable.  It was like reading from the mind of a twelve year old but with kinky sex.  The whole thing was about him beating her (dominating her totally) and she was this virgin who didn't know any better.  finally at the end she gets that he is abusing her? DUH?
B008DJBMO8|3.0|Hmmm... It is often bad to find out too much about actors as it colors your perceptions of the characters they play .... So let's leave Mel Gibson's foibles out of this and talk about the movie.<br /><br />This movie almost seems like a sequel to the 1999 Gibson film, Payback.  It is not, of course, for thought the main characters identity is never revealed here, the background it enough different that although they are perhaps cut from similar cloth, this guy isn't Parker.  There was also something missing that made Parker more likeable than this guy ... not sure what it is ... but I would watch Payback again over watching this movie a second time.<br /><br />I am not sure if the story was a little muddy, as I had some trouble understanding the dialog - loud music or gunfire would give way to quiet talking and I constantly had to ride the volume control.  Also, a great deal of the dialog was in Spanish (the movie is set in a Mexican prison) so I was relying on the subtitles, but - and this isn't a complaint exclusive to this film - once again some idiot made the decision to have white subtitles over very busy backgrounds.  I have no idea how anyone could look at the finish product and say ... cool, there will be no problem reading that.  Future reference, guys - use fluorescent yellow.  It is seldom part of a scene and is soooo much easier to read.<br /><br />It was interesting seeing the Mexican prison system (if this is typical) with families actually living inside with the convicts, and it provided the opportunity for the main character to interact with a mother and son - particularly the son, which was probably the most satisfying part of the story - I wish it had gone further as the rest of the story was fairly typical with nothing to make it stand out.  Not terribly bad, but there is a lot more out there that is better.<br /><br />Time would have been better spent adapting another Richard Stark \\"Parker\\" novel ... oh, well .....
B004T2QZL8|2.0|got the free one and was ticked when it made me pay $.99 to finish. Then i beat the game in ten minutes... if they add more I'll change my rating but seriously?! Ten minutes?!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read the entire trilogy and with each book in the series I felt that the storylines got a little better (as in there actually was one).  This one is better than the first, but not as good as the third. I'm not one for trashy romance-type books, but this series did keep me interested.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Keeps you searching and on your toes. Fun playing with your child.  Hope there will be more search and find games soon.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three 50 Shades books, and this is by far the best! I almost wish that you didn't have to read the previous 2 to completely understand the 3rd one because all of the real action/plot happens in this one book and there isn't as much of the \\"smutty\\" stuff
B0000032LS|5.0|My brother introduced me to the soundtrack when he became addicted to the movie. He recommended that I listen to the songs a few times, memorize them, and then watch the movie. I'm glad he did!<br /><br />The songs are amazing and quite catchy! I think my favorite is, \\"Eddie.\\" Within a week I had the soundtrack memorized and I sat down to watch the movie. Every time the cast sang (literally every 5 minutes) I was up singing with them.<br /><br />I went to my first viewing of, The Rocky Horror Picture Show in Dallas last week. I bought a bag of props for $4.00 and sat up front near the actors and sang along. I had a blast!<br /><br />This soundtrack is amazing! I say it's one of the Top 50 soundtracks of all time.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoyed playing and unlocking more fun and tricky games. It sure does pass the time. Would recommend this game to friends. Great for kindle fire.
0307730697|5.0|Adam Brown was we know as a hero.  Mind you, he nor any other of our fine military would consider what they do as heroic, but in my eyes, Adam Brown is just one more hero.  \\"Fearless\\", by Eric Blehm, is the story of this incredible American who fought and died for his country.<br />  Adam Brown was just another regular young man who always had a reputation for working hard and playing just as hard.  When he decided to join the U.S. Navy, he also decided that he would work hard and attain the most out of his decision.  He opted to become a U. S. Navy Seal.  Once accepted into the training, he dedicated his life to first of all completing the rigorous training, while marrying his longtime sweetheart and starting a family.  Kelly, his wife, was also a rock.  Adam had many issues which Kelly helped him through, some difficult times.  Drugs and Alcohol played a dangerous role in Adam's life for a time, but through God's help and Kelly's persistence, Adam was able to fight off his addictions and became a Operator with the famed Navy Seal Team Six.<br />  Follow Adam through the eyes and writings of Eric Blehm in this true story of this wonderful and courageous man by the name of Adam Brown.  \\"Fearless\\" is the most appropriate title for this novel of courage and sacrifice.  You will not be disappointed.  I'd like to thank WaterBrook Press for the opportunity to read and review this story.  \\"Fearless\\", by Eric Blehm, is sure to inspire the reader.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is extremely well written and quite frightening.  The style of writing (in the form of letters from the wife to her husband) is unusual but did not detract from the story or the subject.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I always bated being bored in longq car rides or just sitting home but this changed it. with all of its different modes aland stuff thus game usually keeps you prettt busy.
0783229364|5.0|I grew up watching family ties on tube in the mid 1980's so when Michael J. Fox started doing movies it was no brainer because he had done movies before this one but this movie The Secret of my success was easy for me to buy and it is very good movie.
031620157X|5.0|A promising first novel from an imaginative young talent. Even though Colfer is a newcomer to the world of novel writing, I feel that he accomplished what he set out to accomplish with this book.<br /><br />Children (especially those who have feelings of inadequacy or who have suffered early tragedy, just like Colfer did as a child) will find lots of hope within its pages, along with bravery and kindness and self-acceptance. It's a book about how every seemingly happy ending creates a new set of struggles to contend with, which you have to keep trying your best to overcome -- while also making good moral decisions and finding some kind of peace in spite of hardship. It's also a book about how things often seem to happen for a reason, and how unexpectedly wonderful things can happen as a result of painful struggles.<br /><br />The book has some interesting meditations on the nature of deep loneliness and longing -- and what people are capable of doing to remedy those heartaches. It's one of the strongest themes that run throughout the story. It appears as a theme in many ways with a variety of outcomes, and manages to be melancholy and uplifting at the same time, which is really lovely. Even with all of that sadness being examined so deeply, the book manages to be really funny and light.<br /><br />Another thing the book does strongly is preaching the power of understanding and compassion, even towards people who have done terrible things. It doesn't condone those terrible things, and it heavily emphasizes doing the RIGHT thing, but it deftly paints the characters as more complex humans than the classic Good Vs Evil stories do, which makes it all much more interesting and more relevant to real world conflicts.<br /><br />It isn't a perfect book, of course, and it could have benefited from a little more editing in a few places, but it's very charming and clever and more-than-a-little magical. I found myself giggling out loud at least once every chapter, and I even gota little teary-eyed in a few places. It will speak to children and adults on different levels emotionally while taking them all on a sweet, exciting adventure.<br /><br />I can't wait to read my copy of the book to my young niece and nephew.
B00004S35Z|5.0|This album is very goopd to have in cd rotation for any occasion you will not be able to stop listineing to the wonderful sounds of Stevie Wonder.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This replacement charger USB to Kindle connect cord solved a problem I was having with my Kindle Gen 2. The replaced cord was not making a firm connection to the Kindle charge port unless I held it at a particular angle. This replacement works perfectly and firmly. If you had a similar problem with the connection perhaps this will fix your problem, too. Thanks, Kindle!
B00004S367|5.0|Wow,music on my mind by the great Stevie Wonder is an album to have in your collection because there are so many hits as usual with any Stevie Wonder song.
0099579936|5.0|After reading some reviews people have written about this book I decided to put my two sense in on this one. Im not going to go in depth about how I feel about other peoples feelings regarding this book but I will say this....<br />THis book is an erotic romance. It Is a Book, therefore it doesnt have to be \\"realistic\\" so to say. Why can't people just set back and accept it for what it is and learn how to ENJOY their IMAGINATION! Geez!<br /><br />Well I hope there is a movie that comes out of this book and Im sure it will be as wonderful as the books were. I give this author TWO THumbs up!<br /><br />THank you for inspiring me to realize how AMAZING and WOnderful SEX can be!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />AMAZING AMAZING AND WONDERFUL! hope there is more to come!<br /><br />Loved all THREE
B0014BECF8|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of songs by George Michael. The double album consist of many favorites you all enjoyed in the past as well as some updated newer songs to add to the collection that being said this album is worth buying.
0316066524|5.0|And but so then, I arrived at the end of Infinite Jest and reflected, and at first I was a bit irked w/r/t the lack of narrative closure and everything like that, but then upon further reflection, like days and weeks of reflection, it like dawned on me that the truly important questions had been answered, some of them from the very beginning, and that also that I could live with the loose ends because the overall experience had been so rich and rewarding, i.e. that I had come to know and love something like two dozen major characters to varying degrees and been totally immersed in their world, and that I had laughed, a lot, and if not actually cried then definitely experienced some real human-type emotions and Reflected on Things and so, on the whole, looking back, I realized that I felt like good about the whole thing and had kind of an urge to read it all again. And everything like that.
B000LRY9PY|5.0|Where to begin Corinne Bailey Rae is not only beautiful in apperance but her amazing voice just give her that extra. The 2cd album comes with the original plus 8 brand new tracks never heard of before. I purchased this album for my mothers birthday and I know she will enjoy listening to one of her favorite artist.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|Overall, a pretty bad movie, that I so wanted to be good!<br />The story follows a teacher, on her last day of school, as she prepares to leave teaching forever and marry (for money). Well, she gets found out, that she's a gold digger and booted to the curb. What does she have to fall back on? Teaching. So she's back at school, trying to pick up the pieces and figure out a way to get some cash for a boob job, so she can hook another money guy.<br />The story, was, in a word, weak. Okay. Two words, incredibly weak. Weak characters, weak story, weak goal for character, weak dialogue, weak all around. Bad comedy. I don't think I laughed at all, which is sad. And it didn't have to be. She could have still been a money grubber whose butt got kicked and she turned it around to help the kids (which she does in a small way towards the end but it wasn't written strongly enough). I want to get hooked in to the main character, even if I don't like them, they have to be believable and I have to be interested in what's going to happen and what they're going to do. Otherwise, why am I watching?<br />They had good actors, just weak material.<br />I saw the unrated version, and I don't think a protruding object in one's pants, or a wet spot is funny. Perhaps, it's just me? Not sure. Now, someone like Robin Williams is funny. But this movie, not in the least funny.<br />It tried to be somewhat a romantic comedy at the end, but that ended weakly as well.<br />Bummer. I wouldn't buy this for my collection.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this app is very simple but I promise that once you start playing the game, it's really hard to quit :)
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Overall, a decent movie, visually and story-wise. Not great, but not bad (story-wise it was better than Tintin).<br />The summary, a dude, tries to save a cute chick, from death, but he doesn't have a great relationship with his dad so he shuns his dad's help. Okay, that was a really loose summary, but hopefully you already know the story.<br />First, the bad, the story needed some more work. Stronger main character, better dialogue (though there were some really good moments), and more emotional drama to hook me into the story. There were some really weak moments, Visual Effects wise, which leads me to believe they had a limited budget for VFX. So, what does the mean? It means that some of the VFX were smokin hot, and others were sort of a dud (not dude). The problem with that, is we (the audience) notice the inconsistency, not good. And the love story sort of at the end, needed more development during. Come on, make us burn to have those two \\"hook-up\\" (like Mulder & Scully).<br />The good, well the action sequences were incredible, not just the VFX (the good VFX) but the directing. Very good. Some fantastic VFX. Seriously.<br />So, based on all that, I would purchase this for my library. Understanding, though the original movie, was better story wise.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a must read! From cover-to-cover I couldn't stop reading. It was so touching to read of Peeta and Katniss' growing love for each other! Well done Suzanne Collins! I hope this one makes it to the big screen as well!
0385534639|5.0|Simply, I loved this book.  If you liked Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell this is a must read.  Just magicial.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|The game is okay definitely not for young children. It's more of a pg13 there cigarettes beer alcohol of different kinds sex lust etc.  Its my second day and the first day it was fun but you just get bored from clicking away at the elements.  I'm over it, you get your $0.99 out of it.  I should say that I have little kids so I don't have the time to be playing it. If the combinations were a little more humorous it would be a lot more entertaining.  I'm using the kindle fire for the game... so beware not for young kids... other than that have fun if you got the time!
B005LAIIS0|5.0|This spelled out misery in so many ways, and how so many folks deal with it, in this case Liam N. does a first rate job of conveying the depression of pain and coping.  The wilderness \\"feeling\\" conveyed is first rate, the other actors very realistic as to a roughneck crew.  The ending is very appropriate and a twist and surprise, but still, a moving, powerful ending and performance by all the actors.  As to the wolves, alot of CGI yes, but well done, and of course there is exaggeration.  But to those that say how they are put into too negative a light, it's a story for god's sake, and the cute, cuddly version of packs that get shown on National Geographic to me are just as disturbing for being utter BS.  These animals are capable, and proven, to be supreme killers, that will kill more than they can eat given the chance and the good folks that live in the bush in AK can attest to it.  Overall, not likely what goes on in the movie but still possible, and once again, it's the performances that count.  The billfold scene should make one look at how a simple scene conveys a lifetime of history per a person reduced to a few second moment.  Won't spoil anymore, but well made, great scenes, some wild action, and overall, acting superb.
B0041X90D0|5.0|This LP is a masterpiece of expressing fun through music. It transcends the glam rock label or even its place in seventies rock history or whatever because the unique sound is too fresh to gather such dust. From the soulful background singing to the use of a lead guitar to promote the beat, to the outrageously sing-able and sometimes ridiculously enjoyable  lyrics, this music puts a bop in my step, a song in my heart and a smile on my face. I tip my hat to Mr. Bolan and offer him a prayer because he cheers me up with this music.
B0087DFIOU|3.0|The title of this review pretty much sums up GET THE GRINGO: a violent, darkly humored noir piece.  (A friend of mine described it as PAYBACK'S \\"spiritual prequel.\\")  The film starts with a masked thief (Gibson) making his getaway across the desert.  He ends up crashing (literally) across the border, and winds up stuck in El Pueblito, a Mexican prison run more like a small town.  He befriends a kid (the excellent Kevin Hernandez) and his mother (Dolores Heredia), while at the same time trying to get his money back, protect the boy (who is basically a living organ farm), dealing with a corrupt U.S. official (Peter Gerety), and the mobster he stole the money from in the first place (Peter Stormare doing his crazy thing).<br /><br />As you can tell, there's a lot going on here.  Too much so, perhaps.  The film feels too much like Gibson's previous PAYBECK (basically, it's the same thing, except half the film is in Spanish); this is both in terms of tone (very dark in spots, very humorous in others) and plot.  Gibson is great, as usual; say what you want to about the man, but as an actor, no one does likeable sleaze better.  He's still got some bite to him, and there's never any knowing what his character will do next.  The direction, too, is solid; the problems lie with the script, which tries to do too much.  The subplots stumble over each other; this is, at its core, a simple story, like PAYBACK (I'm thinking the Director's Cut here), and should not go off on so many tangents.  Still, in terms of grit and fun, GET THE GRINGO offers plenty of both.  And, let's face it, it's nice to see Mel Gibson sinking his fangs into a dirty role again.  Who knows--if he somehow cleans up his public image, he could be having blockbusters again.  (Well, maybe not; but at least he's still got the chops to pull them off.)
1936608898|5.0|This book is awesome. I am not finished with it yet because I am FORCING myself to process the information as I read. I have already recommended it to at least 10 people, 50% of which have bought the book already and are professing it's value.<br /><br />I love that it is written in simple language, with a touch of humor thrown in to lighten up the sometimes \\"heavy\\" material.  I love that it is in sections that you can skip - or read for the in-depth scienc-y stuff. I love that it MAKES SENSE - on so many levels, and that it explains so MUCH about what is going so WRONG in our daily living.  We think we have \\"no control\\" over such things as health - that it is, perhaps, a divine plan for us to be in poor health.  This book reveals that IT IS IN OUR POWER to reverse many horrible ailments because we put ourselves into those situations by the food we choose to put on our plates. We DO have control.<br /><br />I, for one, am taking control. Thanks to this book.<br />thank you
B004SBX112|3.0|Needs to be updated, fixed, overhauled whatever. ROVIO FIX THIS MISTAKE!!!! AHHHH! Needs update and ad removal, etc etc etc
B00701L5XS|5.0|Learning to tie knots from a book can be challenging, even with illustrations. The animations provided in this app, and the fact that you can change animation speed,  makes it extremely easy to learn. Great descriptions of each knot as well.  Only improvement might be to add a cross-reference that shows each knot by its most common application situation.    Edit: I feel the need to comment to everyone screaming about spyware: please educate yourself some before flaming. The dev. explains why the permissions are there; [....] it's a known issue with the SDK, and even if s/he WERE making use of those permissions, adware and analytics do NOT constitute spyware.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|Its a great game but the glitches, graphics, and controls need an overhaul as fast as humanly possible. Seriously game loft? make a good game then spend no time on important elements of it?
0345803493|5.0|Well there are some very detailed reviews out there so no need to be say the same things again.  This book pick up where the first left off.  I am nearly done and can't put it down.  I will have the book done today, thankfully I already have the 3rd book ready to go lol.  Great books by a cleaver author, a must read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|keeps you hooked...fast paced and fun its hard to put it down. I keep saying just 1 more..I love it!
B00005JKHP|5.0|I own this version of the film and it is pretty good.  But what I am wondering is Where is the \\"Special Longer Version\\"???  This is the version that was always available on VHS and seems to have never been released on DVD or Blu Ray.  What we need is a triple DVD and Blu Ray release of this movie that contains 1. The \\"Special Longer Version\\", 2. The \\"Directors Edition\\", and 3. the original \\"Theatrical Version\\".  I gave the movie 5 stars because its Star Trek and I am such a big fan of the entire saga.

B003NHRIVQ|4.0|I loooove this movie! Great story with a wonderful cast. Plenty of angst and a really cute love story between the real life couple.
B004G600A4|5.0|The interpretation of the classic is fresh and well done. A must watch.<br />Chases, frying pan-sword fights, floods, magic, escape, adventure, theft, love, redemption, near death, dancing, and family reunion all in one disc.<br /><br />=]
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Can sing every song in my sleep! Katy Perry is amazing and has the best summer songs! I think the concert movie will be interesting to see where she gets her inspirations.
B00701L5XS|5.0|UPDATED:<br /><br />An exceptionally useful app for remembering not only how to tie various knots, but also for deciding which knot is appropriate for particular situations.  There are various web sites that have animated knot animations (netknots and grog's animatedknots for two that I've frequented), but the app makes a concise reference in my pocket.  I found the interface in this app pretty easy to use and quick to find a particular knot.<br /><br />When I first tried this app a year ago, there was a glitch or two running on my Galaxy Nexus: sometimes it wrote text over itself, and it had some initial slowness.  However, I've not seen this in subsequent versions.<br /><br />When I originally wrote this review, this app included several modules that appeared to have data collection purposes, but which weren't being used by the developer; rather they came from CoronaSDK, which was used to build this app.  The developer has since removed these permissions and released the app with NO special permissions at all.  This is very commendable and shows him to have a high integrity.<br /><br />Summary: a useful app that I'd highly recommend.abled.  I can only take his word that he's not selling information about me on the side, and the app is not serving up ads.  The real problem is CoronaSDK, and the only way to get that corrected is to have pressure put on it via the developers who pay for it.<br /><br />Summary: useful app that is tainted by the inclusion of an SDK with bad properties.

1599218011|5.0|I had read her blogs.  I was a fan of her FB page.  I knew her story.  Yet, I had never actually read one of her books until this one.  I wish I hadn't waited so long.  She is so engaging, and I love the information she puts out and the format she uses.  The things she has to say are usually found to be preachy to the mainstream, but she comes across as nothing remotely close to preachy.  I felt like I was talking (or listening rather - though I have been known to talk back to my books!) to a close friend.  This book is full of priceless knowledge about your body and how to keep it or get it healthy, and Kris is a comforting chearleader who you will feel as though you've known for years!  Crazy, Sexy, Cool! :D
B004P1JEWU|4.0|If you've read the first two books of the Game of Thrones saga, no doubt you will be drawn to Book 3 where the myriad of characters continue to fight the Others, the whytes and each other.  I hope you didn't become too attached to any character in the first two books, because many are dispatched, injured or maimed or just plain disappear in this double volume. Not to worry - they are replaced with a whole lot of new folk - keeping up with these is the challenge facing ardent followers.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|It's a matter of taste. If you love action movies you'll hate this film. The most americans like uplifting and happy ending films which makes a lot of their films cheesy. This is not one of them. Therefore I liked it.  It's a bit depressing but it touches  basic philosophical questions about life, death and survival.  I think one star reviews are pointless  because the film has its qualities even if it's not our cup of tea.

B005QPGHQU|5.0|Considering I thought Evanescence was long gone after hearing break-up rumors and the many years since their last album, this new album was surprisingly good. They are such a talented band who continue to produce quality music. A lot of albums have come out this year and honestly, no band is making music as good as this. No matter how much \\"good\\" music I listen to, I keep coming back to this album, realizing what a masterpiece it really is. It seems like they put a lot of thought and hard work into each song. This is not an album you can just slap together. So, if you are an Evanescence fan, this is a MUST-HAVE.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Book Three begins after they are married and are on their honeymoon in Europe.  There is some conflict with Christian's controlling ways and his adjustment to being in a married relationship.  Anastasia is learning to deal with her married life, having money while maintaining her independence.  I do find this to be realistic, since this is their first real relationship.  He has his old conceptions to let go of and she has her life lessons to learn.<br /><br />I like that Anastasia does continue to call out Christian on his issues, problems, etc.  He is still overprotective, non -verbal about some concerns and angry when she exerts her independence.  She fights back and pushes his limits for emotional growth.  He deals with Mrs. Robinson as an adult, not a child.  So he is finally able to let go of his relationship with her.  This is something necessary to  the growth of his relationship with Anastasia.<br /><br />They still have the craziness of the prior two books with ex-subs and dangerous ex-bosses.  I was able to predict a particular plot twist as to whom and why the ex-boss is trying to get revenge on Christian. The lengths Jack goes to is pretty extreme, but you will see why Jack is so nasty.<br /><br />They are still very active with their sex life all over and often.  They try all sorts of new sex toys including plugs, clamps, etc.  I did find some of the writing a little repetitive. Allowing for the fact that this is Anastasia's first sexual relationship, she never seems to have an off moment.  I wonder how she and Christian manage to have careers, outside lives, friends, etc. while being locked in the Red Room of Pain or their bedroom.<br /><br />This is definitely the happiest of the three books, since they are married and working together to build a happy life.  We learn more about Christian's issues and the life events which caused them.  We see them mature for the most part, while things like family questions continue to be answered.<br /><br />I wishthe editing was done a bit better and was not so repetitive.  Surely, a college educated person like Anastasia must have a bigger vocabulary other than \\"Gah\\" to express her feelings.  I understand that their relationship is based in sex a lot but it seemed like a lot of the same every time.  The repetitiveness made this a fast read.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|Sad because I expected as much from this book as the first three. A lot of senseless talking by the characters and no mention of some of the original characters. Also, where are the dire wolves?  It was not as engaging or methodical as the previous books.  Sad as this is the closing to the end of a great beginning.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I like the app.  Runs well on the Kindle Fire.  But, 2 things:<br />-Because the Kindle Fire (annoyingly) has the power button on the bottom, I typically read with it in portait mode but \\"upside down\\" so that i don't accidentally shut down the Fire.  BUT, unlike just about every other app, Flipboard does re-orient.<br />-On the Fire. The app icon that shows up in the app library bookshelf and Favorites, is just a gray box; no nice red arrow.  The big icon in the carousel does show fine.<br /><br />Fix, please!

0671494120|5.0|This classic look at how the West was Won (or Stolen) from 1860-1890 remains a powerful statement about greed, suffering, and betrayal.  Using single-chapter narratives, the author outlines how Indians of the Great Plains and West were deprived of their land via a series of broken treaties, false promises, and military force.  The culprits were land-hungry settlers, greedy prospectors, crooked Indian agents, and an arrogant U.S. government that viewed Native Americans as a nuisance - or worse.  Readers learn about proud tribes like the Sioux, Commanches, Navaho, Ute, and Apache, plus top leaders like Sitting Bull, White Tail, Red Cloud, Geronimo, Black Kettle, Crazy Horse, etc.  Their goal?  To maintain their land and lifestyle in the face of rapid expansionism.  Readers also learn about Indian agents, U.S. military commanders (Sherman, Sheridan, Custer, etc.),  missionaries, Buffalo Soldiers, interpreters and traders, a varied collection that ranged from violent Indian-haters to some that honestly strove to help and befriend Native Americans.  As many know, the U.S. government repeatedly promised Indians certain lands via treaty, then quickly violated those treaties when settlers, prospectors, or railroad interests wanted that land.  Such forces played out in places like the Black Hills and Powder River Country, and in events like the Sand Creek Massacre and Little Big Horn.  The book outlines overt racism, cruelty, plus outright attrocities - commited primarily by whites, but also by Indians.  I didn't realize how many chiefs ventured to Washington DC to meet the Great White Father in usually fruitless efforts to preserve their land and lifestyle.<br /><br />Author Dee Brown (1908-2002) was a reporter, librarian and professor, one who's youthful acquiantance with baseball pitcher Moses Yellowhorse (Pawnee Tribe) spurred his interest in Native American Indians.  As Brown metaphorically states in the introduction, readers should face eastward (rather than westward) when reading this book.  Brown combines gripping prose, suspense, plus documented footnotes to provide a highly-readable classic.when reading this book.

0307352145|5.0|\\"In a gentle way, you can shake the world.\\" - Gandhi<br /><br />Our current society is all about the big splash and the loudest voice being heard. This book is all about the 1/3 to 1/2 of this society that are introverts, living our best lives when we can regenerate in quiet - withdrawn from an extroverted world.<br /><br />I love this book - it's all about my life. I learned at an early age how to turn on an extrovert personality and engage to be successful, and then retreat into a solitude to close out all sounds and activity to regroup.<br /><br />This world is sometimes so loud, I think everyone should read this book and find a part of themselves here.
B0088WGBC8|5.0|The HD version of \\"Safe House\\" on Amazon Prime was crisp, clear and displayed as well as any DVD on our flat screen TV. The movie itself was intriguing and exciting from start to finish with twists and surprises throughout. The actors did a superb job and Denzel Washington, as usual, was in top acting form. I will download movies from Amazon again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I consider this to be one of the best collections of mini games available. my favorites include seranade and magnet roller. recommend it!
B004H83IM8|4.0|I purchased the \\"1-3 Collection\\" on DVD.  I know enough about the other versions that I can compare/contrast.  If you're looking for information about the movies themselves, look elsewhere - I'm not going to mention the plots, the cast, etc. in this review.<br /><br />First, the \\"Austin Powers 1-3 Collection\\" on DVD.  You get two DVD's.  The first and third movies are on a 'flipper' disc, with the second movie on its own disc.  A little strange, perhaps, but no biggie.<br /><br />Comparing it the the Blu Ray collection, other than packaging difference (3 blu rays in their own slim cases instead of two dvd's) the contents are identical.  All movies are in 2.4:1 aspect ratio.  Each movie features commentary, deleted scenes, etc.  And while the DVD transfer is perfectly acceptable, I can see how these movies would really \\"pop\\" in HD.  If you like these movies enough, spend the extra $ for blu ray.<br /><br />Comparing it to the first release of individual DVD's, note that (1) the first movie is presented in its proper 2.4:1 aspect ratio here, but not on the individual DVD (I don't know what aspect ratio was used, but it was wrong) and (2) that the extras on the individual discs are less.  Since you can easily find the \\"1-3 Collection\\" for about $8 shipped, I recommend purchasing the \\"1-3 Collection\\" if you choose to buy on the DVD format.

B00846REIS|3.0|I thought this was an okay read. A pretty good follow up to the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. This not the best well written book of all time but if you are looking for Page turning erotica this is it.

B0086700CM|4.0|over all it is a great game, and very addictive. sometimes the response times on the controls are slightly delayed but not enough to completely mess up the gameplay. also, if your kindle reaches 15% battery while playing it doesn't pause when he notification pops up which can ruin your momentum and mess up the flow of the game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Painfully bad writing.  Preposterously foolish characters.  Deeply dangerous message.  Sexual situations that were neither original, enticing or even salacious.<br /><br />The most disturbing aspect of it is so many people buying it--and what that says about the perception of relationships in current society. Or perhaps it is merely a statement on the power of tweeting.<br /><br />C'mon.  There are better plots, better characters, better sex of any type, and better pricing on a lot of other books out there.  Try some of them, instead.

B00846REIS|3.0|This was a good quick read after coming off the Fifty Shades trilogy, which I loved.  The book is similar, with the plot line being pretty much the same.  I thought it was better written, the vocabulary level was better maintained and the there wasn't a continuous repetition of phrases, like in Fifty Shades, with that being said, I didn't get as into the characters as I did with Ana and Christian.  Maybe that's because there was only one book, as opposed to three.  I did preorder the follow up to this book, so maybe I'll change my mind after the second one
0345803485|2.0|I've only read 15% of the book (sorry, don't know how many pages - reading it on kindle) and I'm not sure I will be able to finish. I've heard so much about this book and was excited to read it. I guess it's yet another anomaly, just like Twilight. Pisses me off.<br /><br />First of all, Ana is 21 and an English lit student, but she sounds like a 14 year old teenager. How many times do I have to read \\"Crap\\", \\"Oh my\\", \\"Jeez\\" etc? Are you kidding me? I want to hit my head on the wall every time I have to read yet another \\"Double crap\\".<br />Second of all, WHY would a succesfull billionaire want this clumsy annoying girl? In the real world a guy like would never even look at her. Get real!<br />The writing is so poor... English is not even my first language, but I know for sure I can write better than that ( as far as vocabulary goes). I think the writer used the word \\"impassive\\" about 10348572048562 times. Sometimes she repeats the entire sentences. Oh my...And if Christian is so confident, arrogant and bad-ass, why does he \\"murmur\\" most of the time???<br /><br />The only thing that's helped me read it so far, is that I imagine Ryan Gosling as Christin Grey. And Ryan Gosling is hot.

B0072GPQNG|1.0|I'll admit, I wasn't walking into this film with the highest of expectations.  Even from the trailer, the film looked like a misguided campfest complete with overly saccharine elements and cringe worthy plot points.  What I got was pretty much what I expected, so I guess I shouldn't be so let down.  I guess what really upsets me the most here is that despite my initial assumptions about the film, part of me wanted to believe that the trailer misrepresented what Spielberg constructed and so there was a small part of me that expected to be proved wrong.<br /><br />`War Horse' suffers from a lot of things.  In fact, I'm scrapping the bottom of the barrel trying to find something of merit here, but even the obvious (\\"wow, it is so pretty to look at\\") can be debunked when scrutinized (I'll get to that in a minute).<br /><br />First things first though; this story is ridiculous.  I know that many a story has been told about the effect an animal will have on a household or a community or just a young boy.  Most of these stories revolve around dogs and so it has become almost acceptable for that to be the case.  Lap it up, because we all bawl our eyes out when Old Yeller gets `put down'.  There is something odd though about the fixation formed on this horse.  Sure, horse movies aren't new and there are some told with true affection, but nothing about the relationship formed between Albert and his horse Joey feels genuine.  I blame the script and or Spielberg's shoddy direction for that.  I mean, there is no relationship developed here at all.  Because of that, we could really care less about the rest of this movie.  Sure, sell the horse.  Let is gallivant through the war touching lives like Forrest Gump.  Problem is, you've got scattered segments showing very little in the way of character development that the horse because nothing but a pretty prop.  When an elderly man makes a claim that Joey was the light of his granddaughter's life I'm left shrugging my shoulders because I saw her pet the thing once and ride it for all of thirty seconds before some soldiers took it away from her.  Basically, I don't care how she felt about the horse because it wasn't shown to me here.<br /><br />And then you just have the uncomfortable way in which Albert's affections for the horse are displayed.  It makes young Albert appear to be a simpleton.  I mean, I understand that he is younger than he looks (he attempts to pass for nineteen so as to stay alongside Joey when he's sold to a soldier) but he is still supposed to be a teenager of driving age and yet he basically wets himself when a soldier mails him a drawing he made of the horse.  It just feels so, unnatural.  It isn't compelling and it doesn't endear him to us.  Beyond the fact that I saw no reason to be attached considering that Spielberg didn't even try to add weight to the relationship between the boy and the horse, I just found his pining annoying.<br /><br />Then you have the heavily manipulated ending, which was nauseating in its forcible sentimentality.  The whole tone of the film is a miss, considering that parts feel like it was reaching for family comedy (that goose) and other parts trying for tense drama (fail) and yet other parts were so embarrassing I felt like I was watching a fake film, like those created for `Tropic Thunder'.<br /><br />The acting by everyone outside of Jeremy Irvine is very good, I will say.  Problem is, no one is really on screen long enough to build a character (outside of Irvine, Mullan and Watson who carry the film's first hour).  And then you have the cinematography, which is the `obvious' part I was referring to on the outset of my review.  I'm sorry, but this was too much.  I love a good showy celluloid frame.  I mean, films like `Atonement' and `The Tree of Life' are just so catching and heartstopping.  `War Horse' tries to go there.  The trailer alone was basically an FYC add for the film's cinematographer.  Instead though, the film's canvas seems ripped from other films and the way the shots are framed is almost comical.  Is it just me or does everyone in the first hour appear to be dwarfs?  The framing is ghastly!  It gets better, but then it goes all `Gone With the Wind' in the final frames (seriously) and I had to roll my eyes again.<br /><br />Having now seen all of the nominated films from Oscar's Best Picture ballot last year, I'm baffled this was included.<br /><br />I mean, HOW?pped from other films and the way the shots are framed is almost comical.

B0085KGGHI|5.0|Improv at its finest. Where else would you have the king of blues, Muddy Water joined by the kings of rock and roll, the Rolling Stones, AND Junior Wells AND Buddy Guy? The chain smokin' guitarists for the Rolling Stones started out of tune and behind a beat or two, but what the heck, this was improv after all. They eventually caught up.<br /><br />Phenomenal historical musical event. Muddy grinding away at his slide guitar while the Rolling Stones sit in the audience, waiting to be summoned to the stage by the legend, Muddy Waters.<br /><br />Man, to be in the audience for this, now that was the ticket of the year.<br /><br />Great blues, great music, great masters, great camera work, great DVD and in Buddy Guy's club to boot!!<br /><br />If this could be rated 7 stars, I would rate it there. Freakin' unbelievable performance.

The theatrical release is here ONLY in Blu-ray, and the extended version is here ONLY as a DVD. If like me you don't have Blu-ray, you won't be able to watch the theatrical release. And if on the other hand you wanted to watch the highly-regarded extended version in Blu-ray quality, this set won't give you that option.

0743243153|5.0|I bought this book about 15-20 years ago when I was a newly-married young mother.  I must have the read the first few pages and then put it away and just found it last week -- 3 kids and 2 failed marriages later.  I am still an optimistic, happy, strong fun-living person.  I am also confused and lost on the many why's of life.  I don't think the author wrote this to solve the world's problems and certainly not to solve my problems but so much of what he's written about makes so much sense and provides such clarity.  Misconceptions we hold as the truth (that I always suspected were misconceptions) are explained.  Why some are strong in the face of horrible tragedy while others crumble with a gentle breeze.  Most importantly, many of my everyday \\"whys\\" (why did I do this, why didn't I do that) I now understand and no longer feel isolated by them.  I may not have been ready for this book in my late 20's and maybe that's why it was put away.  Now that I am pushing 50 and as determined to live my life as I always have been -- and to raise my 3 kids to be confident in their abilities to navigate through life -- this book summarizes so much of what I have faced and let's me know I'm doing ok.  I've always changed my roadmap as needed and that was EXACTLY what keeps me energetic, enthusiastic and ready to soak in more life.  Thank you Dr. Peck, so helping another woman realize she's gonna be just fine!

B0055PGUYU|4.0|This is a very insightful book into human behavior and habits. It does a great job of breaking down several components influencing habits and gives you tools to address them so you can reverse them or create new ones to replace them. If you are facing challenges in your life, which most of us are, then I strongly suggest you pick up this book. After all, we are all creatures of habit.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|I have not read the novel, but I found Jennifer's performance absolutely riveting and convincing as the poor white girl raising a passel o' young'uns between hard times and the law. The story did not drag for me, as character study was 50% of the narrative.  Yes, there was a little *too* much authenticity: *every*one in rural Ozark Missouri lived in a rundown frame house right out of a 60s documentary on \\"The Other America;\\" *every*one bore a \\"character-etched face\\" out of a Dorothea Lange photograph; *all* were in touch with their home roots through banjos, fiddles and gospel.  A little *too* much \\"code of the hills.\\"  But nevertheless well worth watching and the awards it won.

0061726834|3.0|As with Lauren Oliver's book \\"Before I Fall\\", I really enjoyed her writing style in this novel - she has a beautiful way with words. But whilst I found the concept of love being viewed as a dreaded disease (amor deleria nervosa) quite intriguing, there were too many inconsistencies in the storyline to fully work for me. Unlike other dystopian novels like the \\"Hunger Games\\", the dystopian society described in \\"Delirium\\" did not fully convince me. What was the motivator for stamping out love? Why go to all that trouble? Seeing that usually power is the prime motivator, the concept of eliminating love was not sufficient grounds for me to base the oppression of a whole society on - as I could not see any advantage for the government in doing this. Similarly, Lena's and Alex's love story did not fully manage to convince me - maybe because Lena (unlike Katniss in the Hunger Games) wasn't a strong enough character to draw the reader into her world.<br /><br />That said, the book was a light and pleasurable read. I don't think I will rush out to buy the next instalment, yet I did enjoy reading the story for Oliver's beautiful prose and analogies. 3 ½ stars from me.
0439023491|1.0|WARNING SPOILERS!!!!<br /><br />I'm about halfway done and just couldn't wait until the end to voice how bad the plot of this book is.  I'm sorry but two people having to pretend to love each other in order to prevent an uprising is honestly not realistic, even for a crazy futuristic society.  I also don't understand how all this rebellious tensions stir up in Katniss, Peeta, and Haymith, then the rule for the Quell Games are announced - and you know what they do---nothing!  It makes no sense.  What would have made sense is if they refused to participate and an actual civil war broke out.  Instead, I'm having deja vu as I have to read everything about the arena, tributes, victors, etc. all over again.  I thought that Book 2 would be different and bring in an entirely new plot (See Harry Potter books), but it literally is a joke how identical and immaturely written to say the least.  I expected better, Suzanne.
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed the Hunger games trilogy but Shades was by far the best series I've read in years. The writing was excellent . The characters portrayed in depth.<br /> I had heard it was a good read from friends but didn't think I'd be carrying my Kindle with me everywhere just to see what happened next. A hot and steamy summers read.<br />Everyone should be so lucky as to have a Mr. Grey!
B00701L5XS|4.0|&quot;Knot&quot; bad, lol! It should come in handy once in a while. A keeper. Not quite worth 5 stars, but totally worth the price...free! (for today, anyway)
B0063IH60K|1.0|well they have lost me now. the ads trying to match me with singles won't let me get past their ad. I am happily married and don't need to see this crap when I am playing and then have to shut down the game to get rid of it. bad move mobilityware.
0345803485|1.0|I think after the author spent an hour writing this piece of garbage, she went out into her backyard and performed some satanic ritual in order to make her rich and famous. There is no way people are this stupid, or are they??? This is a bestseller? Really? I'm infuriated!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am not a game player but this is awesome! works great on my kindle fire. easily downloaded and runs smoothly.
0451228375|4.0|This book is good, but not as good as its predecessor, Pillars of the Earth. The characters are believable and draw you in, although the story is somewhat soap operaish. If I'd known the print were so small, I would have looked for a book with larger print
B007U44492|5.0|This is a movie that you have to really sit and watch from the beginning. It is another awesome Nicholas Cage movie. It is also another one that my 2 teenage boys just love and have watched just about every night.
B007C4E1R0|5.0|This is the third book in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo books and it is keeping everything going right along with the stories. I am really enjoying this collection!! Book came to me in great condition and I paid under half of the original cost!!

031620157X|4.0|Alex and Conner Bailey are 11 year-old twins. They have been in the same class in school since kindergarten. Alex is the smart one who always knows all the answers and Conner is the joker who sits in the back of the class and doesn't really understand the class work. Their class, under the direction of their teacher Mrs. Peters, has been learning about fairy tales. Neither Alex or Conner really need to learn anything new about fairy tales, because when they were young they would go to their grandmother's cottage with their parents and their dad and grandmother would read them fairy tales late into the night. Unfortunately, their dad died on their 11th birthday, nearly a year ago. The twins know not to expect too much for their 12th birthday, things are tight for their working single mother, but they are surprised by a visit from their grandmother. She gives them their gifts and then as a special surprise she gives them the book of fairy tales that she had read to them when they were small. Alex is thrilled with the gift and quickly takes it to her room when she goes to bed, but realizes quickly that the book won't let her sleep, it insists on humming and glowing off and on all night and the next several nights. Conner's not sure what's up with Alex, she's acting strange, he finds out about the book a few days later at school. When the book interrupts their class, Alex knows that she needs to find out why it glows and hums. She goes home, opens it and sticks her hand inside and ends up toppling head first into the book. Conner follows and they realize that they are in a beautiful fairy tale world, a place that they both had only dreamed about before. The fairy tale world is a dangerous place though, filled with witches, wolves, goblins and trolls. They know that they need to return home to their mom, but just how are they going to manage that?<br /><br />I was sucked into this story from the prologue, the story itself is engaging, full of action and adventure and just plain fun. Who doesn't want to meet such characters as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel? I really enjoyed Alex and Conner, I felt sad for them for having lost their dad at such a young age and then worried for them as they navigated the dangerous Land of Stories. This was a fun bookt plain fun. Who doesn't want to meet such characters as Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel?

B000002HEP|5.0|KYUSS is one of the best heavy rock bands of all time!! SKY VALLEY is another masterpiece...i thought BLUES FOR THE RED SUN was their best album, but this one is at the same high level...All the songs are great, like GARDENIA, 100 degrees, SPACE CADET, DEMON CLEANER and ODYSSEY!!!! man, i also thought JOSHUA HOMME was an incredible guitarrist on QOTSA, but on his KYUSS years is where Josh really shine....JOHN GARCIA GOT A GREAT voice, and all the band is amazing!!!!REALLY GREAT!!! WELL DONE, KYUSS!!!!
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|If you want a solid, rugged, reliable watch the SKX007 is a must. No battery to replace - it's automatic - wear it and it keeps on going. The luminosity is very bright too, so you'll have access to the time in the dark. Let's not to forget to mention the '007' part of the watch's description, it was good enough for James Bond, but it doesn't launch nuclear warheads, or shoot out darts - well if it does I haven't found those functions yet. A great buy!<br /><br />Note, I bought my skx007 from this seller. Good deal, communication and excellent delivery time!
0439023513|4.0|This is the book I think that should have been the second book.  It is just what I thought the second was going to be about.  My favorite character was missing most of the book, Peeta.  Katniss isn't my favorite but she is interesting.  I find it funny that everyone she knows knows her better than she knows herself.<br /><br />I liked this book better then the second because it was more thought provoking like the first book. In the end of Mockingjay you are not sure who wins or who was the right leader to follow. It is well written and there are twists and turns. Was sad getting to the ending.  At least there will be the movies to watch in the future.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it is way fun and it passes time. Its very addictive. I give this 5 stars!!!!!!!

B0032FPVKE|5.0|I was sweating bullets after reading other reviews here, but both my Pentax camera bodies; K100D Super and K-5; with a new 40 mm XS pancake lens (review and photos under that product) fit like hand in glove.<br /><br />A few things I was not prepared for were (a) the outstanding extra zippered storage on both ends and on one side.  No problem with extra batteries, lens cleaning accessories, a few filters, and extra SD cards; and (b) build quality equivalent to my Lowepro bag which I use with with my K-5 and two or three additional lenses.<br /><br />The beauty of this system is that it is so light and unobtrusive, I can (and will) now literally take it everywhere.<br /><br />The key is the 40mm XS lens and this bag.  See the photos I posted.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|okay I thought this game was going to be totally lame but its very addictive and fun! I love mind games. its almost 5stars but not quite!
B00701L5XS|1.0|I have no idea why it needs access to phone calls but perhaps that is why it doesn't work on a tablet since there ICISF no phoniness capability.  It would never open just crash the tablet.  It sounded like a clever idea but clever ideas work.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Succumbed to the hype and dissappointed, yes it's x rated and basically an erotic novel but literary skill it doesn't have. If you took out the sex it would be rubbish. Great if that's what you want but not exactly a mind expander!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A bestseller? SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! This is so not deserving of even one star.<br /><br />Plot summary: BDSM Dominant hot bajillionaire with a perfect body and freakishly long manicured fingers stalks innocent college virgin who gapes, gasps, and says, \\"Oh crap.\\" He in turn inhales sharply, growls, and makes her eat. She flushes (her face, not the toilet) and bites her lip while her \\"inner goddess\\" performs ridiculous Olympic-worthly stunts. She orgasms every five minutes from his grey eyes alone and every time on command (if only ladies, if only), then with his mouth in a grim line she breaks up with him for spanking her with a belt. She cries.<br /><br />Ugh. First off, what a gross description of his hands! That detail alone bothered me throughout the whole book. The time line is awful (it covers what, two weeks or something?), Christian should be on medication for his Parkinson's (*twitch, twitch*), and you'd think they'd run into a wall more often with all the eye rolling and narrowing. Considering they have sex twice a day every day you would assume that Christian has the stamina of a racehorse. Nope, he's a three pump chump! Who wants to bet on a horse that tires at the first turn? Honestly. It shouldn't be considered an erotic novel when the author used copy and paste and neglected to use her built-in thesaurus.<br /><br />Overall, the author attempted to sexualize and romanticize a completely jealous control freak, giving losers all across the globe hope of ruining a perfectly normal girl. Now girls are clamoring over the idea of having a jealous control freak who has to beat the crap out of their partner to get off woe them with helicopters, cars, Blackberries and spankings. I just threw up a little in my mouth.

B007T9UIMA|4.0|Nice to have a video of their performances that's professionally made as opposed to fan made.  The fan made ones are OK, but usually the audio is poor and camera holder is screaming so much, you can't hear the guys singing.  It's very, very distractiing.  My main problem with it is that they didn't sing two of my favorite songs off the album.  \\"Stole My Heart\\" and \\"Taken\\" wasn't sung which is a shame, because those are some of the better tracks.  They should have sung those songs instead of wasting time with that \\"Valerie\\" and \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" rubbish.  Otherwise I would have given it five stars.  But with those other songs you do get to hear some of them doing solos.  You get a peak back stage which is cool too, and a little behind-the-scenes footage that's enjoyable.  Overall I'm pleased with it and think it's worth the money.
B007U2ABXM|5.0|The hardcover book that accompanies the deluxe edition is well worth seeking - a beautiful document to complement a superb new recording from Patti Smith.
B0000046KM|5.0|the voice of a woman who seems to have truly lived...\\"heres to life\\" is a classic. A friend shared the song with me many years ago and it still is relevant and poignant.

B007R6X9OE|5.0|I just purchased the album and played it at least four times finding new turns and surprising twists every time. As a DM fan, I have to say that this album is outstanding and extremely well made. I think all parties involved gave it their all to make it sound so beautiful and touching. What a joy! David did it again!His vocals are superb.
1594484805|5.0|I found this book while reading an article about Burning Man, if you can believe that?<br />I liked it so much I bought the book it was based on.
B007P06DJK|5.0|The music has the power, and the power of the music remains. If Graceland is best work of Paul Simon. The songs of the CD stay so fresh, so powerful, so joyful ... like the first day, where you have listened them for the first time ... timeless. The DVD \\"Under African Skies\\" is very emotional, when you listen all the actors ... musicians, actors, activists. It is funny, because I don't remember that the controversy was so tense (and sometimes so violent) maybe I was to focus to discover the music of South Africa. The Graceland Tour in 1987 is for me one of the best Paul Simon tour.
0061339202|5.0|I was intrigued while reading this book. So much so that I purchased a related book.<br />This is a psychology classic.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I selected this book uncertain as to whether a Wyoming sheriff would create a strong story.  I am now certain beyond a doubt that it can!<br /><br />The characters are all interesting and very well developed.  The writing is descriptive without being flowery or over-developed.  There is a touch of humor throughout that keeps the story lively.  I find myself thinking about the characters - Walt, Henry, Vic, Cady, Sancho - even when I'm away from the book.  It's as if they're real acquaintances that I have a relationship with.<br /><br />I picked this book up on a Kindle sale but, in strong testimony to the strength of the writing and character interest, have now purchased three more stories (in sequence, of course) at full price.  Smart marketing, Amazon!<br /><br />To that point, the stories reference previous occurrences. So, to keep up with references, it is best to start with the first story and read in published sequence.  The references to earlier stories won't diminish the strength of the story but, if the reader isn't familiar with the background events, it leaves a slight hole and definitely limits what could be the full texture of the story.<br /><br />I started out tentatively and am now addicted to the world of Walt Longmire.  If you want to enjoy a long-term reading relationship and enjoy well-written mysteries, this is the series for you!
1936891026|2.0|I was expecting this to be a real winner by reading the reviews.<br />It was actually a dud! There are a few gems in the material, but it's hardly worth the postage.<br />Perhaps if you find it at a yard sale for 50cents!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First, I want to comment on the one-star reviews on this book.<br /><br />None of the one-star reviews had any indication that the reviewer actually READ any of the Wool series.  These reviewers call it \\"boring\\" or \\"redundant\\" or \\"impossible to read.\\"  They don't mention the characters, or the setting.  They don't mention the development of the series.<br /><br />What I want to know is WHAT BOOK ARE THEY READING?<br /><br />Mr. Howey never tells us where the story takes place.  It is all reveled bit by bit from the viewpoint of the characters in question.  Each new piece of information in the first short story takes you by surprise as you try to figure out where the characters are.  The fake-out at the end of the first short story was enough to tick me off - and why was that?  Because I was deeply invested in Sheriff Holston's life and death.  Howey told me that Sheriff Holston was going to die at the very beginning of the story, and then made me believe that he'd cheated death.<br /><br />Howey reminds me in a way of Joss Whedon.  He isn't afraid to kill off a beloved character to advance his story.  We aren't even introduced to the heroine until Wool 2.  But we learn that she is woven into the entire story, from the beginning.<br /><br />And that's something else, the characters in these stories are alive, with a deep and rich back story.  They are not cardboard cutouts, they have history, history that is felt even when it isn't stated.<br /><br />I love the environment.  While some authors create a whole galaxy to play in, to explore stories of the human condition, Howey has created a precise laboratory, a micro-environment filled with arks that are filled with human stories.<br /><br />Last, the thing I hate the most about self-published books is the poor editing, spell checking, and grammar.  Seriously - most self-published books could have been written by high school students meeting their research paper requirement the week before they are due.<br /><br />I never got that feeling with Wool.<br /><br />I never once caught a misspelling, a grammatical error, a break in the logic and premise of the story.  It flowed in that natural, easy way that looks so easy but is really very hard to do.  I don't know if Howey had an editor or if he edited the work himself, but it feels like it was edited by an experienced professional.<br /><br />The only unfortunate part of this review is that I have a difficult time using Mr. Howey's name with a straight face.  But be sure that I'll be reading his other works, regardless of that bit of silliness.ever got that feeling with Wool.<br /><br />I never once caught a misspelling, a grammatical error, a break in the logic and premise of the story.

B003F5NSTW|4.0|This book deals with a subject that is both morbidly fascinating and horrific. And it does it with an educated voice that feels real. It feels like the whole thing was real. I was compelled to keep reading because, in the end, I kept forgetting it was a work of fiction.<br /><br />True events are woven organically with the false in a way that lends this story credibility, rather than a sense of cheek. And although I guessed the twist at the end about two-thirds of the way through, I wasn't ever certain. The possibility just occurred to me - and so the compulsion to read was even greater.<br /><br />A tragic, heartbreaking, thoughtful read for adults. Perfect for a book club. True depth, alongside real life questions.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Amazing not hard, and not so easy either, some of the puzzles will leave you scratching your head but it's a great game troughout
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Underworld to me was a great horror movie with lots of potential for more movies.  I can honestly say I am a major fan of these movies and hope they can make more of these movies.  It had lot of hype but it lived up to the hype with the movie and all the bonus material.  I enjoy watching all things with these movie and wasn't disappionted.  One major plus was the fight scenes some of better fight scenes in a horror movie I've seen in a while.  Also very good acting from all the actors, I couldn't see anything wrong with this first movie in the set.  So if your looking for some good vampire wearwolves movie then pick this movie up and enjoy some good blood gore and much more from both sides of the fighting.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|great story could have used a few more details when it came to sex. beautiful read thank you for writing stories like that
B001HN697M|4.0|Underworld 3: Rise of the Lycans might be the third movie in the set.  But you actually have to watch this 3rd movie before watching the rest of the movies because this movie sets the first movie up.  Not to spoil the movie set ups.  The intro to the first movie is the ending of the 3rd dilogue wise.  But as for the movie itself great movie, good plotline, and some great horror scenes.  I give you an example of the fight scene when the lycans get shot in the head by the arrows brutal but amazing to watch if your a fan of horror.  I do hope they make more Underworld movies, I'll state my reason in my other reviews.  So if your a fan of horror movies, lots of blood gore and some good story lines then pick this movie up and watch for yourself a good horror movie.  Plus had many great movie lines from the main actor in it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush displays the youthful exuberance shown in 2112 with the release of Clockwork Angels. They pour themselves out - it's as if they don't have a loyal fan base and have something to prove. I have such tremendous respect for guys at this stage in their career to be able to be on the cutting edge. Please buy this album - show the band your support with your $$$.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|Underworld awakening is a good movie in the Underworld set. I only gave it four stars because of the fact it's only about hour and twenty minutes long before the end credits.  It does set up a 5th movie in the set and movie rumors say that scott speedman is coming back as Micheal for the 5th movie in the set but guess we will just have to wait and see if it's true.  As for the movie itself I personally enjoy it, good story line and lots of action scenes.  I did agree with a few reviews that said they wish the super wearwolf had more air time on sceen.  But it was still a great movie and well worth waiting for it to be on DVD.  So if you love to watch vampire or wearwolf movies then pick this up and enjoy some good horror on a free evening with your buddies or just by yourself while relaxing from life or work.  Plus forget the bad reviews just make up your own mind after watching it.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I used to love this game now its so boring its so 3 years ago I don't get why Ppl still have this game they gotta make this game more exciting not just u defeate
B000F6IOBQ|4.0|Underworld Evolution was a good horror movie but... I agree with some of the reviewers the story line was strange to say the least.  I enjoy the beginning of the movie, then slow up in middle, but I actually enjoy the ending personally.  So for this movie I have to say if your just looking for some mindless entertainment to have during a free evening then pick this movie up and enjoy some good amount of blood and gore, decent story line that sets up the 4th movie in the set Awakening.  But to me this is still a good movie worth 4 stars but falls into what I call love it or hate movies.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christopher Nolan faced a seemingly insurmountable uphill battle with The Dark Knight Rises. Ignoring for a moment our sky high expectations, The Dark Knight trilogy faced the deadly \\"third movie\\" curse, which has sunk so many otherwise great franchises. In the crowded superhero landscape, where The Avengers can make over $1B in just a couple of months, Nolan's movies are in such a unique, singular place that they don't have to compete with Marvel and their shared universe. His biggest competition is with his own, well-established greatness that has sent our hopes for the finale soaring.<br /><br />With those expectations comes the realization that \\"sticking the landing\\" is the hardest part of every trilogy, but if there's anyone who could shatter that trend it would be Nolan. While it was clear that he was still finding his footing with Batman Begins, Nolan's confident clarity of vision took hold in The Dark Knight, and sharpened to laser precision in The Dark Knight Rises. We've never seen an epic hero's journey quite like this before. The Dark Knight trilogy breaks beyond the confines of the traditional superhero movie into something unrecognizable; thrilling in the way you know something truly special is unfolding right before your eyes. For good reason, many will enter into this film thinking Nolan could never best the spectacular heights of The Dark Knight, but those people will exit The Dark Knight Rises with their minds blown and a totally new outlook.<br /><br />It's best to look at The Dark Knight trilogy as one complete story, and in that sense the events of the previous film hang heavy over Gotham City. Nolan's movies have always been about legacy, and in this case the legacy of two men continues to loom: the Joker, and District Attorney Harvey Dent. It's now eight years since Batman willingly took the blame for Dent's crimes, saving Gotham from learning the truth of his crashing fall from grace. In the wake of the Joker's rampage, new laws have been enacted that have essentially cleaned the crime-ridden city up, with Batman not having been seen in years. Looking more world weary than ever, Commissioner Jim Gordon(Gary Oldman) knows the truth. That the peace is just a mirage, built on a mountain of lies and deception.<br /><br />Others see Gotham's peace in a different light. The city's wealthy have only grown more insulated over the years, the wealth disparity widening as the poor continue to struggle. There may not be people dying in the streets anymore, but Gotham's corruption continues to eat away at it from the inside, and certain parties are looking to exploit the plight of the downtrodden to their advantage.  Yeah, this is Nolan's most overtly political film yet, shining a spotlight on much of the anger that festers in today's society, where the rich get all the breaks and the poor just....break. Bane(Tom Hardy), a masked, hulking figure seeks to harness that rage against the top 1%, and burn Gotham City to ashes.<br /><br />Where's Bruce Wayne during all this? Holed up in his study like Howard Hughes(minus the urine jars), more of a myth than an actual man at this point. Broken down and beaten both physically and emotionally, he's a shadow of his former self. The indomitable will that seemed to radiate from him at all times is gone, leaving only a shell. It's only when his home is broken in to by a sleek and sexy cat burglar named Selina Kyle(Anne Hathaway), that he begins to feel inklings of the old curiosity again. That detective spirit starts to emerge as he checks into her background, discovering that his old enemies, the League of Shadows, may be alive and well and in Gotham City.<br /><br />Rare is the film that can take you on a roller coaster of emotions quite the way The Dark Knight Rises does, and it's safe to say you'll probably cry a couple of times, while also feeling the exhilaration of Nolan's epic direction. The film has a larger than life scope from the very beginning, kicking off with a breathtaking aerial hijacking that puts the latest Mission: Impossible to shame. Batman's conscience, the heart and soul of the Caped Crusader, has always been his loyal butler and caretaker, Alfred(Michael Caine), but this story sees them reaching a heartbreaking impasse. It's the natural evolution of their relationship, and watching it unfold is probably the toughest part of the film, even worse than watching Batman get beaten to a bloody pulp.<br /><br />And get beaten like a dog Batman surely does. Bane poses a threat the likes of which Batman has never seen. The Scarecrow was merely a psychological threat, while the Joker was lunatic id run amok. Bane is as coolly confident and unafraid as Batman ever was, and is superior in every way physically. More than that, he's equipped with a similar fanatical purity of his beliefs, which strengthens him and inspires others to die for his cause. Batman's visage, created to inspire fear in his enemies, has also become a rallying point of sorts, most notable to Thomas Blake(Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an altruistic cop who joins the fight to save Gotham. Miranda Tate(Marion Cotillard), inspired by Bruce Wayne's philanthropic notions, seeks to join him in a secret energy project that has gained Bane's unwanted attention.<br /><br />Bale's performance as Batman has always bothered me in that it never quite measures up to that of his co-stars. He was woefully overmatched by Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, to the point where that film felt smaller when the Joker wasn't on screen. Here, Bale gives what I think is his best turn of the series yet, portraying Bruce Wayne as a guy who is still bound by his family legacy. He's still endeavoring to measure up to his father. Despite all the suits and weapons and fancy vehicles, Bruce Wayne is still the kid who stood helplessly by while his parents were murdered. Those who saw Tom Hardy in the MMA flick, Warrior, know the terrifying volatility he can bring, and he does much the same here. Only what makes Bane even scarier is his nonchalant attitude, and the fact you can only understand about half of what he's saying.  Hathaway doesn't get enough to work with to surpass Michelle Pfeiffer's iconic performance as Catwoman, but she's got the sultry and conflicted character down to a tee. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Marion Cotillard are all typically outstanding, but I think people will be mostly surprised by how well Joseph Gordon-Levitt steps into the big leagues here.<br /><br />Clocking in at roughly 2 hours and 45 minutes, you never feel for a second that the film is dragging along or being padded out to fill time. Every scene that Nolan leaves in is essential, even as he diverts some of his attention to the subplots of the supporting characters. Every one has their natural arc, fully realized and having a major impact on the final battle. Nolan ups the ante in just about every respect, ramping up the stakes to an incredible degree, and plunging Batman into the depths of despair. There's no need to be a comic book fan to understand the redemptive quest Batman faces, or to appreciate the numerous other themes Nolan has seamlessly weaved into the story. It's always been about what drives the man in the suit, not how the suit drives the man.<br /><br />As the bittersweet final minutes began to creep up, it was impossible not to start thinking about the legacy Christopher Nolan is leaving behind.  Nobody has left their stamp on a character quite like this. Certainly not Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher and their candy colored circus versions. Nolan has taken one of the most iconic characters in pop culture history, and totally redefined him in a way that nobody will be able to touch it. Certainly, others will try, but it will be a long time from now in order to escape from Nolan's shadow.  In the most simple terms, Christopher Nolan has crafted the best Batman story ever told.eathtaking aerial hijacking that puts the latest Mission: Impossible to shame.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This was the perfect solution for our Kindle 2nd Generation.  Our other cord had the coating fall apart.  Now we can charge  again.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|It took \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" three full seasons before it left the comfort and charm of the Edwardian era and entered the stormy period of the First World War.  Writer Julian Fellowes' DOWNTON ABBEY has wasted little time in getting to the war which swept away the last remnants of the austere Edwardian mentality and ushered in a new age of change.<br /><br />In the final episode of Season One, the war was announced during a celebratory garden party on the Grantham estate.  The second season jumps forward to 1916, and we first visit Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) and his colleagues as they are fighting the hideous Battle of the Somme.  Back at Downton, things have changed considerably.  Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) is now entangled with Sir Richard Carlisle (Iain Glen), a brash, \\"new money\\" newspaper publisher; whilst Matthew is now engaged to lovely Lavinia Swire (Zoe Boyle).<br /><br />Downstairs, Carson (Jim Carter) and Mrs Hughes (Phyllis Logan) attempt to keep things running smoothly despite an acute lack of male staff members - Thomas (Rob James-Collier) has joined the medical corps., whilst William (Thomas Howes) makes no secret of his plan to enlist despite the objections of his father and the other servants.  Bates (Brendan Coyle) and Anna's (Joanne Froggatt) romance hits a major stumbling block when his estranged wife (Maria Doyle Kennedy) arrives out of the blue and threatens to reveal a scandalous secret involving the Crawley's unless Bates returns to her side.<br /><br />Upstairs, the Crawley girls are itching to spread their wings.  Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay) stuns the family when she announces plans to train as a nurse; and after taking some driving lessons, Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) jaunts off to operate tractors on a farmer's property.  When it becomes painfully clear that Downton Abbey itself needs to take on a more useful, communal purpose, Isobel (Penelope Wilton) is granted permission to turn the building into a convalescent home for returned soldiers.  The move becomes a point of friction between Isobel and Cora (Elizabeth McGovern), who becomes too caught up in her own work that she fails to recognise the inner turmoil of her husband.  Unable to re-join the army and reduced in his capacity to offer any real value to the war effort, Robert (Hugh Bonneville) is faced with some important decisions of the heart...<br /><br />This second season falls just slightly below the quality of the first, script-wise.  There were a few times I remarked to myself during the course of events that \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" has already done all of this, but better.  It's true in many respects.  In this kind of period drama, there needs to be a few things which aren't sign-posted a million miles away (in other words, Julian Fellowes needs to trust the viewers to be able to follow things without showing us every single machination - one of the great strengths about \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" was it's \\"less is more\\" approach to laying out the plots).<br /><br />We've had much of this before (the maid with ideas above her station getting into \\"trouble\\" above stairs, the rich girl training as a nurse, blackmail involving members of the family).  The series even ends with an outbreak of the dreaded Spanish 'Flu epidemic (historically-speaking it's been calculated that the post-war outbreak of the Spanish 'Flu wiped out more people than those who were killed during the whole war).  The fourth series of \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" also dramatically concluded with the Spanish 'Flu epidemic (it wasn't nearly as dramatic as it's depicted in DOWNTON, however, with seemingly every second character in the cast falling ill - the only casualty in \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" was the lovely Hazel Bellamy).<br /><br />The greatest saving grace of DOWNTON ABBEY remains Dame Maggie Smith and her glorious Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham.  In Season 2, Violet takes on a greater role with some meaty and insightful plots.  For each pithy observation (\\"It's like a second-rate boarding house where the guests keep arriving and nobody leaves!\\"), there's a heart-piercing nugget of grandmotherly concern and a voice of calm in the swirling storm.  We all need a Violet in our lives.<br /><br />The rest of the performances remain solid, and while a few characters remain sketchy, it's all still highly enjoyable.  At the centre we have Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern as Downton's twin figureheads (both actors deliver superbly - Bonneville's Robert is a bit more human and fallible in this season); likewise there's something to be admired in how Julian Fellowes has built up Lady Mary from the somewhat vapid, shallow creature from Season One into a woman with great humility and understanding.  Michelle Dockery is outstanding.<br /><br />Sadly some characters have gone backwards, the most disappointing being Isobel.  I can't remember her being half as preachy or martyr-like in the first season.  She manages to grate on everybody's nerves in this season, to the point where Cora and Violet have to invent some scheme involving displaced Belgian war refugees just to get rid of her for a while!  Even Dr Clarkson (David Robb) acts like he cannot stand her!  She was a favourite for me in the first season (mainly because I'm such a fan of Ms Wilton's work), so I hope Fellowes manages to get her back into the Crawley's favour come Season Three.<br /><br />Shirley MacLaine has been touted to join the DOWNTON cast in Season Three, playing Martha Levinson (Cora's American mother) from what I've learned.  I'm hoping for at least a few delicious verbal sparring matches with Smith's Violet.  Whether or not the characters will still have their vitality or snap as the story reaches into the 1920's is yet to be seen, but if it's anything like the first two seasons, I'll be very happy indeed.n (\\"It's like a second-rate boarding house where the guests keep arriving and nobody leaves!\\"), there's a heart-piercing nugget of grandmotherly concern and a voice of calm in the swirling storm.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it because it is different from other games.  You can make families by hatching eggs. There is a nice. selection of prehistoric animals. The daily rewards are great and you can win animals by playing the Scrat  game
B004FOA84A|3.0|Fun game, but would like more helps.  I'm stuck<br />and can't figure it out.  My kids(who do very well<br />on games) have looked at it with me and they can't<br />figure it out either.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|A friend turned me on to this book series.  She told me that I needed to read them all, not just the first one.  After reading the first book, I couldn't stop!  I ended up reading all three books twice!  I enjoyed them even more the second time around!  I can't wait to see what the author comes up with next!  The only thing about the book that seemed redundant is the description of the orgasms. After awhile I started jumping over them because they were all the same.  Other than that, I loved the story!<br /><br />I wasn't a big reader before reading Fifty Shades (the trilogy set), but now I am craving more books just like them!
1469984202|5.0|This is a great series of short books.  I have recommended it to everyone I know on facebook.  At the end of each book/short story, I was wanting more, more, more!  A great series for teenagers as well as adults.  I wish it was on Audible.com so I could play it in the car for my family on the next trip.  Maybe I'll have to read it to them.
1577311523|1.0|This is a horrible book. Bibi Jones claims this book is the reason she retired. I strongly urge females to stay away from this book and stick to better books like 50 Shades. Great job Eckhart, you ruined my summer.

0394818237|4.0|I have one of the 1980's copies of this book, which is 99 or so pages. My copy is falling apart and my daughter loves it. I ordered this new one for her so she could stop destroying my copy. I was fully aware it was abridged when I ordered it. There is no unabridged version available new to my knowledge. My daughter actually noticed that some of the stories were missing. I do not know why some of the stories were left out, because in all honestly, our world has changed so much that many of the stories have an old timey, but not necessarily outdated feel to them. I would not know how to pick what to take out; all the stories are wonderful. I love that this book, and Scarry, have such a timeless appeal. I took off one star for the simple fact that the editors took away about 25 pages from the original and they should not have.

B002MW50KO|1.0|Usually, in a studio, you pretty much have unlimited takes to get it right.  Knowing that, this was the best they could do?  How far into the first session do you have to get before someone with a modicum of decency stands up and says \\"you know, maybe this wasn't such a good idea\\".  A recording this bad and charging money for it is a new low even for the music industry.  The reviewers to date have made some really great comparisons, I'll chime in and say that I've heard better vocals from the cancer kazoo cowboy singing the Tobacco Song.<br /><br />I hope Amazon keeps the snippets from this CD on here forever.  No one believes me when I tell them about this CD and how really really really bad it truly is.  At least I will always be able to direct them here.  To Mr. Dylan, take what is left of your credibility and whatever you made on this train wreck of a project and buy up any remaining copies of this CD and roast them on an open fire.  Then please quit singing.

034580404X|2.0|For the life of me, I can't understand why these books garnered so much attention. They are dry, dull, and boring. They're also very predictable, repetitive, and unrealistic (who comes with their partner at the same time every time they have sex?!). The books been dubbed \\"mommy porn\\" and women flocked to them ooh-ing and ahh-ing, but the sex isn't as kinky or hot as people have been describing it. I think anyone who thinks the sex in these books is hot must have a very boring sex life.  If you want to get yourself off, I suggest going with tried and true erotica novels, not this garbage.

B007Y30OQ6|1.0|For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \\"fanboy\\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.<br /><br />Physical Characteristics The iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.<br /><br />New and \\"Improved\\" Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.<br /><br />The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \\"new\\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.<br /><br />The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />Smart Covers aren't really \\"smart\\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.<br /><br />Multitasking Support One of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers
B006OCM0G0|3.0|cant really play it properly without buying gems. not truly a &quot;free&quot; game. lets u obtain equipment then u cant use it without gems which you pretty much have to buy :(
B0053O89IS|3.0|Season 7 was good, as all Bones seasons are, but due to Emily Deschanel's pregnancy the season was far shorter than average. Unfortunately the greedy producers haven't changed the price of the season to reflect the reduced content you are purchasing. While I love Bones and will probably buy this anyway I am very disappointed that I will be paying the full price for half a season's worth of content.
B0086700CM|5.0|I didn't think I would like this game, but I was wrong. This game is so addicting. I love it.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game is great!<br /><br />It has top-notch graphics. They are a little bit cartoony however they're very well done and can be enjoyed by anyone from age 6 to 600.<br /><br />The in game music and sound effects are also very well done. They're not the type of music that you would listen to for recreation, however they fit the game quite well. This is not a game that you need to mute.<br /><br />The level designs are very well-crafted. This is no straightforward platformer where you just run across totally linear stages crushing everything in your path. These levels are designed to provide a good degree of challenge. Jumping and getting from place to place is often more difficult than facing off against the enemies.<br /><br />Each level provides the extended challenge of trying to find three golden paperclips. If you attempt to do this in each level, you will find that exploration is a huge part of this game. Sometimes the paperclips are very easy to find, but most of the time they require you to break off from the path entirely and searching area that you would not normally enter. This really, really, really adds to the overall gameplay value.<br /><br /> The one minor sticking point with this game is that the default control is a little bit difficult to work.<br /><br />The floating joystick will appear underneath your thumb. Wherever you first touch is where the joystick remains so if your thumb drifts off center it can require some unusually large movements to get back to the center. This makes it very difficult to change directions, especially when jumping.<br /><br /> There is an alternate control. It emulates the classic directional pad. It is static and will not move out of position. In my opinion this control works much better, however, on a tablet or a larger device the pad itself is too far away from the corner to be used without really having to stretch your thumb.

B00701L5XS|5.0|I would have been happy to pay a buck or two for this app.  It takes a lot of the mystery  out of some very well known knotting  techniques.  Great demonstrated  examples that can be played over and over as you practice.

B00863DOL0|5.0|I could understand why people who were at the concert would prefer a complete live show. As I live in an isolated city in the far reaches of the world, to me this DVD is well represented with more new songs from their last two albums. It compliments the last two DVDs like \\"Castles and Dreams\\" and \\"Paris Moon\\" and made an extended updates on the live collections. I am happy.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I haven't been able to put this game down since I downloaded it.  it ha(s so many different courses to choose from you never get bored.  good challenging game free and totally addictive.  I definitely recommend it
B005C0DHEY|1.0|\\"Gasland\\" Was full of misinformation, half truths, central issue was not fully covered,and too sensationalizing; Film maker seemed just to want to make a controversial film without doing \\"his homework\\" on the subject. One needs to watch \\"Truthland\\"  for a more balance overview of this topic.  Pros and cons are revealed in a non- sensationalized presentation. As with any endeavor, it is the operator,manager,company,and/or president following guidelines and regulations  or not following rules and regulations which can lead into unsatisfactory results.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Jack Reacher is a great character. This is my second book. I was hooked from the first one. It had me on the edge of my seat for the first two I'm sure the next several will do the same. I'm reading them in order but I don't really think you have to do that as I saw nothing in the second book that pertained to the first book.
B00701L5XS|5.0|This is an excellent app. The animation and rotation capabilities make out easy to follow the techniques and the knot usage explanations are informative. A+
1594203334|5.0|Great book - i'm highlighting and taking notes! I have a baby on the way and am looking forward to following guidelines around sleeping and eating so that our family keeps a normal routine or rhythm. I hear about so many American parents who are at their wit's end because their baby won't sleep normal hours or won't eat healthy foods. It affects not only the baby, but also the parents and their marriage. We will try our hardest to stick to these to save our sanity and really enjoy parenting and family time. Highly recommend this book!

B005LAIGF0|1.0|I bought this BLU RAY movie because of the glowing and universally positive reviews of the EXTENDED CUT.  Of course, the EXTENDED CUT is not on BLU RAY is it?  No, it is surprisingly on an additional STANDARD DVD while the theatrical version is on the superior BLU RAY.  Thanks Amazon, thanks a lot.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What an emotional story! Cancer can be a tricky thing to write about but Green did a great job. I cried, but I also found levity in parts. I would say the best YA novel of the year.
0385528752|5.0|There is no shortage of literature on the topic of personal change. Most books on the subject are not worth reading, while others are reading but not essential. Only a few fits into the category of \\"must read\\" and Switch is one of them.<br /><br />There are a few things that impressed me about the brothers Heath's work:<br /><br />1. The content is well researched and recommendations are based on science (as opposed to hyberpolic self-help nonsense that seems to be the norm in self-help books.) After reading Switch the first time (I have read it twice and plan on a third helping real soon) I tracked down most of the research studies cited in their book, and read many of the suggested books. All top class! This really helped me to see the Swith as \\"credible\\" and caused me to pay close attention to the concepts and ideas.<br /><br />2. Their style of writing is masterful. The way stories and analogies are sprinkled throughout the book makes for entertaining and light reading, while effectively explaining and highlighting salient points. Switch also offers a refreshing approach to repetition of the same concepts. Repetition and recap is key in successful learning, but can become boring and may at times feel condescending if not done correctly. Dan and Chip Heath executed masterfully in this department by putting a great deal of effort into their style of \\"recap and repeat.\\" When you get to the end of the book you really \\"get it\\" while still remaining captivated.<br /><br />3. Simplicity was considered by Einstein as the ultimate accomplishment, and Switch again delivers. Given the wealth of research that went into writing this masterpiece, it must have been an ungodly task to keep things simple enough so that readers could apply the concepts. Many similar books fall down in this department as the ideas are too diverse and numerous. As so eloquently stated in \\"Paradox of Choice\\" less is often more when it comes to these matters. Their selection of tools surely meets the80/20 rule multiplied and I believe only the best ideas cut the grade to be included.<br /><br />Buy this book. Read it. Apply it. Read it again. And apply some more. And then read it again. You get the idea...<br /><br />It will change your life.

B008EDGBW6|3.0|I was willing to give Chris another try.  Although I do like a couple of the slow jams, and Turn The Music Up, the rest of it is not enjoyable to me, I have been listening to it for over a week now in an attempt to have the other songs grow on me but it's just not working.
0062073486|4.0|This book was spellbinding;  a good Agatha Christie for those familiar with her writing and a wonderful addition to the newly christened Agatha Christie fan.  There was no way of knowing who dun it;  The details were carefully written, and the clues carefully laid out.  Since it was first published in 1939, and then 1940, under the name Ten Little Indians, I'm not sure how many readers this book has seen.  It is the old title that the new title will remember.  Agatha Christie is also easy to read, with one chapter flowing easily into the next, making it just as hard to put down because of the plot as with the written story.  The ending is surprising, but rereading could identify the suspects better, maybe.  There are some grousome details, but Agatha Christie writes neatly and to the point;  no scary, put on the night light, look under the bed stuff - unless, ofcourse, you don't like a murder tale.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|rates up there with born to run.  great story, excellent tips about running and diet, buy it and another for your friend that doesn't run.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh, I hate to compare your work to your arch nemesis Orson Scott Card, but I will anyway. Both stories offer a total fictional immersion for the reader--to me that's something rare. Well written, gripping plot, awesome character development--I've not had that much fun reading a series for a long time (since reading the Ender series). In many ways I like your writing better than Card's. And what I enjoy the most; you did this without a Big Six publisher--your own way. Thank-you, you've earned a fan for life.
030758836X|2.0|After the first 2 books which were barely OK, I swore off this author.  And I do like psychological fiction, but not her style at all.  This it the last I'll read I promise.  They are far too slow and far too sick.  It's about 2 and a few more people who are victims of how they were raised which is fine.  But it drags on and on and on forever and ends - well it ends strangely like the book itself.  I realize the book is quite popular, but definitely not my style.  Apparently at this point a lot of other people dislike this writing as well.  How it can be a best book is beyond me.  So much for what our society is into right now.  Too Sick for me.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like the game but it would be better if you could use in-game money instead of real money other than that it is a great game.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Challenging but easy to learn. Free games rarely are any good, but this one is an exception. Definately worth a look.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I liked this book it kept my interest. I would not want this to be my duaghter. Travis was a nut. My 15 year old picked it up and read ahead of me. I took it away because I did not like the fact that this guy beat up someone for looking at her and their were no consequences for his actions.
B00845PV16|4.0|Bought the movie for my son! who loved it! I enjoyed the movie also. Not usually something I would pick to watch but found it entertaining.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|the first and only bible app that i have tried and it is great. it offers so many different translations and lots of reading plans and devotionals. only thing it does not have is a concordance or topical search.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|excellent work! i appreciate being able to access several translations of the Bible  on my phone, my Kindle, and my kids phones. I can share notes with my friends, take notes in service and record notes on the road! I've come to appreciate versions I've never used before because they are so easily accessed. wonderful!
B00701L5XS|5.0|If you are a camper, hunter or climber this is a great app for you. Even if you are just tying down a tarp or working in the yard many of the knot techniques would be ideal for your needs. Each knot is clearly shown in 3D motion graphics on how to tie the knot. It also defines when to use this knot and its benefits. It even tells you the strength of the knot and how it might fail.<br /><br />The app lets you rotate the knot in multiple directions, enlarge the knot for easier viewing and even pause the motion to allow you closely examine the knot's shape and the path of the two ends of the rope or twine.<br /><br />This app has different sections for classifications of knots and would be good for:<br />* Campers<br />* Boaters<br />* Climbing<br />* Fire and rescue<br />* First aid<br />* Fishing<br />* Scouting<br />* A handy person who always needed to secure items with a rope.<br /><br />The app is rather large at 32.73 MB in size but this is due to the high definition graphs and the way it actually shows you how to tie the knots. I like this app and I recommend it to you as a training guide!
0143123173|4.0|I discovered this series after watching A&E's version of the books. I picked up the Kindle edition and finished it in short order, and I look forward to the rest of the series.<br /><br />The books are well-constructed, the plotting is excellent, and the character interaction is first-rate. The characters are also well developed and he does a good job or describing everything. My problems with the novel are relatively minor, but I am going to mention them.<br /><br />The first TV episode had some fact inaccuracies and I read the book paying particular attention to the details. I was surprised when I found that the origin of the episode's inaccuracies originated with the author. He apparently uses the Internet to insert details as he obviously knows NOTHING about firearms or American history. Johnson needs to have someone knowledgeable in both areas to fact-check his books prior to being published.<br /><br />I always start at the beginning, so this was the first book I read, and I plan to read the rest of them. It was a flawed gem, but well worth the purchase.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|Great movie.  Gru and the other characters are well established and the plot is easy to follow for kids and there are enough little jokes for adults to be entertained as well.  One of the best we have seen in awhile.
B002ZE85YW|3.0|Regardless of whether you get the Director's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version of Terminator Salvation, you're in for an average movie viewing experience at best. I was certainly entertained. I love the Terminator movies...especially T1 and T2. I know a lot folks hated T3; I for one did not hate T3. T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2, but it wasn't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound. No, I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average...in their own unique ways.<br /><br />And I'll tell ya, it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie? Have you heard that? Oh my God, what a chump. Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale. And you've got to give props to Anton Yelchin as a young Kyle Reese too; Yelchin almost made me think he was really a young Michael Biehn (the guy who played Reese in the original [[ASIN:B000F9RB9Y Terminator]].<br /><br />But the story in Salvation didn't come close to living up to what Terminator or [[ASIN:B001RIY4WE Terminator 2:]] delivered. Salvation's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations, and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations. How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series? Maybe he didn't teeny-bop Salvation, but it was very weeknight CW networked up.<br /><br />Bottom line: Terminator Salvation is a rental

It seems like a good idea and a useful tool, but it force closes on my phone (samsung admire)<br /><br />*Update* as of 1/13/15<br /><br />This app now works completely and has for probably the past year or so. Works completely on Samsung Galaxy s5 and LG Motion. A very useful go to reference for tying/learning a variety of common and useful knots (hitches, loops, stoppers, etc.) That is fully functional. Allows you to stop the animation of the knot tying, rotate from different angles, speed up and slow down the animation, and it provides some interesting and useful basic information/history about each knot.
0547569653|5.0|This is a fun book, both for the good writing and storytelling, as well as the nutritional side. It makes healthy eating seem not boring at all, a feat unto itself for me. Also it is a fine follow up to those looking for more after Chris McDougall's epic Born To Run. Some books I don't finish or take a long time to read because they are not that great (or difficult to read). But with some books I take my time because I enjoy them so much and don't want them to end. This was one of those books that I took forever to read, with many breaks involving shopping and following the recipes in between runs. This book has changed my perspective on both eating and running and was a pleasure to read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|A lot of fun to play and easy enough to get all the animals without having to pay extra money.  Love this game.
0765309408|5.0|Only twice in my 67 years have a read a book in less than 24 hours.  One was Lord of the Flies, when I was in college, and the other was Scalzi's Old Man's War, much more recently.<br /><br />I read slowly.  Not because I have to due to some limitation, but because I really like to appreciate word usage and writing style.  But somehow this just kept pulling me forward, until the end.  I know, some people really don't like it.  But I did.<br /><br />Take the recommendation of someone who has been reading science fiction for over half a century, and read it.
B005AUWY2W|5.0|Love love love this movie as much as my 2 boys and girl.  A spectacular, energetic, and beautifully done movie fun for the young and old alike.

B000OMGUIA|5.0|Having seen the original B&W movie I was interested in reading the book. It's a very entertaining easy read. The book isn't so large that it tires one out to hold it up. Great bedside book and I'll keep it in my library to read again.

B003SI7OQ4|4.0|This was a great family movie with catchy songs, downside is getting kids to stop singing,dont go breaking my heart.
B006M4F67A|2.0|There is no way to change background floors. The tile designs blend into thebackground making for no contrast. This slows your play
044042321X|1.0|The art is terrible. Everybody looks way too pretty. Even the characters who aren't supposed to be pretty are in this adaptation. Also, everybody looks way to stiff and key scenes are done wrong. For example: In the original book, Drogo never even got off his horse when he first \\"met\\" Dani. He just looked at her for a second and rode off. As you can see in the preview of the comic pages it's completely different.<br /><br />You're much better off just reading the novel or watching the show than bothering with this.
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|Excited for this new release....heard RM sing live with Olivia Newton- John in the past and it was amazing.  Only wish their cover of \\"Right Here Waiting for You\\" with ON-J doing harmonies where part of this release. Youtube the 2011 11 15 duet.  [...]
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a great app, it keeps me entertained for hours. The advertisements though are not some thing I really enjoy, I understand that they NEED the advertisements except they are quite annoying. Otherwise great app.
B00701L5XS|1.0|This app is full of spyware. I was excited there was something better than what FAOTD has been offering lately and I'm again disappointed
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|I enjoyed Train back when they became big, including enjoying seeing them in concert back when the all-time great \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" was a big hit.  Their return in 2009 \\"Save Me, San Francisco\\" was a great summer album for me and my family, and I truly enjoyed most of the songs.  This latest album also gets plenty of airplay in my house and car with the family, but some of the song styles are not quite for me.<br /><br />The first single \\"Drive By\\" is a good example.  A very catchy tune, but with a borderline dance beat to it.  Later on the album, \\"Mermaid\\" and the title track revisit that style.  Not bad, but for sure not at all the rock vibe I would expect from these guys on uptempo songs by them.<br /><br />Other songs on the album are much better.  Take the opening track \\"This'll Be My Year\\".  As others have mentioned, it does that chronology thing much like Billy Joel's \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\" from a good 23 years back.  However, it is a truly fun, catchy, \\"summertime driving\\" kind of track.  \\"Feels Good At First\\" is classic-sounding Train.  I also rather like the country-ish duet sound of \\"Bruises\\".  \\"We Were Made For This\\" is also a very strong pop/rock offering towards the end of the album.  \\"50 Ways To Say Goodbye\\" is another different sound but pretty unique--I've actually gotten to like that one quite a bit.  \\"When The Fog Rolls In\\" is a melancholy but fine ending track--very heartfelt and emotional.<br /><br />All in all, very fun to listen to and pretty good to very good songs.  Not a 5-star effort like \\"Save Me, San Francisco\\" (or \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" back in the day), but a solid 4 stars.
0307474259|5.0|He makes some good points, I don't know how much of it is accurate but it's an easy and interesting read.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This might be the most pointless music review I've ever written--being the 345th person on Amazon to review a huge rock album by a huge band some 15 months after it has come out.  That being said, I just have to put in my two cents regarding this latest Foo Fighters album.<br /><br />In a word, this album is brilliant.  The songs are catchier than ever--if that's possible.  \\"Bridges Burning\\" and \\"Rope\\" get the album off to a rip-roaring start.  \\"Limo\\" is a thrashing song--maybe the heaviest thing they've ever done and a surprise to me.  Then there are songs like \\"These Days\\" in the center of the album and \\"Walk\\" as the closing track--classic Foo melodies with heartfelt, life-affecting messsages.  As usual with the Foos, there are a wide variety of tempos and volumes to the songs on the album.  I could rave about every song on the album.  Today's rock music quite simply doesn't get much better than this.  If you download, buy every song to get the full Foo album experience.<br /><br />Of all the rock albums released in the 2010's to date, this one is at the top of my list of must-haves for rock music fans of various ages.  At my age (over 40), I buy a lot of \\"retro\\" stuff that not all younger folks may be into.  This album, however, is one I recommend for teenagers up to 50-somethings.  A widely appealing album--proof that good rock music is still being made and proof that at least a few big current artists actually do care about full albums as opposed to just a strong single or two.  This entire album is highly recommended.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really cool. It works great on the kindle fire I got it about 2 weeks ago and have never had a problem with it.

0547133510|4.0|Winnie the Pooh and friends have been perfectly fine as characters in the kids' early picture books. Calm, cheerful, mildly message driven, and with just the right touch of silliness and adventure. But, they can only carry you so far.<br /><br />  Enter Paddington. A very similar vibe, but more advanced character, story, vocabulary and concept. And how many early reader/read-to/read-with books can you call charming and droll? And never dopey, (and I mean you, Amelia Bedelia), or cranky or precociously rude.<br /><br />  Now sometimes we want silliness or adventure or broad jokes or fantasy, but for some of the quieter times, this really does have an honored place.

B0079XPUOW|4.0|A great, fast summer read is something I wanted to punctuate the pauses between Caro's 4 volume LBJ tome. Redshirts gave it to me and while I was a bit disappointed when I got to the end of the mission, the three codas gave took a twist that made the novel thoughtful and moving in a way that I didn't think was possible.  If you like sci-fi and have watched sci-fi TV, there will be plenty of funny moments that will make you laugh out loud but unlike most satires or parodies, you will also be faced with existential questions about the meaning of life that may bring tears to your eyes.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|I worried about this stylus when I first saw it. I have tiny hands, like almost child-size.  But once I started to use it, I fell in love with it. All the other stylus' that I've bought, lasted only a few months...I'm a heavy angry birds player....and the slippery, skinny aluminium ones were always flying out of my hand...scaring the s...t out of the dog. This is fab to hold, doesn't slip and the point, even though it looks hefty, can do the same job as a tiny tipped stylus. The bonus is I never misplace it. It's so large, that there it is at all times. Just wish it came in different colors. I highly recommend this. Oh, I use it on my iPad and even do some wonderful sketching with it, when I'm not killing off birds, monkeys and pigs....

B000I9UA8U|5.0|This is a delightful movie. It is funny and moving at the same time. If you enjoy comedy with a touch of pathos, this is your movie. The performances are spot-on, especially that of Robert Carlyle, the leader of the pack. The movie moves to a joyous conclusion, and the storyline sustains well throughout. I highly recommend it.
0060734191|5.0|This trilogy is easily one of my favorites. The world the stories are set in feels normal to a fantasy setting with common themes like undead and magic, yet it also has a twist on the elements that I never heard of before reading this trilogy. Now I will attempt to do a brief review of each before going back to the trilogy as a whole.<br />Sabriel may be my favorite of the three; this is probably because I feel it can standalone. At times, the story can feel a bit slow, but for the most part, it is a page-turner. The story keeps you interested until the last page. The story has a good bit of action, but there are also many secrets of what is going on in the Old Kingdom, which is the bigger fuel of the story.<br />Lirael is probably my least favorite, but it is too important to skip. It starts the slowest of the books. This one also feels a bit darker with more intense emotions, especially at the start. It spends a lot of time building up the new characters and beginning their roles in the plot. By the end of the book, it started to get very interesting. But then, it ended to be concluded in the next one. In this story, the action was lesser but there was still the mystery/secret element from the first, but more present in the new characters than in the world.<br />Abhorsen provides an epic ending to the trilogy. The book starts with a huge shock, so surprising I wanted to skip ahead just to see if it were true. The story starts quick, but can also feel a bit slow as well. There is a lot of pressure from the start as it picks up where Lirael left off, but it doesn't jump right into the action. As the story gets to the middle, it is already preparing for the climax. In contrast to the other books, more so Sabriel, the climax in this one feels very long. The ending does a great job of delivering on the needed action and answers.<br />The trilogy does have a few fight scenes, but they aren't the most common occurrences. I found that the plot itself proved to be far moreinteresting than the battles in the story. By the end of the trilogy, you get to see most of death. Still, I wish it were used more in the trilogy, since it is a very well designed story element. I guess it is better to use it scarcely to keep it exciting than over use it though.<br />I only noticed a few problems in three books, but they were minor and could easily be ignored. The first is that sometimes the viewpoints shifted without a clear indication, which was a slight annoyance at times. The second is that some sentences feel a bit too long winded occasionally, but it wasn't often enough to cause any big problems. The final thing is the lack of epilogs. All of the books ended rather quickly with little detail of what happened next. Although there are stories that come after each book (The Creature in the Case from the Across the Wall comes after Abhorsen) that help wrap up the previous, and from what I heard more books are planned.<br /><br />In short, this is a great trilogy. The slow trickle of information about the world and/or characters does a good job at driving the readers and the occasional twists are all very notable. While the series may not have a lot of action by physical combat, its plot is strong and intense enough to keep you reading. I'd suggest it to anyone who likes fantasy books.

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|My husband was thrilled with the Star Trek movie set he received for Father's Day.  Came as promised in great condition!
1596912855|1.0|I had hopes for this- truly I did.<br />By the cover and the cryptic jacket blurb I thought this was a paperback Lost in Austen. Hopefully better, because I couldn't stand that series and still can't believe BBC produced it.<br />So. Girl is obsessed with Colin Firth in his Darcy persona. Old benefactor lady discovers this and (because she is rich and apparently totally understands such obsessions) buys her a three week treat in Austenland- an English 'pretend' resort (disguised as an old manor house) where everyone speaks and acts as if they were back in Regency Era. By everyone, I mean rich Americans who lo-oved P&P and can afford the price of the place.<br />The girl feels lonely and dejected amongst all the actors\holiday makers\rich regulars - and because she is a wannabe-Elizabeth, she, of course, hates the resident Darcy (in all his moody, cold and in-spurts-emotional glory) from the instant she sees him.<br />Oh no, wait. In that first instant she drools, then gets on with the hating.<br />Her Wickham is a gardener who is her only connection to the real world (because he watches american football and is oppressed by the Austenland organiser lady and compulsively ignored by all the house mates).<br />So finally, after a lot of unimaginative angst, you may ask me: does the girl get a happy ending or does she fly off- independent and free of her Darcy obsession?<br />Well- I answer- she realises that her Wickham is really a plot point made up by the Organiser-dragon-lady, because not all the 'guests' there want to romance english gentlemen who are Darcy's facsimiles.<br />She also realises that Darcy is a regular english guy- divorced, an actor, and a hurt man who desperately wants to escape reality.<br />And, she finally realises that the guy in the seat beside her, on her flight back home, is her true love- the sad eyed, confused Darcy-pretender.<br /><br />Then she screams and jumps off the plane.<br /><br />Okay, not really. But that, I think would have been a better ending.
B005HSL626|4.0|The game was pretty fun and interesting ( who couldnt love chopping random fruit in mid air with cool swords) but after a while you might get bored.

B00866H7SS|3.0|~~3.5 stars~~<br /><br />Now we've all heard the comparisons to Fifty Shades and let's start off by clearing that up.<br />By the middle of this book I'd decided that Ms Day had definitely read Fifty and thought something like the following to herself -<br />\\"Well, that was disappointing. It's a workable premise, there's good material here, but the writing's mediocre, the characters have been left undeveloped and the dialogues are uninspiring. I could do something with this and I could do it better.\\"<br /><br />This isn't a rip off. The story isn't exactly the same no matter what the other reviewers tell you. The tropes are the same though. College graduate gets a job in a new city, billionaire notices her and insta-lust happens. There are only so many ways you can write this story.<br /><br />Also they are both survivors of abuse.<br /><br />I liked that here. That both of them have a dark past. That's what the story is basically centred on (though their marathon sex comes a close second) - two abuse survivors struggling to trust and understand each other. All their misunderstandings, arguments and heart breaks happen because they both have issues and the other is still learning what triggers not to press.<br /><br />This first book seems primarily about Eva's issues. Though it was clear that Gideon has some big things too, I think the author's keeping his problems tamped down a little because they are the major hurdle she'll start getting them across in the next book.<br />In this one, despite Eva thinking they were dealing with both their problems and hang-ups, we were most seeing Eva's reactions and Eva's hurts. Possibly because she's the less scarred of the two and she's already had help from psychiatrists and dealt with her problems. She's (as has been repeated said) very self aware. She knows that when she's hurt she runs away and that it's the wrong reaction. She also knows what can hurt her and bluntly makes them clear to Gideon. Gideon on the other hand ismore closed off, having never tried to figure out his past and how it affects him. He makes a lot of concessions for Eva, but it'll take him longer to deal. (Hence the sequels).<br /><br />They are very honest with each other and I like that, but it usually takes Eva time to calm down and talk. Her first response is flight. I like that both of them recognized quickly that what they have between them is powerful and nothing like their past relationships, but it seemed as if while Eva was the one who took them forward by making them face their demons, Gideon was the one keeping them together. No matter how hurt Gideon wasn't willing to let her go, while Eva kept thinking they wouldn't last and acted accordingly.<br /><br />But Eva isn't a Mary Sue (as she's been accused of being). She doesn't fit the profile. She knows she's attractive and she's confident in her sexuality. Men aren't falling for her all over the place and most refreshing of all, she makes mistakes and knows when she made them.<br /><br />Gideon's messed up but we don't know why. This book doesn't tell us, though we get an idea. At first I was surprised by how much he was willing to bend for Eva after just days of meeting her when he'd held to certain rules most of his adult life. But then I've never felt dizzying lust or an incredible connection with a stranger. Maybe something like that makes you willing to take a risk. For Gideon it's a pretty damned big risk.<br /><br />Gideon is also controlling and refuses to understand why Eva needs him to respect certain boundaries. I'm guessing this is also something Ms Day will explore in book two. Some of his actions would have annoyed the hell out of me but Eva surprises me by being understanding. She gets why he needs to control everything he can and why he digs for information behind her back that he should just ask her for.<br /><br />Anyway below's a quote that shows why I like Eva so much. She's got backbone and she's not a wide-eyed or easily intimidated. There's a female friend who loves Gideon and was once his girlfriend. Eva tell him straight that her nature's too possessive and jealous to allow him to have close relations with another woman, especially someone who still has feelings for him. To which Gideon says --<br /><br />\\"She's a friend, Eva, and she's in a rough spot. It's a cruel time to cut her off.\\"<br /><br />\\"Think carefully, Gideon. I have exes in my past, too. You're setting the precedent now for how I'll handle them. I'm taking my cues from you.\\"<br /><br />He stood with a scowl. \\"You're threatening me.\\"<br /><br />\\"I prefer to see it as coercion. Relationships work both ways. You're not her only friend. She can find someone more appropriate to lean on in her time of crisis.\\"<br /><br />And I could have stood up and applauded. There have been so many romance stories where the heroine just kept her mouth shut because the hero was doing the gentlemanly thing by being a friend to the other woman. It was the source of a whole bagful of misunderstandings.<br /><br />I'm sure the woman's still going to be a source of problem because it isn't that easy to cut out a friend from your life, but at least Eva made her position clear. Gideon can't steam roll over her or pooh pooh her concerns. She won't let him.<br /><br />This book veered very close to becoming an erotica novel instead of romance, but maybe it was written for that market, I don't know. Sex was certainly plentiful here, but then sex is part of their baggage and it's also what makes them feel safe with each other, so maybe I shouldn't criticize.<br /><br />One last thing. There was a dearth of female characters here. I'm not talking about the women vying for Gideon's interest, but women who could be Eva's friends. I hope that is remedied in the next book, which I will definitely read.
B007SGM084|5.0|I think these books are awesome. It does have a lot of sex in the book. But when your reading it you will fly through the book and get lost in their world. I was told it was a soft porn book. I would have to say it is more detailed than soft porn, but the romance and love in the book, is perfectly put together.

0894803123|5.0|I make all of our ice cream and use this book almost every time.  I was surprised to find that all of the classic Ben and Jerry flavors are listed in here and enjoy leafing through the book and trying new ones all the time.  It has good advice and easy instructions on how to make all their flavors.  Personally, I find it just as easy as buying it from the store and a lot cheaper.  One suggestion to them would be to add a low fat option to their Sweet Cream Base and also instructions on those who don't want to use raw eggs.  I am currently pregnant and cannot have raw eggs.  This is an easy fix, you just have to heat the cream, sugar, and eggs to 160 degrees and then cool completely in a bowl of ice or in the freezer before adding your other ingredients and putting it in your ice cream maker.  Overall it's a fantastic book though.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|[[ASIN:B003JTHXOK Safe Haven]] is only the second of Nicholas Sparks books that I have read. I'm more of his movie watcher than his book reader. A lot of them I didn't even realize that they were his books.<br /><br />When Hollywood puts out movies based on books I instantly want to read that book before the movie comes out. Hollywood rarely does a book justice and they claim it's because things that happen in a book don't translate well on the screen. I think it's just lazy on Hollywood's part. If my brain can imagine it then it can be translated into film.<br /><br />I'm back from my Hollywood rant. I discovered Safe Haven was being made into a movie from the On Air with Ryan Seacrest. Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel are starring in the movie adaptation. I researched the movie people were critical of the casting.<br /><br />After reading it, most of the comments on imdb were overly critical if not downright comical. Having only [[ASIN:B0018QQQK8 read]] and [[ASIN:B005S9EK1S watched]] The Lucky One, Safe Haven reads in the same general tone. I knew something was off with Jo but I never saw that twist coming, which is the role Cobie Smulders is playing and the tipping point that made me want to read it.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks definitely captured the North Carolina state of mind, in one quote. I read it to my mother, a North Carolina native, and it even made her laugh. It has the same general flow as The Lucky One. It's an easy uncomplicated if not overly simplified read.<br /><br />Based on the movies and the two books, I do think Sparks has a formula that works for him. I knew what to expect and got what I expected. You quickly know who's good and who's bad. I would just one like to see what would happen if the story didn't always have a happy ending; the choose your own adventure version (You really don't see them anymore).

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I first started reading this book, but I knew it sounded interesting. At first it was a bit creepy, but that feeling lessened as I got to know the children more through reading the book. It was really good, in my opinion, and the stories and letters only enhanced that. Some have said that reading the letters is impossible though kindle, but I have the kindle app on my iPad and I simply enlarged the images and they went to their own page until I was done reading, and I x'd out of it and kept on with the book. I hope there is a continuation of this story; I would love to find out what happens next and see what Jacob ultimately decides after the adventure at the end of the book. Very interestingly too is that all of the pictures are authentic. I gave it four stars out of five only because this book could have been edited better. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to grammar and spelling, punctuation, etc. and I noticed a couple areas that had been missed during editing. Other that that, I would definitely recommend this book.

Highly recommended.

1936608898|5.0|When most folks think of nutrition, they think of supplements, powders, meal replacements, etc. Not so much fun for anyone like myself who loves to cook, eat out, and enjoy my food.<br /><br />That's why as someone who works in the specialty food industry but also as someone who cares about my health, I recommend this book to those looking to reconcile good eating and good health. Turns out, they're not mutually exclusive.<br /><br />The Hartwigs' conversant style makes it easier to grasp nutritional concepts and to translate that into a working model for everyday eating. There are no gimmicks here. Just a foundation of good, honest food with integrity that will feed your body and your soul.<br /><br />Though the Whole30 itself is about an elimination process to deduce how your body reacts to certain foods, the overall Whole9 lifestyle is great for food lovers. It emphasizes quality pasture-raised meats, fats like clarified butter, coconut, animal fats, etc., and seasonal produce. It's an approachable book about food, which for Dallas and Melissa is a book about health.

B00555X8OA|5.0|Nobel winner Kahneman gives us a model of the thinking and judging mind.<br />System 1, the fast thinker in us, provides fast decisions, instinctive ones. It jumps to conclusions.<br />System 2, the slow thinker, is in charge of 'thinking'. It must supervise the other.<br />System 1 is gullible and biased towards believing. System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but it is sometimes busy and often lazy.<br /><br />Here some nuggets from the gold mine of Kahneman's experiments and comments:<br /><br />'Familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.' (Hence the value of repetition if you want to fool someone.)<br /><br />'Knowing little makes it easier to fit everything you know into a coherent pattern.' (Which is why dictators and demagogues hate intellectuals.)<br /><br />'A single cockroach will destroy the appeal of a bowl of cherries, but a single cherry will do nothing for a bowl of cockroaches.' (yummy)<br /><br />Kahneman admits that his two systems are not a scientific anatomy of the mind. He knows that he gives us fictitious characters with ugly names. There's no location in the brain for the 2 systems. They are fiction like Freud's threesome, but useful, like Freud's.<br /> The model works for us because we grow up with a psychology of causality, of agents. Things that happen must have been done by somebody. Our intuition has  not learned to use statistics. We look for explanations where there is nothing to explain.<br /><br />This book is devastating to a certain school of thought which insists that everything happens with 'a reason'. Our instincts want to make sense, and we produce too much sense, more than the world has to offer. We want to ignore luck and coincidence.<br />The book is equally devastating to a culture of business success stories, the hindsight insights, which pretends that success can be understood, described and taught. It undermines the 'Search of Excellence' or 'Built to Last' illusions, the need to run for the Iacocca or Jobs or Welch or Google hindsights.<br />It should do away with the case study mania of business schools.<br />It should do away with assessment centers which think they can predict a candidate's future development from brief observations in an artificial environment.<br />It is devastating to any illusion that anything can be reliably forecasted. However, we need to be clear that the book is not proving the impossibility to forecast messy environments. It takes that as a premise and looks at the hack jobs that people do who try it anyway.

0894803123|5.0|Many delicious ice cream recipes in this book, along with other recipes for desserts, drinks, and more. Really helps to understand the basics of making homemade ice cream. Most recipes will make \\"a generous 1 quart\\" which ends up being approx. 1 1/2 quarts. Prompt shipment and great product!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Was a great read and would recommend to others. Never been into this genre of books, but have enjoyed the romance between Christian and Anastasia all the way through not only the first but through Darker and Freed as well.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book borders on pornographic.  I had no idea it would be so descriptive. I only read a few chapters before erasing it from my iPad and iCloud! Waste of $10.00!
0670080926|1.0|This NOVEL is a DRAMATISATION of a murder that happened in the late 1930s when the Japanese had invaded China, and the Chinese left and right wing factions were fighting each other for control.<br /><br />The problem is, there are so many errors in this account that everything French writes can be discredited. His sources are limited and mostly unverifiable or unrecorded, and the rest is invented. Many references do not exist.<br /><br />If you read Werner's file, you will find that Werner says EVERYONE, but everyone, except himself, was inept....that only HE (Werner) found the \\"truth\\"...which he bought:Werner gave money to people for info. Go figure. That isn't proof, and it isn't going to hold up in any court, now or then.<br /><br />So, apart from all that...it's description is thin, and poorly executed, with the only impression being that January is cold in Peking. We hear over and over again about the same few past times. There is no sense of menace here at all, chiefly as the author is incapable of bringing it to life, speaking of which, he is exhuming Pamela's corpse simply for a buck.<br />Paul French has created a fiction; knowingly.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read \\"Wild Swans\\".<br />If you want crime fiction, and god knows why anyone would, then read \\"In Cold Blood\\".- it would rather ruin the feeble conspiracy theory he tried to construct. Anything to sell a book.<br /><br />The author/novelist takes the notes of Werner, who hated my grandfather, and passes them off as gospel truth.<br />I expect more from a \\"historian\\".<br />Paul French can libel the dead with cheap slurs, but I know, for a fact, that he is a lazy inaccurate hack who is profiting from the violent death of a girl.<br />Don't buy the piety; Paul french doesnt want \\"justice\\", he wants a fast buck.
0553801473|3.0|If you've enjoyed the first four books you'll likely enjoy this one. I agree with some folks that there seemed to be a lot of stuff simply not happening. I really didn't like the way things ended up with Jon. I think it took far too long to develop Dany. And I'm still scratching my head wondering what the hell purpose does Stannis serve? Seriously, either have him do something or don't waste so many chapters on him.<br /><br />It's not all bad though and the book is entertaining. It's not unusual for the books in the middle of a series to become a little stale as the author tries to tie everything together and setup the ending. All the same I'm looking forward to the next book.
0670921076|1.0|This NOVEL is a DRAMATISATION of a murder that happened in the late 1930s when the Japanese had invaded China, and the Chinese left and right wing factions were fighting each other for control.<br />If you want history,or even historical atmosphere, do not bother with this book. If you want a murder mystery, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The NOVELIST (do not be deceived- this man is no historian nor analyst)has used notes made by the father of the murdered girl, and has based his NOVEL on these. If anyone, it would be the father, that has \\"solved\\" the crime, not this NOVELIST. It is audacious and dishonest to claim otherwise. The problem is, there are so many errors in this account that everything he writes is discredited.<br /><br />This NOVEL is cliched and repetative.The expats are described as wasters, drunks, womanisers, \\"bright young things\\", \\"old China hands\\", \\"fast set\\", pompous, stiffupperlip....you name it, it is there... and on each page these people are taking tiffins or propping up bars. This NOVELIST pads out the book by such repetition you wonder if an editor ever went near it.<br /><br />Clearly the NOVELIST is writing for a screen play, not for history, as why else would he fabricate dialogue, private thoughts, pass off rumour as truth, try and construct a conspiracy theory, and describe scenes he did not see. These parts are not even well written: \\"who does a dentist's dentistry?\\". Tiresome and juvenile.<br /><br />It is dishonest of this writer to:<br />1. pass off someone else's work as his own<br />2. claim status as a historian, analyst, reporter, when he fabricates, and fails to corroborate libellous suppositions, and cannot get basic facts right<br />3. hide behind the \\"novel\\" title and yet passes this dross off as \\"history\\". Or vice versa.<br /><br />If you want history, read \\"Wild Swans\\" , or the biography of Mao by the same author. try \\"Empire of the Sun\\", for autobiography of child caught up in the japanese prison camps. They are all gripping, well written, and the research is there.
B001EOOQEM|4.0|Ronnie James at his finest... Sound is great and it's Black Sabbath with RJD.. Even though I prefer Ozzy and cannot help but say this album is one of the best Black Sabbath albums..
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best app ever! it doesn't steal your battery life as fast as other apps (wich is awesome) and it is just perfect for anyone of any age. I am happy with this app and I have no concerns.
B007ZBWJX8|3.0|I've only had this for a day, so this is more of a first impression than a proper view.  As far as the music goes, it does sound like Asia to me!  The second track, \\"Bury Me in Willow\\" I'm finding pretty catchy, and I haven't yet heard anything from the rest of the album that rubs me wrong, so I'm giving it a tentative thumbs-up.<br /><br />I got the vinyl LP record, so here are some comments specific to that...  This is a standard-weight single-LP album, not any sort of premium or audiophile release, and I do think that's a shame.  Going with only a single disc required some unfortunate compromises.  They had to cut out three tracks from the CD release, although two of them appear to have been merely alternate mixes of songs that were included.  Even after dropping those three tracks, the running time is still 49.5 minutes, which is really pushing the limits for the LP format.  To make it fit they had to use a narrower groove, which meant they had to reduce the signal level, and the signal/noise ratio has suffered.  The one I got is a clean pressing, the noise floor is pretty low, but I can still hear the rumble of the needle on the vinyl between tracks.<br /><br />The good news is, it still sounds better than the sonically-crushed-and-clipped CD release!  The loudness war continues, and although I've encountered worse examples, the CD release of XXX is suffering from that syndrome.  So...  Even though I wish the LP had appeared in a more premium package, I'm also relieved that it was released on vinyl at all.
0201633612|2.0|One reviewer put it very succinctly: BY ACADEMICS, FOR ACADEMICS.<br /><br />Pros: This book has a good layout for referencing.  If you are already experienced with the design patterns in this book, it will be useful as a reference to refresh yourself later.<br /><br />Cons: It is horrible for any student who wants to learn about design patterns for the first time.  Many patterns are irrelevant or indistinct, and many patterns are intuitive and used by programmers over and over without even realizing it.  However, this book does little to enhance your understanding or application of either.  The language used is hard to follow if you're not already familiar with the particular pattern and the terminology associated with it.  The explanations are needlessly complicated (consider saying &#34;modeling the effects of velocity, spin, frictional coefficient, and impact angle on deflection angle in near-elastic collisions of phenolic resin spheres&#34; instead of just &#34;pool balls hitting each other&#34;).  There is only one example for each pattern, none of the examples are articulated well, and most are for GUI development for simple productivity software, not a very wide range of uses.  Many of the patterns bloat your code with needless complexity for little or no benefit.<br /><br />This book is clearly a product of academia (think Phd, seminars, and book-writing) rather than a resource for actual software developers in the actual industry.  Only someone who has spent their whole life in an educational setting would bother to rewrite the same design pattern 5 times over, slapping a new name on it and justifying it as a separate pattern purely through semantics rather than applicability.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're already an experienced programmer who has already had experience with design patterns, buy this book to use as a reference if you find it for sale at a thrift store for 50 cents.  If you're a student hoping to learn about design patterns, avoid this book.  Instead, consider the series of Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture books.  If you're a student game developer, Game Programming Patterns and Game Engine Architecture (1st edition, the 2nd edition I believe removed some of this stuff) teach a lot of the same design patterns but uses language that is easier to understand.Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture books.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have not read this book, but I have heard enough about it to express this:  This book is pure garbage and a waste of time.  And we wonder why there are so many sexual crimes against women and children???  I am no prude, but When is enough ...ENOUGH!!!  I have seen girls as young as 14 reading this book by the pool.  I know it is for adults, but you know that everyone is interested in it and curious.  Nothing is shocking anymore and it is just sad.  So sad.

B0009S4IKQ|5.0|Directed by Edmund Goulding from the stage production by Vicki Baum, this is one of the MGM's most prestigious projects that star several top performers of the day. Set in the most opulent establishment of post WWI Berlin, the Grand Hotel is where the story unfolds. It is all about life; the good and bad interact, and bad tries to destroy the good and it is the good that win at last. A people-weary prima ballerina named Grusinskaya (Great Garbo) is shy and likes to be alone but starved for love and attention; A conman who presents himself as the Baron Felix Von Greigern (John Barrymore) is desperate to steal precious pearls from Grusinskaya to pay off his debt to his gangster friends; A dying bookkeeper, Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) is out on a mission to enjoy the last few days of his life, and his greedy boss, Preysing (Wallace Beery) is busy negotiating an important merger of his business empire. His young stenographer, Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) is trying to make on her own in the real world; the hotel bell captain named Senf (Jean Hersholt) is too absorbed to get the good news from the hospital where his wife is about deliver his baby, and then a wealthy doctor, Otternschlag (Lewis Stone) with scarred face is lonely and too bored.<br /><br />The ambitious Flaemmchen makes the acquaintance of the handsome Baron and falls in love with him, and she also likes the friendship of the kind-hearted gentleman Kringelein. When Grusinskaya is away, the Baron sneaks into her room and steals her pearls, but he finds himself locked inside the room. When Grusinskaya returns to her room, and tries to commit suicide because of depression, he suddenly appears before her and stops her from taking her own life, and in a change of heart, he also returns her pearls. His charming ways changes her heart and she falls in love instantly and dreams of her life with him. Later the Baron steals money from his friend Otto Kringelein who won a large sum of money in a poker game, and eventually returns his money due to a change of heart. Finally he gets caught red-handed by businessman Preysing when he steals his money and in an outburst of anger, Presying's hit gives a fatal blow to Baron's head and kills him. Preysing ends up in jail, Flaemmchen finds love where she least expected, the kind and gentle soul, Kringelein, Grusinskaya is lost after she couldn't find the Baron. Radiant in love, one can only imagine the despair that awaits her.<br /><br />This is a fantastic story of a conman who in his last few days of life bring love and happiness in the lives of two women who desperately seek them. He spends his entire life stealing from others. He is miserable and merciless, but one sweet act changes his ways. Sweet old Kringelein is rejuvenated after finding love in young and beautiful Flaemmchen. Greedy and heartless businessman Preysing finds nothing but darkness ahead. This is a story of the good, the bad and ugly; it is the good that finally wins. The movie is brilliantly directed and it is the Barrymore brothers who steal the show, especially John Barrymore who offers a brilliant performance as a conman who goes from being bad to being good. This is also one of the big movies of Great Garbo, but she appears in very few scenes than Joan Crawford.<br /><br />There are several memorable quotes from this film that reverberated through history. Greta Grabo's words; \\"I want to be alone\\" is one of them. She is known to be shy and strongly liked her privacy wherever she went in her personal life. Other memorable dialogue is when Baron changes the heart of beautiful Grusinskaya<br /><br />Grusinskaya: \\"Can you imagine a hundred girls in the ballet school, each thinking she would become the most famous dancer in all the world? I was ambitious then. We were drilled like little soldiers. No rest, no stopping. I was little; slim, but hard as a diamond. Then I became famous and.... but why am I telling you all this? Last night, I didn't know you at all. Who are you, really?\\"<br />Baron Felix von Geigern: \\"What?\\"<br />Grusinskaya: \\"I don't even know your name.\\"<br />Baron Felix von Geigern: [laughs] \\"I am Felix Benvenuto Freihern von Geigern. My mother called me Flix.\\"<br />Grusinskaya: [joyously] \\"No! Flix! Oh, that's sweet. And how do you live? And what kind of a person are you?\\"<br />Baron Felix von Geigern: \\"I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock. I shall die on the gallows.\\"ho are you, really?\\"<br />Baron Felix von Geigern: \\"What?\\"<br />Grusinskaya: \\"I don't even know your name.\\"<br />Baron Felix von Geigern: [laughs] \\"I am Felix Benvenuto Freihern von Geigern.

B007P6VLRS|3.0|It's listenable, but I felt a need to stop before My Love is Winter ended to play Zeitgeist because I needed to feel something.<br /><br />My first impression was that the overall sound is good, the drumming is good, and I like the fact that the bass playing has personality.  However, when I played Zeitgeist I immediately realized what was missing... Jimmy Chamberlin.  As far as I'm concerned Jimmy is one of the best drummers EVER.  There's no doubt in my mind that Billy Corgan IS Smashing Pumpkins and Oceania is a Smashing Pumpkins record, but I'm going to have to listen to it again with the knowledge that this one has a sound that settles somewhere between Gish and Adore.
B004LWZW88|5.0|A few of my friends had recommended that I watched this movie. So I did, and I was really surprised. This movie is actually really funny. It even has it's \\"laugh out loud moments\\". And unlike its parent Shrek movies, this movie is all action and comedy. Never a dull moment. It is definitely entertaining and good for laughs with the whole family. The movie takes place in a latin setting (Puss seems to be from Spain (Antonio Banderas definitely is) so if you know a bit of Spanish, it will make it even funnier. I enjoyed watching Puss's whole story since he was a kitten. And if you are a \\"cat lover\\", you will be in heaven! This is a must buy for you.<br /><br />The chemistry between Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayek seeps through their animated characters making it fun to watch. Not to mention that Zach Galifianakis is in it too. And being from Dreamworks, it ensures high quality in video and audio(1080p/7.1 Dolby)<br /><br />With the price dropping and the high re-playability factor, this movie will make a great addition to your collection.

0345803485|1.0|is america off its rocker? THIS trash is best selling literature. I fear for the future of our country if that is the case.<br /><br />this book has NO, absolutely NO literary merit. its written so clumsily that one cannot help but gag while reading. i put it down about 15% of the way through because i had enough. The first 5% i gave it a chance, the second 10% i continued to read because i was actually incredibly astonished how retarded it was and how this filth was popular.<br /><br />the story is about a billionare who speaks a bunch of languages, and some girl he marries and does nasty kinky sexual things with. thats the only reason the books sells: pornography masquerading as literature.
B004H1YH66|5.0|I'm really glad I followed the advice to buy this recording over the OST. The sound quality is great and you get additional tracks not included on the OST. This is a re-creation, not a re-interpretation of the original score. The Prague Orchestra sticks as close to the original sound as you could ask for. Magnificent recording of an awesome film score. If you must have the original poster art, buy both recordings!

I didn't get to any of the um \\"good stuff\\" but I couldn't even get past the horrible writing in the first place. And I agree with some of the other reviews...\\"holy crap\\" (you will understand IF you read the book) there is a lot of repetition! All I can recall is the usage of \\"holy crap\\" maybe 10 times in just the few pages I read. Really? The writing is amateurish, unoriginal and I can't believe this is a top selling book. And what 19 year girl or even grown woman says \\"holy crap\\"...other than me, because \\"holy crap\\" this book is crap!

1594744769|4.0|First, I am an adult. I do not limit myself to reading only adult fiction as there are so many interesting and fun books out there for all age groups. I wish I had had young children to read this book to, as they definitely would have enjoyed it along with me. These days with all the vampire books out there, it was definitely refreshing to have not a hint of one in this book. There are plenty of interesting characters to keep you reading though so do not dispair . The story kept me coming back for more and helped me to linger longer on the treadmill. That's worth something right? ;-) The artwork was fun and different. I am looking forward to reading the sequel. Happy reading.

Yes, I am a teenager, but contrary to popular belief we are not all obsessed with sex. Adults should actually get to know some of us before stereotypIng us to idiots who hate everybody. News flash: we don't always respect adults because adults don't respect us.

I also let my sister borrow the book.  She used to be a director at a VERY major cosmetic & perfume company.  She really enjoyed it, too.  And it's all in alphabetical order so it's very easy to find whatever fragrances you're looking for.  Great fun and lots of good info!

B000OP1M6M|5.0|So, after contemplating getting a Rolex Submariner I visited a few Watch Forums and the Seiko 009 and 007 came up as reasonable alternatives for the \\"everyday\\" watch. The Rolex owners weren't complaining about the Rolex, they just noted that for the price, and overall durability, the Seiko Divers Automatic was a \\"must have.\\"  Actually, more than a few mentioned that they wear their Seiko's far more.<br /><br />I browsed both colors, and after reading a few forums, I found out that I can change the bezel to Black, or vice versa if I wanted (ebay purchase). So, I pulled the trigger on the Blue and Red, many people note it as being a Pepsi Dial, but I see it more as the colors of the American Flag, and being that this would be a work watch (I'm in the Military), it seemed fitting. Additionally, the military history of this watch contributed to my decision as well.  Noting some of the common concerns with the watch, \\"band feels cheap and flimsy,\\" and \\"the watch face is large,\\" I eagerly awaited shipment.  I receive the watch and am immediately impressed. The watch isn't that large, but I am pretty tall (6'2\\"), so it fits, but if I was shorter, I believe that it still look well, and not too large.  To note, I've been wearing a Suunto Vector for the last 9 years, and that face is 50mm, and the Seiko is about 8mm smaller, so I was happy.  The photos listed on Amazon DO NOT do this watch justice, it looks MUCH BETTER in person.  You cannot manually wind this watch, however, a few swings from the left and the right, and away the ticking went, and I set the time. Additionally, I followed the \\"poor mans hack\\" in order to synch the second hand to another watch. For that, when in the time setting mode, gently turn the crown counter clock wise, and the second hand will stop in place.  When the second hand on the other clock reaches the paused second hand on the Seiko, just gently turn the crown clock wise, and it's synched.  It's really that easy folks.  Setting the date, day, and time is a snap, and the screw down crown is pretty nifty.<br /><br />I have to agree that the band feels cheap, so in anticipation, I purchased a 22mm oyster bracelet  on Amazon, that I feel will give a more professional appearance, and not so gaudy as the current band.  You can also I also order the Seiko oyster band on Amazon, but the complaints were the same, that it felt cheap, so I went with the more expensive after market brand. I also ordered a simple watch repair kit because in order to remove the links on the after-market oyster, you need a small screw driver, as it's not a push pin type.  I've only been wearing the watch for about 4 hours at the time of this review, and I think it's fitting to write another review in about 6 months for an update.  This is my first automatic, and I feel like I've entered into a new world of watches.  Most older gentlemen (and the wise young) that I know wear automatics, and a watch of this quality priced under 200 bucks that matches well in either a suit, uniform, or casual wear is a must buy if you're considering.  This will definitely be on my wrist for many years to come.  Happy with the purchase, and if your contemplating, get it. This watch will last for many many happy years. Actually, I can't stop looking at it. Remember, if you decide one color bezel, you can always change it, and the band for a completely new look. Hope this review helps.<br /><br />UPDATE 21JUL12 - I dont consider myself someone that gets caught up too much in fashion, but I simply love this watch. I cant stop looking at it. The second hand just takes me to a happy place. I've caught at least 3 people checking it out when it peaks out from underneath my sleeve when I'm in uniform. One female commented that the colors are that of the American Flag (SCORE!!!). I can't believe that I've lived on this earth for 33 years and didn't know about automatic watches. Someone commented in another post that it feels like your watch has a soul, and every timeI walk anywhere, I feel like I'm giving it life. I actually find myself imagining all the gizmos inside working every arm swing. Sometimes I just over exaggerate the swing, but Im a fool. And I have to admit, I just purchased the SKX007 (Black). I removed a few links, and adjusted the micro on the band and it it fits like a glove (another reviewer mentioned that it moves like liquid, and I have to agree. It has not pulled any hair on my arm, and moves with my wrist as I \\"desk dive\\" sitting at my computer all day). The band no longer feels cheap, I actually like it.  So, the super oyster band that I purchased is going to go on the 007 so I have two totally different watches. I've also caught myself checking out other peoples watches, and I've spotted a few Rolex (one day :) ), Invicta (DO NOT PURCHASE), Seiko, and a whole lotta Walmart (nothing wrong with those, those guys tend to have a family to support and are being responsible) brands. We sit around all day in the same uniform, and now I feel like I have a sense of separation from the drones. One of my old Major's used to wear a Rolex (a real one), and I never understood why. Now, with this beauty on my arm, I totally get it. Again, the photo does not do this watch any justice, I have to upload a pic. So, someone asked me how Seiko makes money if their watches last so long. I told him that people are probably silly like me and get two, and end up recommending, and buying as gifts. This watch is not that expensive, and will last a really long time, so if gifted, it will likely be with someone for a really long time. In regards to time, as of now, as I've owned it only for a few days, it runs a little fast when I wake up (about 6 seconds) (poor mans hack fixes that), but seriously, I dont mind, I'm now wearing a machine, not an accessory.  I think with some time, it will settle in.  Seiko flys under the radar, and thats good, cause I want to keep my American Flag Colors all to myself.  So, if you can, save the time, order both from the same seller, and just enjoy.<br /><br />31JUL12 Update - Received the Skx007 (Black bezel) model yesterday and changed the bracelet to the super oytser, and it looks great. I did the entire change myself and total it took me less than 30 mins with a watch repair kit that I purchased for about $8.00.  My 009 (pepsi bezel) runs about 20 seconds fast depending on which way I lay it at night, and found that crown down, on the side keeps it there. I am no longer super obsessed with keeping the second hand synched with my phone clock, and realized that these watches will do as they do. As I mentioned before, wearing an automatic is wearing a watch with a soul. These watches are priced right, and will last me a life time.<br /><br />16AUG12 Update - I changed out the band to a Super Jubilee, which does a nice job adding even more heft to the watch (not too much though). Also, it just feels all round more secure, as the new band has a deployant release. Super happy, you can view pic here on the amazon site at: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B007VZUONU/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_0?ie=UTF8&index=0&isremote=0I walk anywhere, I feel like I'm giving it life.

So, someone asked me how Seiko makes money if their watches last so long. I told him that people are probably silly like me and get two, and end up recommending, and buying as gifts. This watch is not that expensive, and will last a really long time, so if gifted, it will likely be with someone for a really long time. In regards to time, as of now, as I've owned it only for a few days, it runs a little fast when I wake up (about 6 seconds) (poor mans hack fixes that), but seriously, I dont mind, I'm now wearing a machine, not an accessory.  I think with some time, it will settle in.  Seiko flys under the radar, and thats good, cause I want to keep my American Flag Colors all to myself.  So, if you can, save the time, order both from the same seller, and just enjoy.<br /><br />31JUL12 Update - Received the Skx007 (Black bezel) model yesterday and changed the bracelet to the super oytser, and it looks great. I did the entire change myself and total it took me less than 30 mins with a watch repair kit that I purchased for about $8.00.  My 009 (pepsi bezel) runs about 20 seconds fast depending on which way I lay it at night, and found that crown down, on the side keeps it there. I am no longer super obsessed with keeping the second hand synched with my phone clock, and realized that these watches will do as they do. As I mentioned before, wearing an automatic is wearing a watch with a soul. These watches are priced right, and will last me a life time.<br /><br />16AUG12 Update - I changed out the band to a Super Jubilee, which does a nice job adding even more heft to the watch (not too much though). Also, it just feels all round more secure, as the new band has a deployant release. Super happy, you can view pic here on the amazon site at: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B007VZUONU/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_0?ie=UTF8&index=0&isremote=0
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game J's very very very very fun you should get it it is like Mario but a more cartoon version.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am a 51 year old man, happily married for 26 years to a wonderful woman. We have a very satisfying physical and emotional relationship. I just finished reading Book One because I wanted to share and discuss this with her, as she has read all 3 novels. Most of her female friends have, too.<br />I liken this reading USA Today, in that it is poorly written and appeals to a wide audience.  Perhaps an audience with different needs and expectations than mine. I am fairly open-minded when it comes to the subject of sex and erotica, but I cannot excuse BAD writing. This is among the weakest I've ever read, but there is no arguing with success I suppose. People will read this because their friends have and it's \\"scandalous\\"!<br />To me, this was 50 shades of a P.O.S.
B004TWOXIU|5.0|I have owned a few video presentations of this opera and this, for me, is the best option among the more modern versions. I also bought it before the price was reduced to the current bargain range (depending on the Arthaus version advertised) so it seems to me to offer terrific value.<br /><br />The venue at Verona is spectacular with everything being presented on a large scale. This produces a situation of swings and roundabouts. The voices can get somewhat submerged, but not inaudible, at the big moments - and there are many. However, with the aid of the subtitles, it is easy enough to precisely follow the words being sung without any guesswork.<br /><br />At the same time there is also conveyed a degree of required effort which I personally find appropriate to the scale of the drama being portrayed. The crucial death of Scarpia must equally be conveyed with an overwhelming passion and hatred and in this respect we are fully catered for. Several otherwise fine performances fall at this hurdle. The singers here are all up to the task vocally and as actors. The orchestra are well recorded especially when considering the demands of the venue.<br /><br />As a recording this succeeds in creating the sense of considerable spectacle and the imaging is as crisp and as involving as one could reasonably expect from such a setting and venue. The sound is equally praise-worthy and is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo options.<br /><br />This is a red-blooded Tosca writ large. Tosca is all about passion, larger than life characters and events supported by music conceived on a large scale. That, for me, is what we get here and I for one, am very satisfied. Highly recommended especially as it is now available at a much reduced price.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read the book over the course of 2 days and was almost as torn as Anastasia is over Christian. On the one hand, I decided I'd had enough of the repetitive writing style (if she bit her lip one more time!), inexperienced descriptions of sex, and semi-abusive relationship. College or high school me might have actually thought this relationship was romantic. Now I see it for what it is - a train wreck.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book was a fast read and I was curious to see how it would end. While the feminist voice inside of me balked at the weird D&S relationship, to each his own. Overall, Shades of Grey was not what I expected, but it was okay.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game! I actually finished all of the levels (with no mistakes) in two days... Now I'm doing the time trials...  I wish there was a type of scoring system or a way to earn more levels, though.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy, but rarely bother to write a review.  However, this is such a great book, so I want to add another 5-stars to this book's ratings.  \\"Raven's Shadow\\" is in the same league as Rothfuss, and Brandon Sanderson.
044024630X|5.0|[[ASIN:1410430103 Killing Floor (Jack Reacher)]]<br /><br />I still think a 5 foot 5 inch actor (Tom Cruise) shouldn't play a character who's 6 foot 4 (Jack Reacher).

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I haven't read any other reviews here,  but I expect I am mostly alone in my dislike of this book.  I want a refund!  I must admit I did not read the entire book as what I did read I found boring and repetitive.  Okay I 'fess up I am not in the same age group as its millions of devotees.  I am a woman and don't consider myself a prude.  But I just plain didn't like it.  So there!<br />[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
0385344228|4.0|This is a great read.  Well written, well thought out, good character development.  The plot has lots of twists and turns, and full of surprises.  I would recommend this book to anyone who liks a good mystery/family saga, but is bored with all the \\"same old same old\\".  Enjoy!

B001RHPJBU|5.0|Saw this 99 cents one day promotion and immediately thought it must be a single. I was extremely surprised when I realized it was not only an album, but a 16 song album that contains many of my childhood favourites! Don't know how Amazon does it but KUDOS! Pure awesomeness!!
B002MEW7YY|5.0|This production has such wildly mixed reviews about the leading lady and the staging that I thought I'd add my perspective for potential buyers. This role was redefined in the early 50's by Maria Callas and subsequently perfected in the late 50's-70's by Joan Sutherland. For me there are no better Lucias and even among their contemporaries there were few singers I enjoyed as much. There are no singers performing today who could share their stage. Unfortunately for an overall performance, I don't think either singer has an ensemble as electric as this. Their live Lucias are either in debatable sound or in the case of Sutherland's Met DVD version she was way past her prime and probably was paid big money for a fan favorite. A legion of sopranos have tried their hand at this opera some with great success and others not but for this particular staging Anna Netrebko's natural beauty, acting ability, and adequate voice make her a remarkable if not historic Lucia.<br /><br />It is the male leads that really shine and steal the show. Piotr Beczala filling in for Villazon was perfect in a role that has been sung by all the great tenors since Donizetti wrote this opera in 1835. He has a beautiful, ringing voice and a noble bearing onstage. The man who made me really sit up and take notice though was Mariusz Kwiecien. He added an evil fire to Enrico Ashton I've never seen or heard before and made Enrico a role that baritones should seriously consider making an important part of their repertoire. In all the Lucia recordings I've heard before, and all the videos and DVD's, I've barely took notice of Enrico even when he was being played by a historically great baritone.<br /><br />As far as the Mary Zimmerman staging goes, I have not read the book, but I rather liked the dark, Victorian tones and how Netrebko's costuming contrasts with them onstage. I liked it ghosts and all. Wrapping this together is the sound score of Marco Armiliato, an undermentioned conductor who I saw liveconducting La Fille Du Regiment (also Donizetti) in 2010 at the Met. Armiliato deserves much credit as well for accommodating the singers with his tempi and volume. He is no different in this regard when it comes to Lucia di Lammermoor.<br /><br />In conclusion, I loved it regardless of whether Anna Netrebko was the best or worst to take on the role of Lucia in the last 175+ years. It is also in High Definition and for me that is a plus.
B003W5C0VM|5.0|First, get the Blu-ray and not the DVD because it's much better audio/video quality (but have reasonable expectations -- we are talking 1972).  Everything the band plays (excepting one cover song) is from Let it Bleed, Beggars, Sticky, or Exile.  Mick Taylor, Nickey Hopkins and Bobby Keys are equal players with the core of Mick, Keith, Bill and Charlie (even Ian S. makes a brief piano appearance).<br /><br />This is the Rolling Stones at their absolute peak (among many great periods). Don't worry about the lack of completely perfect technical quality, this is what cinema verite aspires to be.<br /><br />Something about 1972 was just magical.
0345529057|4.0|The books arrived punctually and were reasonably priced (set of four for twenty dollars).  Not the best written books, but entertaining, especially for those interested in e HBO series.

B004UG7RQ0|3.0|I'm sure this product is just fine and works great with other vehicles. Just wanted to make Infiniti drivers aware that it may not work in your vehicle. WHY any car maker would limit an external audio device to something proprietary like an iPod, I'll never understand - I guess so the user can have audio controls via the steering wheel. But car makers should at least offer the option for a standard audio jack.<br /><br />In any case, my GROM version of this device works in my Infiniti, but has starting cutting out. So I was hoping to try this brand instead. I guess I'm back to GROM.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|I'm glad I'm just borrowing these books!  I'm most certain I'd feel guilty for a long time if I had bought them.<br /><br />As I've mentioned in my review of book 1, I decided to move on to book 2 hoping to find redemption.  Well, there were new developments, new twists, and still a lot of sex!!!  These two know no bounds - morning, noon and nighttime, and not just once on each occasion!<br /><br />Really, this trilogy can fit into just one thin paperback, with just enough sexy encounters to tease the reader.  Or was it the author's intention to create a 3-volume sex atlas?<br /><br />This sequel follows the blossoming of mutual love, from pure lust to some kind of erotic-romantic.  Still, it's on the shallow side.  Just for the joy of romantic sex, an extra star.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I originally got into this series after seeing the first season on HBO. It is fantastic. A real page turner. I've heard it described as \\"Lord of the Rings\\" meets \\"The Sopranos\\", and that is about as accurate a description as I could think off. The only caveat is that the 4th book is not nearly as good as the first 3. There are several reasons for this, but the main one is that the best characters with the most interesting story lines don't appear in \\"A Feast for Crows\\". I burned through the first 3, whereas with the 4th one I almost just wanted to get through it. It was a chore. I've started the 5th book now, and I'm thankful that the series seems to be back on track. If you're looking for a great summer read, it's tough to beat this series.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so much more than your basic thriller.  There is enough action in the plot to keep you more than interested, but the characterization is also phenomenal.  It's not a serious read, but it's more than your basic fluff novel.  I don't want to give too much away, but basically, the book keeps you evaluating both the husband and wife who narrate the novel.  You can never quite be sure if they're being honest or what they're keeping from you.  Only from seeing both sides of the story can you get a full understanding of the plot and characters.  I highly recommend this book!
0345529057|1.0|Lots of reviews saying the printing quality of these books is bad. That may be, but in such a case, a buyer may beware and still take a chance, based on the relatively low price.<br /><br />BUT the main problem here is MISSING PAGES! There are actually LARGE CHUNKS missing from the text! If you read the reviews, these missing pages seem to be somewhat random -- at least, I couldn't see a pattern. In my case, it was pages 121-184 from Clash of Kings that were missing.<br /><br />Inexcusable that Amazon is still selling these books with such a flaw.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!!! I usually<br /> never play games but this one has got me hooked. I. love these apps.

B007XNAQLA|5.0|You must have this! Great performances by all...and a great deal...2 CDs and bonus DVD with live performance!  The DVD alone is worth WAY more than the price for the whole package.  If you've never bought RTF music, this is the one you want!  Not just rehashed oldies...these are really great new arrangements of their greatest works.  I think even better than the originals with the addition of Jean Luc Ponte and Frank Gambale on guitar.  Watching the DVD for the first time gave me almost as many goose bumps as when I first saw RTF on Don Kirschner's Rock Concert in the 70's!  Wow!  Great stuff!

B004JN1D2I|4.0|5 stars for content, 4 stars for format though - TOC of each book listed as Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, etc, but within the text the start of each chapter has only the title, not the chapter numbers. This is an epic story and I find that I frequently want to go back and reread a previous chapter in order to better understand what's going on, but this lack of chapter numbers makes that difficult. It doesn't help that the chapter titles are the names of the characters who are the the main focus of that chapter, so, for example, \\"A Storm of Swords\\" has 80 chapters and 20 of them might be titled \\"Tyrion\\". Doesn't really narrow it down much.<br /><br />There's no link to the main TOC in the menu, but if you go to \\"beginning\\" and advance a few pages you get the links to the start of each individual book, so no big deal I guess. I have a Kindle Fire and a 3rd gen and for some reason I have problems getting the 2 versions to sync up properly, so I've been using bookmarks in order to find my spot and not relying on the kindle to figure out current location. (This could very well be operator error, but I don't think so.)<br /><br />Also, on the 3rd gen version it always says I'm on Page 674 of 674 no matter where I actually am in the series. The Fire doesn't tell me page numbers.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend this version for the simple fact that it's better than lugging around 4 books, but if you are the person who really needs to flip back and read that one scene again because it might help you understand that other scene, you might want to stick with the paper version.<br /><br />UPDATE Sept. 19, 2012: For some reason this kindle book is no longer available for US residents to purchase. Before you buy 35 pounds of hard copy though, email/call amazon support and give them crap about this. It will likely come back into the kindle store, but the product page doesn't say when. The same thing happened with Dances with Dragons; I looked for it in the kindle store for a couple of weeks, but it said it wasn't available for US residents. 2 days after I bought a used hardback, it became available on kindle! Unfortunately for me, I didn't buy the hardback from Amazon.<br /><br />Also, Amazon pushed an update to this book which appears to have fixed the real page numbering on my 3rd gen Kindle. There are still no page numbers on the 1st gen Kindle Fire, only location numbers. The Go To submenu now includes TOC link, which goes to the master table that contains links to the start of each of the 4 books. These are good improvements, but I'm still sticking with my 4 stars because it's still excruciatingly difficult to navigate when you are deep into the story and want to reread a previous chapter.<br /><br />But really what I think you should do is get this on a 2nd gen kindle fire and read this with the X-Ray feature that device has. Or maybe Amazon will be so kind as to update the 1st gen K-fire software with X-ray. If there is one  book (or seven) that screams for that feature, it's the Song of Ice and Fire.
B00701L5XS|5.0|This app far exceeded my expectations. It has animated video that can be pauses to show how each knot is tied. the images can be viewed from any angle to show how the knot is tied. Also included is a description of each knot and what it is used for. All knots are broken down by category. The fishing and boating knots will be most beneficial for me.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Fiona Apple definitely made this worth the 7 year wait!

B00127RAJY|5.0|After reading all the reviews about Jillian Michaels, I decided to give it a try. Well I plopped the  DVD in yesterday morning and at first I was thinking, oh this won't be bad at all. Well, I was wrong. Jillian Michaels delivers a killer workout in approximately 20 minutes! I woke up this morning and I could barely walk but I will definitely be plopping the dvd in later this afternoon again. Even when I go to the gym, I never feel like this so obviously I've been doing something wrong. I also love the fact that there is a modified version which I followed the whole time and believe me, even the modified version will have you sweating! I will definitely be doing this for 30 days (of course with a day or two off each week). I also measured myself before I plopped the dvd in so I'm anxious to see if I lost any inches after the 30 days.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|I don't know if I read the description wrong, but I didn't expect a thin, hard plastic shell with a thin cover for the screen. If a Fire was dropped with this on it, I can see it breaking. It's also very uncomfortable to hold as the corners have sharp edges. I feel I've wasted the purchase price & will be spending the additional to purchase the leather cover I've seen on a friend's Fire.
B008IYOEZM|3.0|This is the weakest of the Dexter seasons. None of them are totally believable, of course, but stories with serial killers who stage elaborate \\"tableaux\\" for the police and public are really hard to believe in. CSI degenerated into this kind of story and I think it ruined the show. I hope the next season is better. I also found the sex scenes creepy.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|I have to admit in this review that the first 3 times I saw Titanic that I actually thought it was a pretty bad idea for a story.  I mean, who would actually believe that a ship like this would sink.  Poor writing!  But then it happened.  I was watching the History Channel and what did I discover?  The whole thing was real!  This was a real story!  There was a ship and it REALLY, Really, really sank!  Can you believe it?  Wow....holy baby jesus.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|When comparing this new Blu-ray to the old DVD, I was very surprised to find that the old wide-screen DVD is actually CROPPED!<br />This new Blu-ray presents much more picture on the top and bottom as well as on the right side! There are black bars on the sides of the screen to bring the picture in to it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:66-1 (which is not as wide as wide-screen TVs).<br /><br />The old DVD stated on the back that it was also 1:66-1 aspect ratio but that was a lie, the top & bottom are cropped to present the picture in 1:85-1 aspect ratio.<br />To add to the cropping problem the old DVD also cropped the right side! This means that even more picture from the top & bottom got cropped off than necessary to create the 1:85-1 aspect ratio.<br /><br />The presentation on the new Blu-ray disc is much sharper and the colors are way more vibrant!  It is almost like seeing the movie fresh and new, like never before.<br /><br />--As far as the story, it is an OVERLOOKED CLASSIC!  Really!  I have enjoyed it since day-one! My wife had never wanted to see this because of the early reviews, after she saw it she was shocked at how good it was, calling it a \\"must see\\". She is probably not the only animation fan who has deprived themselves of this classic for the past 10 years. Now is a great time to remedy this and buy this Blu-ray!<br /><br />The adventure is fast and well paced,  the characters are fun to watch, and the animation is great!
B00701L5XS|4.0|I watched several of the animations and enjoyed the ability to rotate the view. It just need a search option.

0345803485|2.0|I have always thought that the best books were those that invited controversy and differing opinions. If that were the sole criteria, this trilogy would surely be a classic for all time. I read through over a hundred reviews before purchasing the books and ultimately decided that I wanted to formulate my own opinion. Throughout the reading, I could see why many of the readers came to the opinions they did -- on both sides. But by the time I finished the third book, my own opinions were very clear. This is an author with a 30-page, unimaginative plot which she attempted to puff up with equally unimaginative sex scenes. And while the sex scenes vary according to costume, locale, or dialogue, they are all the same. Sex between an abusive (but charming to some) man and a woman who talks herself into acquiescing in order to keep him. It's an old,old story, one I would have thought we'd be past socially today.  For Christian Grey, sexual turnabout is never fair play; she never restrains or causes him pain, nor is it ever even a consideration. My own personal abuse was that I was cheated as a reader -- too little plot, too much sex, overtly poor writing quality in places, and no redeeming social growth or moral value to justify the time or money I spent. Buyer beware.
B00701L5XS|4.0|Reviewed on a Kindle Fire<br /><br />Knots 3D is an excellent tool for anyone who uses or is simply interested in various types of knots. Graphics are beautiful, animations are smooth and quality of content is excellent. The different knots are categorized by use or classification, and it is one-touch easy to add any knot in the library to a \\"favorites\\" section for easy reference to your most commonly used knots. Knot animations can be paused, reversed or slowed to see the individual steps of the tie, and the 3D image of the knot can be rotated to show all sides of the knot and tying process. Overall this is an excellent reference app, and well worth the $1.99 pricetag.<br />The app does exhibit two problems on the Kindle Fire. First, the menu bar of the Fire covers up the bottoms of the buttons on the individual knot views. This does not seem to affect functionality in any significant way, but it does make the app look a bit unpolished. Next, the zoom slider on the right side of the knot views does not work on the Fire, although pinch and zoom gestures work fine. 5 star review after these problems are fixed.
B00701L5XS|4.0|This is a great reference list of knots. I was just talking to a couple of other dads last weekend and complaining to them that none of our kids knows how to tie a decent knot. Half of the dads I was talking to didn't even know how to tie a bowline.<br /><br />Not only does this include images of the knots, it includes video images that you can speed up, slow down, and rotate.<br /><br />Each knot includes a description and usage, alternate names, and related knots. The descriptions are incredibly thorough and include information like strength/reliability and mechanical advantage.<br /><br />I was actually looking through some knot references recently to work with my son. This reference app is far better than anything I had found previously.
1451648537|4.0|I read this book while on vacation.  Aside from purchasing an iPhone just over a month ago, I knew nothing about Jobs.  Here's what I came away after reading the book.  Jobs was a very driven person.  He focused on work.  He treated people like crap.  Some would call him a genius.  With all his quirks, he managed to develop (through his company) devices that changed how we view data and how we interact.  I recommend the book for anyone looking for an honest reading of a major player in technological development.

0071762345|5.0|I just finished Likeable Social Media and I was very impressed. Dave guides the reader through what it takes to develop an effective social media strategy for any organization. While he goes into deep detail with lots of case studies from his firm's clients, Dave's advice boils down to following the golden rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. I think this is indeed a likeable strategy.<br /><br />In addition to really good content, Dave also provides helpful questions as the end of each chapter to help you develop the chapter's concepts for your own organization.

0307887448|3.0|It doesn't say it anywhere in the book description, but this book must be geared toward a young teen audience.  Just to set expectations.  Taken as a teen book, it's a fun story.
034580404X|2.0|Fifty Shades of Grey<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is written by E. L. James a British author who fancies herself as an erotic BDSM porno peddler, which lack credibility and authenticity. Just call me romantic I must admit, I had high hopes for the love story but was repulsed by the subject matter of the practice involving bondage, discipline, sadism, and masochism from the beginning.<br /><br />I had heard all the hype about this book and being an avid reader and writer of various genre including mild erotica I felt it my duty to stay \\"in the know\\" and read this contribution to the literary society. This book does after all include some aviation (as lame as it may be. her knowledge of aviation is grossly lacking).<br /><br />The Setting was mostly in the Seattle Washington area, it is about a relationship between a college student about to graduate and a young businessman who is about three clicks off center of normal. He's dark and disturbed with a desire to inflict pain, a real subtle \\"sicko\\" inflicting pain on girls. Christian Grey is darker than fifty shades of grey.<br /><br /> Anastasia Steele was a virgin, how many virgins have an orgasm the first time they have sex? I'm a man, I've never heard one woman in my life say she had a climax the first time. (Am I wrong ladies?)<br /><br />I am a romantic and besides the marathon unrealistic teenage fantasy multiple orgasmic forty erections per hour fairy tale zippy doo-dah, I wanted it to work, sadly it didn't!<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey has topped best-seller lists in the United Kingdom, why? In the United States, why? and around the world, why? Why? I'll tell you why, because everyone can't believe everyone is talking about it. I have to say the marketing plan is genius! What a wonderful job the public relations firm had done.<br /><br />Additionally, the story subject was okay, though the BDSM isn't my thing, I think overlooking the navete' the bare writing (no pun intended), was good. I liked the way E.L James writes. She doesn't have to use a lot of grossly over the top vulgar words. She showed that erotica can be written without using too many dirty gritty four letter words. I applaud Ms. James for her effort, the writing did earn her two stars in my opinion.<br /><br />I don't think I will revisit Anastasia and Christian to find out if he dominates her again. He comes up with a contract and she's torn between her love for him and her fear of him. She knows he is Fifty Shades messed up. I want to yell out LEAVE HIM ALONE GIRL!! RUN, RUN and don't look back!<br /><br />If this book is so great why are the majority of 8,000 reviews overwhelmingly negative? There are only a few sweaty thigh reviews among the whole bunch! But then that is from the male perspective, what a disappointment this book was for me. I was hoping for an interesting story and a tease or too in the erotic department but it was all very repulsive and I couldn't get past the \\"pevert\\" part of this guy with issues that belong on the shrink's couch...<br /><br />I shall not waste my time reading the other two...<br /><br />JR Hafer, aviation writer
B00701L5XS|4.0|This app is easy to use and easy to understand. The 360 rotation is very helpful for checking the knot after you tie it.

B001HNE3NO|2.0|The first third of the book--about \\"the child\\" and her experiences (and why not use her name since the book is CALLED \\"Sarah's Key\\" and it's really, really obvious anyway), and that part is worth reading.  The last 2/3 of the book was predictable, contrived, and fairly ridiculous.  I think even if one likes \\"chick lit\\" it would be hard to take.  The astounding \\"coincidence\\" of the apartment was so over the top it would have been right at home in a Victorian novel.

B000QRIGLC|4.0|The first half of \\"Lone Survivor\\" needed to be edited into about 10 to 20 pages; it is background for the real story. When you at last reach the real story, it is engrossing and fairly well written.  This is a real American hero, who deserves to be recognized and he paints a vivid picture of a real Navy Seal operation. I'm sure that the author feels the need to recognize all the individuals who he felt were a part of this operation; however the long lists of names should have been placed into footnotes or treated in some other fashion because they did nothing to advance the story.<br /><br />Although it is interesting to hear from a military man, the military feeling about the press, I think it was repeated too many times and should have been edited also.<br /><br />With all that said, it is still an engrossing story; the American public could gain much needed information about the US presence in Afghanistan by reading this book.
076115728X|5.0|What an awesome, refreshing book to give to young kids - a nice addition to the classics of Madeleine and Barbar and Dr. Seuss books!  Also, I love the pop-ups.

B007XNAOS0|5.0|This release shows vast improvement from \\"Blue Record\\" in terms of production, lyrical content and composition.  I have always liked Baroness but was never \\"in love\\" with one of their albums...this album (more so a double) is stellar.  I have listened to it in its entirety once and am hooked!  The band's use of effects on this album definitely adds to the already solid musical frame of the 18 tracks and creates an ambience any audiophile will greatly appreciate.  Key tracks (to give an idea of what the release is without listening to all of the tracks): \\"Little Things\\"; \\"Twinkler\\"; \\"Green Theme\\"; \\"Mtns. (The Crown & Anchor)\\" and \\"The Line Between\\".  I highly recommend this album to all audiophiles and people who appreciate music that is well-written and executed.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I was hooked on the first book and steamed through it in a day and a half, and just had to get into the second book and did the same with that.  I wanted to finish the series, but felt the last book was fairly predictable.  The writing was intriguing and caught you right away, but I felt like each book lost a bit of it's luster and the last one though ending happily was just one book too many.  Interestingly enough...they might make a movie of this book.  How does one do that?

B000NQRE9Q|3.0|We need more extras, behind the scenes and audio commentaries for these classics!  Raiders of the Lost Ark (and it's called just that \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", not 'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark' - ridiculous marketing idea) is still one of the greatest movies ever made.  Temple of Doom, contrary to the blurb written in the description, is the 2nd best movie of the series.  No, Indy wasn't battling Nazis and he didn't need to.  It followed the same path as the first movie - tribute to the serials of the 1940's, it was a prequel, so it's totally fine that he was with a different girl and had a sidekick, and for the most part, the movie took itself as seriously as the first one did.  It was adventurous and bold and entertaining and had beautiful locations.  The third movie was good and had some great elements to it (like Sean Connery as his father, River Phoenix as young Indy - even with bad hair), but overall the movie became hoakie.  Think about Sala and Marcus.  In the first movie, Sala was the serious and devoted friend.  In Last Crusade, he and Marcus were comic relief, joking around and being silly - way out of character for both.  And most of the action scenes with Indy contained wisecracks for the audience, something that was never done in Raiders.  Think of the truck scene in Raiders and any of the other action scenes - there was a sense of urgency and possible doom if he failed, but in Last Crusade you always knew he would be fine because there was an element of comedy there.  In the first and second movies you are clutching your seat and hoping everything turns out okay.  In Last Crusade, you're watching and laughing, with drink in hand just going along for the ride.  The 4th movie had very few great moments - Lucas, Spielberg and Ford waited for years for just the right script and couldn't do any better?  Bringing Marion back was awesome and Ford was fun to watch.  Even Shia is a good addition as Indy's son, but the plotline, action scenes(Shia swinging with the monkeys?!) and the pacing left much to be desired.  Let's hope the next one is worlds better, is less hoakie and takes itself as seriously as the first did...
0062197258|4.0|[[ASIN:0062197258 Into the Darkest Corner: A Novel]] is the kind of story that has been told many times before.  Catherine Bailey meets a man she thinks is everything she has ever wanted, only to see him devolve into a sadistic controlling monster.  It's nothing new for a heated romance to turn obsessive.  But the way the story is told here is so well done that this book makes for a captivating read.  Be warned that this book contains extreme violence and sexual situations, so reader discretion is advised.<br /><br />It's hard not to be interested in how and why such a seemingly good match turned so sour.  Slowly the author unwinds the facts for us a little at a time, revealing more and more about our characters and why they behave the way they do.  The author never tries to do too much, letting the reader fill in the blanks.<br /><br />The author also employs several often used plot devices with better than average results.  The story is told along two timelines, so that we see both the young woman who begins the relationship and the shell of the woman who is left in its aftermath.  Peppered throughout are vignettes from other times that shed light on our characters.  While many writers try and fail at using a circular timeline, the author succeeds here, starting somewhere in the middle and working around the story concentrically.<br /><br />It is clear by the later timeline that in the aftermath of the relationship our heroine is extremely damaged.  She has developed a very serious OCD with regards to her security, and even the times she drinks tea must be controlled to stem her panic attacks.  While the author only slowly reveals the causes behind it, it is also clear that she is suffering from severe post-traumatic stress.  These ailments are expertly portrayed by the author.  She either has done a great deal of research or she is very familiar with them herself.<br /><br />As the story unwinds, there are several questions that are addressed so subtly that some may feel they were unanswered.  I am still wrestling with re-reading and thinking about this story, to try to understand the meaning behind its conclusion.  But I am astounded that this is the work of a first time author.  Whatever flaws might exist are minor to the point of being negligible.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This is a worthy psychological thriller and I look forward to introducing it to family and friends.  It can be read on so many different levels, and has tons of suspense throughout.  Even when the author reveals something that has happened, she manages to hook the reader into trying to find out how and why.  It kept me interested from start to finish.  I highly recommend it.  Just don't be surprised if after reading it you feel the urge to check the locks on your doors.<br /><br />Enjoy.may feel they were unanswered.

030758836X|2.0|Though I have used Amazon for numerous purchases all have gone well as far as timeliness and quality.  This is my first feedback or review of any of my Amazon transactions.<br /><br />After reading glowing reviews of \\"Gone Girl\\" in several venues I was pleased that the first third or so of the book actually met these statements, and truly exceeded my expectations.  Clear and deep descriptions, flinty, and witty as well.  I was so impressed that I was just about to order Ms Flynn's other two books so there would be no break once I completed Gone.<br /><br />However...I am now at page 248 and sense that the author experienced a direct change of attitude to something very bitter, leaving me at least tired, and insulted. I may be one of those for whom this book is not for, but I don't think so.  Not one main stream review even hinted that this book should have an \\"R\\" (movie equivalent) rating, or maybe I should have read between the lines.  When the dialogue between every character in this story is now laced only with the f-word, 4-5 times per page, and now senseless and vulgar sexual descriptions, I am ready to wave the white flag and move on. And now I find, in these reviews, that the ending stinks as well...what the..?  Enough!<br /><br />The use of constant gross profanity does not show clever, or even superficial character development on the part of the author. Rather it shows an unwillingness to continue to work on a solid story line, or, a clear lack of ability and skill.<br /><br />  I
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Simply put, this book is by far one of the grestest works of modern fantasy i have ever come across!  It truly embodies that feeling of trepidation and hope when you open a purely unkown book for the first time with no utter expectation of what lies within, only to be utterly blown away.  It seems almost a travesty to be forced to wait for the next book in the series.  for any true avid fan of modern fantasy i cannot recomend this book strongly enough!
B007SGM084|1.0|Everyone was talking about these books so I wanted to try them. Yes, they were a bit expensive compared to most Kindle books but 'Best Sellers, I figured they would be worth the price.  This were the worst written soft porn books I have ever read.  No I am not a prude and I enjoy a nicely written sex scene as much as any of you.....but is there any PLOT?  WHY not just put it out there upfront: this is porn, period, not much of a plot, no character creation, and nothing but the sex to hold your interest.  So if you want some soft porn that is more interesting, get some Halequin Romances, they are better written and much more fun to read.

B0071T5PN0|5.0|I don't care what ANYBODY says, David Lee Roth was probably singing and dancing in his mother's womb, because he was BORN TO BE the ultimate rock and roll frontman. I've been praying and waiting for this forever, and the miracle has finally happened! Despite previous problems he is now right back where he belongs, standing next to the ultimate showoff on the guitar, they were made for each other. David struts, jumps, dances, and sings better than anyone else in rock and roll, a totally fun showoff. I think Steven Tyler comes in 2nd and Mick Jagger 3rd, for 4th there are so many others, but possibly Ozzy Osbourne. Given, there were a few good songs with Sammy, but most of the time his vocals sound like he is trying to sing but mostly just SHOUTING, too forced and monotone. With Dave it justs feels totally natural and he has so much more range and flexibility, he doesn't have to TRY to sing, with him it is a natural-born talent, as natural as fries and ketchup!<br /><br />This album is a blast all the way through... just fun, lighthearted, party music, nothing forced or pretentious. Some of the songs are a bit short, so it could maybe use a longer \\"anthem\\" type song, but I ain't complaining, it's just too great to have Dave back in the saddle again, sounding as young as 20 years ago. And he and Eddie, who also sounds awesome, are both getting an equal share of the spotlight, in perfect harmony with each other, so there shouldn't be any arguments. They are going to make so much cashola on this one that I just can't wait for the inevitable next album and maybe a tour! ROCK ON GUYS, so glad the ultimate rock band is reunited!

B007XNAOS0|5.0|It's true. Baroness has changed their sound. There's really not much room to dispute this. If you have listened to their earlier works (including the EPs), you will know that Baroness is not foreign to the concept of change. I've seen some say that they've \\"lost their edge\\". In a manner of speaking, they have. They aren't really anywhere near as heavy as they used to be, both instrumentally and in the usage of Baizley's vocals, (which are now much cleaner sounding when compared to the \\"shouted\\" types of vocals he used to employ). But are these things bad? No, they aren't. Not if you're willing to give them a chance and not immediately say \\"Baroness has sold out\\" just because they are not \\"extreme\\" anymore.<br /><br />As I alluded to earlier, this album is not nearly as heavy as its predecessors, The Red album and the Blue Record. In fact, it actually sounds to be more rockish than metallish. I will admit that, initially, this was off-putting to me because I usually do not venture far outside the realm of metal. But after listening to the album, my fears were put to rest. Despite being different, Baroness managed to still keep their core, signature sound that makes them unique, and after stripping away the layers of metal, they even expanded it some. In this album, they head further into progressive territory than they ever have before, going even beyond the Blue Record in terms of progressiveness. In fact, I feel like this album almost has a 70's progressive rock sort of vibe to it, except that it's merged into a more modern sound. In general, the album just feels like it is a more refined version of the Baroness we have already known and loved. But is the metal completely gone? Thankfully, no. Scattered throughout the albums are parts where Baroness temporarily lets loose and channels out riffs and solos that would sound right at home on their earlier work. These parts are used to great effect, especially on Green opener, \\"Green Theme\\", which displays my favorite part from the album. If you aren't prepared for it, that part could probably scare you to death. (In a good way, I mean).<br /><br />To accommodate their newer, more rockish and more refined sound, Baizley has also worked to refine his vocal delivery. While I cannot call the vocals flawless, they work well with the new material, and in general, I think they sound pretty good. To me, it also carries a sort of \\"classic\\" vibe to it, as well. Songs such as \\"Twinkler\\", \\"Board Up the House\\" and \\"Foolsong\\" are just a few songs on the album that really exemplify how far he has came in terms of vocal abilities. Despite the difference, you really can tell this is the same man from their earlier works because, just as how they have kept their signature sound musically, Baizley has also carried over what made his vocals unique. Given how far he has come, i'm expecting even better things from him in the future.<br /><br />The tracks that personally stand out to me the most? \\"Green Theme\\", (which displays one of the most triumphant moments I have ever heard in music), \\"Board Up the House\\", \\"Eula\\", the fantastic melancholic instrumental interlude \\"Stretchmarker\\" and \\"Sea Lungs\\". Actually, truth be told, I didn't find there to be a bad track on the whole album, and that in itself is an achievement when you consider the sheer size of it. Still, there are a few that I find to be a little lackluster in comparison to the rest, and those are \\"Back Where I Belong\\" and \\"If I forget thee, Low Country\\". Again, those two are not bad songs, but they just seemed lackluster in comparison to all of the other great material on the album. (Fortunately, those two have actually grown on me on later listens).<br /><br />Yellow & Green is at it's best if you can sit down and listen to it as one whole work, but it also works if you just listen to them as separate albums. Why? Some songs, such as \\"Back Where I Belong\\" and \\"Sea Lungs\\" flow directly into each other for great effect. All of the songs are fine to listen to on their own, but things like that really do make it worth your while to listen to this as one whole work.<br /><br />My album of the year thus far. 9.0/10
B0086700CM|5.0|I really loved this game. There is nothing wrong with it so far, and I love how addictive it is.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So I had to read this series because everyone was talking about it....I suggest you have someone just tell you what happens in this book and then just read the second and third one unless you like watching porn! Kinky sex is one thing but this book is a whole other ball game! Really liked the second and third books though. I can deal with their kinky \\"vanilla\\" but THIS was horrible. I was anxious for it to end the whole time I was reading it. I don't understand how they are going to make it into a movie unless it is a porn.

He's especially perfect for people that love to read because that's usually what he writes about: people that love to read.<br />They say you don't have to read his books in order but I recommend reading 'The Angel's Game' before this one.<br />It was slower than his other books, the plot wasn't as intricate but by the end of the book it became apparent that this book was meant to be a kind of interlude between The Angel's Game and the book that I'm guessing/hoping will come after this.<br />Therefore, it's a must read for those who have already read some of his books and for those who haven't - you better read them all!!
B007MAET4O|5.0|I'll leave the music reviews to other customers. It's good. John Mayer is one of the best guitarists alive. So forth.<br /><br />This is a review of the vinyl version of this record--since I usually find myself wondering whether a record comes with a free MP3 download of the songs, I thought I'd pitch in my two cents. My copy arrived today and it is the best vinyl I've purchased yet. It has two records in thick sleeves, the lyrics are inside the fold of the cover, and, best of all: IT CAME WITH A CD.<br /><br />It's $8 to $12 more expensive than most new vinyl records, but because you get two records and a CD (and therefore the ability to make MP3s), you actually get all three versions of every song. You can literally play John Mayer on any device besides a tape player.<br /><br />\\"Born and Raised\\" on vinyl: Buy.
0525478817|2.0|The dialogue is very unnatural and unrealistic.  I found myself thinking over and over again that kids that age just don't use those words or phrases or have discourse of that character.  So in my opinion, the author comes off a bit pedantic and the characters do not seem real, but rather just extensions of the authors intellect and ego.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has become my morning Bible study and reading instrument. It allows me to jump from book to book for reference scripture with ease and I do not lose my train of thought while searching for the reference verse. I still like to take my physical Bible to church just for the warmth of touch it provides me.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|If \\"The Fame\\" introduced Lady Gaga to the pop scene in 2008, then her 2009 EP \\"The Fame Monster\\" solidies her place in the mainstream. Out of all the new pop acts that came out in the late 2000s (Katy Perry, Ke$ha, to name a few), Gaga seems to be the only singer who not only posseses outstanding talent and musical abilities, but is also much more than just her music. She is the definition of fame and knows exactly what her fans both want and expect from her. So, as you can tell from the album cover, \\"The Fame Monster\\" is actually a very different album than its parent \\"The Fame\\". Gaga lets in a darkness not at all present in \\"The Fame\\" as she pulls off a track right from ABBA (Alejandro), gets down and dirty about the dance divas of the 20th century (Dance in the Dark), and describes a man who loves her body and full on controls it...in bed if you don't get the single entendre (Monster). So if you take those darker tracks and mix them with the bright pop/rock of \\"Speechless\\", the hyponotic and alluring \\"So happy I could die\\", and the wonderfully perverse march \\"Teeth\\" and to top the pop confection off, Gaga's best ever single \\"Bad Romance\\", you get this extended play. This counterpart of \\"The Fame\\" manages not only to produce content equal to that of its already outstanding predecessor, but also provides 34 minutes of non stop action that will surely hold you over through years of waiting until Gaga once again produces an collection even more sleek and addivtive than the last. In short, \\"The Fame Monster\\" is what pop SHOULD sound like, not only in its time period, but in any era.

B007EC6FIS|1.0|I love Keane and buy all their stuff as soon as it comes out and I've seen them live a couple of times also.  I listened to Strangeland about 25 times and am sad to report that it's utterly forgettable from start to finish.  Not a single track stands out as great.<br /><br />I don't mean to bash them, or any of you who love this CD.. I'm just saying I didn't connect with it.<br /><br />There are some songs by Keane that almost move me to tears.  \\"When you are alone and afraid, I will come to your aid\\" from Perfect Symmetry's \\"Again and Again\\" comes to mind.. I get chills when that song plays.. Actually, the entire Perfect Symmetry CD is phenomenal, IMHO.<br /><br />A good friend of mine bought Strangeland while he was in Germany and listened to it several times and then emailed me to ask my thoughts.. He agreed with me too.. Maybe I'm the oddball here, but I don't think this is up to par with their other CDs.

0439023513|2.0|**SPOILER REVIEW**<br /><br />Let me start off by telling you the first book was the best. I could not put it down until the end. When I came accross the third book, I wasn't even close to enjoying it. First off, the book was very slow and dissapointing. In my opinion, the ending was HORRIBLE. Katniss, who was best friends with Gale from the start, doesn't even talk to him for the rest of her life. Also, it was quite depressing since she lived in a ruined district with two neighbors which she then ended up to marry one. The only reason I continued reading this book was to figure out what the outcome was.Don't waste your time. Just look it up online.
1400079179|5.0|One of the all time great books.  After reading this I read all of the dan brown books and they are all great.
B000KIPT30|5.0|Behringer doesn't have the best of reputations, but some of their gear does a great job at the price. This is one of them. This gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones. I run a project studio with an Apogee Duet as my interface. I needed this because sometimes I need to monitor something while another person in the room is recording/monitoring a track.<br /><br />My main headphones are Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro, Sennheiser HD 555, Sony MDR-V6, and then I have some others. All of my headphones are comfortably driven by this headphone amp with plenty of gain on tap and I get very good volume, and even at the exact same volume as the input, I find that the sound is improved by using this headphone amp. It's hard to describe, but it just feels a bit fortified and a little bit stronger. I've had a Presonus headphone amp before that cost many times as much as this little Behringer headphone amp and the sound was no better.<br /><br />The volume pots are very smooth and there is no noise that I can hear that is introduced by this amp. Make sure you use a quality sound source because this will faithfully amplify anything that goes in. For instance, if I run a cable from my iMac's built-in headphone output to this amp and turn up the volume, I can hear a little buzz and random digital sounds, but that's not the amp, it's the source. Running the output from my Apogee Duet, the sound is very clean and strong.<br /><br />There are some annoying things about this amp. Obviously the external power supply is annoying, there's no on-off switch, and it's light enough that when everything is plugged in, it doesn't want to stay in place. However, that's nothing that Velcro tape on the desk can't fix, and the rest of the problems are stuff you have to live with when you get something that does so much for less than the price of a decent pair of headphones.
034580404X|1.0|Where to begin?<br />First, this was some of the worst writing I have ever had the displeasure of forcing on my brain. I felt it was written for an adult with a sixth grade reading level, at best.<br />Second, I am at a loss as to why so many ladies told me to read this so that I could learn something new in the bedroom. \\"Oh, it will teach you things...give you new ideas...\\" they swore.<br />Disgusting is all I have to say to that.<br />None of it was new or exciting information. Frankly, I couldn't past the reasons the main male character was they way he was. I couldn't put him in the role of sex god....he was a victim. If the character were a woman, having gone through what he went through, I doubt the female population would think this so erotic and informative. Aren't most women down on further sexualizing vicitms of molestation and rape? Oh, only when the victims are women. If it is a sexy man then it is cool. Or so I am starting to think given the reaction of so many American women. Gosh, if he hadn't been groomed and molested he might not have been the sexy male character he was. Ew.<br />The first book and part of the second were so emotionally draining to read. I will only say this much in semi-praise: It has been a while since a book has moved me to feel such strong feelings. However, it was pure depression and despair.<br />The second book was less draining to read, but not any better.<br />There is a small section in the final book that has no sex and that is the best part yet. And just when you think, hey this might end differenlty than you'd expect...it doesn't. So pathetically generic. I felt like this author took the Twilight series and the movie Cruel Intentions (or the book that suggested the movie, I'm not sure, as I have never read it) and with absolutely no original ideas of her own wrote these books.<br />I would like to add that I am no prude, so very far from it truth be told, and I found all the sex in this series to be tasteless and pointless. Most of it was irrelevant to the story. I stopped reading the sex scenes after the first book, skimming just to make sure I wouldn't miss something that might be important to the characters. I didn't miss much, I'm sure.<br />The sad thing is that I think this could have been a good book, with much better writing and less frivolous sex. I also think it is sad that this male character is sexualized so, given the history. It is actually more sickening than saddening.<br />It was three days of my life I will never get back.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I have read all three of the series and find them deteriorating in quality as the grey becomes less grey and more happy ending.
0307592731|5.0|I really enjoyed this book very much. It made want to walk the PCT myself. I wish I had the guts and the opportunity to do it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I picked it up to see what all the fuss was about. The writing is okay. It's meant to keep you reading. There are parts that are so disturbing I had to convince myself to finish the book. I am glad I did because in the end, it's not as disturbing as the author would have you believe it's going to be by about halfway through the book. If you want to see what the buzz is about, read it, but I certainly didn't find myself compelled to read (or buy) all three. In short, it's racey, somewhat fun, stimulates the reader, but I'd give it 2.5 - 3 stars in comparison to other recent reads. My suggestion is to get the first one and not commit to all three at once (the bundled price).
0312944926|4.0|After reading Da Vinci code I wanted to check out the other books written by Dan Brown and honestly this one is probably my favorite.

B0063IH60K|2.0|I used to love this game and did not mind the occasional ads but lately it has become ridiculous! Way too many ads to make it enjoyable. I finally gave up and deleted it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Compared to this book Twilight is like a work of genius. If a 13 year old wrote this book, I would understand, but I am pretty sure she's not 13. What really scares me is the amount of people who really like this book. It makes me really scared for the human race. The main character has no personality or self respect whatsoever, and apparently that is ok? I guess I just don't get this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is an awesome.game that i love to play i play it more than my other apps awesome game
B004H4XLRE|3.0|My boys ages 3 & 5 like this. My son got this for a birthday gift last year and he enjoys playing with it so we purchased it for a birthday gift for his friend. It's a fun concept, however, you do need to buy \\"special\\" cars for it (of course), it does come with 1 car and we didn't end of getting the additional cars; my son just uses the regular cars his has. They are not as light as the recommended cars but they still work. It's built nice and seems sturdy. It doesn't work well on carpet so you really need to play with it outside or on hard wood floors. The nice thing about it though is it will hold the cars for you so it kind of doubles as a carry case. Overall this is a fun toy but doesn't keep their interest more than about 15-20 minutes.
B0086700CM|5.0|Beware! This game is very addicting.<br />I can play this game for hours and hours without even knowing it.  My kids love it too.
B0084HJE0S|5.0|What is HTML5 and what is the outlook for JavaScript?<br /><br />Those are the questions answered in this articulate and informative article.  If you would like some background about the essence of HTML5 and JavaScript and why they have resonated so well among Web technologists, then seek a quiet corner with this article.  The read will illuminate the context of your work and for non-techies, you will appreciate the enthusiasm for Web applications over desktop apps.  Web Workers, Web Sockets, Web Intents, Shadow DOM and more features are introduced through good writing that was a joy to read.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I thought the game was great. the storyline was interesting, the puzzles were challenging the only issue I have was the room in the basement of that big house was a little too dark to see the items.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|What's not to like? The lines are fun, the cast is great, and the story is well-developed. Overall its a really well-done, fun show!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book was better for me because it had a little mystrey and suspense. It was a very quick read and I couldn't wait to read the third book. Ms. James did not disappoint!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun,  silly games you don't have to think about too much. It is relatively easy to get enough points to continue unlocking games. Although I do agree that the controls can be clunky and slow,  whatever! It makes games more challenging.
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|One of my wonderful yoga teachers plays this in class sometimes and I just love it.  All of the songs are so beautiful.  I highly recommend this to anyone that does yoga or even those that don't do yoga.  I love playing it in the car.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|Rather than spend time reiterating all of the wonderful things the other 5 star reviews have said about this pack, I wanted to add that its great for carrying other camera equipment besides DSLRs.  I currently have mine stocked to the max with 2 Go-Pro cameras with all of their accessories (sticky pads, 4 different mounts, assorted cases and different sized back doors, etc.).  I even had enough room to also carry my point-and-shoot digital camera and Sony HDR-TG1 Handycam along with their accessories (chargers, extra batteries, etc.) and my Wolverine PicPac II backup device along with its charger and data cable.  This bag holds every piece of camera equipment and all of their accessories that I own.  Its absolutely perfect.
B0063GORYU|4.0|stable and fun. no complaints at all. good way to waste a few minutes and it looks and plays like the desktop version.
B00846F1YW|4.0|great!  keeps your interest w/o being hard.  as far as the problems mentioned in other reveiws ...<br />u can x out on facebook prompt &amp;  can also turn timer off.<br />it took about 3 days to make it through the game.  l would buy another game from this company.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Get a thesaurus! I can't express how much this author needs variety in her words. How was this published as written?!<br /><br />A grown woman who hasn't used a computer? A college grad who hasn't been drunk????<br /><br />The inner goddess character is much more entertaining than Anastasia.
B00846F1YW|1.0|This is so repetitive it drags on.  You find things in a scene, then finish it.  Next the story goes on a bit and then you go back to the same scene and find different things.  Sometimes you have to do this 3x!<br /><br />The story is bad at first, but does get a little better.  Still it's like a 6th grade story.<br /><br />You can pinch to enlarge, but when you do 1/3 of your screen is hidden behind the list on the left.  Only good for use when you're looking for groups of things, like to find all the keys.<br /><br />This asks you to post it on facebook or twitter when you get a trophy.  It looks like you have to, as other reviewers have said, but you don't. Just click the X in the upper right of that box to continue on.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. Worthless in my opinion.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first I didn't think I would like this game but its amazing I love to play this game in the morning when I'm bored or even before I go to bed
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I loved the suspense, and while reading this book, every night I would just stay awake thinking about it. I'm 13 and a lot of kids my age are avid readers. Me? Not as much as I used to be. But James Dashner has fired up my passion to stay up all night and read books! (Especially his'). I don't think I would change anything about the Scorch Trials. It's just such an original and unique story--it still boggles me! The only thing that got me reaaally annoyed/angry is Jorge's character. Did anyone else find it annoying how he'd always add &#34;hermano, amigo, etc.&#34; to the end of his sentences?!!? OK. I am also hispanic and I know NO ONE who talks like that. Seriously??? My mom sometimes does it when she's surprised or something but it's really really weird. Well I'm not that offended anyway but if you do get touchy at that stuff  i wouldn't recommend this beause it's constant haha. But overall GREAT BOOK!

B0070NSPCU|5.0|When I read the reviews for this book by Anthony Ryan I was intrigued. I am still working on the Wheel Of Time series but my devotion is waning. I felt I needed something else. That something else is Blood Song.<br /><br />I downloaded Blood Song several days ago. I was immediately engrossed. This author has revived a lust for reading I have not felt in years. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down.<br /><br />This author gets to the point. The story flows quickly without an abundance of pointless filler and fluff. His writing style is interesting yet comes together so well. Fight scenes don't drag on forever.<br /><br />Mr. Ryan, if you read the reviews.....Thank you. It is the best book I have read in a very long time. You are only charging $2.99. Are you insane? You are much better than $2.99. If your next book is half as good as this one, quit your day job, and start charging like a real author.
B00867HDTA|2.0|it is an ok game but it kind of is the worst game I have ever played xD so don't waste two dollars just wait for it to be the free app of the day.  : (
B0076303RY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  It really grabs and keeps your attention.  The quality of the video is great, and it is so easy to stream.
B00001QEG5|4.0|Was this the last TS album? If so, it's pretty neat. It stands up strong to today's mediocre and somewhat prolix junk and the best part about it is you can actually understand what lead singer Dee Snider is singing about. No growling, yelling, howling, or even cursing here, just pure singing, and my favorite track is 'Hot Love'. No bull. One good album.
B000Y0S7OC|5.0|Super awesome episode, I had no idea how SG1 was gonna beat this one. It was kinda crazy that they solved the whole episode crisis in just 5 minutes at the end though. None the less, the situation looked pretty hopeless!

B005KR6OBM|5.0|This show is hilarious. I have watched every single one over and over and over again & still find funny things I didn't catch the first time. You also learn a lot.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|Very good though not long after reading it I realized that nothing at all was said about Jake E Lee, Rhodes's replacement. You gotta admire Ozzy for not digging up the past and flinging any dirt. Overall, it's humungously horrid what this man went through with all those s*** jobs but thankfully he quit the car horn dead end trap, may we all be so strong. Finally, one of metal's greatest stories is told. Rock on, Ozzy!
B0088X7YU0|5.0|As a public affairs representative from the Federation, I approve this movie. Do not be dissuaded by the trailer. The movie is top notch. The director really does a good job of reinforcing that the only good bug is a dead bug!
B0055SWM08|5.0|A great puzzle/maze game. Well designed and fun to play!<br />Worth every minute I spent playing. Now I want more levels.&quot;
B006PAZMMK|3.0|Alright, I'm familiar with all of his work and I must say that I was slightly disappointed  by this. It's not at all a bad album, but when you compare it to some of his earlier works that's pretty must perfection, this doesn't shine as much.<br />here's a brief description (I don't own the bonus track)<br /><br />1. Right In : One of the best songs here. It reminds me of Rock in roll from Scary Monsters EP but still holds up.<br />2. Bangarang (Feat. Sirah): One of the more popular songs from this cd. I don't really like it that much. Sounds too much like Right In but not bad.<br />3. Breakn' A Sweat : A strange song here. It has guest vocals in it again but it isn't bad.<br />4.The Devil's Den : Don't care for this one at all. Kind of generic and repetitive<br />5. Right On Time : This song had a good beat but was WAY too repetitive. The last 15 seconds of this song sounds awesome but it doesn't save this from being the weakest song on the cd<br />6. Kyoto (Feat. Sirah): Now this is a really good one. The rapping section is dumb but the musical parts make up for it. To sum it up it's kind of sounds like \\"Right In\\" but harder and with a unnecessarily rapping section<br />7.Summit (Feat. Ellie Goulding): This one is a little strange too. It's really calm but repetitive too. People that don't like Skrillex's typical sound might like this.<br /><br />OVERALL: If you are new to his music you might like this because it has a more mainstream feel too it. However if you want to see Skrillex's true talent, start with \\"My Name Is Skrillex EP\\" and work you're way up to \\"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\\"
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I was looking for a new series to read and found thus recommended on a few websites. Despite the 1000+ pages and the slow buildup, this book was excellent. He really had a way of making you care about the characters and there's a huge payoff at the end.  Can't wait for the next book!
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|Great CD! They could have added a few more songs to the CD that were awesome on the show, but hopefully they're coming out with another CD for season 3. It was shipped and delivered on time and right to my mailbox.
1609611543|4.0|I just read  Dr. Davis's book Wheat Belly, and I have to admit, after I read the first few chapters, I had to confess,  I was depressed, but I saw a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />I am  53 years old,  Type 2 Diabetic,  on meds for high blood sugar, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, well on my way to my first heart attack.  I have tried diets in the past, but I would soon go off them, and over the last 20 years, my weight has zig-zagged it's way up to 250lb.  My problem has always been this huge appetite, as I am always hungry, and even though I know my weight was literally killing me, I felt hopeless. I talked to some other type II diabetics and the next stop for me was injecting insulin if my A1C did not come down.  I have tried the suggested low fat diet, but was hungry constantly, and I couldn't get the weight down at all.<br /><br />After reading Wheat Belly,  I started on removing wheat from my diet. Within days, my blood sugar plummeted down to normal values (I had to drop the glyburide,as I was becoming hypoglycemic - still taking the metformin for now) with a slight elevation in the morning.  I have been eliminating wheat for the most part for just over a week now. and my weight has dropped 3 pounds, to 247.<br /><br />I do think Dr. Davis is on to something here. One thing I didn't mention was I experience joint pain in my fingers and sore feet.  I thought it was the onset of arthritis, but I have noticed an improvement here in just over a week.  And I am experiencing the wheat withdrawal by being a little scatter-brained for the past week, in a sort of mental fog at times, but this is getting better as well.<br /><br />I can't wait for the cookbook. Part of my problem is I travel in my job and have to eat out all the time. Now the trick is keeping away from the wheat while I am on the road.  I will keep you posted on my journey to eliminate my wheat belly.
0345803507|2.0|But Ms. James has created a imperfect \\"perfect\\" man.  Mr. Grey will appeal and touch on every female emotion.  He is male model beautiful.  He is Sexy.  He is wealthy with a capital W.  He is sensual.  He is generous with his money.  And the big one, he is broken.  Women's instinct to nurture, mother, protect and \\"fix\\" a man will be front and center here.  Not saying it's right and not saying it's ALL women, but let's face it:  it's a huge percentage.  This is why the trilogy has succeeded and Ms. James is a millionaire.  Although not a great book, she's written a story that most women will eat up lustily. Hmm... kinda like Mr. Grey.

0893860220|5.0|With the exception of A Course in Miracles, this is the one book that addresses it all, succinctly, lucidly, often poetically, without an agenda of any kind (of course, because Nisargadatta has no ego to distort his teachings). I've used it for years by simply opening it \\"at random\\" to drink from its precious well of wisdom. If you seek the truth of your reality, look no farther. If you find, however, that you don't resonate with this book, then give it a few more years, keep walking your path, and try it again. Yes, it's that good.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games was recommended by my teenage grandson, so I read them, enjoyed them, and then mailed the set to him.  He was really surprised and excited to get them. Great way to keep up with the younger generation and share their world and what their being exposed to today. I received the books in great condition and in good time. Thanks for asking, Marie
0439023513|1.0|I agree with most of the reviewers who gave only 1 star to this book. Besides the disappointment for this book, I also feel very disappointed about Katniss as a person, after reading this book. She just does not possess any of the good quality that we find in her from the first book.<br />Meanwhile, I also think these three books (Hunger Games) are not sutiable for the young generation! It's a mistake that Scholastic promotes them as a reading for teens. These books are too dark and depressing, and they don't provide a good guidance for the young generation to follow. If you are a parent, you should encourage your children NOT to read these books.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This set has all theatrical versions and the versions of directors' cuts from all 4 movies in the series.  The quality of the fist and second one impressed me the most since there seems to be a lot more light and obviously more details.  It is not blue-ray, but I don't care.  Love it.  Great price!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was very intriguing I loved the book when I was finished with one I was running to buy the next book it's so nice having a kindle because I didn't have to leave my house to get it!!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I use this app on a regular basis. I live in Florida where certain times of the year you can usually expect rain at some point in the day.  This app helps me plan my day by knowing the hours that are most likely  best spent indoors.  I love the radar map option - it is quick and accurate. It allows me to see if a storm is heading my way. Best of all it allows me to see if the storm is a small or large one. This way I can decide to wait it out.  I hate running in the rain only to get to my car and realize had I waited 2 more minutes and the rain would have ended!.<br />By the way - I like the storm NOTIFICATION function - I've been caught off guard by a few really nasty storms and was alerted by this App.  I was able to call my kids and let them know about the comming storm and to power down any valuable electronic they were using.<br /><br />I had an issue with the App after my phone updated to a new version - emailed the developer and literally within 20 minutes Iwas sent and email with a solution. The help was quick and acurate - and now I have my favorite Weather App back in service again!  Thanks again to you, Sergey!!<br /><br />Keep up the great work - this is an easy to use and very practical application.<br />Well worth the $2.99 - I've paid for cups of coffee that cost more and delivered less satisfaction :)
B0087YYHZU|1.0|Gene Kelly, obviously, had his heavy hand in this. He does not understand `how' to get an honest performance out of actors. The performances in this film are `result oriented' performances. They are characterizations of the characters they are playing. They are overblown, silent screen film acting (of the worst kind) in a talking film.<br /><br />When not speaking of the `musical' numbers in this film and, just comparing the height of sophistication of the silent era's numerous highend films like `City Girl', `Lucky Star', `Birth of a Nation', `Underworld', `Docks of New York' (just to name a few), `Singin in the Rain' reaches a level below Vaudeville, below Burlesque, and even (gulp!) below television.<br /><br />All the `expert' reviewers, especially Ebert, rave about how this film just towers above the rest of the `musicals' because, \\"unlike the rest of them, it did not come from the stage but is it's own original production\\"... what snobbery!<br /><br />No one will EVER convince me that `Singin' can even hold the bootlaces of great musicals like: Oklahoma, Sound of Music, The Music Man, South Pacific, Pajama Game etc<br /><br />As far as `musicals' NOT done on stage but written specifically for the screen that blow `Singin' out of the water with sophistication and subtlety, I would put forth: Pete's Dragon, Mary Poppins, Victor Victoria, The Court Jester, A Song is Born, The Inspector General, New York New York, White Christmas even, though it's a stretch, The Wizard of Oz etc<br /><br />Debby Reynolds performance is unconvincing and plodding, Jean Hagen (check out ONE of her SUPERIOR performances in Asphalt Jungle) is way over-the-top. If you want to see a sophisticated performance by a REAL babe using that kind of voice then watch Barbara Nichols in `The Sweet Smell of Success' or Lesley Ann Warren in `Victor Victoria'. I know Jean Hagen was `encouraged' to over blow this stereotype character and, in my opinion, she reached new performance lows. She is NOT funny, she is not subtle, she is only obnoxious but, in all fairness, it's not her fault, it's the fault of the director Gene `The Tyrant' Kelly - I really don't think Stanley Donen had much input and Mr. Donen's \\"Pajama Game\\" showed the superior subtlety, sans Kelly, and his ability to get `real' performances out of actors.<br /><br />It's the Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor show and that's about it. The opening sequence montage where Gene Kelly looks back fondly at the start of his and O'Connors careers at the first screening of his new silent film shows that he and O'Connor are great dancers. We, the audience, already knew this. Their quick skits show massive physicality but no subtlety of class. Compare this inferior tediousness to the wonderfully understated sophistication of the dance montage of the upcoming song'n dance team of Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby in `White Christmas'. `Singin' doesn't even come close.<br /><br />The recycled MGM musical songs from the 1930's are uninspiring and dull, just like most of MGM's musical pictures of `the day'. They treat the audience like we're stupid enough the buy into the ridiculousness of the obvious-as-hell STUDIO SET that opens `Singin' rather than let the film breathe a proper realistic breath and film it on location.<br /><br />`Singin' is dumbed-down tediousness and it insults my intelligence to watch it and I will never EVER watch it again - it makes my skin crawl.<br /><br />Of course, most of the other beings on the planet will disagree and certainly flame this review as blasphemy but my signoff to those who are going to, is:<br />I NEVER look at my reviews once I've posted them so, your efforts are wasted trying to refute an honest opinion.<br /><br />I don't try to understand the `fans' of this film, I'm just glad that I'm not one of you and that I can see through the artifice - I do NOT watch television. I ONLY watch and collect films.<br /><br />Finally, the real funny thing about this film is, it is NOT funny... at all.<br /><br />OvUr'n Out

B004TSXUWY|4.0|The issue involved is very interesting. Still,I think that it was a bit difficult to follow the two main men characters - especially the man who assumed the role of the husband. Also the role of the psychiatrist was not pursued to the end.<br />But on the whole a very interesting subject because it puts you to think about memory/consciousness, the important role it plays in our existence.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|a good little brain bender for any time when I want a quick little something to do. fun to challenge friends with as well
1611133866|5.0|A work of madcap genius.  I first read DFW's magnum opus the year it was published.  This second time around was even better.  However, for me, the ending is depressing: no resolution, no defense to the lurking dangers that entrap us whether we recognize them or not.  I think DFW must have felt there was no way out of the trap of addiction, paranoia and consequent depression.  Holding on to platitudinous beliefs is not enough for the penetrating mind.  Is suicide the right, or a worthy, response?  One hopes there is a way out, other than drug induced dream or death, of the overturned cup (bell jar), creeping paranoia, and depression.  Love?<br />Infinite Jest is the entertainment that is a continuous loop which will kill you.<br />[[ASIN:B007TAF1JY MONSTERS OF THE MIDWAY: 1969 - Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n Roll, and Football]]

One book would have been absolutely enough.No literary merits - a real sex manual. Oh my! The plots to make these books a bit more interesting very strange.<br />People are of course drawn to the unending, repetitive sex scenes - over and over again: he groans, she moans---- good Lord how often can your support reading this?<br />And then - at the end of the book - the author THANKS YOU for reading the book. Really! (She should!)

0345803485|1.0|Jeremy Clarkson, Michael Jackson circa 1999, the football coach from Glee, Jabba the Hut, these are just a few things that are sexier than this book.<br /><br />Okay, I'm not afraid to state from the start I'm a reader of Fetish fiction. I had started seeing magazine articles about this new BDSM book that was sweeping the nation and boosting handcuff sales tenfold. I decided to try the book after skimming through a few pages in store and deciding to make up my own mind about it.<br /><br />Well it looked like the page I read (the contract terms and conditions) was probably about as racy as it got. Whilst reading it and getting increasingly angry with Anastasia and wanting to slap her myself every time she said Oh my I thought I must have been the only one who didn't get it but since completing the book I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who felt the language was repetitive, juvenile \\"he's my very own Christian Grey-flavoured popsicle\\" and lacking any redeeming characters (or plot for that matter). As far as the sex scenes go there was certainly nothing shocking about them apart from how cringe worthy it was. As it was I ended up skimming over them as there was nothing exciting about them and had about as much non-naming of genitalia apart from \\"down there\\" as I could take. I didn't like the way Christian Grey was marketed as this mysterious man with a dark past but was soon turning into a conventional character thanks to Ana's wishes at moulding him into a \\"normal\\" boyfriend. Also surely there must have been other ways to convey Ana's naivety than making her as clueless about technology as she was about love. Also what makes her so dazzlingly beautiful that her all her male friends want a piece of her too.<br /><br />This is not a book to be taken seriously, it is quite a good piece of comedy and how not to behave in relationships (indeed I had a friend who was a bit too much Anastasia for my liking) but if you're looking for erotica stick with Nexus or Black Lace.<br /><br />Actually I must be into S&M, I've gone back for 50 shades darker.
0307956350|2.0|The title sounded like something I could identify with, the locales were familiar thanks to business travel; so I picked up this book to see if the story would do justice.  It did not.<br /><br />The story is constructed from one of those patterns where everyone spends boundless energies conniving everyone else, and nothing seems to be what it appears to be.  Many times this works, but not in this particular case.  The two protagonists are not fleshed out in enough details to allow me to care what happens to them.  One is a CIA operator (I am not giving anything away, you will read this much in the first few pages of the book) and the other is a low-key computer security expert who uses the oldest trick in the computer security handbook for personal gains.  (The oldest trick I am referring to, for those who are interested, is the man-in-the-middle attack.)  But wait, personal gain was not the motive, something else was, and the CIA wife, well, she never told the security expert husband that she was a spook, and the husband forgot to tell her that he, well ... you'll figure it out.<br /><br />I did finish the book, but I must admit that at times I wish I had a man-in-the-middle who would read the book to me instead of me reading it myself.  But wait, ..., will that be a replay attack or a MiTM attack? (June 2012)

B008B3H4VQ|4.0|Living Things is Linkin Park's fifth studio album, and in my eyes represents a perfect butterfly transformed from Hybrid Theory's and Meteora's caterpillar. Their sound has continued to grow and change, almost organically over the last five years, since 2007's Minutes to Midnight. Like a godsend, this album delivered Roads Untraveled, a song that has helped me put into perspective some deep personal issues. Other standouts are the short but heavy-handed Victimized, the catchy Lost in the Echo and Until it Breaks.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|My grandkids just love this pool. It arrived on time, easy to assemble. They<br />are really enjoying this gift for the hot summer months.
B007MU85D0|5.0|So I just wanted to say that this is an album I just love listening to. It doesn't matter if I'm driving and want to speed along to a song or if I'm just in a funk and want to listen to something mellow. This album covers a wide spectrum for me and I feel like this was one of the best purchases I've made so far this year. I want to thank Amazon for giving me MP3 credits and for the reviewer who said every song was a single, because they pretty much are.<br /><br />Buy this album, you won't regret it if you like good music.

I would have paid triple that.<br /><br />Pull the trigger, you won't regret it.
0345803485|5.0|I read a review on this book earlier this year and decided I had to read it. Once it became the talk of the town, that pushed me to read it even more. The author of the book does a fantastic job of describing everything in the book from the characters personalities, to their interactions, and the scenes around them. The chemistry between the main characters is so hot and cold that it keeps you intrigued. To me, the best part about the book is what Christian says and does before and after he has his way with Ana. The foreplay is an amazing build up to what's to come. Great book!
B003O86FMW|4.0|you just can't believe the twist of them going back into that world... an incredible and totally screwed up turn of events! what drama that you can't miss out on!

B002VX0A40|5.0|This is a great toy. My 7 month old baby loves to chew on the dragon's tail. Great colors and perfect to hold babies attention for at least a little bit. I am also a big fan of a dragon, something besides a monkey!
1439102732|1.0|I actually had to go back and make sure that this what the same author I thought it was.  It started out pretty good, but it sure didn't stay that way!  I believe in everyone's right to make choices about their own lives, but this is just awful!  It's shove-it-down-your-throat preachy and makes me feel like heterosexual couples have no rights - they all belong to gay couples.  It's probably going to take a long time before I read another of her novels.  Yeesh!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is so well written i decided not to sleep the first night having work the next day and finished it in a 24hr period. the characters and story line are so enticing you just can't drop it for one second. love, action, suspense, family... it's just plain and simply amazing
0345803485|2.0|I read this book because I was curious to know why it is so popular among female readers. Having read it, I am a bit unclear about the attraction. I skipped most of the email exchanges in the book. Not too impressed by the writing style.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I actually enjoyed the movie overall, except for the parts when Gerard Butler opened his mouth. Until he was unmasked and then he could sing all of the sudden. I would have hoped for much more with better casting and stronger singers. I loved Ciaran Hinds and Simon Callow, they were superb.<br /><br />Amusing, but not great.
B007R6X9IK|4.0|Everytime a new Depeche Mode or Dave Gahan album releases I feel that wonderful feeling like good times are here. I wont compare this album to Dave's previous 2 solo releases since this one is a collaboration with soulsavers (a group i've never heard from before) however rest assured you'll feel right at home if your a fan of DM or Dave Gahan.<br /><br />Dave's powerful voice is as good as its ever been, that soul uplifting effect is in full swing here. My favorite tracks are In the morning, Longest day, Presence of God, Take, and Dave saves arguably the best one for last, Tonight.<br /><br />Thank you Mr Gahan for this wonderful gift :)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is quite the book for females to feel empowered by. the heroine goes through a heck of a lot to be where she is. at each book as you feel you know what's about to happen, something says \\"nope, change of direction!\\". the series was very well written although the last book was a much harder read than the first two. one of the best series yet!
B006RUJST6|5.0|Amazing!! So so good. So very very good. One of my favorites this year. I loved this book and was completely sucked into it. I loved the chemistry between Will and Lake. The slam poetry and the Avett Brothers quotes took the story to a whole new level. The secondary characters were wonderful. It's heartwarming, heartbreaking, raw, and exciting. There was so much going on I didn't want to put it down. Thank you Colleen Hoover!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Hot album!  Love the dance club songs, but the slower ballads such as Broken English, Outlaws of Love and Nirvana showcase Lambert's powerful, but controlled and beautiful, voice which evokes deep emotions.  Favorite track:  Runnin'

B007IXWL2C|3.0|So it was predicatble... so what? There can't be 1 woman that read all 3 books that doesn't want aman like Christian Grey at least 90% way through... it's every woman's fantasies combined into one man for all the good and the bad but in the long run and for what really counts just so much good. Not the best writing and story line in the world i'll admit but definitely worth reading if you're a romance junkie like myself
B004RC8NXI|4.0|The no strings attache two disc blu-ray dvd was shipped on time. The item was a xmas present for my daughter.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" first and glossed through some of the rougher sexual encounters, only because I'm NOT one who enjoys pain and found \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" NOT well written, drawn out and repetitious! Although a few days after finishing, I found myself wanting to learn what happened to CHRISTIAN GREY and ANASTASIA STEELE, so perhaps this book was a bit better then I originally thought.<br /><br /> I then downloaded \\"FIFTY SHADES DARKER: BOOK TWO OF THE FIFTY SHADES TRILOGY\\" to my KINDLE which I am currently ENJOYING VERY MUCH!  This book is much more INTERESTING, because it has more depth as it covers reasons for Christian Grey's Sexual Devient Aberrations and why his great need to Dominate Submissive Women!<br /><br />I only wish that I had a more vivid imagination where I could visualize more accurately all those VANILLA sexual encounters, as they sound much more intriguing when one reads about it, which really is backwards.  Perhaps after the third book I will become an expert and teach my gentleman friends to be more artful and inventive lovers like CHRISTIAN GREY, but only in his vanilla creative approach, and for that I have to give credit to his AUTHOR, E L JAMES!  ;-))

B007NESBK2|4.0|I attended the Sade concert and wanted to have the DVD as well. I actually ordered both the DVD and the Bluray. The Bluray quality is obviously much better, however the DVD edition comes with an audio CD as well.<br /><br />To me it seems concert DVD's do not do justice to the concert. They do not convey the feeling of being in the concert. That said the sound is of very good quality and I would still would have bought the DVD.
B000FVNX2Q|3.0|Decent calculator, however the keys don't feel nearly as solid as the old 12C.  However, it is much faster... much faster than the old 12c, and quite a bit faster than the first 12C Platinum (awful).<br /><br />That being said, this calculator does not even come close to the HP 17BII calculators from the 1980s... or, the 17BII+ calculators.  Yes, it is a little smaller... but not much.<br /><br />For ease of use, my first recommendation would be a 17 BII from the 1980s, then a 17BII+ Silver.  Frankly, if given a choice I'd take a 17BII+ gold or a 10B (old style only.. not the 10BII).<br /><br />I have three 12C's, 3 17BII+ golds, 4 17BIIs, and one 14B.  If I had to pick one, it would be the old 17 BII... the 12C would be last.  By the way, the 17 BII and Bii+ can be switched to RPN.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT TO FEEL THE DIFFERENCE, FIND SOMEONE WITH A 10B, 14B, or 17BII (all older  models).  They are built like tanks, and I am still using one from 20+ years ago.  The old 12c are tanks too.  IMHO the old 17 BII is a clear winner.  The only consideration, would be if cash flows are needed.... then, the 17BII+ silver would be a good choice.<br /><br />I know this is likely to offend 12c \\"old schoolers\\", but I am 52, and the 12c simply doesn't compare.  The comparison reminds me of Conners, Borg and McEnroe playing tennis in the late 70s/early 80s.  All of them said wood or steel rackets were better, and that graphite was for less skilled players... until they started getting destroyed.  THE 12C IN ANY VERSION IS NOT NEAR THE CALCULATOR OF THE 17b VARIANTS.<br /><br />One last comment... why the huge cases (all HP models).... More protection maybe, but they are simply too large.

Part II grabbed me immediately and I thought \\"this is going to be a great story!\\"  Even as I began Part III, my interest was piqued and I literally couldn't put the book down.  As I read the last chapter, I was still hopeful for final resolution.  When I read the last page, my first thought was the author must have put the manuscript down near the end and let someone else finish it.  It was a total and complete let down. I'm sorry I wasted my time reading it.
0345529057|5.0|I am very pleased with this item. It is remarkably cheap and in the same time very trilling to have. I can't wait to start reading them.<br />There were no problems with shipping, it even came before the estimated deadline.
1433293498|4.0|Not so much a novel as a collection of interrelated short stories arranged so as to form a somewhat cohesive narrative, The Martian Chronicles (as Ray Bradbury says) also isn't so much science fiction as fantasy set on Mars but with a clear allegorical-thematic connection to real-life, present-day issues.  Most of the stories are quite good, such as \\"Usher II\\" which anticipates Fahrenheit 451 with a story of censorship and resistance to totalitarian bureaucracy, as is the book taken as a whole.<br /><br />The one major issue that is a little hard to swallow, even on the books own terms, is why practically all the human settlers of Mars, many of whom left Earth precisely to escape the threat of war, would return to Earth as soon as war actually breaks out.  Bradbury sort of attempts to explain this, but doesn't really succeed.<br /><br />Still, the Martian Chronicles is a classic of fantastic literature, a virtuoso display of Bradbury's talents, and well worth reading.  If you've yet to experience it, get it now!
0307730697|5.0|FEARLESS is typically a book you would find men reading.  For some reason, I am drawn to stories of men who have sacrificed their lives or given their service for our country through the military.  This is Adam Brown's life story, from Hot Springs, Arkansas, and it has touched my heart in a million different ways. He was proud to be from the state of Arkansas, which you will see as you read through the book.<br /><br />As it states in the book, Adam was born three minutes after his twin sister, Manda, and it was the last time she beat him at anything.  She came out crying; he came out quiet, looking around.  From an early age, he pulled off dare-devil feats that would keep his mother on pins and needles.  Pain was something that didn't bother him.  What mattered to him was helping others, doing the right thing, not letting pain hold him back, and standing up for the underdog, all with deep, heartfelt compassion.<br /><br />Adam's shenanigans throughout this high school years made you wonder if he'd live to graduate.  But he did.  When his three best buddies went off to college, Adam seemed to lose his sense of purpose.  He got into the wrong crowd and did what he never thought he'd ever do-street drugs, which led to jail time.  This went on for some years, until he met his sweetheart, Kelley, whom he married, had a son and eventually a daughter, and was guided into the service.  How he got into the service is a story in itself!<br /><br />Eric does a spectacular job of describing the man, Adam, with all his quirkiness, fun-loving personality, dedication, failures, achievements, faith, deep compassion, and his deep love for his wife and children, as well as his dedication to the men he served with and the country he served.  Even through his extensive training as a Navy SEAL (and no, I do not remember all the titles), you will find him standing out partly due to his quirky behaviors, but also because of his overcoming achievements and bravery.  Never have I `met' a man with the caliber of commitment to his country, fellow servicemen and family.<br /><br />Your emotions will ride high and low as Adam's life takes on the highs and lows of achievement and disappointment.  This is a book of reality, and there are some crushing moments.  You will find yourself rooting for Adam, but also taking stock of the steadfastness of his wife.  Military wives are one of a kind and are to be commended for their own bravery while their husbands are gone on duty and encouraging them throughout.  What would bring Adam and Kelley through all the struggles and deployments was their deep faith in the Lord.  God worked many wonders through their lives.<br /><br />The combat missions are told in such a fashion that you are going through the elements and conditions along with the men.  Their tenacity and endurance make me proud to know we have men who are willing to fight for our safety at the cost of their lives if necessary.  The select mission at the end will bring it full circle, though the missions have not ended. Though the book revolves around Adam, he knew that working with the SEALS was a team effort.  He took no glory for himself.<br /><br />The other major thing you will find in this book is what these Navy SEALS did for the women and children in the countries they were serving in that the American media did not show us on TV.  That truth alone stands out to show us that Americans were not evil-doers out to just conquer another nation as we were led to believe back home.<br /><br />This book will inspire young boys and men to be proud to serve in our military, holding up a standard for them to work toward.  Special thanks go to Eric Blehm for writing this gutsy, true story about Naval Special Warfare Operator (SEAL) Adam Brown, who overcame tremendous odds in his rise to the top tier of the U.S. military: SEAL Team SIX.  The tender warrior.  This story was  told to Eric by Adam's family, friends, teachers, coaches, the military, his SEAL teammembers, and letters and journals he wrote.<br /><br />I received this book free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group  in exchange for my honest review.  No monetary compensation was exchanged.

0312641893|5.0|Never mind losing a shoe--cyborg Cinder is missing a foot when Prince Kai shows up at her stall in the market with a malfunctioning android that has recorded urgent information. Cinder promises to fix it, but, before she can start, she is \\"volunteered\\" to be a test subject to discover an antidote to the plague that is decimating the Earth. It soon becomes clear that the past that Cinder cannot remember will have a great impact on the present.<br /><br />Although the story uses Cinderella as a framework, the plot is much more developed. Cinder is a very strong heroine who doesn't need a fairy godmother to get her to the ball. Prince Kai is a troubled ruler with ever mounting duties to his people--and an undeniable crush on Cinder. The story combines fantasy and dystopia in an engaging mix that leaves the reader wanting more. It is fresh and unique in a crowded field of young adult books.<br /><br />This book would be suitable for grades 7 and up. The attraction between Cinder and Kai is innocent and chaste. There is no objectionable language, although Cinder makes a couple of snarky comments. The descriptions of the plague ward may be difficult for young or sensitive readers.<br /><br />I received an advance galley of this book from Macmillan Children's Publishing Group via NetGalley.com.
0345803485|2.0|I have to agree with all the negative reviews. I have actually read all 3 books, and I thought the editor and publicist did the writer a disservice. This trilogy, should have been condensed into 1 book. They should have cut out 95% of the sex scenes, and developed the 2 counter story lines, and developed Ana and Christian more.<br />I'm wondering if she didnt have enough for one book, so the editor or publicist came up with the trilogy to stretch into 3 books by the 2 main characters having sex for over 75% of the book.<br />I like steamy sex scenes as much as the next person, but by the middle of the 1st book, I was flipping thru pages to get to the story.<br />I got this book because of all the publicity, but am really sorry I did and if they are planning on a movie out of this, oh god, please make it one movie that covers all 3 books. Please, I beg you!!!

B006RUJST6|5.0|Well, I'll be freakin' damned!!!!<br /><br />You think you've read it all. Let me explain, I've been in a book phase this past week, non-stop reading book after book only taking breaks in between to shower, to do chores, to cook food for my niece and nephew, and to QUICKLY (and I MEAN NO-TIME-TO-SPARE QUICKLY) run errands. Oh, and to get some sleep and use the bathroom and talk to my boyfriend. Other than that, it's book after to book and you would think that after reading a good book you can't put down, there can't be another one, right?! I was wrong!<br /><br />I loved this book! When I first read the title, I said to myself, \\"Slammed? Did someone get slammed against the wall or something? How can the word 'slammed' have anything to do with the word 'romance'?\\" I shrugged it off since I was in my book phase, remember? I couldn't stop. As I read, I realized I was laughing and then crying. I thought to myself, \\"What is this? After all those books I read, I'm feeling so much emotions over this book!\\"<br /><br />I'm not interested in slam poetry but by golly, I can definitely appreciate every single word poured out by the person who wrote it and spoke it. The feelings are all there, not just in the poetry, but in the book! In all the books I have read this past week, THE HEROINE HAD A BACKBONE! LAYKEN COHEN HAD HER BACKBONE. As much as I wanted her to stop thinking at first (lusting) over Will, I'm glad she grew one and stuck to it!! HER PRIORITIES WERE SPOT ON. I loved her for it! I loved that the writer gave us guilt, lust, greed, happiness, love, family, heartbreak, friendships, ......this was life! It tugged at my heart. It wasn't only about Will and Lake, it was about all of them and how the story all came together.<br /><br />The story was real. The characters were real to me. Situations like what happened in the book can happen! I understand it because I'm in it but not to that dramatic effect. Anyway, the book was such a good read even though I won't be able to read it twice (to avoid sadness), I'm rating it five stars. As a kid and until now, I avoided watching Lion King because I couldn't take watching Simba's dad Mufasa die in that stampede. It was too heartbreaking. I'm going off tangent...<br /><br />I love the book. The story. The characters. The freakin' cancerous lungs costumes worn by freakin' two adorable and funny little boys!

B007F7XXKA|5.0|This book provides very interesting and important information on \\"emerging\\" markets and nations.  It explains why some nations grow their economies much more rapidly than others.  The data is relatively up-to-date, including some from early 2012.  It changed my mind on some nations and confirmed my opinions on others.  Clearly democracy is not a key to economic development.  I now have a much more positive opinion of Turkey, an understanding of why a slowing of China's growth is inevitable, and a better insight into why Russia is stalling out.<br /><br />My only regret is that I bought the Kindle version.  I should have purchased a print version so I could pass it along.  No, I would have kept it.  In the printed version the index is much more useful.<br /><br />GFH (ankerstein)

B00005AXEL|4.0|In \\"the business\\", you have to be able to do three things, two of them quite well.<br /><br />For example, Stevie Nicks is one heck of a good songwriter, and \\"the word around the campfire\\", so to speak, is that she can carry a tune right along with the very best of them.<br /><br />So, you might ask, what's the 3rd thing?<br /><br />Well, Stevie's third thing seems to be production, regarding which she's seeming to come into her own on \\"Trouble In Shangri-la\\".<br /><br />Stevie Nicks co-produced much of this album alongside such luminaries as Sheryl Crow and John Shanks; David Kahn also puts in an appearance.  Stevie's approach to creating backing tracks for her songs seems to be one of building not so much a foundation but rather a bedrock for each song's vocal track; the backing tracks are excellent, but what's most noteworthy is how much they both center each song's vocals in the listener's perception, but also provide a musical telling of each song's lyrical identity apart from that of each song's main melody.  The backing tracks seem to have their own way of telling each song's story.  They are clearly not an afterthought to the main melodic framework of these songs, which is always a good sign of top-notch production.  Ms. Nicks, and of course her co-producers, deserve kudos for their masterful production work here.<br /><br />And the songs themselves?  They're quite good, both those composed by Ms. Nicks, as well as those contributed by other artists.  Co-producer John Shanks' song \\"Every Day\\", co-written with guitarist extraordinaire Damon Johnson, is an outstanding radio-friendly single whose lyric does harken, after a fashion, back to Nick's image as an enchantress (\\"Don't give me visions to explain / There are no doubts I feel the strain / Of all my senses yearning / Over and over again\\") while simultaneously standing on its own, its vision of deep, yearning love needing no imagery context to establish its meaning.  Other songs, like \\"Sorcerer\\", again speak to a more mystical view of things, but reveal themselves to be about certain times and experiences in Stevie's life.<br /><br />Each song is strong and easily memorable after only a few listens; some, like the aforementioned \\"Every Day\\", \\"Sorcerer\\", and oldie-but-goodie \\"Planets of the Universe\\", become unforgettable after only one listen.  \\"Too Far From Texas\\", a song from longtime Nicks collaborator Sandy Stewart, is quite memorable right from the first playing, as are several other tracks here as well (Don't miss Natalie Maines' excellent co-lead vocal on \\"TFFT\\").<br /><br />This album may well be the most consistent since \\"Bella Donna\\"  (although Miss Nicks has produced many great tunes over the years, making each of her releases well worth owning).  Quite possible the best singer-songwriter of her generation, she continues to impress and amaze her listeners with her continuously developing musical gifts.<br /><br />While this isn't a \\"new\\" Stevie Nicks, it's a more experienced Stevie that's heard on this album.  She started out in the early 70's as a wonderfully gifted songwriter, and, imho, has only built upon her raw talents and musical gifts throughout the years.<br /><br />I strongly recommend \\"Trouble In Shangri-la\\" as one of Miss Nicks' best solo efforts; if you're a long-time fan, you'll not be disappointed by anything here.  If you are new to her work, this is a very good place to start.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun and addicting and epic it is worth the download and at least five stars anyone who didnt rate it five stars you are an IDIOT!!!!!
0439023521|4.0|The story is intriguing and keeps you focused. I did finish it in a single day, although I wouldn't have been heart broken if it was torn away from me. The writing is clever and well crafted, although some sentences seem to stumble over themselves. The story manages to be less predictable than what the first few chapters would have you expect, but it still contains plenty of standard archetypes. The main character is a great, strong female role, but I wasn't found of her by the end. The Hunger Games is not Harry Potter, but it's most definitely not Twilight.

B0044ZQ8QC|5.0|This is not bargain bin set - it is the work of art.<br /><br />Corelli was not prolific composer like other Baroque masters, but he is no less important- Corelli influenced many composers during his lifetime and those that came after him. He is a building block of the foundation of our culture.<br /><br />Even if you are not a fan of baroque music, buy this set, it may open totally new musical horizon for you.<br /><br />The price of this set is like buying two CDs of music wannabes who will be forgotten next year.

B008JAFXOQ|5.0|Margaret is a phenomenon as a film that suffered many set-backs in coming to release and suffered an embargo on distribution. It’s a wonder we have a copy on DVD although it was released in a shorter version at some cinemas(2.5 hours) the extended version of 3 hours is available. The director Lonergan had one previous film,You Can Count on Me. The film does something remarkable; it dives into the emotional turmoil of a teenage angsty girl (Lisa) whose hormonal turbulence makes her react in an angry, startled ,self righteous manner, at every confrontation, conflict between her view of the world and the world’s reality. She challenges her mother with a kind of contemptuous indifference. Her mother is played by an excellent actress J.Smith-Cameron, who has more than enough of her own troubles, having divorced, and has a career as a stage actress. She also becomes absorbed in dating a South American(Reno),who introduces her to opera. We see Lisa in scenes at school in class, where she argues through every point with such raw emotion, whether about 9/11 or Palestinians, she sometimes has to leave the class. We also see her in scenes with her literature teacher( Mathew Broderick), with his somewhat smug, pedantic questioning of his class about Shakespeare or Gerard Manley Hopkins.<br /><br />She treats a young man badly who cares for her a lot. She takes up with the school seducer, who introduces her to drugs, and helps her lose her virginity, without having any love for her. She also has an affair with her maths teacher ( Matt Damon : a beautifully understated performance). The central part of the film is based on her witnessing and contributing to a traffic accident by distracting the bus-driver, by waiving at him alongside the bus. She holds the hand of the dying woman, who mistakes her for her daughter. Her guilt about the accident makes her pursue the case and contact the woman’s family as well as the bus driver ( Ruffalo), in another explosive scene. There aremany situations when Lisa is on the phone(when music is played by her brother in a neighbouring room), or she’s talking to her father( Lonergan) who is in California, in conversations that are hopeful about meeting, but don’t go anywhere. In cafes we approach her talking but we also hear the other customers talking too. The deceased woman’s friend( Jeannie Berlin) has a coruscating scene where she attacks Lisa’s narcissistic abrogation of other people’s lives and grief for her own self-dramatizing ends.<br /><br />What is most amazing is not only the scintillating central performance by Paquin, but also the many and varied cameo roles of the supporting cast.The story has great energy and depth and we get the gradual reconciliation of mother and daughter, after the savagery, distrust and emotional turmoil of the earlier episodes.The camera work is immense as the lens trawls the city’s buildings, streets, skies, often slowing time down as it pursues the panorama of space to evoke underlying feelings.The music accompanying this is wonderful right up to the operatic episodes, with the singing often evoking tears as it relates to the drama. You may have some doubts to overcome about the enormous length of the film and wonder if further editing was necessary. I feel the length was justified due to the emotional intelligence of the screenplay,and the rhythms and pacing of the drama. Very rarely will you see this opening out of people’s emotions due to the commercial pressures of making films, the need to tell a story with the minimum fuss. This director has a vision we should cherish in an age of sequels, prequels and franchises which are to often churned out for money. This film will outlast many of the great number of releases coming out now. An amazing, indelible piece of artistry by a writer-director to look out for.(Known also for Oscar-winning Manchester at Sea 2017).
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Just finished reading this book, took me a lot longer than I first thought it would and I believe that it has been made out to be a lot more thrilling and addictive to what it actually is. I wouldn't say it is the worst book I have ever read but I think I will leave it a while before starting '50 Shades Darker'.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The premise of this movie is that seven senior citizens for a variety of reasons opt to leave their homes and lives to retire permanently or temporarily to Jaidpur and the confines of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The hotel, as often is the case when viewing something on the net, turns out to be not what is expected and actually far from it.  It is a story of contrasts from that point on. Some of the travelers embrace the sights, sounds, and adventures that lie ahead and some fight the differences from the start. Not done strictly for laughs though there are many hilarious moments, there are poignant scenes that resonate as well as scenes that exemplify how sensitive people can be at times and how blind they can be at others. What remains as this story unwinds is that strangers are strangers no longer and the people involved have a greater awareness and self-knowledge of themselves and others.<br />The casting in this movie is perfection. By far Maggie Smith and Judi Dench shine as two of the seniors as do Tom Wilkinson and the lesser known Bill Nigh. Dov Patel is great as the hotel's proprietor though the entire cast excels as an ensemble.<br />The scenery is beautiful and exciting and expresses a more laid back and sunny atmosphere in contrast to England.<br />This is a feel good movie that works.

B007X4ECLY|2.0|So this is Guy Pearce. Trying to be like Bruce Willis  with the smirk and care free approach falls flat. The  concept is actually a good one. Prisoners sealed in suspended animation at a space station getting an untimely release has great potential. Unfortunately the very good sets and decent stunts are only filler for real acting and a cohesive plot.<br /><br />It appears much time , energy and money was put into the explosive action scenes but it just can't carry the film. Another reviewer mentioned \\"suspending belief\\". I would say completely detaching your cereberal cortex is an advisable step towards the viewing process. If this is a B movie, it's the most elaborate one I've seen. Another odd thing is that I was transported in my easy chair back to the decade of the 90s as I watched the suave anti establishment savior attempt to rescue the unsure and resistent female.<br /><br />A guess I should have been clued in when the movie dug up old films like \\"Die Hard\\" & \\"Blade Runner\\" to use as jacket art promos. Maggie Grace plays the presidents daughter who whispers her way through the film as you can almost invision her acting coach nearby. I really hope I don't see her in another film.<br /><br /> If you do find any humor it is of the old 80s \\"Romancing the Stone\\" style. I would equate the movie with a sci fi channel re run that never takes off but adds one more violent scene in hopes of holding ones interest. I'm sorry to see filmakers resorting to this type of sci fi fluff in the year 2012.

B007N0REX6|5.0|This album is quite simply the best rock album in years. Slash has actually matured as a lead guitarist, focusing a tremendous amount on the quality and phrasing of his licks rather than the speed and ferocity that were the trademarks of his youth. Myles Kennedy is a revelation on vocals, begging the question (at least for me), \\"where would Gn'R have gone with Kennedy on vox instead of super talented, but megalomaniacal Axl Rose?\\" The sound is tight, raunchy, punishing, gentle, and robust. This album is a must-have for any true rock fan!

034580404X|5.0|I absolutely loved these books! Highly recommended for adult readers male and female! They shipped quickly and I believe I read them within a week! I just couldn't put them down!
B0002F6AH0|4.0|Great footage along with nice narration. Of course, you cannot cover every single incident of the War but this collection does cover a great deal across many fronts and in many countries. There is also some nice color footage as well spread throughout the series. Some of the extra documentaries about Hilter, I found to be very interesting. The sound is not the best. Subtitles are not available. That is the only drawback. All in all, a really nice, thorough collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As soon as I started reading these books, I was unable to put them down until I finished them.  I have never finished any book so quick.  As a matter of fact, I'm on my second time reading these books, and not because of the erotic nature, but because of the story line.  I loved them!
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy was a great read. It was everything I expected it to be and more. Katniss becomes the heroine every little girl dreams of being and for once we see a book with a girl that has guts and spends more time strategizing than simpering over boys. I fell in love with several of the characters and found my self biting my nails in anticipation of what would happen next. One of the more entertaining series I have read since Harry Potter. While some will claim this book as gory and horrifying being that kids are fighting to the death, I think it is a great metaphor for government control and anarchy. A great read all around. I would definitely recommend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good stuff.  fun for all ages.  energy goes quick and is hard to come by. but over all a very fun game!
0345803485|3.0|So I just finished reading the Fifty Shades of Gray series by E.L. James and I must say that my mouth was probably hanging open through all of the books. The main characters are Ana and Christian and their story is sometimes beautiful and other times heartbreaking. Christian lives a closeted sadist lifestyle and we get to see his journey from a tortured frightened child to an even more tortured and controlling man. Ana comes into his life and becomes a soothing balm to his wounds and the past that continues to haunt him. I love the fact that Ana starts off as this naive frightened little mouse and we see her grow into a woman that can hold her own against her overbearing love interest (Christian) and become a little more assertive to the bullies that show up in their life from time to time. I must say while the story line was great and very interesting at one point I just got completely tired of the sex scenes. This amorous couple seem to be screwing every other paragraph and it gets to be tiresome which is why I really think the trilogy could have just as easily been one book. I can't say after reading this that I would have bought the books for $10 a pop though, I was glad they were loaned to me by a fried. The books are a decent read but they do border on porn with all of the sex in every few pages. While Christian comes off in the book as a controlling psycho most of the time, I did enjoy the way his character evolved over the three stories. I would say give the book a try.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Original review before I learned what the permissions were actually about in this particular app: \\"Why do some developers (like this one) work so hard to make applications that are obviously very cool and very useful and then ruin them by including all kinds of third party malicious code, spyware, and even openfeint??! I just don't get it. Why would a developer ruin their reputation this way? I have no choice but to give this one star because behavior like this is just that unacceptable to me.\\" (NOTE: This has long since been rectified so please keep reading!)<br /><br />UPDATE: I completely take back everything I said, as the developers have more then proved themselves as legitimate and up front about everything.  It turns out that this is not the fault of the developers of all, but the fact that the library that they used to write the application contains all these permissions/extra code stubs by default with no easy way to remove them, until now. The developers have a sense released a new version that has all these unused tagalong extras removed and now this application requires no permissions at all! Due to this and considering that I already said that the app is excellent besides, Knots is absolutely a 5 star app now in every way. and I mean in every way!<br /><br />Highly recommended, beautifully programmed and extremely educational!<br /><br />I applaud this developer for what they are doing. I certainly plan to put them on my short list of developers to buy from in the future and cannot wait to see what they release next!
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|NO SPOILERS!<br /><br />I absolutely love this movie. I am not a huge fan of Miley Cyrus, and honestly, if it was not for the romantic plot line I doubt that I would have purchased this movie. On the other hand, Miley and Chad Michael Murray make a very cute couple and it is adorable that they were actually a real couple a little while ago.<br /><br />Since buying it I have watched it several times and it always makes me fall in love with it because it is very romantic. I know several male friends who have also seen the movie and they love it, so I would not necessarily consider it a chick flick; although, if that is your thing you will love this movie!
0451228375|5.0|This book is an epic read. The social justice portrayed evoked strong emotions in me. Unfortunately, this book follows the same exact format as the previous Pillars of the Earth, where we follow the stories of four main characters from the time they are children until they are senior citizens all under the shadow of the priory and cathederal.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoyed the game in the beginning,  but agree with the folks that dislike the randomness of the awards in the Scrat mini game. No matter how well you perform, the prize is a gamble. I have won the large coin prize several times and the animal prize twice,  but never more than 10 acorns. I realize that the company is trying to make money,  but it'd be nice for those of us who refuse to pay huge money on a game if it was a bit easier to win acorns. The fun is disappearing as it is becoming impossible to achieve challenges that require hundreds and thousands of acorns - even the hearts in the social game are easier to earn than the acorns!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am still trying to figure out how this book became a runaway best-seller. Have people not read erotica before? Good erotica? Well, Fifty Shades of Grey is not good erotica. Heck, it wasn't even good Twilight fanfiction when it was originally published as \\"Master of the Universe,\\" which was an Edward/Bella A/U BDSM fantasy. However, once it was professionally published, I thought I'd give it another go and see if the publisher had edited it and perhaps improved it.<br /><br />That would be a big fat no. Nothing has really been changed.<br /><br />Why does the heroine speak as if she's in a Jane Austen novel? Is she British? Since the story is set in the U.S., the \\"editors\\" (and author) needed to lose the Britishisms! I won't even get into the unequal power imbalance in Ana and Christian's relationship, nor the unbelievable plot that Christian is actually a billionaire (who seemingly never works). Overall, not as bad as a Dan Brown novel (which I consider utter dreck), but still appalling bad.
B000LBBLO2|3.0|I bought this item twice. I really wanted the lenticular cover but didn't get it the first time. I bought it used and I do not recommend buying an used one. I bought it again new and it came with the lenticular cover that I was supposed to get the first time I bought it.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I liked this book at the beginning but the more I read, the less I liked it. I loved the chemistry and friendship between Abby and Travis. But once Travis became so obsessive and needy, I couldn't handle it. I was waiting for him to be diagnosed as having bi-polar disorder. I tried to like this book.....just not enough.

B000002LLC|5.0|this is the music from the movie.  i love the movie got both the CD and the movie and both are nice to have.got's at least 10 songs did not listen to the CD in a while but i liked it.
0345803485|1.0|I bought the audiobook, mainly to see what all the fuss was about, and I don't turn away from good 'erotica'.  I will admit that this is not my usual genre, and I listen to audiobooks almost all the time.  Where to begin with this one?  The writing?  I'd be generous and give it a 'D'.  Maybe it 'reads' differently, but the exchanges of e-mail, with the constant 'to/from/subject/date/time' references will put the listener to sleep.  If they took the words 'flush' and 'blush' out of the book, it would have been chapters shorter.  Ana flushes more than the collective toilets at super bowl halftime.  Her 'Inner Goddess' visits her constantly.<br /><br />The female narrator tries to lower her voice for the dialog from Christian and mainly succeeds in making him sound uber-stuffy.<br /><br />The sex scenes...plentiful...not badly written compared to the rest of the book, but I'm sure it wouldn't be difficult to find comparable ones.  Right now, I'm about half way through it.  Since I bought it, I'll probably finish it.  Do I have any interest in the rest of the trilogy?  NO in 'shouty capitals'.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I finally realized that I didn't really care what happened to these people, I stopped listening and moved on to a better use of my time.
B000059Z8J|5.0|i am a superman kinda person.  the first in the series.  Warner Brothers could not get any one to play the part any better.  he was a living superman with his disability.  this movie predates c g i for the age of the movie i would say that it is better then a lot these days.in this movie he meets Lex Luther.  i suggest to any one to watch.

0790729652|5.0|this is an original batman with Michal Keaton from the late 80's early 90's.  the action is wonderful the gadgets are great and the car is uniquely wonderful.  predates the batman movies with christian bale by at least 10 years.  this is the batman i grew up with.
0345803485|1.0|Don't buy this book or ANY of the other book in this Trilogy.  The author is rich enough from everyone who made the mistake of buying into the hype about the book's sex scenes.  Take my word for it, they're boring and redundant; she uses the same sexual verbiage over and over again that after reading it for the tenth time...I just wanted to scream! Soccer moms of America, stop referring this book to your girlfriends and neighbors, and get into therapy if you think this book is the only way to release your inner sexual goddess; which by the way, the author makes constant reference to with the books main character Anastasia Steele.  \\"My inner goddess is jumping for joy; my inner goddess is afraid, my inner goddess is sad; my inner goddess is blah, blah, blah...\\"  This book reads like a conversation preadolescent girls have at a slumber party, talking about some fairly week bondage scene they got a glimpse of on a Showtime movie.  With all the promises of exploring the BDSM world, this book doesn't even satisfy the reader in that area, because the bondage scenes are not indicative of anything more than \\"rough\\" love making.  Go straight for erotica literature if that is what you are looking to read, it will be less frustrating and way more satisfying than any of these books.
B00005JNJV|5.0|there are no features but a great movie.  not the best batman movie i have ever seen people never consider the effects that they had in earlier movies even if the movie they are comparing top is 30 years newer.  good movie though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because it has different Bible studys that you can chose from. You can set it to remind you each day at a certain time to remind you to read your Bible.
0307949508|2.0|I know books start off slow, but geez it was just consistently slow. I literally got 3/4 way through and couldn't bear another page. It seemed like every chapter, every paragraph was simply a filler to some small event or tease to an event of that chapter. It was simply every character asking what happened to Salander? Where is she? Did she do it?  What's going on? Over and over and over and over. Just all pondering the same thing, I couldn't take one more page. Then once the main question was answered I was left wondering why I was even reading it, what was the character trying to accomplish. Feel like it was never really established. I really wanted to like it I just can't. Besides like other people have said what always bothers me is a weak character like Salander can do everything and defeat any enemy. Okay, some people are geniuses without formal education, but a thin girl can't just defeat anybody and everybody. Kind of reminded of the character in Revenge (tv show). They both bother me for the same reason.<br />The Swedish names also bothered me, always got them confused because the names were so well, Swedish! Couldn't say it in my head.
B0063IH60K|1.0|this app will constantly nag you with adverts, therefore I would stay as far from it as possible.  It's a shame, because other than that, it is programmed well.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|The Kindle app is fantastic - the books are well displayed on virtually any kind of machine - tablet or phone.<br /><br />However, I have one little nit-pick I'd like to address:<br /><br />BOOKS YOU ARE CURRENTLY READING<br /><br />See that?<br /><br />It's not in the Kindle app.  To me, this should be a NO BRAINER.  The app is for people who love to READ BOOKS.  Often they like to read more than one at a time.  Often, they have 20+ books in their collection.  Some of us even more.  Browsing through a lot of books just to find a couple you're currently reading is kind of stupid.<br /><br />Can we fix this, please Amazon?  I promise I'll give you five stars if you can manage to do the exact same thing a nook reader app can do.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />BinaryFu
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|i'll add my 2 cents to the equation. this album arrived on saturday and has been in heavy rotation since. (between this and nas's new album)<br /><br />i'm not sure what some of the other comments are talking about when they say frank's voice is boring, their ole school and so-forth. i'm ole school, too, but one thing is that you always appreciate good music, and this album is what it delivers.  although i do appreciate frank's mixtapes, it was a smart move on def jam's part to deliver fresh material. this album is something that i really can not put into words at the moment. i personally, think this one of the best r&b albums of twenty-twelve thus far behind swv and monica, and can be enjoyed 10 to 20 years from now.<br /><br />for the music luvas who've been nostalging for some good r&b, you will not be disappointed.

I can tell that this is going to have a positive impact on our lives, because Rhonda is absolutely right: gratitude is the key to a happy, fulfilled life! :)
B005LAIGZU|4.0|I'm quick to admit that I love playing first-person shooter video games, as well as watching shoot `em up action flicks. I grew up with Rambo and Medal of Honor. Do I support war or condone acts of violence? No (well, often on the fence about the former). I don't know what it is about hardcore action sprinkled with bloody violence that gives some of us an adrenaline rush, but one thing's for sure is that it doesn't always translate to our real world desires. Where am I going with this and what's the point? The film Act of Valor is an up close and personal dramatized encounter with real-life Navy SEALs, a high body count, and some of the most realistic combat effects I've seen. I enjoyed this film due in great part to the action, as will many viewers of this film, and I don't see why that has to be a bad thing.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I, like many people, look for more than cheap thrills with movies. But I see nothing wrong with a nice adrenaline filled action movie from time to time. Act of Valor is a great example of such a film. It's got a fairly standard terrorist-driven storyline, lots of gunplay and tactical action complete with first-person perspectives that put the viewer right in the middle of the action. It's clear that the SEALs weren't trained in classical acting when forced to perform dramatic dialog, which I forgave knowing this fact from the beginning, but in the tactical scenarios it's clear they are the real deal. The SEALs don't give off the presence of hulking action stars, but rather impose a more controlled, modest demeanor.<br /><br />Now I may be making this sound like a no-holds-barred shoot-everything blow-stuff-up flick, but that would do this film injustice. After all, this film is centered around a group of individuals whom represent some of our nations greatest heroes. It is said that the film originally was meant to be a recruitment film for the Navy. Had I seen such a recruitment film when I was in high school, I may be in a different career. Not only does the film depict guys that can kick some serious butt and pull off life-saving missions against incredible odds, but it also shows respectable characters that truly believe in what they are doing and care for their team as they would family while at the same time risking their lives for people they've never met.<br /><br />The film does what many of its kind have a hard time doing, and that is putting meaning behind the action. While the story isn't anything spectacular, the feelings of patriotism, heroism, and camaraderie feel authentic and successfully translate to the real world. In other words, the film doesn't make the gamer inside you want to shoot at the bad guys, but it makes you want to shoot at the bad guys while saving someone's life and perhaps even an entire population. The film also gives the viewer the realization, mainly by casting real life SEALs such as leads Dave and Rorke, that these people are among us everywhere we go. That itself is a pretty big eye-opener.<br /><br />A lot of people are going to hate on this film for being too violent, pro-American, etc. and for it's other faults such as a fairly standard storyline and weak dramatic acting. Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course, and in some cases I would agree with some of those opinions. However, I believe that sometimes people are too serious when it comes to movies. Why does one have to agree with everything a movie says or does to enjoy it? While Act of Valor may have set out to enlighten, inspire, and promote, that doesn't mean it has to have those effects on you to appreciate it. I personally welcomed such an authentic feeling action flick packed with purpose that still satisfied the FPS fan inside me.<br /><br />The factors keeping me from calling this a perfect action film would be that I would have loved to have gotten to know the characters outside of combat (perhaps the filmmakers wanted to limit the amount of dramatic acting that would have been required to achieve this?). The film certainly could have used improvement in some of these areas. The choice to cast the real-life SEALs did indeed add that level of authenticity where it counted, but detracted from the overall cinematic quality. Nonetheless, I enjoyed enjoyed Act of Valor and felt like I got a good insight into a very exclusive team that serves our country while simultaneously being entertained.<br />Source: criticnic.com 17-July-2012<br />Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox

B0087DFIOU|4.0|First-time director Adrian Grunberg partners with action veteran Mel Gibson on this Mexico-set crime thriller which stars Gibson as an American career criminal on who finds himself doing hard time in an outrageously-corrupt Mexican prison. Once I saw the first trailer for this film, I knew it was going to be an interesting, albeit fun, and wild ride.<br /><br />Ok, I have to start by admitting I needed to look up the word Gringo prior to writing this review. I've heard the term before, and in the context I've heard it in it has always seemed derogatory. Gibson's character is the Gringo, or white foreigner in a Spanish-speaking place. From his arrival into the shady prison, it's clear he's unwelcome. Looks can be deceiving though, as we soon learn that the gringo wields certain skills that improve his chances of survival in the pen.<br /><br />Driver, as Gibson's character is credited (he goes by a few names in the film), landed in jail after driving off with what we are led to believe is at least two million dollars. The corrupt Mexican officials take advantage of their find and leave Driver to the sharks in jail. As it turns out however, the stolen money belonged to some very high-powered individuals who want it back. To top things off, the jail houses one particular inmate who runs the show behind the scenes who may cause trouble for Driver.<br /><br />While in prison, Driver befriends a young boy living with his jailed mother (entire families can live in this jail...I was as shocked as you are). The kid (Kevin Hernandez) reminds Driver of himself a bit, and the two help each other out. The boy and his mother (Dolores Heredia) also have a few secrets that tie them to the prison's kingpin Javi (Daniel Giménez Cacho). While the Driver is a loner who from the get-go just wants to leave with his money, he is drawn to the mother and son and finds himself getting stuck into a much stickier situation.<br /><br />Get the Gringo met my expectations and more. I knew that it would contain over-the-top scenarios, wild action and good amounts of humor. It delivered those things, and even exceeded my expectations in some respects. Say what you will about the man's personal affairs, but Mel Gibson woos and entertains, especially in these types of action roles. His character is a badass with an ironic sense of humor. The action scenes are exciting, often shocking, and definitely prevalent. I was in disbelief about the whole prison situation, but that only added to the quirkiness of the picture.<br /><br />I knew this would be a fun flick and it certainly was. The story was surprisingly clever and had a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming. Grunberg impresses with his first feature, adding a gritty and energetic style. Combined with Gibson's charisma, adrenaline-filled action, and enough sub-plots to keep you from pulling your hair out in boredom, Get the Gringo is sure to be the sleeper action flick of the year.<br />Source: criticnic.com 17-July-2012<br />Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox
B0082LUEW8|1.0|This entire album is junk that isn't worthy of what many call, \\"filler tracks\\"... And makes me pine for the \\"Stampede\\" album, which I didn't even like too much!<br /><br />My main gripe about (prior) HellYeah music, was that an Illinois born 'n raised Singer, was trying to write/sing \\"Southern Rock\\"; and was, for the most part, failing miserably.  (Which, as I mentioned in my Stampede review, pains me to say, as I'm a Huge fan of Chad & Mudvayne!, as well as being a big Pantera fan, having grown up w/ their music (as it was released)... and more so, because they're from Dallas, as am I.)<br /><br />It seems I got my wish, with BoB, as they've (largely) abandoned the \\"Southern Rock\\" aspect of the 'project'... but, what is left, is a mesh-mash of, cruddy wanna-be Pantera-esque music, with cruddy wanna-be Mudvayne-esque vocals. __ There is no set direction, or theme, (outside of 'drink booze in excess'), and the result is that the entire album sounds as if it was rushed to completion with none of the members really caring what the end-result/'product' sounded like, or if it was any good. (and it's not)<br /><br />There are ZERO songs on this album, that could be considered \\"Hits\\" (Radio Hits, or Otherwise)... There are ZERO songs on this album that I (personally) consider to be anything but \\"Filler\\", (save, perhaps one song: \\"Dig Myself A Hole\\", which is next-to-last track-wise; but even that one is just, \\"okay\\", and entirely forgettable).<br /><br />Ever since the forming of HellYeah, Chad's Mudvayne work has been more limited (time-wise, and content-wise, as it was being spread now over 2 bands)... and the last Mudvayne album (self-titled) I felt, was \\"lacking\\", and largely, due to his involvement w/ HellYeah... though, obviously, that's just an educated guess, and one that can't be proven - outside of comparisons pre and post, and comparisons of other Artists who've done things similiarly -- and to my knowledge, no one has been able to write & sing for more than 1 band (simultaneously), while being able to continually perform (write, etc.) at the (high)level fans of the original band have come to expect. _ In fact, the only 'exception' to this could possibly be Corey Taylor (Slipknot/Stone Sour); but I would argue (as would many) that the involvement therein, has mushed/melded between the two Bands, and are now more akin to 'Brother/Sister', as oppose to 'Distant Cousins', if you get my meaning.  (a few years ago I would've argued the case for Maynard James Keenan; but after the 10,000 Days album, can no longer make that argument)<br /><br />So, please, for the sake of Mudvayne, and its' fans... Please Stop(!) and put your focus & undivided attention on Mudvayne again. __ Either way, I'm done wasting my money (and time) on \\"HellYeah\\", because it was never all that great... and now, it's just laughable.

0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones is a novel so full of complexities, characters, and plots that a brief introduction to this world can't do it justice, but here is my attempt.  We begin in Winterfell, where Lord Eddard Stark is at home with his wife and children.  Unease lies over the land, as winter is coming and unrest abounds in the Seven Kingdoms.  Many old families are plotting to gain power and advantage, as well as avenge centuries old feuds with each other.  For the Stark children (and those of other families as well), it is a difficult time to be coming of age, as circumstances will force them onto differing paths, where treachery is around every corner and no one can be trusted as war comes closer and closer.<br /><br />The novel is told from many differing points of view (not only the Stark family), and I love this method of storytelling.  The paths of several characters sometimes cross and we are allowed a view of events from two differing sides.  There are characters to love and characters to hate, but none are boring.  The only time I found myself losing interest slightly is during Catelyn's chapters, but during Daenery's, Arya's, Jon's and Tyrion's chapters I was completely unable to put the book down!  Highly recommended, but beware, there is a significant amount of violence, if this offends you.  Hope the rest of the series stays just as strong!

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Well..I guess this book isn't for everyone but I loved it! It has been labelled 'momma porn' but I would say its a modern day Mills and boon. Fifty Shades of grey is the first book in the Trilogy and sets the scene for books two and three to go deeper.<br />Its an easy read,and keeping things in context, this is all it needs to be! therefore not a literacy masterpiece.<br />If you have an open mind and can get past some sexual content it has a cute , unravelling love story taking place.

0061726826|5.0|This novel is the best YA dystopian work I have read since The Hunger Games.  This genre is hot right now, but so many of the books out there lack well-developed characters and/or a believable and engaging storyline.  This book has both.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series.

0307592731|2.0|While the author claims to have gained insight and enlightenment on the trail, she continued to make bad decisions and poor choices the entire time.  I had a hard time relating to her and found the book frustrating because of this.  I almost felt like she did the hike in order to have something to write about, not that she hiked and then decided to write a book about it.  When struggling to deal with her mother's death and being faced with an unexpected pregnancy, it seems that she might embrace that as part of her healing.  Not so.  Overall, her continual poor decision-making made it impossible to respect her and left me happy when the book was finished.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The pace is slow. The book is too long. The sex writing is repetitive and juvenile. It's about as erotic as a cookery book. There's no dramatic build up. The characters are not particularly likeable. Ana is dull, naive and whiny. Christian is like a bossy nanny, rather than a sexy Dom. If you think a helicopter trip followed by a discussion about signing a sex contract is mucho sexy time then this is the book for you. The characters are irritating and the dialogue is either mundane or cringeworthy. The bits in between the sex are dull. The sex is also quite dull.<br /><br />The cover is good though.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is kinda addictive but it is a huge blast!! It is soooooooooooooo fun!! I highly reccomend to EVERYONE!!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I have wanted to read \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" for some time and I finally did so.  This is a heartwarming story about a little 11 year old girl called Francie and her truly wonderful family.  The book covers about 4 years (from age 11- 16) with quite a few flashbacks to Francie's earlier life.  It is set in Brooklyn in the early 1900's (about 1915-1918) and the story is about living in Brooklyn at this time of the 20 century.  Francie lives with her mother and father and her one year younger brother in a poor tenement in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn.  The family is poor but they do manage to eke out a living for themselves with lots of hard work and sacrifice.  Francie is an imaginative 11 year old who finds beauty in the simplest things.  She loves her family while at the same time being quite aware of their failings.  But these failings only make her and her family stronger and the bond between them tighter.  Francie loves to read and to learn and she gains a maturity far beyond her years because of her insatiable quest for knowledge, her effective observation skills, and because of the hard life she lives.  When I looked at Ms. Smith's bio it appears that she herself lived in Brooklyn as a young girl at the time of the setting of this book.  I am sure that she has put a lot of herself into the story, and her love of Brooklyn comes through on every page.  And she obviously loved her characters as her writing makes them appear to live and breathe on the pages.  It is easy to see why this book is considered an American classic.  The writing and the characterizations are very well done indeed. It is a wonderful story about a precocious little girl as she grows up in a big American city at the beginning of the 20 century.  I will miss Francie and her brother Nealey very much now that I've finished the book.
1439127700|5.0|'<br />This pair of authors knows how to write history that both informs and entertains, as displayed in their book \\"The Presidents Club.\\"<br /><br />This is not a book about major historical events involving 20th Century American presidents (though some do form the backdrop for various tales).  The book gives a fascinating portrait of presidents in retirement and how they interacted with subsequent occupants of the Oval Office and other presidential retirees.<br /><br />It is a book of very interesting anecdotes and a catalogue of the huge egos that are pretty much a requirement for someone to rise to the office.  Truman is magnanimous in inviting Herbert Hoover, the Democrat's favorite whipping boy at the time and someone party members did not want to see rehabilitated, back into service to both find a way to avoid European starvation after WWII and reorganize the Executive Branch.  This started the President's Club.  Their dance at the beginning of this episode over who would invite/ask who to meet and under what circumstances reveals two wary politicians in the arena.  They ended up becoming fast friends.<br /><br />The office, the authors point out, has a way of becoming larger and more important than the present occupant or their policies to those who have sat in the White House.  Thus, our ex-presidents largely are ready to help current occupants, or at least the institution, in matters large and small.  By and large, they wish for the president to succeed in a general sense and the influence of the Executive Branch to remain decisive in our system of government.  Only Jimmy Carter consistently fails to adhere to the unwritten rules of the club. His continual willingness to subvert foreign policy initiatives and walk his own line when talking to foreign leaders presents the only consistently discordant line in a tale of men who come to revere the office and generally see their role in retirement as, if not supporting the current inhabitant, at least supporting the institution and the power of the office.<br /><br />Some of the presidents don't like each other.  JFK called Eisenhower \\"that old ass****\\" and Eisenhower didn't think much of JFK either.  But he willingly came to Camp David in the wake of the Bay of Pigs fiasco to both give advice and be photographed with Kennedy so the world would know there was no division between the former president and current occupant.  Clinton thought Bush 43 would hate him because he beat his father for reelection.  However, working together and time have yielded a very friendly relationship between both Bushes and Bill Clinton -- so much so that 43 refers to Clinton as his brother because of the fondness 41 and Clinton feel for each other.<br /><br />For presidential or history junkies, this book is a treasure trove.  Nixon and Johnson both colluded and conspired against each other around the 1968 election as both attempted to beat Humphrey (in the election in Nixon's case and into submission to his Vietnam policies in Johnson's).  These were two men cut out of the same cloth and they both realized that about the other.  Reagan taught a new President Clinton how to correctly salute his military guards so the young president wouldn't be embarrassed with an effort any veteran would recognize as deficient.  Clinton frequently called Nixon for advice and counsel on foreign affairs and considered him an expert on the matter.  Ford gave helpful advice during Clinton's impeachment scandal having handled the matter with his own predecessor during his presidency and being fearful of the cost to the nation of a president removed.  Bush 43 and Obama summoned predecessors to deal with humanitarian crisis and the club answered the call.  Touchingly, sometimes a departing president asks an incoming one for a small policy favor.  Bush 41 asked Clinton to keep his Points of Light initiative and Clinton asked Bush 43 to keep his Americorps program.  Both survive.<br /><br />The authors do a great jobof interweaving dialogue, background and the political environment into each of these sketches portraying presidential interaction.  They were able to interview some of the surviving presidents for the book and aides to many who have passed.  Their narrative strikes the right balance of facts without being turgid and dialogue without being breezy.  Their assessment and conclusions and \\"lessons learned\\" strike in the main the right balance and don't seem too ideological (though I thought they did seem to portray Eisenhower as more of a cold fish and grouch than I've seen in other places).<br /><br />A good read that will entertain and provide insightful personality sketches of this century's Presidents.of interweaving dialogue, background and the political environment into each of these sketches portraying presidential interaction.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This puzzler starts out relatively simply, then increases in difficulty as you move through the levels. Good for your head.
0345803507|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy. When I read that this was the author's first writings  I thought that she did a great job with all of the twists and ability to keep the reader wanting more! A very unique plot.

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun!! i play this game everyday and its amazing! i just recently got this app and i picked up how to play quickly, but there is one problem.  sometimes it reads my action wrong, like if i'm trying togo to the side it will slide instead. either than that its a fun and addictive game!!!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Doesn't work properly.  The second you put this on your kinect, it wont be able to track you and wont be precise enough to play any games any more.  I can't believe a company can get away with marketing something like this.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book becuase it was on the best seller list.  Poorly written, sick and very unpleasantly surpising.  I think the fact this was on the best seller list reflects real problems with what our society is coming too.
B00701L5XS|1.0|App force closes &amp; caused my phone to reboot.  Uninstalled and installed again but it just force closed again.  During install it lists unacceptable permissions but the Amazon listing said no permissions.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|If you like Jane Austen, you will love this.  It's like she wrote it after finding a taste for mystery.  Great book.
0307956350|3.0|So, the book's description was a little more enthralling than the book itself. Granted I haven't finished ... but I thought I would have by now! I thought it would be a mysterious and thrilling page turner, but there are sections where the excitement runs dry. It's not that the storyline isn't exciting ...it's the author's writing style. I just hate it. From page one he makes it very apparent that he is more than capable of listing information, stringing together people's actions, thoughts and descriptions of scenes. It's tedious to read and detracts from the story's suspense. However, I will keep reading because I want to know how it ends... Not because I am considerably engaged with the story and on edge, I've come half way and won't leave it at that.
0345803485|1.0|After reading this book, and finding it very lacking, I decided to read the reviews on the next two.  Apparently, it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />It is just not good. If you want to read poorly written erotica, you might as well read penthouse forum mags.<br /><br />I actually found myself skipping pages and pages of the \\"porn\\", looking for a story.<br /><br />This thing got a lot of buzz on so many tv shows, I wonder if somehow Miss and Mrs. conservative women who have never been exposed to this sort of writing, somehow felt like they had permission to read this because it was all over the news?
B005K17RU0|4.0|You don't have to wonder what the weather is like with the app.  It tells you, with instant weather alerts.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|First I have to comment on those who absolutely hate these books.  I have to wonder if they ever bother to read the synopsis of a book before they read it...and if they did, have they ever read a current day romance novel?  If someone states they've read a current day romance novel then the sexual content in this trilogy is not shocking by any means.  Yes, this story line does delve a bit into the BDSM world but in truth it barely touches it...and really, it's not what these stories are truly about...the real story within these books is how two people come together...as a couple.<br /><br />Now to comment about this second book in the trilogy.  Once again, it's not great writing.  Sorry to the author, but it's just not great writing; it is a very good story though.  In this book you get the opportunity to really get to know the characters much better.  I really found myself sympathizing with Christian in many ways and identifying with Anastasia's plight/situation, there were even portions of this book that brought tears to my eyes.  Yes, yes, yes...there's a lot of sexual content in this book as well but this is two people in a relationship, sex is a reality of an intimate relationship...therefore, there's sex in this book as well.  This should come as a shock to no one.<br /><br />If you are someone who expects literary genius in everything you read, don't read this book...you'll only want to tear it to shreds and look down on it.  On the other hand if you are someone who reads a book for entertainment and graphic sexual content doesn't make you say \\"Oh my! (a nod to Anastasia) blush and cover your eyes then go for it, I think you will enjoy it.  One last comment, if you are someone who feels you truly know the BDSM world...leave your knowledge of that at the door, this book isn't really about BDSM...it's merely another character of the trilogy, in this book...one that is (in my opinion) in the background.<br /><br />As I recommended in my review of the first book.  Read it, form your own opinion...it's not a 5 star book, but I liked it.Read it, form your own opinion...it's not a 5 star book, but I liked it.

B0000VAFO0|3.0|Hello i just watched this for first time after seeing Awakening which was just above average movie is pretty good and enough horror action violence to keep you entertained throughout but i wasnt over scared watching it or wanting more after watching it sorry also action scenes were just ok nothing special, overall movie is watchable but probally not view again for awhile after watching this series, i prefer Resident Evil or Blade a bit more.
B0054JELS4|1.0|I ordered the 1-8 set through a non-Amazon seller. These were advertised as in new condition, but upon arrival, it was clear these were knock-offs. The print quality of the dvd packaging and insert was poor, like as from a 15 year old inkjet printer on draft mode. The discs themselves appeared to all be factory pressed with silkscreen/full color printing/artwork. However, the episodes/content of the discs were remastered to fit (lessened quality) on a single DVD layer AND to include 'engrish' and Chinese subtitles. I verified the remastering by ordering a disc through Netflix to check contents...no Chinese subtitles and dual layer DVD.<br /><br />I reported this to AMAZON and contacted the seller for a full refund. It's a fantastic series, but just make sure you are getting these through a legitimate party to ensure you are getting what you are paying for and that you don't have any of the playback issues reported by other users.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great read and would recommend for any mature audience!! Two very insecure characters come together and learn what it takes to make a relationship work.<br /><br />Writing from this author is very captivating.
0316066524|5.0|A work of madcap genius. I first read DFW's magnum opus the year it was published. This second time around was even better. However, for me, the ending is depressing: no resolution, no defense to the lurking dangers that entrap us whether we recognize them or not. I think DFW must have felt there was no way out of the trap of addiction, paranoia and consequent depression. Holding on to platitudinous beliefs is not enough for the penetrating mind. Is suicide the right, or a worthy, response? One hopes there is a way out, other than drug induced dream or death, of the overturned cup (bell jar), creeping paranoia, and depression. Love?<br />Infinite Jest is the entertainment that is an endless loop that will kill you.<br />[[ASIN:B007TAF1JY MONSTERS OF THE MIDWAY: 1969 - Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n Roll, and Football]]
B00701L5XS|5.0|A lot of the apps being released around the time this app went FAOTD were riddled with tracking software. Thus Nynix got beaten up pretty badly over the inclusion of many types of tracking options and appears it was completely accidental and primarily an issue with the software they used to create the program. I upgrade my rating and review now because the issues have been resolved, and apparently have been for some time.. Unfortunately making reviews from your phone does not setup notifications for replys to ratings and comments.<br /><br />We must stay vigilant for the Devs of any apps on the markets and let them know directly (by email rather than bad reviews) when there is something fishy going on since it is very likely they don't know something is set a certain way until it is too late and the bad reviews are flooding in.<br /><br />************************************<br /><br />THE REVIEW:<br />This is an awesome app and works great to help visualize exactly how a knot is created and looks. The knots themselves are animated from beginning to end which is much more helpful than a bunch of static pictures with arrows. You can also rotate the knot 360 degrees to look at it from all directions. Unfortunately you can only rotate it on one plane - it would be nice to rotate left/right AND up/down.<br /><br />Now, if only I could find an app like this for tying neckties...
B00371V6SE|3.0|A really good read if not a little drawn out at times but could have been my impatience so I could see what was going to happen next.
1469984202|5.0|This is the type of book that sucks you in and causes you to ignore your responsibilities and then leaves you with that empty, sad feeling because it ends. I hope there will be more in this series.

015206396X|5.0|So I finally jumped on the Graceling bandwagon, and honestly people, if one of you had just beat me over the head with this book 4 years ago and told me that the series was full of complete stories that didn't depend on one-another, I would have read it a long time ago.  Clearly this is all your fault.  But I'm willing to forgive and forget because I loved Graceling.  This book swept me away as only fantastic fantasy can do, compelling me to neglect every other aspect of my life until I'd read the whole thing.  I believe I still fed the cat and maybe showered once, but who's to say?  I'm pretty sure the furry fella is still kicking around here somewhere.<br /><br />Because this is one of those books that I'm about the last person to read (and if you haven't yet, consider this me hitting you over the head with it), instead of trying to write a legit review I'm just going to clue you in to why I enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />Things I like in books:<br /><br />3rd person over-the-shoulder perspective*<br />Single perspective*<br />Unreliable narrators<br />Strong female lead*<br />Girls who kick butt*<br />Girls who dress as boys*<br />Fantastic world building*<br />Real world settings I know well/would love to visit<br />When things only piece together near the end<br />When characters figure things out as fast as I do*<br />Non-human characters<br />Slow burn romance*<br />Political machinations*<br />Great action scenes*<br />Survival*<br />Characters who are confident but have humility*<br />Stories with romance that aren't about romance*<br />Stories with no romance<br />Characters who grow*<br />Underground movements*<br />People who let other people be who they are*<br />Snark/a dark sense of humor<br />Adventures/journeys*<br />Stand alone novels*<br /><br />*Graceling has it.<br /><br />I could complain about the naming scheme of the countries, which is, quite frankly, terrible, but as that's the only complaint I can come up with for Graceling, it seems silly.  No one book can have all  of these things, but Graceling came pretty damn close.  Now excuse me while I check on the cat....

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. It is really time consuming. When this app wasnt available on the kindle fire I would play it on my friends I pod touch whenever I could! When I found out that it was available on the kindle fire and it was free I was sooooo exited! Now i play it all the time! I don't know why people said that it was a bad game in the other reviews. I would get this game! Its free and REALLY FUN!

B005ARYEY6|5.0|Other reviewers have stated beautifully how important and fantastic the music in this set is.  Just a couple of additional points:    1.  While this is the same group that was with Miles on the \\"Plugged Nickel\\" 1965 performances documented in another box set and smaller \\"best of\\", the group had two years to grow, stretch (while remaining accessible), and the difference for me is astounding.  In addition to their growth as a unit, Miles is in MUCH better form during these performances.  It is well documented that he was recovering from health issues and not at his personal best during the Plugged Nickel sessions.    2. The sound on this set is excellent.    For a great professional review check out: [...]    The music this group created is simply astounding and continues to influence musicians and listeners 35 years later.    Do not miss this set.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I've been buying Plantronics headsets for years.  It takes 1-2 years to wear a pair out, even with daily use.  With Logitech and other brands, I was buying new ones every three months.  The sound quality is great for the price range and they are super comfortable to wear.  The microphone is clear and easy to set up, works great with games, ventrilo, mumble, etc.  All in all, this is a great value for a headset that will last a long, long time.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Giancarlo Esposito's work as Gustavo is as good as Emmy winner Bryan Cranston's performance this season and he deserves applause for his excellent composure and character portraying this season.<br /><br />The season starts up slow for the first few episodes but then gains steam to match the unsurpassed Enthralling storytelling these seasons have been so far. I could not stop watching till I finished all the four DVDs and 13 episodes this season 4. Fantastic TV series. Once again Season 4 does not disappoint you in any way.<br /><br />Kudos to the cast and crew for making this one of the very best in TV series! - Keep up the good work!

1595827684|5.0|I love the Mass Effect universe and this book was very well put together. Good binding, glossy pages, bold iconic artwork. It's really nice to be able to see how the art for each character evolved and how they came to be who they are and who they look like through the art. The breathtaking landscapes and cityscapes that the artists rendered in the preliminary drawings and sketches seem to be exactly the same in the games and show so much energy and emotion in still images. I like the book, it's good for the price, definitely not worse. It's a good buy. If you like the Mass Effect universe and the games and you want to see the initial ideas and evolution of the game through it's art, buy it.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Right here I'll tell you I read about two thirds of the book. At that point I flipped over to another book which is highly unusual for me. I thought I would come back to it; I did, for about half a page.<br />The story starts off amusingly, the two main characters don't seem to hit it off, and things change, etc, but around half way it starts to get 'samey' (as in all the same) and repeats itself, and emotions go back and forth, and, well, I guess this book really is for the late 'teen readers because who else has the patience?<br />About where I broke off (two thirds) I began to realise I could write the rest myself:<br />Girl tries to slow things down..<br />Boy doesn't like it, throws a fit..<br />Girl shuts him out a bit..<br />Boy does something silly, gets into trouble.. or gets killed - who cares<br />Girl believes in him..<br />Boy redeems himself.. or she weeps over at his funeral - again, who cares?<br />They find true love.. or she finds another fella.<br />ETC.<br />It's MY fault. What on earth was I doing reading this stuff? It's not MEANT for me!

Throughout the movie the mother and daughter learn to see through the others eyes and thereby understand each other better.  I did enjoy it very much.  I thought both Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis did very well in this film but I also enjoyed the work that Christina Vidal put into this movie as well.  I would recommend this film.  Pretty good for a remake, and easier to relate to.

She stumbles upon Stitch who they think is a mutant dog.  Stitch causes chaos but learns through the movie.  When finally tracked down by the one who sought him, Stitch says that the two girls that found him are his family.  I would highly recommend this film to anybody.

I leave it as a display on the coffee table and change it whenever the mood strikes, and when I need the table surface, I just close the book. The straps hold the pages open well. If you have it open to the first or last bouquet it can look a little uneven, but that's easily fixed by slipping a few coasters under one of the covers.

0823015033|5.0|I love this book and I learned so much from it that I'm ready again to start sculpting figures in clay. I tried before and failed miserably but this book gives you all the tools you need to sculpt a figure in polymer clay.
B002AOWXO0|5.0|This album is basically a duet between the guy and girl in a break up..not only is it good music in general, but it really is good to listen to through a rough break up (been there)! I think it's definitely a good buy! Pete Yorn rules!!
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This DVD of Karol Wojtyla is a treasure.  You not only see Karol gowing up and maturing into the young man who realizes he wants to become a priest, but you get to understand his struggles and search for answers to the mysteries of war and suffering and death.  I am very happy to own this DVD and look forward to sharing it with others and to have discussions regarding the depth of the life of John Paul II. The second DVD, Karol- the Pope, the Man is an excellent story recalling the papacy of John Paul II - His struggles with communism in the world, their treatment of the Poles and other eastern bloc countries.  This biographical dvd also demonstrates the difficulties he had with the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and his acceptance of this disease and how he lived out his life as richly and fully as he could.  These DVDs really witnessed to us the depth of the person of John Paul II from childhood to mature adulthood to death.  They are a real treasure!  Piotr Adamczyk who played Karol in both DVDs is an excellent actor and really presented the character of John Paul II in a wonderful light!
0062197258|5.0|INTO THE DARKEST CORNER by Elizabeth Haynes is an amazing find and honestly one of the best books I have ever read.  It is first a superb psychological thriller of the highest order with chills and thrills galore.  But the novel succeeds just as high on so many different levels as well.  It also deals very heavily with abusive romantic relationships and why a person would choose to stay in one.  It superbly illustrates the effects such abuse has upon the victim and how it changes their life forever.  Our main character here is Catherine and she has OCD to a very extreme level.  We go through the illness with her as author Haynes drops tidbits here and there slowly showing us all that she encountered that made her this way.  All the characters here are belivable and all plot lines and actions are totally realistic.  This is an intelligent novel extremely well written and Haynes has done her homework very well on the intense subject matter.<br /><br />To give away more of the plot would ruin the novel for readers but what I can say is this novel is extremely gripping and will stay with you for a long time.  It is disturbing on many levels but is also a story that needs to be told.  There are chills and thrills galore and real life situations that make the whole thing that much more intense.  I highly recommend this superb novel and totally agree that it deserves to be on all the BEST OF lists its hit and deserves all the rave reviews its been receiving.
0143119680|2.0|Story is actually OK but I'm distracted by the simple editing errors and unfortunate choice of type setting (please choose the \\"fit to page\\" rather than hyphenating). I barely made it to page 4 before I found the second error. The hyphenated words often are split to having to turn the page to get the other half. The typos consist of missing words that a simple grammar program would catch.<br />These types of errors seem to happen quite often in Penguin books. I may have to start avoiding books from there because of the error distractions.
030758836X|3.0|Psychological thriller indeed. Gone Girl is full of twists, turns and a curve ball. The book starts off slow until the engine hits the red line.<br /><br />I was riveted to this book, trying to figure what would take place next. The plot was excellent and the characters indescribable - perfect combination to create an amazing thriller.<br /><br />The mind games Gone Girl provided left me exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. I couldn't wait to see how the story would end - which caught me off guard completely.<br /><br />I enjoyed the descriptive writing Ms. Flynn provided - set the pace for the entire read.<br /><br />This book was definitely worth the attention it has received. You wont be able to put this book down, and the twists will have your attention without a doubt.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow has a lot of tricks. Once you get to the 7 by 7 rounds, the points get closer together. The tricky part is that you have to use every single square to move on.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Best spider solitaire there is. Would give 5 stars if I could buy to have no ads bc  they are annoying. I only keep this one bc its so good that it out weights the ads. Also its the only spider that has big enough cards to view perfectly on phone. I use on HTC evo and Coby tab.
B00637HXNG|1.0|Gents,<br /><br />i bought this blu-ray, but when i tried to play in regular blu-ray player, after played 12 tracks the disc was 'frooze' and i couldnt see anything. So, this blu-ray just work in 3D blu-ray only.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|It took a couple games to get used to the way you can \\"pencil in\\" numbers. But I love how it highlights the number your working on so you can see which boxes have that # already. Really love this version of Sudoku!!!
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|Read lots of reviews about it, so i decided to buy it since it looked pretty much like the way more expensive Merlin version.. after spending nearly 2 weeks tryieng to balance it i GAVE UP and returned it.. i know there's lots of good reviews here and recomendations to set it up following you tube videos for merlin.. truth is even when similar those videos wont help you at all since right from the beggining when attaching the camera to the base plate you're lost 'cause the merlin version has many different holes with letters assigned which the opteka does not have.. there's only one video in you tube i found about how to set up this specific stabilizer which wont help much if you didn't purchase an additional quick reales plate.. i tried with a canon rebel t2i and a 5D m2 with different lenses including a 16-35, 24-70, 50mm and even when getting close to a decent balance this will go off right after locking the knobs which supposed to hold it in place.. that was very frustrating!! I don't usually give reviews but i feel this deserve one. I wont recommend another stabilizer since i'm still looking and also 'cause i don't want you to think i support other brands like others suspicious reviews.
0345803485|5.0|My wife loved the book.  Found it to be stimulating and entertianing. Might even get to try a few new things.  :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Completely addicted to this game. I love being able to go back and figure out the levels I missed the first time around. No problems with fitting to screen even when using tablet settings. Samsung Aviator 4g
B007SYWFRM|5.0|needs some improvements but other than that I really love this game very addictive game for all ages to enjoy!
B001HR5AIC|5.0|Love this box set. \\"Valerie\\" recording is awesome in this collection. Lots of other songs, or versions, I had not heard. Much better than the posthumous album released not too long ago.
B00701L5XS|4.0|I've always been interested in how to use and tie many of these knots. This makes it easy to understand and learn.

B0073PZIYI|3.0|Writer/director Andrew Niccol had a good idea - having time be the trading commodity for a future time when everything is bought and sold with a person's inherent time on earth.  But is it is a one-note song and that note gets so overused that monotony sets in.<br /><br />The official description of the story is as follows: in a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, having the means to buy your way out of the situation is a shot at immortal youth. Here, Will Salas finds himself accused of murder and on the run with a hostage - a connection that becomes an important part of the way against the system.'  Plug into this simplistic explanation the fact that Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives in a time zone equivalent to living on the wrong side of the tracks. He decides to go for the gold and with the help of his buddy Borel (Johnny Galecki) he sets out to cross through all the barriers (using his allotted stored time to buy passage) to get to the wealthy part of town - an area run by the Timekeeper (Cillian Murphy) and his staff (Alex Pettyfer et at).  Will gains entry into the gambling casinos, bets his hours on Timekeeper at the table, wins, and meets the beautiful Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried), daughter of the richest man in the city.  From there on it is a `catch me if you can' chase as Will and Sylvia try to outwit the Timekeeper and of course we know who is going to survive.<br /><br />The dialogue is plebian, the characters, with the possible exception of Will, are only given to us in outline form, so we end up not really caring about anyone.  There are some interesting bits of surrealism tossed in but even those can't alter the fact that there is very little to work with in this little star turn for Timberlake.  Grady Harp, July 12
B005LAIGLE|1.0|This  DVD  is  a  copy  ripoff......  Will  not  play  on  my  DVD  player,  but  I  can  watch  on  puter.....  RIPOFF  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is one of the best apps I have downloaded since I bought everything on temple run which is another great app
B000HIVQD0|5.0|Bought this on vinyl (several times, actually) way back when. Hasn't aged a bit, still sounds fierce. The second CD has cool B-sides, live stuff.  Highest recommendations!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I have followed this show since it began.<br />There are many reasons to love this show, from the nerd jokes that require more than just knowing who Pavlov's dog is to an actual respect for aspergers.<br /><br />For me the real reason to love this show is the growth of the characters from episode to episode and season to season.<br />No one stays the same and the love the share is visible in every scene.<br />The flanderization of the characters in season 3 made for just so much fun.<br /><br />What I like best about the production is that there is no laugh track. I find the laugh track to be the most insulting aspect of modern television ever. I will laugh when I find something funny, I don't need the TV to tell me what I find funny.<br /><br />Give this show a try and if you don't like it...well sadly it is you and not the show.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it! I find it challenging and very addicting. my daughter and I both have it. its great for any age.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Great book! Not as good as the first two but it leaves you wanting more! There is so much involved in these books and so many twists and turns . You think you know what is going to happen then something totally different does. There are tons of different  characters it a complex series of fantasy books. I would recommend it for someone who does not want the stories to end. It's not easy reading and keeps changing so you have to pay attention to who is who cause it changes in the blink of an eye and two books later this person will pop up. Sometime it gets slow and a little boring but you will figure out why! These books are very long. I am reading the most resent book dance with dragons. I don't know if will be the last because i am only a third of the way through but if it isn't.Iknow I won't  be able to wait for the next.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|i love playing any of the angry birds games but tryed to download them to my android tablet and it gets to the main screen and forces it to shut the app down really wish this problem would get fixed love to get to play them all :/
B007XH6BPG|4.0|Squackett wasn't what I was expecting. I bought Chris Squires Swiss Choir album a few years ago, which also had Steve Hackett. I wasn't really knocked out by the christmas album and I'm a huge fan of Chris Squire. So I bought this album thinking it would be some excellently played, but bland, music.Maybe I'd get lucky and there would be one or two good songs. Well I was pleasantly surprised. Life Within A Day rocked hard, very much a nod to Led Zep, but pretty Yes-like, too. Other standouts are \\"Tall Ships\\" and \\"The Summer Backwards\\". I got this as an internet download from Amazon so I don't know who played drums. Another review said the drums sounded 80's, I agree. The drums sure aren't Alan White or Bruford! This drum sound is kinda weird, like 80's metal, almost. But whoever the drummer is he's really gettin off, and after awhile you start to dig it. Anyway, really good fresh sounding songs from Chris Squire and Steve Hackett. And for bass guitarist out there, Chris Squire proves that he's STILL the man. And for guitarist there's Hackett, who is almost an 'invisible virtuoso', his parts are so well integrated into the songs. Yes/Early Genesis/Hackett fans should really like this!
B0086700CM|3.0|i Cant seem to donload it kn my kindle fire! but its a good game for on my friends ipad.-.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I'm totally obsessed &amp; have gotten friends addicted too...its really easy to fallow &amp; the story line us real cute too
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it is fun. I would recommend this to everyone. I have played this game for over 30 min. at one point. addicting. get it...........Now.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is the introduction season.  They want us to learn about the characters and take an interest in them.<br />Dexter is a sociopath serial killer.  Adopted and raised by a police officer, Dexter learned to appear \\"normal\\".<br />Training as a forensic specialist, coupled with his Father's training keeps his killings from official notice.<br />Set in Miami, Dexter works for the police helping them solve cases.  Along the way, Dexter kills the bad people that have beaten the system.<br /><br />This season revolves around \\"The Ice Truck Killer\\" and how this affects Dexter.<br /><br />The humor is dark.  The dialog is witty and cutting.  The acting is above average, no one is miscast and all work well together.<br />The story line is not overly complex.  If you think about it, you will see where the story is going.  Even with that, it is fun.<br /><br />If you find the idea of a serial killer working for the cops funny, you should enjoy this.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Blank screen on Kindle. Support FAQ suggestions did not fix problem. Apparently this was a known issue, way back in 2011. Still not fixed. I submitted a trouble ticket an hour and a half ago. Still no reply. If I'd known it would've been this big a hassle, I'd have never bought this app. Worst $5 I've ever spent.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|We laughed when we took the book-like holder out of it's compact box and started to unfold it, and unfold it, and unfold it. It was over 4 feet long. Luckily you can open just one side at a time. We disagree over which is our favorite but enjoyed all the movies and their special editions. Haven't finished watching the 5 discs of special features.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its really fun.  some are really hard but they are awesome!!! challenging app. I would love a second one. get this app!
B00701L5XS|5.0|I have had this app on my ipod for almost a year now. I consider myself an expert with knots , but I still consider this a useful reference. The developers of this app continue to add useful knots from time to time.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Not your boring, usual puzzle. Teases the brain in a sudoku way, but without the numbers playing the dominant role.
0062132288|4.0|I'm a big Nolan fan so I enjoyed this every bit as the 11 year old I got this for. If you want a bit of fun to go along with one of the summer's big movies - haven't seen it yet - then this certainly revs you up. A lot of entertaining detail about the vehicles and the gadgets, and it's ideal for kids.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Fun and challenging without being too difficult.  Perfectly playable without requiring resorting to in app purchases. Well worth a few bucks.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Excellent Trilogy I never watched the whole movie in the past but this time I watched all three nights in a row excellent reproduction too...
B0088TG252|3.0|STORY: Untested CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is the bored keeper of a South African safe house that is rarely used. Immediately after requesting a transfer, he receives an unexpected guest: Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a CIA agent that went rogue nearly a decade ago, voluntarily turns himself into the American consulate and is brought to Weston for safekeeping. Unfortunately, the safe house turns out to be not so safe, and Weston finds himself escorting Frost to the proper authorities on his own. Now, if only he could figure out who the proper authorities are.<br /><br />Cue: car chases, gun fights, close quarters combat, and a few half-hearted red herrings.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Reynolds. I enjoy him even when he's starring in [[ASIN:B004EPZ07K unwatchable dreck]]. Denzel Washington, too, is a captivating actor. Both of them do an excellent job in this film, selling their characters' flaws and virtues without overdoing it. The rest of the cast is peppered with more well-tested talent -- Vera Farmiga ([[ASIN:B000NGTJTY The Departed]]), Brendan Gleeson ([[ASIN:B000HKY9W8 Harry Potter]]), Sam Shepard ([[ASIN:B000GX8B9I Black Hawk Down]]), Robert Patrick ([[ASIN:B001RIY4WE Terminator 2]]), and Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones, Season 3) -- but none of these people are really given the opportunity to do much. Their characters fill a prescribed role, and the script doesn't really give them leeway to deviate.<br /><br />The action is brisk, slick, and well-edited without being completely over-the-top. Our leads seem a little more prone to bruises and cuts than your average action movie protagonist. When Frost is waterboarded at the start of the film, he handles the torture stonily, but you can hear the wet rattle in his lungs and see him struggling for a good breath, even after the experience is over. Weston endures quite a beating, and although he makes it to the end of the film (come on; it's Ryan Reynold as the lead character; this isn't a spoiler) it's not without some serious costs.<br /><br />It's all well and good and very, very familiar. The story doesn't have any new tricks up its sleeve, and although its presentation is nearly flawless, the plot's lack of depth, risk, or any inventiveness at all make the whole film feel like a loud, brassy, colorful way to twiddle your thumbs for two hours. \\"That was a pretty good movie,\\" my girlfriend said afterwards, \\"but I can already tell I'm going to forget we even watched it by the end of the week.\\" She's right. Absent any really new elements to recommend it, the flick feels like a well-choreographed summary of a story that's been told many, many times before. If you have 110 minutes to kill and you don't necessarily care for surprises, it's a movie worth seeing. If your tastes are more discerning, probably not.it's not without some serious costs.<br /><br />It's all well and good and very, very familiar.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the best game ever. it is so addicting. I legit play it everyday!  it is totally worth downloading. ive had no problems with it force closing or freezing. i would recommend this to anyone!!!!!! I love it!!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Allows me to play music and charge my iPhone.  Before this converter, I would plug in the iPhone and got a message charging is unsupported.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am addicted to this game. I can't put it down. I just want to keep playing and playing. I highly suggest you get this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game me and my dad play it like 24 7 and mega run and also temple run so try all of theses games
B007SYWFRM|5.0|greatest game!!!!!!!!!!! you don't have to pay for anything and it has all the animals from the movie .The game has a lot of fun things to do.Like scat ninja
B00701L5XS|5.0|I was not a Boy Scout. I do fish and those knots alone are worth 5 stars. I am sure I will use some of the other knots in the future.
B00701L5XS|5.0|I'm an avid knot tying enthusiast and have a bunch of books, cards, and games to teach knot tying.  This app has a neat interface that allows you to rotate and review the knot from different angles which helps people who see or tie knots from a different perspective adapt their point of view.
B0088TG252|5.0|This movie was very intense with a lot of action.  Denzel Washington as usual did a superb job in this one.  Safehouse is both exciting and spellbinding.  I would reccommend this movie to anyone who likes action, suspense, and drama.
B002SZXSL8|3.0|I had an Amazon gift certificate, so this album didn't cost me anything, and I didn't have much at stake by buying it.  I've listened to it at least ten times, and I'm just not getting into it as much as I did their first album.  This is a 'double album', so twice as much of Andrew Stockdale's screaching, which gets a little wearing after a while.<br /><br />O.K., been there, done that. Time to find some other tunes.
0297859390|5.0|With 618 reviews before mine, I think you get the picture.  Great read.  Lots of twists and turns! I did not expect the ending and I would be willing to guess these characters will appear in another novel.  I love it when I read a book that I love and find out she has written a few more.  I don't have to wait for the next few.  They are waiting for me.  Happy Summer!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a great puzzle game. Some of the boards are very tricky. Hopefully more levels get released soon! Cannot recommend enough.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is super addicting. its better than the original Oregon trail by a long shot. if I have free time this is perfect
B00701L5XS|4.0|wifi connection is required to download ... why can't they include that in the description! is it so hard to stick it in there somewhere? other then that its an interesting app
B001F12J48|1.0|extremely disappointed in the 3D version, We had to use the archaic cardboard red & blue glasses. We own the electronic glasses but they wouldn't work with this movie. My wife & I both received headaches from this debachle. If the movie wasn't made in 3D originally I wouldn't buy a 3D version later on!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is pretty fun and is easy to do but they have a lot of tasks and earning money is easy and you get to name your own village
B008JAG9BW|3.0|But not as good as the original. It was interesting to see where they are now, but the story was pretty slow going.
