0385333846|5|Kurt Vonnegut's death made me think about Slaughterhouse-Five, and I read it again for the first time since the early '70s, not long after it was published.  I discovered that it's now a much better book, or maybe I'm now a much better reader...<br /><br />This book is often called an \\"absurdest classic,\\" and it is both of those things.  It relates the life of Billy Pilgrim, who's become \\"unstuck\\" in time, by describing what is happening-- and what has and will happen-- to him simultaneously.  The focal point for all of this is the shattering experience of Billy's life, his presence as a prisoner of war in Dresden when it was destroyed by the allies in World War II.<br /><br />Of course, Vonnegut himself actually experienced the events he creates for Billy, surviving only because the Germans housed their prisoners in concrete slaughterhouses, and it had a similarly shattering effect on him.  He says the book is his attempt to deal with the experience.<br /><br />The book could have been impossibly confusing or just annoying, but it's not.  That's because of Vonnegut's style.  His central thesis-- that the survivors of the horrors of war are sick because they realize that they are \\"...the listless playthings of enormous forces\\"-- is developed with both humor and humanity.  The book is a condemnation of savagery committed as a service to authority; it's also warm and deeply funny.  That might seem like an unlikely or even impossible combination, but Vonnegut pulls it off.  That's why the book is regarded as a classic.<br /><br />This book is easy, quick reading, but it's most certainly not an easy or quick task to forget it.  It's often compared to Joseph Heller's Catch- 22, probably because they are both appreciations-- celebrations, really-- of the absurdity that can be found in the tragedies of life, particularly the tragedy of war.
B000066NW0|4|i don't know what's wrong with me.  i can't remember ever liking a pop song, and definitely not anything by anyone fairly young, but i like this entire album.  hmm.  <br />i also, on the rare occasion i like a top40, can't remember ever feeling like hearing a pop song, and yet i find myself jammin away to this album at the computer.  hmm.<br />so i am confused.  i usually listed to angry girl music of the pjharvey variety or punk rock or dave matthews (mmm, yummy) and this album is nothing like these.  it very much fits into the pink, britney category.  i like a couple of these types of songs, but never a whole album ... i can't figure it out.  i just like avril.<br />so... i'm telling you this album is worth getting if you're thinking about it.  if i can like it, most people can.  <br />first listen fav's: unwanted,anything but ordinary, naked, nobody's fool - in that order

0861714911|5|This is the most recent of several Pali-only anthologies of Buddhist texts I've read, the other two being Word of the Buddha and Path To Deliverance, both by the famous German monk Nyanatiloka.  (The latter is especially good.)  This one is easily the most comprehensive.<br /><br />For those of you who find the suttas tough going on account of their lack of thematic organization, this book will be a godsend.  As Bhikkhu Bodhi explains in the introduction, the idea for it had its genesis in a series of lectures he gave on the Majjhima Nikaya.  His goal therein was to arrange materials from simplest to most profound, giving a progressive, graded course of theoretical and practical instruction.  He then decided to turn that approach to the Sutta Pitaka as a whole.  The result is the present work.<br /><br />The specifics of this structure are as follows, where each number refers to a part of the book:<br /><br />1.The Buddha's description of the human condition<br />2.The nature of the Buddha and his attainment<br />3.How to approach the Dhamma<br />4.How the Dhamma contributes to happiness in this life<br />5.How it can contribute to happiness in future rebirths<br />6.The Dhamma on why renunciation is the safest course to take (the perils of samsara)<br />7.The nature of the path to liberation<br />8.How to master the mind<br />9.The nature of transcendent wisdom<br />10.Stages of realization<br /><br />Each of these sections is prefaced with a substantial introduction by Bhikkhu Bodhi, and some of these are surprisingly good.  (I have often felt a little sour toward BB's writing because he is such a slave to the Commentaries and tends to express himself with a slightly stilted, pompous air.)  I was especially impressed by his introduction to part 3 (\\"Approaching the Dhamma\\"), which is, in effect, an essay on the place and nature of faith (saddha) in the Buddha's teaching.  I think anyone, no matter how knowledgeable, can benefit from these pages (81ff).  It is especially useful as a contrast to Christian notions of faith.<br /><br />So who would benefit most from this book?  I think beginning students would especially be served by it, or at least those who have until now subsisted mainly on a diet of secondary texts and haven't yet plunged into the jungle of the suttas.  This book is excellent for providing an orientation, and if read two or three times so that one really becomes familiar with the passages contained therein, when the passages are finally encountered in their full form it should prove very rewarding.  But then, anyone who wants a refresher, or a different manner of presentation from, say, the four noble truths and the three-fold training (sila, samadhi, pa&ntilde;&ntilde;'), will also benefit.ially useful as a contrast to Christian notions of faith.<br /><br />So who would benefit most from this book?

B005HV6Y84|5|waiting for this movie to come out when it did it was every thing I'd hope for.
0062409859|4|I enjoyed the book very much.  I did not find the changes in Atticus Finch unusual at all.  Most of us are complex individuals  and that was the case with Atticus.  He was a student of the law and as such he had defended a man wrongfully accused.  That respect for the law did not mean that he was not overwhelmed and distressed by the changes in his society.  It can be difficult for us to understand that the society that we have loved and supported will probably not survive us.  I loved the book and thought it was an excellent squeal to To Kill a Mockingbird.
B00AZ6RSFE|5|The fact that is a true story makes it even better. If you are tired of violence and want to watch a movie that will teach someone a life lesson, watch this movie!

B001L5SXQG|4|I like this album. I do agree with some things people said about Queen of the Supermarket & Surprise, Surprise.  After listening to this CD a few times, it's quickly growing on me. There's nothing like putting on some headphones and getting lost in Springsteen's music. Don't care for the song Good Eye.
B0009P5YXO|5|I LOVED this sonic screwdriver! The ink lasted for a surprisingly long time considering the size of the &#34;pen&#34; and the battery is still going strong!

B003XU75QG|5|Every time I think there's nothing fresh and new to listen to, an album like this one comes along. Taylor Momsen and Ben Phillips are superb songwriters, and Taylors' vocals are energetic and unique. She surrounds herself with an excellent band that's tight with a cutting-edge sound. This is a must-get for you rockers out there; young and old.

B001DPHDCY|3|Inexpensive enough but the movie is only so good. If you're in to owning a bunch of movies, then adding this isn't a bad option but if you only want top movies, then this one didn't fit that bill for me.

0446525537|5|Once again, Nicholas Sparks provided a book that I had to finish in one sitting.  I eagerly anticipated his newest release, and I was not disappointed.  As with his other two books, &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;  also evoked a rollar-coaster of emotions (especially the tears!).  This is  a very sweet and innocent &quot;coming of age&quot; story that I absolutely  loved and will recommend to others to read.  I can't wait for Sparks to  release his next book!

B00DR0PDNE|3|The product is a fantastic idea.  Unfortunately internet bandwidth is not quite there yet.  I bought this product to watch tv shows i missed later because I don't have dvr.  It does work, but often the video lags a second behind the audio and somethimes the audio sounds robotic.  It is no fault of the device-that's obviously a bandwidth issue but still a bit disappointing.  I have 18mbps U-Verse internet.

B0067TGSOK|5|I have read several books on starting a small business as well as taken a 12-week business course, and nothing resonated with me and made me feel as hopeful and inspired as this book. Different things work for different people but for me, this is exactly what I needed. In my opinion, it's the best book on starting a business that's out there.
B00A8SPNYW|4|I kept it around for a few weeks as it was a free app of the day.  I played it a bit and enjoyed its graphics and functionality, plus the game premise.  But I did get a bit bored with it--probably because it's not really my kind of game.  It's definitely entertaining.
B00HBQWGXK|4|I enjoy Lee child as an author and Reached as a character. This book is a classic Reached novel with a twist ending. Enjoyable, fast paced with twists.
B00005ABX0|4|Long story short...<BR>Brian Wilson creates Pet Sounds, his career up to the making up Pet Sounds has been on the up and up...  He just keeps getting better, his band just keeps getting better, the albums they make just keep getting better...  This is a pretty standard rock n roll story, that like most has a tragic ending...  <BR>So then Brian and his crew create Pet Sounds, which goes down in history as one of the greatest pop albums ever recorded.  The sound the quality, the song writing, everything about it is amazing.<BR>Brian Wilson of course wants to create an even better album, and in many ways he does.  He starts to create that great album, but as a result of problems with the record contract, problems with the band, problems with motivation, problems with everything, it gets flopped and canned.  An album, then titled \\"Smile\\" was supposed to be released before Sgt. Peppers, and had it, the history of rock would've looked a little different, and the band in the foreground changing rock and roll would not have been quite so dominated by the Beatles.<BR>Smile might've been the greatest album the Beach Boys ever released, or at the very least, on the caliber of Pet Sounds.  Fans, discouraged by the hype and long wait are given Smiley Smile, what Carl Wilson called \\"a bunt instead of a grand slam,\\" and the album fades into history.<BR>But people, IT'S SO GOOD!  I know that I will admit this, and every Beach Boy will admit this, it's not Pet Sounds, but it's good.  Listening to songs like \\"Heroes and Villians\\" and \\"Little Pad\\" you can see just how good it was supposed to be.  The talent, the sheer unstoppable amazing talent of this band is SO abundantly clear here.  The only thing holding this album back is that it is the scrapings of a discouraged project.  This is a half finished art project, that was supposed to be the most amazing thing ever produced, take the hype, return with a \\"sorry guys, not as good as I wanted it to be\\" leads to a recipe for a lost LP.It's STILL a good album, a great album even.  It doesn't HAVE to live up to Pet Sounds.<BR>Listen to the harmonies, listen to their voices, everything about this album is delightful.  <BR>The continuing story on this CD is the LP \\"Wild Honey.\\"  Wild Honey is the result of the guys wanting to have some fun with their music for a change, rather than stressing it, and not putting a great amount of effort into the production.  After the disappointment of Smiley Smile, this wasn't exactly what fans were looking for.  It's fun though, and like Smiley Smile, it's still good.  Listening to this I see a direct influence years down the road on the album \\"Whatever and Ever Amen\\" by the Ben Folds Five.  (...)<BR>\\"Country Air\\" is a big highlight for me, it's simple but beautiful which is all that's needed for a good song.<BR>This is a great CD for the albums themselves, but also good for looking at what was going on with the Beach Boys after Pet Sounds and really makes you understand why the following music didn't take off as well as their earlier productions.<BR>True all good things must come to an end, but in this case the only thing that ended was their popularity.
B0020BUWX2|5|Thankfully the sequel was already out, because it just ends leaving you wanting more.
B00C1BU7V8|4|I really liked the way this movie portrayed such an iconic part of our history. Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Fields, and Tommy Lee Jones all did phenomenal jobs on their roles. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the speech wasn't completely clear the whole time. Some times they were sort of mumbling. Also, some of the dramatic moments in the movie were a teeny tiny bit off in my opinion. I felt the effect, but it didn't drive it home 100% in some moments. It definitely made it to a good 90% though, so I have no real complaints. Great movie and I recommend it to everyone to check out! :)
B00GXKVZSW|5|My wife and I LOVED this show. Got my mother and daughter hooked on it also. I am very surprised it aired on a national network due to its content. Very interesting twists to the movies. I did not read the books.

B00DR0PDNE|4|I purchased the Chromecast to stream Netfix content to our TV in the bedroom and can report that it works very well.  Occasionally, it will have a minor glitch and staying connected to the WiFi, but that has been very infrequent since I moved a wireless access point closer to the bedroom.  For $35, I don't think you can go wrong with the Chromecast.
0345525558|5|I read this book for the book club I belong to.  I did not pick this out myself but this is one of the best books I've read in a long time and by far the most enjoyable book I've read in my book club.  This book was written beautifully and was very interesting and realistic.  I had three weeks to read it and finished it in 2 days.  It mad me think and appreciate my life and be more aware of others.  It also educated me about flowers too!  Overall I though it was excellent!
B00FB13Y74|4|A little nerve racking but fun for a game for all.  You just have to try them to see if this suits your taste.
B0000041Q3|5|I concur that this is one of the very best performances of Turandot.  The  music is breathtaking.  I get goosebumps every time I here it. My wife and  I were privileged to see Turandot at the opening night of the San Francisco  Opera in September, and Richard Margison was marvelous.  I look forward to  more recordings by him, but for now, Pavarotti is the best.  This is a must  have for any opera lover.
B00F87ZUYG|5|Great vibe and intro music, not predictable in the least, your favorite character could be next to get nom-nommed.  Binge watching at its best!

B000669GAI|5|This album is a classic. <br /> <br />I have all of the PJ albums and this is my favourite. It has all the very best songs from all the albums and even has songs from  the 'singles' movie soundtrack. Disc one has the energetic, hard grunge songs & disc 2 has the slow, beautiful, depressing songs. Both discs are as good as each other.I strongly reccomend this to all true Pearl Jam fans and even people who have never heard them before, If you like Soundgarden, chillis, Stone temple pilots you'll love this.
B00006AG5N|4|This past summer my 8 year old son loved the movie Lilo and Stitch so much we saw it twice. Then we saw the soundtrack in a store, and he begged for it. After buying it and listening to it non-stop (including a five hour drive for a camping trip), my son declared &quot;That Elvis guy is pretty good.&quot;<br />So when this CD came out, we had to get it. My son and I both love it and have it on the CD player all the time. It's got enough &quot;lively&quot; songs to entertain a kid, and enough classics to please me. And we both love the bonus track &quot;A Little More Conversation.&quot; <br />I recommend this CD for any family whose kids like music.

B00V3QQDR4|4|The bluray disk is undamaged, the movie plays excellent, the packaging is good, the DVD arrived scratched.
B003A4IFGY|5|This album is a return to what Tom Petty does best.  Rock, Roll with some Rhythm and Blues.  His last efforts were a bit slow and a bit depressing.  Guitar riffs are good with memorable momentum. Running Man's Bible makes your legs wanna shake a bit like Elvis's Pelvis. Trip to Pirates Cove catches your attention on open, ready to hear a fable as it slowly drifts you away. Candy, well you immediately know by the title it is going to be upbeat and it is, sounding like it was written in New Orleans, \\"I don't drink a coca cola, but I sure like a ol' moonshine\\".  \\"No Reason To Cry\\" is a bit too slow for my taste and it is to me a weak song, unless your into listening to it drinking moonshine in the middle of the night over a campfire.  \\"I Should Have Known It\\" is a strong blues based song with a strong opening guitar riff with a strong solid Rock tempo, reminds me a bit of Led Zeppelin.  \\"U.S 41\\" borrows some Paul McCartney vocal pitch change but it has strong Southern Blues Roots.  \\"Taking My Time\\" sounds like something Robin Trower would have played on guitar, but has a strong slow beat that sounds colossal and again, southern blues.  \\"Let Yourself Go\\" has a faster blues beat that adds a harmonica riff now and then along with a steady beat.  \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\" sounds almost Reggae in it's tempo but it is Tom's Vocals that are recorded to give the impression that he is like a ghost, especially when he slowly sings \\"Don't Pull Me Over, I Got Mouths To Feed\\".  \\"Lovers Touch\\" is strong Blues that gives a very laid back relaxing mesmerizing tempo. \\"High in The Morning\\" is another Rocker and Blues combination and a Great Song. \\"Something Good Coming\\" makes you want to hear the story behind the music, somehow the mellow style makes you want to know about what is coming, it is very very deep emotionally and Beautiful at that.  \\"Good Enough\\" again is blues, however it epitomizes the entire emotion and sound of the album.  \\"Little Girl Blues\\" is a fast paced Blues Rocker.  Tom Petty does a great job as a story teller and has come out with a fantastic album.  So my advice.  Buy the Entire Album not just a song or two if you like Tom Petty or Eric Clapton.Tom Petty does a great job as a story teller and has come out with a fantastic album.  So my advice.

B001ANSSDC|4|The movie director changed the premise of the story and so changed the relationships of the characters and the whole meaning of the story.  This is a great story about people finding redemption and growth.
B001HNE3NO|3|After hearing rave reviews for this book I finally sat down and read it, front to back in two hours.  I couldn't and wouldn't put it down despite certain 'flaws.'  I had goosebumps and chills for the first half, it definitely brought up a lot of emotion in me thinking of those actually involved in the roundup.  The story itself was predictable at points i.e the origin of the apartment, the romantic connection with the son, the newborns name, etc.  And I found my interest waning after Sarah's POV was removed.

B0011NVC9I|1|Robert Zemeckis said that he hated the original story of Beowulf. Then why did he waste his time and ours making this movie? Why doesn't he spend his time making something he does like and stop trying to redo a literary classic. About the only thing this movie has in common with the original story is the title. There are two reasons this movie was made: 1) To show off CGI effects (which could have been better and still look artificial); 2) to show off Angelina Jolie in a supposedly nude scene as Grendel's mother and Boewulf's seductress. I'm sure pre-pubescent boys everywhere got excited at the thought. Of course, as Hollywood is constantly reminding us, she's irresistible, isn't she and all grown men with a brain or not can't resist her can they? Just once I'd like to see a movie where the guy isn't a complete moron and doesn't fall for it. And of course they leave the ending of the movie with the possibility of a sequel just in case it's a success and they can make a sequel and lots more money from the teenage movie audience for whom these types of movies are made for. Rent it or download it, but don't waste your money buying it. Better yet, skip it altogether.
B003EYVXXW|2|Hollywood has a long history of misrepresenting historical events -- altering timelines and characters, changing motivations, and injecting an alarming amount of anti-Christian prejudice. Agora is no different, a film that approaches a fascinating historical figure without a shred of respect for what actually happened.<br /><br />The Library of Alexandria holds the most precious philosophical works in the world, and among its many admirers and protectors is the beautiful philosopher Hypatia (Rachel Weisz). A student of progressive thought, an instructor in philosophy and science, and obsessed with circles and their relation to the movement of the earth, Hypatia is much loved by her students and colleagues alike. One of her most ardent admirers is Orestes (Oscar Isaac), who hopes to inspire her to marry him -- but in doing so she would lose her independence and fall beneath his influence, meaning she would be forced to fall silent and no longer teach. Hypatia is convinced he does not love her for her mind as much as for her body and rejects him, not realizing as she does so that her world is about to be torn apart. Christianity has spread throughout Alexandria now that it is no longer illegal and in the wake of slaughtering Christians defacing Pagan statues in the central square, a mob descends upon the great Library with the intention of burning its contents.<br /><br />Caught up in the midst of this religious fervor is Hypatia's slave Davus (Max Minghella), who is also in love with her -- but cannot tell her as much, for it is forbidden and inappropriate. A Pagan who has converted recently to the new faith, Davus abandons her and joins the mob, finding his calling while at the same time questioning the motives of the Christians that surround him. In later years, the violence between the Pagans and Christians and also the Jews will escalate into inescapable pandemonium, resulting in a bloodbath. Where the film succeeds is in the strength of its characters -- each ofthem are interesting and likable in some sense, even though some make poor decisions. Our heart goes out to Davus when he offers to take a flogging for a female servant who admits to professing the Christian faith. He is not religious then, but becomes more so later on. Hypatia is a spunky heroine and in some sense easy to identify with, both in her yearning to discover truth and her resistance toward submitting to the men around her. Orestes appears at first to be something of a jerk but eventually we discover that his love for her is genuine -- and he risks his life in defending her honor. Another figure, this one first a student and then later a Bishop in the Church, comes across as adhering to the teachings of Christ at least -- compassionate, forgiving, and respectful to Hypatia.<br /><br />On a purely cinematic level this film works in a lot of ways and fails in others -- minor characters are not well developed and many of them look so much alike that for awhile I didn't know who anyone was; the story likewise seems to have no internal focus, since it cannot decide what its story is really about -- or what it wants to say about its characters. It is part romance (that never goes anywhere), part historical fiction (rather than fact), part adventure, and partly a push for science and philosophy while at the same time denouncing religion. Its underlining message is that philosophy unites and inspires whereas faith divides and incites violence. Furthermore, it throws Christians to the forefront of controversy and depicts them poorly, while disregarding the actual historical events. In the film, they intend to burn the library, presumably to put a stop to free thought and philosophy -- in reality, the Library of Alexandria did not exist in that time period; it had fallen into disrepair and been destroyed years earlier. In its place was a Pagan temple that a Christian mob sacked in return for their Churches having been defaced by Pagans.<br /><br />The film paintsHypatia as an atheist or agnostic, her fundamental faith only in philosophy -- in truth, she was a Pagan. It misrepresents her friendship with a Bishop -- implying he abandons and speaks ill of her, when in reality she ceased corresponding with him and never told him why, although he continued to speak highly of her and admire her tremendous mind. It also claims her death was religious, when in fact it had everything to do with politics. The director makes very conscious decisions to imply that Christians of Alexandria were actually comparable to the Nazis.<br /><br />The costumes and acting are without a doubt marvelous, but that it so deliberately maligns the facts in an attempt to misrepresent actual events and place blame where it is unwarranted displeases me very much -- and I am not the only one to be offended by it, as various atheists have also proclaimed their disappointment as well.
B008Q09K2U|3|Unfortunately, I think Mr de Mille has exhausted the exploits of of John Corey & Kate Mayfield.  This book is simply not thrilling at all.  In fact in places the story line is down right silly.  He has managed to make John Corey into a caricature of himself these days.  de Mille seems more intent in having Corey voice his constant sarcasms and witticisms than keeping us in touch with the plot.  I used to find Corey amusing but too much is frankly too much.  Mr de Mille, I implore you, go back to those edge of the seat page turners that made you famous.
0307346609|5|I dont usually read horror books. The closest I got was watching Buffy back in the day. But I tried this one based on the reviews I read about it in Amazon and it was well worth it.  <br /> <br />What did I like about this book? <br /> <br />The way it's written makes it seem real. It's written as a series of eye witness accounts and each one leaves you wanting to read further to see what happens next. It's obviously not real, yet if such a thing did happen, you can imagine things happening like this book describes. <br /> <br />I am so glad it's only fiction :)
B004QZ9PLU|2|This is the last Nicholas Sparks' book that I buy.  I end up being depressed after reading most of his books.  Fiction, to me, should be inspiring and uplifting.  If I wanted to be brought down, I would turn on the news. Life is hard enough. I want a book that makes me forget everyday life and hardships!
B000002TLX|4|Turns out there were more songs that I liked on<br />this one than I had ever even heard especially<br />if you want to chill out.
B000BVD460|5|Simply one of the greatest albums of 2005.<br /><br />It contains some of the most important pop songs of the last five or six years. Eminem is truly a great artist, on the same level as Michael Jackson for the eighties or Elton John for the seventies.<br /><br />He helped to redefine pop music and brought us into the 21st century with such hits as WITHOUT ME, STAN or CLEANIN' OUT MY CLOSET.<br /><br />It's maybe the most important greatest hits package of this new century so far and it's a shame that it's Eminem's farewell cause I'm sure he had so much else to give. He's going to be a producer now it seems but he could have moved on with his own music and brought us some new hits. Some others will sing them for him through his productions but it's a shame he's not going to get all the credit for it.<br /><br />Eminem, thank you for everything you brought to pop music and you can be sure this CD will become the reference for your work. I don't know who will be the next greatest pop culture icon but it's going to be hard to follow.
0156012197|3|I read this book as part of a requirement in English class.  Granted that I was in a hurry to finish it the night before, this book is puzzling and in retrospect I should have read the book as well as the \\"Cliff Notes\\" to the book.  There's a lot of depth and meaning that is, or is claimed to be in this story.  For me, it was just a bunch of disconnected stories that didn't come together.  When deep meaning is couched in the form of a story, that's because the values of interest are too complex to explain without such context.  The Little Prince however, doesn't seem to add much useful context to help me understand what exactly it is that the author wants to get at.  I feel like this is a book that  humanities majors like, because scientists like me have a hard time understanding its obscurities. <br /> <br />All in all, this is one of the most boring books I've read.  Perhaps my opinion will change if I read it again some time in the future.  But for now, I highly recommend it for scientists, engineers, and doctors who have trouble falling asleep.
B00N1HONIO|4|Downloaded this for my son who wanted to play it, he always hears is friends talking about it, so I gave in when I seen it for free during a special promotion. He is very happy with it.
B009SJ3H8Q|5|Can't stop watching
B0048064PI|5|Beck and Rod Stewart with a superb backing band. Shapes of Things, Morning Dew, You Shook Me . All Excellent classic material. You just can't go wrong here.
B004OZOTSQ|5|Transfered a bunch of photos and stuff from my computer to my Kindle Fire. Super easy to use and works great. USB port on the Kindle doesn't work so this was a great solution.
B000O8OTNC|5|Nice quality, easy to hold and use, and worked well in first use to re-edge all our heavy use kitchen knives.
B00006RIO7|5|When I saw this movie, I thought it was unbelievable.  I thought this movie was incredible and very unexpected to be this great.  What made this movie so wonderful was the music.  The singing was enjoyable as well as the dancing.  I would definitely recomend seeing the movie but the soundtrack alone feels like you are in the movie.  The songs are incredible, I recomend this music for anyone that loves Jazz music or music in general.
192076920X|5|This book seems daunting due to its sheer size, but don't be fooled. Let it be known that I'm not a five-star kind of girl. I give three stars, the occasional four, but NEVER five. However, this book is most definitely a five. It's gripping, it's funny, it's sad, it's interesting...I started it on the plane ride back from visiting Mumbai and have been thinking about a return trip ever since. Roberts captures Bombay perfectly from all aspects of the city.  Read this, you will not be disappointed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|This game is brilliant! Challenging and beautiful in the HD.  I wish I had known about it all along and look forward to many more rooms.
B00992CF6W|5|Love this game! I got it on my sister's kindle first, but know I have it on mine ,and I play it with my cousins when I get the chance. But at first the controles where hard to get used though.
B008JGSM6G|3|The game is fun.  But if you kid plays it, there are options to make in-app purchases which did not require a password.  Our daughter was playing and she isn't old enough to read.  So she inadvertently bought '50 coins' or something like that.  Luckily it was only $1.  I've since disabled in-app purchases on my Kindle Fire.
B004G6009U|5|Tangled is a must see Disney movie for sure. Especially for all of those little princesses out there! I love how Rapunzel is the hero and that most of the bad guys have redeeming qualities. The musical scores are wonderful, I have been humming them since I saw the movie. This movie is safe for the whole family and will be enjoyed by all. The blu ray quality is superb. Great job, Disney!
B000002U82|3|Maybe I'll give this CD a 3 star because it was good but not <br />great. The best song was probably MONEY. All the songs I thought <br />were pretty good. This still dosen't rank the best album of all <br />time. It could be better the next time I listen to it.
B00BSBT8M6|4|This was a beautiful movie with stunning effects. It didn't exactly follow the book so if you are a stickler for that you might be a tad disappointed. However, the movie is worth watching and I highly recommend. We were happy we watched it.
B00MB8P1OO|2|Decent
B004QOB8SO|5|I watched Sherlock season two on tv and couldn't wait for it to come out of dvd.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock is full of the usual \\"Sherlock\\" quirks but with<br />a twenty first century sensibility.<br /><br />Martin Freeman's Watson is no slouch when it comes to helping Sherlock solve cases.<br />I like how he stands up to Sherlock-calls him on his \\"bs\\" with love.<br /><br />The running joke of \\"are they a couple\\" and Watson's blog is so timely!<br /><br />I highly reccommend the series!
0060574216|5|Yes, it is a bit gimicky, but that just adds to it's charm, and adding humor into a subject that makes everyone tense and emotional only helps lighten the mood. Like another person said in their review, this is an invaluable resource. This book doesn't focus on how to play games with the opposite sex to win them over. I hate books like that. No one is truly happy playing games and pretending to be someone else in order to get the person they want because deep down we want the opposite sex to understand and like us for who we are, and this book helps us learn how to be oursleves and get what we want, what we really want. This book has not only helped me connect more with my boyfriend, but has also allowed me to understand other men in my life, like my father and brother. =) The gimicky language makes reading it more fun.
B007SGM084|5|read the paperbacks and now reading it on kindle...I can look up words that I didnt understand before...it is really worth reading again...  ;  )
B00HZ3C4N6|4|Very good
B0053F042G|5|A refreshing take on the classic &#34;ground hog day&#34; time sci fi.
B00J2VSS0C|3|It's fun to pass the time but I just expected more from a G5 game
B00DEG4Z1W|4|I think that it is lame.I think this because all you do is do hair like coam her or his hair.It is good do good for little kids because they can learn how to take care of there hair.
B00KFW4EFA|3|not a great app for kindle
B00785P2QC|5|Title says it all~ :D Its simply what the game implies but the missions keep you hooked. It is surprisingly addicting.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This app is amazing! It's keeps you thinking! I love it! It has me and my family competing to guess the answers!
B00BAXFJ5M|5|My favorite author with two fun characters in a real twister - the best holiday treat!  Can't go wrong with one of Baldacci's books!
B00005JLSC|1|I went to this movie today expecting to really like it, but I was let down.  The best parts are the songs.  The story line isn't good, it just gets the viewer from one song to another.  The music video for \\"And All That Jazz\\" is better than the movie.  I suggest that anyone interested in this movie buy the soundtrack instead of this movie on VHS or DVD.
B000007T1M|5|This CD is good all the way through.  The opening of Suite-Pee displays the guitarist's amazing talent, the initial drumbeat of Know is executed very skillfully, and the singer displays his very different, very cool  voice throughout.  Unlike most of the CD's I own, every song on this one is  good.  System of a Down manages to maintain great sounds in all 13 songs.   I urge you to pick up this CD if you have any interest in metal.  I'll  definitely get their next CD.
B009KS4XRO|4|Great addictive game
B00QROJ94Q|5|Loved this movie.  They knocked it out of the park here.  Developed the plot and characters very well.
B000W8HC8I|5|The movie was wild the book was all sorts of crazy and I LOVED it! One of the best reads I've come across in a long time. I would and have recommended this book to others!
B0054JZC6E|5|I like this game because you can pick from a various amount of games to play and I love it so much
B009JZSC9S|5|My husband and I both love it.  It has good character development.  It is shows some realistic moral vs legal issues.
B00IG2DOKM|5|This game is very fun, and kid friendly. I'm very pleased with this game, it's not like other's where you wait an hour for one crop to grow
B0063GORYU|4|Enjoy the game but would prefer it without the adds.  Unlike other reviews I seldom have problems, maybe had to reload 2 or 3 times in a year.
0812993292|4|I very much enjoyed this book.  There were a number of pithy, descriptive sentences that still come to mind weeks after finishing the book.<br />I gave it 4 stars because I felt the book was choppy in places, as though the author wasn't sure where she wanted to go. Some parts were were very descriptive, while others were glossed over.  Some scenes had no point and did not advance the story (my opinion). I won't describe them because I don't want to spoil the reading for someone else. By the time I finished, I felt the book could have used a bit more editing.<br />That said, the problems I saw, are the same that can be found in many author's early works. With time and experience, they can be dealt with.<br />I look forward with eagerness to read future works by this author.
B00C7KYXHW|4|Kind of violent got a lot of people but interesting
B008IJTFYW|5|My snoring partner can only be drowned out with thunder. I would love to have an urban option that features voices and footsteps of passersby, as I've found in other apps, to create a campground experience.
B0068ZZ6CI|5|Excellent collection of classics, with a touch of new. Not all the new remixed versions are for everyone, but there is something for every Rammstein fan on this one.
B005D9MUWY|4|Aside from my old Treo, I've only used what came with Android on htc. However, SwiftKey is *much* better than anything else I've used.
0812973992|5|I loved this book! The collection of interweaving tales left me awestruck and wishing for more. A fantastic read and a wonderful examination on life and death.
0451169514|5|Scarier than the movie lol
B005QYKD4I|1|I could not get sound from Amazon when I tried to watch it. Other programs played but this one was silent. I probably would have loved it, but that day I hated it since there was great visuals and no sound.
B00CKOYVG8|5|What can I say, It's angry birds
B00005QY5Y|4|The best review of this album is held in the meaning of the title:<br />Gold; anything very precious or noble, one of the rare metals<br />Rock is so desperate to find the next Dylan, Petty or Springsteen that the establishment is naming every year a talent who will change the world. Of course, the hype fades away and all is left is a modest talent. The thing with Ryan Adams is that all the hype, all the critical kudos and admiring fans is right on cue. He is, without doubt, a song to sing about. He is precious, he is rare, and we would all be very stupid to take our eyes off him.<br />Gold, bombastic and flawed, is exactly what I expected after Heartbreaker. Crammed with songs thickly instrumented Adams takes the listener on a voyage through the history of American rock (but just like the upside down American flag on the cover, he adds a few surprises). His songwriting and singing alludes to the finest rock artists of the past century but leaves us with a taste that is all his own.<br />He writes songs effortlessly, and when performing live he is as relaxed as the audience, cracking jokes, telling stories, creating a relationship between us and him, making the music that little bit more human and personal.<br />Gold is not a masterpiece as some blindly claim it to be. Think that and you will be disappointed. It is though a very, very good album, and I recommend it highly. Ryan Adams. Do not forget his name!
B0038KJH2G|5|Better then the remake.
B00H7VCKKS|5|Like the other 5 movies & the actors the movie is fast pace and captive had me on the edge of my seat..
B00DHHWY9I|4|I love The Great Gatsby (book and Robert Redford version) I found myself comparing the two movies which I shouldn't have. This was a good take on the book from a different director's pov. It was more colorful and musical.
B004MC8CA2|5|This app is convienet; easy to understand; and a very useful tool. It has a lot of different devotions for any one 's situation. This app makes it easy and exciting to read the Bible daily.
B00127RAJY|4|I had been trying different home workout systems (mostly by the Firm) for several years before Jillian was recommended to me.  Her workouts were the first that really worked, providing notable toning results.  The 30 day shred is very intense.  It has three routines - one easy, on 'medium', and one hard.  Each routine has three circuits, with each circuit having 2 strength moves (one for 30 seconds, one for one minute, then repeat each again), 2 cardio moves (30 seconds each, then repeat), and then 60 seconds of ab work.  The workouts are supposedly 20 minutes, although they tend to be 25-30 minutes long.  All three workouts are intense, and they can be hard on your joints.  There are a lot of lunges and squats, so you need to make sure your form is correct.  The cardio, especially on level 3, has quite a bit of jumping.  Jillian provides some modifications, but for some moves, she doesn't give you a non-jumping option.  Again, make sure you always land lightly, with your knees flexed to cushion.  Level 1 starts with some basic moves (pushups, jumping jacks, etc).  Level 2 builds on this, putting in some very strength-intensive moves.  It's a bit less cardio and jump intensive than level 3, but I think it is probably just as hard. Level 3 is very cardio intense, with modifiers for most of the hard moves.  The series is wonderful in that it produces results.  It is hard, though, so don't be discouraged.  Stick with it, and it will give you results.
B00B2V66VS|5|We love all the temple run games! This one is no exception. My daughter plays it all the time on her tablet and mine.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Lovers of the outlander series will deeply enjoy this book. All your favorite characters are back and some new ones come to light. Gabaldon writes her novels with such care and good craft that you don't want to believe these are fictional characters but rather that she somehow channels the story of real people. Hard to put down!
B00IINPXLW|5|Best game ever  I wish they made a 4,5,and 6
B007N6NGYG|5|best game I have played in the of logistical and logic in one game. I recommend this for people who enjoy thinking.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Definitely a page turner for me. I'm not a fan of traditional sci-fi.  While it did have sci-fi elements, The Martian was more of a personal account.  I found myself completely absorbed in Mark's story - from his survival quest to his musings on life in general.  Unbelievable and believable at the same time.  As I made my way through the book, even my young son was asking me how &#34;the Martian&#34; was doing.
B00HGJ18C2|5|My addiction!  Good game.
B009GQ57ES|5|I cannot stop listening to Wings and Same Love. I love this entire album and Thrift Shop does does do them justice.
0446547573|5|I ordered this book for my daughter.. I've since discussed the book with her and she had informed me it was an excellent read.. She loved it. Thanks
038553826X|5|Terry Pratchett at his best, which is his norm! :&#62;
B000005RMY|5|One word best describes this early material: Raw.  If you have only heard the polished club songs on Floodland, then be warned! Some Girls Wander might be quite a surprise (like if you have Never seen a certain someone without their makeup on, and then one day...)<br />But SoM is beautiful underneath their studio production, in their unique way, of course; Some Girls Wander shows off this natural beauty...the minimalism is wherein the beauty lies.<br />I remember La Nausee [amazing club that was in Montreal] playing at least one song from Floodland pretty much every night in 1991, but even as black and foggy as that club was, they rarely played the songs now found on Some Girls Wander.  Why?  Well, most of these songs just aren't...clubby.<br />But So What!  Most of the goth kids I knew in the States were too young to get into the cool clubs, which were (and probably still are) few and far between to begin with -- so the poor devils would console themselves by listening to these Sisters songs on scratchy vinyl in the wee hours of the night.<br />THIS IS THE REAL STUFF; these songs were some of the seeds of the Goth movement, and while ya can't dance to many of them, they immortalized Goth -- so give 'em credit where it's due.
B00IS87HYI|4|I am so glad that they released a version for Kindle, finally.  It is so addictive, and now I can play on all my devices.  I would've given 5 stars, but it's so annoying that you have to ask friends for help every time you move onto the next episode.  Unless you want to unlock instant access by paying for it, and who does that?  Even Candy Crush lets you move onto new episodes for free...eventually.
B0002IVN9W|5|This album kinda sounds like what would happen if The Pixies and Talking Heads took a huge crap. But what a beautiful, hypnotic piece of crap it is!!! Each song captivates you in a a magical way, transporting you to a catchy, spooky universe where music is organically born. Do Purchase.
B00DR0PDNE|5|It does what it advertises. I cannot wait till they add plex support so I can stream movies to TV !
B00AIUUXHC|5|I LOVE THIS GAME! SO ADDICTING!! I GOT THIS YESTERDAY AND ALREADY ON GREAT WHITE SHARK!! LOVE THIS GAME!! #AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004GJDQT8|5|Amazon has everything I need in one place
B001UV4XJ2|1|I love Harry Potter.  I am not happy for paying extra money to get the Harry Potter Deatbly Hallows Part 2 to get the digital download as it does not work.  Warner Brothers makes you sign up for their Flixster service then their Ultra Violet service and you get in an ugly loop but never get to the stage to enter the redemption code to get the digital download.[[ASIN:B005O30Y5Y Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Movie-Only Edition + UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]]
B00K2CHW48|5|Just swell.
B00571F26Y|4|I recently came across another reference to 'Belly Fat' which also dealt with this issue. But the specific reference to wheat in this book really sparked my interest. Wheat is found in so many products these days.<br /><br />The views expressed are certainly not main stream at the moment. But Dr Davis' views are well supported by facts and references that appear to have substance. Although I have not finished the text it certainly has merit for many of those looking for a solution to our current overweight problems.<br /><br />Removing wheat from one's diet will be a big challenge but if his thesis is correct it might just be a lifesaver.<br /><br />And I like the fact that Dr Davis recommends a shopping technique I have heard before - shop around the perimeter of the supermarket (vegetables, dairy and meat) and avoiding all the processed foods in the center aisles.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000VMFDR2 In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto]]
B00AYHKIZ6|5|Essential.  Not easy but worth engaging - listening each time unfolds more passion and meaning to his eclectic words & phrasing.<br />As a dancer, I can count on David for irresistible dance songs as well, and I am pleased to be working out to several of them. Even<br />slower beats work well on the elliptical machine because intensity drives you forward to do more.  And he did. I wish he sounded happier, but serious has been his way to help us all face the truth of our collective soul.  Thank you David Bowie for gracing us with<br />this poetic music.
B00000IAU3|3|Like many people I'd never heard of Dido until she did Stan with Eminem.Her contribution was most definitely the highlight of that song-yet it isn't the highlight of this c.d. at all.<br /> To me lyrically she sounds like she's had her fair share of heartbreak in the past.Many of the songs are about old flames or about missing old loves-poor girl.Musically it's quite laid back-particularly suitable for winding down after a night on the town.The songs are good if a bit bland and when you listen to the c.d. as a whole it's often hard to remember or distinguish one song from the other.I mean there are plenty of really nice songs on the c.d. and there are very few absolute awful songs-but there are very few truly outstanding or memorable songs.<br /> The one exception for me though is the opening song &quot;Here With Me&quot;-it builds up from a very quiet start,then quickens up with the acoustic guitar riff,blasts in with some heavy duty orchestration and leads to a loud sing along chorus.It's my favourite on this c.d.Hunter is a good song also.Once again it's style is very similar to the opening song acoustic quiet build up to a louder fuller complete band sound for the chorus.Then lyrically it becomes a bit tiresome as she sings about another guy who has gone off with someone new-and believe me this happens loads of times on this c.d.The chorus is good and very catchy and the strings throughout this song really keep this song interesting.The next song has a real Celtic feel to it.In fact it sounds like it could have been written 200 years ago in Ireland.Quite a few of the songs have this Celtic feel to it.They are generally more atmostpheric then loud.Song 5 All You Want is very similar in sound and feel to the previous tracks and a change of sound would have been nice for a bit of variety.Once again she's been cheated by someone.At this stage the songs and lyrics have made each song indistinguishable from each other-which is a pity because when listened to individually they  are good songs.A bit of variety in the sound would have been beneficial I feel.<br /> Then we have the Stan song Thank You.No doubt it's a great chorus but funnily enough while I'm not into Eminem I actually prefer Stan.The next two songs are slow-moving and rely as much on synthesiser effects as acoustic guitar.This is a welcome change of sound but unfortunately I think they're not as good as the previous songs.I like the song Isobel-lyrically it's a great story-held together by a loud drum beat and guitar.The understated chorus to me is very good.The whole song  is very rhythmical and builds gradually all the time as more and more instruments join in the song.The title track is similar in sound and feel to all the other songs and I didn't particularly like it.<br /> I suppose when she was making this c.d. she wasn't exactly well known.It's generally a good not great c.d.Maybe for her next c.d. she could afford to be a bit more ambitious and try to have songs of varying volume and tempo.Still it's a good &quot;late-night&quot; c.d. and it certainly won't disturb the neighbours!
B001BANK32|5|I saw the movie when it first came out, but I had never read the book. I was surprised by how well-written and literary the writing was. It was decently paced, and the tension built to the end. A very enjoyable read (vastly superior to Salem's Lot).<br /><br />There is certainly the scary stuff, but it is not up in your face until about three-quarters of the way through. To a large extent, it is a statement of the modern family, how domestic violence permeates society and affects us as we grow up with it. It deals with matters of addiction and selfishness, and other things. It contains subtlety, nuance, and metaphor. Well worth the read, even if you think of yourself as only a reader of literary fiction.
B00BMVTS1S|5|Love, love, love the Hobbitt movies. It was great to be able to purchasethis and watch it the same day.
B008578PRK|4|Enought suspense to keep you watching
B009LDCXNY|5|Good
0380804557|4|With or without the beautiful illustrations by Charles Vess, this is an enjoyable tale. Though it reads like a fairy tale, this book should appeal to more mature readers. Gaiman doesn't shy away from the darker or more risque topics if they are necessary to the story, and at the same time, doesn't overuse these topics gratuitously.<br /><br /> Stardust tells the story of Tristran Thorn, beginning with his father's early adulthood in Wall, the town that lies next to the wall that separates the realm of Faerie from the world of humans. When Tristran becomes a young man, he promises the most beautiful girl in Wall that he will go and fetch the star they just saw fall, if she will give him anything he desires, namely her hand in marriage, when he returns. She takes him up on the promise and so he goes into the land of Faerie to get it. Unbeknownst to Tristran, there are other people seeking the star, all for their own separate reasons. And none of them have really considered how the star feels about all this. On his quest, Tristran learns compassion and courage, and grows up a little somewhere along the way.<br /><br /> Stardust is a very light read. The writing style is very comfortable and natural, and this book makes a great selection to read aloud with a loved one. The motivations of all the characters are well-reasoned, and at the end, the reader feels compassion even for the most wicked of Tristran's competitors. Each of the characters seeking the star has a well-developed history and personality, all with a minimum of prose. Gaiman blends humor, romance, suspense, and action into a thoroughly enjoyable story that lets you immerse yourself in its fantasy world, if only for a little while.
B00AHGSVKS|4|I loved this tale because it is timeless and puts the trivial problems of the human race into a well deserved perspective.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who ponders the age old questions of why are we here and what is our destiny as a species?
B00OICLVBI|5|Love this book
B00DR0PDNE|5|I'm a gadget junkie. I already have a Vizio Co-Star, a Roku 2 and numerous smart TVs and Blu-Ray players. So streaming content is not all that new to me but I had to buy the Chromecast because it seemed so simple and open. After playing with it for a few days, it's well worth the $35 price tag and will likely become my default streamer of Netflix and YouTube.<br /><br />Most people now have a smartphone and/or tablet and usually have them within reach at all times. As much as I love my Co-Star, it's yet another clunky remote I have to grab for to utilize it to the max. The Roku remote is small but any searches are a pain in the backside. The Netflix interfaces on my other streaming devices are all stripped down and awful.<br /><br />The simplicity of the Chromecast is why people are going crazy over it. Grab your phone, tablet or computer and you can instantly stream to the device for the official apps or websites. As long as you have a decent router, there's almost no lag from when you input commands into your phone/tablet and when it happens on the screen. Picture is in big beautiful 1080p. The fact that the device can be operated Android and iOS is a butter, as my wife has iPhone and I have Nexus 4. My wife also hates learning how to use my new gadgets, but she learned how to use the Chromecast in about 2 minutes and is happy to bury the Roku & Co-Star remotes out of sight.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, this won't replace other streaming boxes until developers update their apps, but Google is making it pretty simple for them. But for me, I use Netflix and YouTube 95% of the time on my streaming boxes, so this will become my go to device.<br /><br />If this was $75, I'd give it 4 stars because of the lack of other services out the box, but at $35, it's a 5-star pickup and a no-brainer. I ordered two and may order some at work as this will be a nice way to show off my companies YouTube videos or show presentations during meetings without lugging a laptop around or having wires sprawled across the conference room table.
B00BSBR9N6|3|SO-SO Category. While reading this book, I could only picture Sheldon Cooper &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34;. It was a different love story and I can't say that it was very interesting. Nevertheless, it was very realistic.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Very good game, warning it is very addicting !!
B004498KPU|5|One of the best purchases I am sure I have ever made!<br /><br />What can I say? If you are a Michael Jackson fan, and I am, this is a must have for your collection!
B0054JZC6E|5|I loved this game so much I don't stop playing it till I go to sleep and I still play it in the morning
B008M4MB8K|3|I finally got around to examine the 3-disc 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition, and I'm relieved that the original theatrical version(s) are available in pristine and IMHO superior quality than the &#34;Final Cut&#34;.<br /><br />Although only the &#34;Final Cut&#34; fixed a few production goofs by means of CGI (I never found these too bothersome) and reveals slightly better miniature photography, shadow detail is partially reduced compared to the theatrical version (e.g. Bryant's police office) and in general I found the theatrical version's original cinematography more pleasant to watch.<br /><br />One of the strong suits of the film had always been how it creates &#34;atmosphere&#34; by means of photography, music and sound design. One of such highlights is the morning flight to the Tyrell-Corporation pyramid, but in the &#34;Final Cut&#34; Vangelis' beautiful score is compromised because of redundant air traffic chatter.<br /><br />But this is just a somewhat logical continuation of atmosphere deconstruction, because the biggest offender - for multiple reasons - is this awful and pointless unicorn sequence Ridley Scott felt compelled in 1992 to squeeze into the film.<br /><br />Supposedly, it was then to convey the impression that Gaff's unicorn Origami hinted that he knew of Deckard's dreams and one logical conclusion would have been that Deckard is a replicant, too (but doesn't explain why he doesn't have the replicants' superstrength).<br /><br />One of the documentaries focuses on this particular issue and it almost seems that every VIP in Hollywood throws in his or her 0.02 $, but no one ever seems to wonder what Gaff's other origamis were supposed to hint (that Deckard rather wanted to be a chicken farmer than a cop? that he was actually gay and empty Hotel rooms gave him funny ideas?).<br /><br />Always seemed to me that Gaff was making subtle symbolic and clever statements, that he considered Deckard to be a coward (chicken) or that searching other people's belongings had an exciting nature (Peeping Tom). With the unicorn being a symbol of the quest for bliss and happiness, I always felt Gaff merely understood and sympathized with Deckard's needs, adding a facet to the Gaff character that has been somewhat lost ever since 1992.<br /><br />The VIPs seemed equally oblivious to Gaff's line &#34;Too bad, she (Rachel) won't live!&#34; Assuming Deckard was a replicant with a short life-span himself, Gaff's statement would be absolutely point- and worthless.<br /><br />Now hope is a good thing and a good thing never dies, and after winding in agony listening to all this Deckard=replicant nonsense the familiar face of my favorite living filmmaker appeared on the screen and said what everybody else had obviously missed thus far: It's about a man rediscovering his humanity, if Deckard were a replicant the film wouldn't really make a lot of sense (Thank you, Frank Darabont!).<br /><br />And last but not least, Harrison Ford popped up and revealed mild astonishment, making it abundantly clear that he played the character as a genuine human being, unaware of any ambiguous aspects.<br /><br />Ain't that remarkable that Harrison Ford's characters are involved in what may just be as well the two dumbest revisions in film history?!?<br /><br />To cut a long lamentation short: Watch the original theatrical versions first (and check out the workprint version and the deleted / alternate scenes, too), these are the original context and reason for BLADE RUNNER's ongoing appeal.
B0099RFVXQ|1|Meaningless dragging of the movie makes you wonder where is the start and when would this be done! Better movies in similar category exist..
B001HM1PFO|2|Was not impressed
B004SD5GZ4|5|It's working fine.  It was downloaded onto my Kindle Fire and appears to be working just fine, so we're happy.

B00N2D52MI|5|Classic album!
B00AMBH70S|2|This movie is a 45 minute motorcycle chase. It has nothing to do with the prior &#34;Bourne&#34; movies. It was a waste of time
B0002T7ZKW|1|I'm torn. Green Day have put out some catchy albums (from the wonderful \\"1039 Smooth\\" up to \\"Nimrod\\"). BUT, I hate their singer/songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong. I just can't stand the ignorant little pixie ass. Basically, if you're not with him and follow his poor and inarticulate views on everything he believes, he mistakes that for a threat, and then proceeds to call you a whole plethora of things you'd expect a 10th grade drop-out to say to you. I don't have a problem with Billie Joe's music ability or his singing for the most part, but his lack of intelligence just irks me. He has a major Napoleon Complex. I guess you can expect that from someone so short and unschooled. Now, don't get all in a huff because I can't stand the little elf. As a whole, the band have put out some good (albeit very simple) albums. All of \\"Warning\\" sucked though. And it looks like the single for \\"American Idiot\\" is continuing the band's recent trend of glaringly-obvious lack of ideas. Maybe the full-length American Idiot album will be better, but I really don't care anymore. I just thought I'd put in my two cents. As far as I'm concerned, Green Day were at their best on their first three EPs (\\"1000 Hours\\", \\"Slappy\\", and \\"39/Smooth\\").
B005HGKW00|3|not bad
B007ZGO7EM|5|I find this app extremely useful.  It works really well for my needs. I also find that it is much easier on the kindle than trying to use my cell phone.
B00272HPDO|5|Excellent figure highly recommend it. Huge scale looks great.
B00I8Q77Y0|1|I just downloaded the game and I can only get pass one tube. So it is good but not great.
0345535529|3|The writing can be a bit wandering and unfocused, but as for fantasy goes, it's not bad.  Martin doesn't really compare to Leiber, RE Howard, and the other classic fantasy authors, but he has his place.
B00RVBY8KO|1|This is nearly three hours that I’ll never get back. If you’re not familiar with the movie (is anyone not familiar with the movie?), Boyhood has been called groundbreaking because the director filmed it over 12 years using the same cast. So you actually see Ellar Coltrane – supposedly the star of the movie – growing up from age 7 to 19. The movie is Richard Linklater showing a slice of life in each year of Mason’s life – navigating boyhood and adolescence among his divorced parents relationship, two stepfathers and a host of horrible haircuts. Lorelei Linklater – the director’s daughter – has almost equal share of the stage. Scott read somewhere that Lorelei actually became bored with the concept around the third year and asked her dad to kill her off. It would have been better for me if he’d obliged and done away with the whole lot. I understand that its nomination is from the novel idea of how it was filmed – so give him a nod for Best Director, maybe – but this movie is at best a one-trick pony and at worst a over-hyped film of terrible acting, flat dialogue and little plot. (IMDB 8.2)
0307454568|5|Loved the trilogy, read last winter and hate that Stieg Larsson is no longer with us.  My kind of good reading experience.
B00J4KZSHW|5|I loved her singing,  Very inspirational for all young children who love to sing.  I listen to it over and over again.  Highly recommend it.
1556438850|4|Good for anyone wanting to better understand the mechanics of teaching yoga.  This book starts with the history of yoga before moving into the teaching sections.  Information is included on setting up your practice area, techniques, sequencing, and working with special groups.  For me, the best part was in the section on teaching asanas where it looked at different poses and went into what to look for and emphasize for each one.  Although I do not consider myself a teacher, I do occasionally lead group practices and this book helped me make the transition from practice to leading.
B0040YFR1Y|2|This movie was horrible. Even from the beginning how do the predators put parachutes on all the victims after teleporting them to another planet? And with all the technology of the predators and aliens if they could transport people to another planet, do they really need parachutes? So many scenes were stolen from the original it was a joke. Then the plot was so bad, I mean 20 minutes into the flick Adrien Brody figures out way to much story too easily. Predator dogs? Really? I don't know whats worse wrestlers trying to act(Predator) or good actors (Adrien Brody) trying to act like a 110 lb. badass. This group of 110 lb. people are the Earths baddest badasses? OK. The Brazilian girl telling the same story about the Predator back in 1987 was just retarded. The best part of the movie was Lawrence Fishburnes part in the film, but the film was so bad he even had to get out quick. If you thought it was dumb that an Predator and a girl teamed up in AVP, well Adrien Brody does it in this flick too. I was however thankful after watching Splice that Adrien Brody didn't have sex with a Predator. If you just like mindless action, and don't care about the story or plot you should like this one. And truthfully there really isn't a lot of action.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Very nice thing, smooth and slick! It works like a charm from the beginning! The initial setup was easy and fast.
B005EGXTL2|5|A fantastic story (impossible to put down) and thought provoking at the same time.  A superb end to a this great trilogy.

B00136NUG6|4|always loved they're music, and this sure brings back all the fun I had during that era of time, loved to dance!!!
B003PIUBZS|5|Awesome videos. Because of a busy schedule, I kept my viewing time to two episodes per sit-down. I couldn't wait for the next installment.  The blood part, a little too....hoakey, still added to the overall affect of the video. I can't wait until this season is over so I can order the videos. (Don't have it on my cable TV selection.) Definitely not for those timid about violence or sex.

B000LPQ6DE|5|I first watched this version of Jane Eyre two weeks ago, and I cannot stop thinking about it! The characters and setting are all exceptionally, superbly presented...what a marvelous piece of work.  Jane Eyre is a profound love story- always was, always will be...therefore, despite certain criticism of the extent of it in this version, the passion displayed by Rochester and Jane is absolutely appropriate.   All I can say is, as far as Toby Stephens' Rochester is concerned, I am in love!- (Somebody please put me out of my misery now!!)  DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!
B008CP6RWU|5|Journey is a thought provoking game with a music and art style that combines to create an incredibly moving story line, all without the use of any text or language.<br /><br />Even if this had been 60$, I would not have regretted the purchase.

B000001EG6|5|Elton's recordings prior to this, especially the Empty sky album, are interesting, but this is the album that catapulted him into the big time, where he has remained ever since. The tracks for this album are dated January 1970, but only ten of them appeared on the original album. Other tracks were released as singles. This re-mastered edition includes four bonus tracks taken from the original sessions.<br /><br />The first single, Border song, made the American charts but became a bigger hit for Aretha Franklin, who thus became the first singer as far as I know to have a hit with a cover of an Elton John song. Elton's own follow-up to Border song was a UK-only single coupling two tracks (Rock and roll Madonna, Grey seal) that were omitted from the original album, but which are included here. Elton later re-recorded Grey seal for his classic album Goodbye yellow brick road, but the version here is his rarer first recording of the song.<br /><br />The next single was Your song, released in America following impressive live performances there. The B-side of that single, Take me to the pilot, features lyrics that even their writer Bernie Taupin admits are meaningless. He sometimes does that sort of thing but points out that the words sound good together and that's what matters. Yet Bernie was also capable of writing meaningful lyrics of a high quality, and his best songs all share that chat eristic. While the best example here is Your song, others include The greatest discovery (about the birth of a baby), Sixty years on (reflecting on what the future might offer; about forty of those sixty have so far elapsed) and First episode at Hienton (inspired by a time in Bernie's youth).<br /><br />This was a great album, but even greater albums were to follow in the ensuing years.
B004FOA84A|1|Graphics looked great, storyline interesting...BUT....When i went to settings, muted sound effects and lowered the volume and the program was still super loud.  Shame, it seemed interesting.  Uninstalled.
0679805273|5|Love this book!
B00G5G7K7O|5|Excelente
B00006879E|5|SONGS ABOUT JANE is sure to become a classic pop/rock album.Released way back in the summer of 2002 its about time fans and radio stations alike have finally taken notice to this great album. The first single HARDER TO BREATHE, was just a tip of the iceberg and if you like variety, you have found the right album. The second single, THIS LOVE,  blends pop, with rock and dance and is a song that you cant help singing and dancing along with. There are also ballads to choose from as well and I would look for either MUST GET OUT or SHE WILL BE LOVED to be possible single choices sometime in the near future.<br />Other standout tracks on the album include SUNDAY MORNING, THROUGH WITH YOU & THE SUN with each track on the album sounding distinctly differant.<br />There are definate R & B/funk influences all over this album and will all of the rap songs and R & B ballads taking over the pop charts these days, it is very refreshing to hear a group like Maroon 5 and songs like HARDER TO BREATHE and THIS LOVE getting significant play at radio.<br />Buy this album today and be prepared to sing and dance all day and make sure you catch them live when they come to a town near you.

This music never feels tiring--always Fresh and just different enough to keep me on my toes. I get transported back to the black beaches, icebergs, and waterfalls. But even if you've never been to Iceland, this music enthralls.

B00TU9UO1W|5|A MUST SEE
B003THJA1G|5|One of the greatest shows ever.
B000005JA8|5|Some people think this album is cacophonous and shrill.  This is true for someone who's never heard any point of reference for this album.<br />Combine Delta Blues and freedom jazz (Albert Ayler, Ornette Coleman, Sun Ra, any number of folks) and you've got a reference point.<br />You see, when you have a piece of music, the lines in the different parts don't have to be the same length.  You might have 20 beats where one part plays 5 bars of 4 and one part plays 4 bars of 5 (you've heard the Beatles do this with 12 beats at the end of &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&quot; -- the guitars play a waltz, where the drums play in 4).  <br />Or you could have 17 beats in one part and 12 beats in another and they stop and end at the same time.  <br />Or you could have one part start to get faster and faster, and go out of sync with the others, and have them hit together several bars later.<br />This album does this a *lot*.  Does it make it cacophonous?  Perhaps if you've never heard this happen before.    <br />Is this album random?  No it has a definite formula -- basically each part has something to play, and they play each bit a few times (usually until they all hit together) and then another, link them together until the poem runs out.  Don Vliet shouts/sings his poetry over it, sometimes completely out of sync, sometimes very tight, sometimes just in sync, and sometimes drifting in and out.<br />There *are* rather normal rock songs on this album (check &quot;Moonlight On Vermont&quot;, &quot;Veteran's Day Poppy&quot;, &quot;Sugar 'n' Spikes&quot; or the ever popular &quot;Myhumangetsmeblues.&quot;  There's a straightforward blues tune (&quot;China Pig&quot;).  One song even showed up on another album in a different form (&quot;Pachuco Cadaver&quot; vs the song &quot;The Spotlight Kid&quot; on the album &quot;The Spotlight Kid.&quot;)  One song (&quot;Hair Pie&quot;) is played twice, in a slow version versus a fast version.  <br />But there's a lot of brain-food and geometric shaping of time in this music (you can't be wigged out and make this, no way).  Once you figure out how the shapes shift, it won't sound strange, but it might be a *new language* for you.

B000084T18|4|GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' is 50 Cent's major label debut with Eminem and Dr. Dre at the helm of producing. The set is pretty solid; however some songs definitely sounded like filler material like LIKE MY STYLE, 50 QUESTIONS, and POOR LIL' RICH. Some songs are just downright solid bangers like IN DA CLUB, PATIENTLY WAITING, and P.I.M.P. This is the first time I've heard what Eminem had to offer as a producer, and its awesome! I highly suggest buying this set.<br />Here are my top three favorites:<BR>1. P.I.M.P.<BR>2. DON'T PUSH ME<BR>3. IN DA CLUB

B00D7Z4GQY|4|Can someone say OCD?  That describes Cecilia’s life.  She’s a good wife; a good mother; a Tupperware Host.  In fact, their whole life is planned out as if they were arranged in Tupperware containers.  The Husband’s Secret is about Cecilia; Rachel; and Tess as their lives intersect in the same community in Sydney.  Cecilia’s ‘Tupperware-style’ life came crashing to a halt one day when she found an envelope her husband, John-Paul, had hidden.  It simply said, “For my wife, Cecilia Fitzpatrick – To be opened only in the event of my death.”  Poor Tess.  Her husband had ‘fallen in love’ with her cousin who also happened to be her closest friend.  Then, there’s Rachel.  Her much beloved daughter’s life had been extinguished twenty-eight years prior.  But, she knew who was responsible, and one of these days he was going to pay.<br /><br />The Husband’s Secret began a little slow, but once it picked up it captivated me.  I can’t say that the characters were lovable – they weren’t.  OK – well maybe the children were lovable.  Humans are all very complex and the characters here share that complexity as they make individual choices which affect all of those around them.  The author effectively transitions by chapter from one character to the other.  The story is as much a mystery as it is about the lives of these three women as they each face their own heartaches.  I rated this novel at 4 out of 5.
1401216676|5|Awesome read!!!
B004NOH9LC|5|This is a feel good and realistic view of what producers go through behind the scenes of a show. Loved Harrison Ford's character. Cantankerous! Diane Keaton - diva. If you want a light-hearted movie - here you go! Oh and the back plot of the love story of the main character is - not typical of this type of movie.

1451627297|3|I enjoyed the characters, but the protagonist's motivation for taking on the \\"mission\\" is questionable and the ending was a bit hokey. Preferred Under the Dome. Although, like Dome, this one was also too long. (I should also add I wasn't born until the 70s and don't have the same feelings and recollections of the previous era as those alive then might have.)

B00005AXEL|5|In her first solo album sinse 1994's &quot;Street Angel&quot;,Stevie Nicks releases possibly her best solo effort ever! Perhaps in time,even better than her multi platinum 1981 solo debut,&quot;Bella Donna&quot;. Nicks has always been one of America's best singer/songwriters,and this collection demonstrates her vivid storytelling,backed by infectuous harmonies and lush production.The initial singles,&quot;Everyday&quot;(the first video clip being played on VH1),and the fantastic rocker,&quot;Planets of the universe&quot; are already being embraced by radio,and there are many potential hit singles here! &quot;I miss you&quot; is gorgeous,and is my pick for the second video/single! &quot;Too far from Texas&quot; is charming with Natalie Maines,of Dixie Chicks backing Nicks' suprisingly twangy strong vocals! &quot;Sorcerer&quot;,with Sheryl Crow finds Nicks hitting high notes she hasn't hit sinse &quot;Dreams&quot;,with increadible ease. &quot;Fall from grace&quot; is an intence epic of a rocker. It is easily the hardest rocking song on the entire collection,ending with a fury.&quot;That made me stronger&quot; details her converstation with Tom Petty,when she asked him to help her writer's block(&quot;Well you know me better than know myself,will you write this for me? He says NO,you write your songs yourself&quot;). And what would a Stevie Nicks album be,without her long-time back-up singers,Lori Perry-Nicks,and Sharon Celani? Their gorgeous backing vocals,along with the many guests appearing on this sterling disc,delivers a most satasfying listening experiance.Stevie Nicks is an American Rock icon,and with this new release,she will continue that legacy with old and new fans alike. This music is addictive,infectuous,and very touching. There is not one bad track on the entire album. Do I smell a GRAMMY?? THE WITCHY WOMAN IS BACK! AND BETTER THAN EVER! Look-out Britney,Backstreet,and all you teen pop stars! STEVIE IS GOING TO TWIRL HER WAY to the top of the charts with some REAL rock &quot;n&quot; roll! It's about time some GOOD music returned to the mainstream! Stevie Nicks is one of the most beautiful woman in the world,looking years younger than her age,and one of the most animated performers in rock.

B00B2V66VS|5|This game is fun and challenging. A good way to pass the time in line or waiting for an appointment or to pick someone up. Easily started and put down and then begun again when you need to kill more time.
B004EPYZSU|2|Did not do it for my dad who loves westerns and did not do it for me who loves Sci-Fy.
B000JMKTLO|5|Kept me on my toes!!  It was what I expected from Gillian great writing!!
B003NFM3JU|4|One of my movie regrets is not seeing this film in the theaters equipped with 3-D.  Every holiday season I keep hoping some theater books it even for a return, limited run on an IMAX screen in 3-D.<br /><br />A wonderful, imaginative version of the classic.  Yeah, it has the CGI over-the-top moments, but those are offset by the quieter, and more interesting scenes such as the ghost of Christmas Present, or the celebration at Tiny Tim's home.<br />While it's updated with spectacular special effects especially tailored to pop out in 3-D, the script stays fairly faithful to the original story.<br />Kudos to Carrey.<br /><br />Love this film and watch it every year.
0385504209|1|As an occasional fan of the &quot;thriller&quot; genre and an avid reader, I was looking forward to reading this much-publicized book.  I was severely disappointed.  While some of the background information regarding early Christians and alternate gospels is interesting, it cannot begin to make up for the poorly paced and developed plot and the cardboard characters.  Even by the standards of mystery and thriller writing (admittedly not as high as the standards for the literary novel), this novel is badly written. Such popular novelists as John Grisham, Stephen King and countless other mystery and thriller writers are much better writers than Dan Brown. It is a sad comment on the level of expectation of the reading public that so many readers consider this novel well-written.
B008Y6UNT0|4|Very poignant story. My son actually watched this movie in his history class.
B00B5A9FLY|1|I throughly enjoyed the whole series, even when it was a little uneven.  So I was really looking forward to buying the series with the commentary.  I started at the last episode, hoping for some more ideas as to where the main characters had ended up.  Instead there was a shoddy, puerile voiceover from Katie MacGrath and Julian Murphy.  It felt like being slapped in the face.  Don't bother buying the boxed set for completion.  It was an insult.  The fans deserved better not least for the abruptness of the ending after some quite patchy episodes.  Not worth it.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|Great game I would recommend anyone to play! It needs to be updated more frequently so you can play with people on other devices tho! But it still is a great game, it also gives me some time to learn to play so when I join my friends world im not such a noob. LoL &eth;&eth;&eth;&eth;&macr;
B005V2EVBQ|1|My Kindle falls down- cut is not deep enough to hold the kindle up. I am still looking for just the right way to hold the Kindle up while reading
B007REV4YI|5|The best of the new Bonds, keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Also serves to introduce new characters for up-coming films.
0385341008|4|Written as a series of letters the story reveals life on the Island of Guernsey during the 2nd World War.  The effect of the German invasion on Islanders.  Told with humour and in a unique literary style this book is a very enjoyable read.
B0060MYM3S|5|Couldn't get through the books (my wife is ripping through them) but the HBO series is fantastic. Highly recommended for lovers of high fantasy and just good television alike.
B00008CLOA|5|Awesome
B00H7MW31S|3|Lea Michele has a great voice, especially  when she is belting out show tunes. She didn't seem that comfortable covering popular songs for people in her age range. Also, I have to wonder about the format of the songs; every song started with the same intro and same ending. I think she could do much better.
B00BSBY38A|5|Excellent !!!  A great family weekend watching this movie !!! I recommend this movie for a evening in family and friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Very addictive
B00CL66FEQ|3|It was a funny good movie with a feel good ending. There were some pretty funny scenes especially when she gets mad at her son and goes out to the bar without him. It wasn't outstanding but a good movie.
B0016Q2D5M|1|Very disappointed.  The center plastic holder was broken and the dvd was loose causing a slight scratch which could effect the viewing of the movie.  As it was a gift, I am extremely doubtful as to whether I should give it to her.
B003O86FMW|4|I really like the story concept and the story line flowed very nicely making you want to just keep reading
B007MG360G|5|i must admit that i liked it but this one left me wanting more to do with it. make more please!
B00IOVH8AW|5|What can I say? This song makes me HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY!!! I can listen to it all day. And I have...lol.
B00BLCHZC2|1|I hated this show. It has a lot of stupid ideas that make the show weak and unrealistic don't waste your time and watch it.
B004GFN11A|5|great
B005CVWWJY|4|It won't win any awards I don't think but an interesting read. Recommended if you like video game history etc.
B001ANSSDC|4|This was a fast read, a page turner for sure. I only gave it 4 stars because I expected a more dramatic end after the giant build up.  However, I really enjoyed this book.
B008MG1E4A|5|This is a book I thing EVERY American should read. It really gives you an inside look at what our service men, women and families have to go through to serve and protect our Nation. What an eye-opener!
B002Z8LPZ4|3|WHITEOUT was an enjoyable movie. Alot of twists and turns and \\"WHO DID IT'S\\". But without Kate Beckinsale (as always a great actress!) it probably wouldn't have been as good as it was.
B000QCS8TW|4|To be honest I was actually forced to read this book... My son, back from Iraq, was going crazy over these books saying that he loved this entire series and it kept him busy with something to read and kept his sanity as well... I was recommending a few books for him to read, not that he will, but stated that i would read his book, if he reads one of mine, fair is fair I thought... Because this is NOT the type of book I would read. It's total fantasy, which I've never read that genre.<br /><br />Really, the a total fantasy world made up in someone's mind... I mean I do enjoy a fantasy book, but this was REALLY fantasy... in my opinion WAY OUT THERE... but I finally got through the book, and midway, I found that it wasn't such a chore to read, after being very reluctant to read it... but I made a deal with my son.<br /><br />As I was saying, half way through the book I finally gave in and actually started enjoying the book and when the book ended it left me very curious... so curious in fact, that i went ahead and orderd the next 3 books, and knowing that #5 will be out at some point.<br /><br />Now, if I could only get him to read the book(s) I wanted him to read... lol... that's next :)
B00GTCECVG|5|It is one of the only games I play on my device any more because of how fun and intriguing, when I play it I get so effervescent in the game it is exemplary.
B00MVSCI18|5|Grohl is a genius.  Having Butch Vig in tow helps ;&#62;)
B000069CWE|4|Alot of people consider this to be the evil twin of Hybrid Theory. You can say that but I don't care.  Reanimation is a bit more advanced then Hybrid theory and there's alot of underground musicians in here. Half of it is rock and half of it is rap But it makes it better.  Some of remixes are a bit worse then the original.  Some are about as good as some are much better. Alot of them sound even completely different (also with altered lyrics) then from the original hybrid theory as well.  <br /> <br />Ente E ND could have been better.  Its much more rap and has no rock feeling to it at all.  They changed the lyrics.  If you are really into rap you'll love this song.  But I was a bit disapointed since the orignal one was all the hype in the first one and I think it was much better.  The ones that I think are much better than the original is the bymself remix, with you remix, and the pushing me away remix.  They got a whole lot better. <br /> <br />My favorites are P5hing me A-wy, the my december, and with you. <br /> <br />Also a real treat is that linkin park  managed to add remix tracks from the japanese imported hybrid theory (my december, high voltage) that is not included in the U.S. ones.  If you are a linkin park fan I highly recommend you buy this if you have hybrid theory.  Remixes are nice to listen to for a change, and fortunetly this one won't be that disapointing.
B00FAPF5U0|4|The only negative side of this game is that they only give you five lives at a time.  Besides that its awesome!
B0044C5SCU|5|Loved it.
0439023521|5|This was a gripping book. While it is referred to as \\"teen fiction\\" I think one can use the term \\"teen\\" loosely; while it might be geared toward a younger age bracket, adults will certainly enjoy it as well. It's well-written with an excellent plot, and the themes are certainly very adult (e.g. rebelling against big brother, human rights, the role of violence). I read the entire series in two days; you absolutely cannot put them down.   That said, it's obviously not a universally appealing book. The same themes that make the novel thought-provoking are upsetting, and the action that makes you unable to put them down will not appeal to all. Collins kills characters, which isn't easy. But she does so for the advancement of the plot and to make the grim dystopia more threatening and tangible. The violence is neither gratuitous nor over the top, given the premise of the series. I generally don't like violent stories, but found these very compelling. They'll leave you emotionally drained and hungering for more. I would recommend parental judgement be used if younger teens want to read these.  A brief introduction: This is set in a future, dystopian North America in the nation of Panem. There are twelve districts ruled by the Capitol. At some point in the past, they and a thirteenth district rebelled. The Capitol triumphed and destroyed the thirteenth district. As punishment and a reminder of their subservience, each of the twelve must send one boy and one girl (ages 12-18) as tribute to the Capitol each year to participate in the \\"Hunger Games.\\" The tributes are placed in an arena made to look like some ecosystem (it could be a desert, jungle, tundra, anything) and have fight to the death. These games are televised and serve as \\"entertainment.\\" The victor is sent home wealthy. The districts range in affluence. The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is from the very poor District 12 that mines coal. This places District 12 tributes at a disadvantage, as they possess no fighting skills and are often malnourished.  Katniss is a feisty, likeable heroine. She and the other characters are well-developed. Collins is an excellent writer who successfully combines action with character development and dry humor. I highly recommend these books; you won't be able to put them down!  Katniss is a resourceful sixteen-year-old who often breaks the law to sneak under a fence and hunt in the woods, which is forbidden. She must do this to survive, as her father was killed years ago in a mining accident. This caused her mother to become depressed, and the burden of providing for her mother and sister, Prim, fell to Katniss. She became a successful hunter and gatherer, skilled with a bow. She loves Prim more than anything. When tributes are chosen, Prim is nervous. Katniss comforts her, telling her that since she is only 12, her name is only in the lottery once, and she is unlikely to be chosen. Unfortunately, she is. At this, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  She is then flung into a world in which she must dress and act a certain way to gain support and sponsors, who may pay to ease her way in the Games. Advised only by a former victor from her district, the perpetually drunk Haymitch Abernathy, she must learn quickly. Along the way, she gets to know her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark. She becomes close to her stylist, Cinna, who is a source of support and wisdom for her.  As she and Peeta spin tales of love to gain sympathy, Katniss must decide whose feelings are real and fake. And in the arena, she must fight to survive. The choices she makes change her, and ultimately affect all of Panem.
B00COGXGNQ|5|So good, in fact that men might like it too.  Kind of a mixture between Sleeping With The Enemy and a Lifetime tv movie.  I enjoyed it a lot...great suspenseful ending. Filmed in Southport, North Carolina.  Just a nice, easy love story with good actors and a good plot. Highly recommended for what it is!
B004XUMMFE|5|Great show
B0031RAOVY|5|I chose this rating because the movie touched my heart and I cried like a baby.  It made it even more special to know that it<br />was based on a true story.
B009FB3W3W|5|This was a last minute order as a birthday present and it came on time!Now I just need a vinyl player!
B0089EHWQE|5|Five star love story!!  It's been years since I read a book that produced real tears.  Get your Kleenex ready.  I couldnt put it down, so pretty much a straight-thru read!  I normally do not like historical novels but made an exception and I'm so glad I did.  This book is relevant for any time period.
B00CWY76CC|3|I am glad this was a free app. It needs more levels. It was pretty easy. My kids enjoyed it more than me.
B004H1V5RU|5|The product came in great shape and functions perfectly. Provides hours of fun for all ages. Family, friends, and coworkers.
B007J4T2G8|2|Not enough spaces to explain so Ill just say as an erotic story it's fine but as a novel that could hold my interest and keep me reading, well......No. I could not make it to the end of the book.  I really do not get what all the hype is about, but to each his own.
1401232590|2|The real tragedy of this title is not the weak, contrived ending nor the bizarre and pointless parade of Batman's Rogue Gallery . . . it's that Sale and Loeb could have really put together a fantastic Batman mystery if they'd been pressed to.  Let me start off that Sale's artwork tends to be a little polarizing. People love it or they hate it, and it is very stylized. I enjoyed the moody, noir feeling Sale's deep shadows and muted colors evoke, I enjoyed the architecture of Gotham, and there were many splash pages that were artistically satisfying. Some weak anatomy and draftsmanship mistakes conveniently blacked out by a dramatic shadow are hardly unique to Tim Sale, and credit must be given where it's due. The Long Halloween has some very well-drawn pages and panels.  Loeb, on the other hand, really wastes the opportunity to write a beefy, 300+ page Batman mystery - something many writers would eat their own word processors to have the opportunity to do - by slathering his narrative with tired Godfather references, cliche Mafia tropes, and a hackneyed, clumsy mystery resolution that comes out of nowhere and makes no sense in the context of the story. I get the sense that Loeb was really into writing his mystery, but kept running into plot holes and lulls in the story that he had no idea how to work through . . . and that he wrote the ending before he wrote the story. His attempt to dove-tail his 'surprise' killer's motivations and drives with the slow and meandering narrative of his mystery is almost embarrassing to wade through. It's like having to watch a stand-up comedian bomb on stage . . . for almost 400 pages.  Sadly, the build-up to the reveal is actually interesting, the interest in the killer's identity grows as the story unfolds. The Harvey Dent sub-plot, while predictable and very cookie-cutter Batman story-telling, is nevertheless solid and holds up as the tale progresses. But the ending, the mystery resolution and the steps that lead to it are so badthat they overshadow and eclipse the aspects of the book that succeed at what they try to do.  The Long Halloween is a decent enough read if you don't want to think too critically about the story and/or attempt to solve the mystery before the characters do. Sale's artwork is well worth seeing, although it's quality is a topic of subjectivity. But if you're in the mood for a meatier, more cerebral treatment of Gotham's Dark Knight . . . you won't find it here.
B005K0HDGE|5|I have never been into fright fiction so this is my first Stephen King novel. NO spoilers.<br />I thought King did an excellent job developing the characters so readers care about what happens to them. I also liked the science fiction thread of time travel and what happens, if it could happen, when people go back in time and change the past. I liked the analogies that were used, toward the end, and how the same characters are repeated in the novel but with different intentions and situations. I also liked the thought that while the immediate might be able to be changed, the outcome, ultimately, is set in time and eventually catches up.<br />It's hard to write too much without giving things away and then what would be the point to reading the book. I will say that this book has very little to do with the JFK assassination and more to do with everyday people and their search for significant things in life. Woe be to the traveller who finds their passion whether in profession or personal life in the past. It's also a statement that perhaps things happen as they should and changing them can have very bad consequences.<br />Most interesting is reading this book and asking one's self, what would I do? While I realize we can't travel back in time it makes for interesting guessing none the less. What part of history would we not change to 'save' ourselves.<br />I recommend this work and I would read other non-horror fiction by King.
B004EPYZXK|4|Well acted, great effects, fun.  I wasn't expecting much when I saw the other reviews, but was pleasantly surprised - and I'm a jaded sci-fi geek.
B0006GVJEE|5|If you loved the U.S. theatrical release of this movie and dvd you will love this deluxe edition with the long version or European theatrical release which is 23 minutes longer and a second disc with behind the scenes footage and documentary.
B005XQLBU4|5|Fantastically simple and fun
B000002UBB|5|Big sigh of relief after getting this and finding it is the exact recording of the original vinyl. I've read a lot of bad reviews of various F.L.A.E. re-issues - saying that the intro had been cut to :12, and that the track transitions weren't seamless like on the album. Fortunately (although analog folks won't agree), this sounds great and I couldn't be happier! I about wore this album out when I was in high school, and it was just fantastic to put it on again and hear those trippy synths and great musicianship of Stevie, Lonnie Turner, Gary Mallaber (most underrated drummer of all time!), J. Young, Dudek, and on and on. It's in my virtual Top Ten (\\"virtual,\\" since there are about 20 albums in my Top Ten!) and I'll probably even get a hold of one of those \\"funny\\" cigarettes that I used to smoke and give it another listen. Not that it needs it tho! They just don't make 'em like this anymore!
B00E9ZATKI|5|the grandkids were fascinated by it.
B0086700CM|5|jeez it took them long enough! but anyway temple run is soooo addicting and dun so i definatly recommend this app.
0790731452|4|The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was a big dissappointment.  Then I started to think about it.  Usually, when I dislike something for no  reason that I can really put my finger on, it is because it has challenged  my expectations in some way.  For this reason, I like to re-examine my  feelings about those things.  And often, after reflection, I realize what  it is that disturbs me, and I realize why the thing that I hate addresses  that, and often it makes me enjoy the thing I &quot;Hated&quot;  more.<br />This movie is like that. One of the things that bothered me so much  was the lack of reason for the alien attack, and their resulting brutality.   A little after I watched the movie, I found out why this is so, while  reading a book &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me,&quot; which related the  following tale concerning Columbus:<br />In 1492, Colomubus landed in what is  now the Dominican Republic.  He got off of the boat, and read a short  proclimation that said (essentially,)  &quot;I am taking this place over,  you must now immediatly renounce your pagan gods, convert to Christianity,  claim Isabella of Spain as your ruler, or I will make you slaves, and you  will work until you die, and I will not be held responsible for your  souls.&quot;  Columbus read this proclimation in Spanish, which of course,  none of the native people of the Dominican Republic could understand.  They  greeted him with a huge party, and Columbus proceeded to decimate the  natives.  The Spaniards forced the Indians to work, and rode on their backs  rather than walk from place to place.  Does this not strike you as  ridiculous? The same kind of mindless destruction for the sake of  destruction that the movie portrays?<br />What disturbed me about the movie  was it's quiet censure of our society, our modern world, our own arrogance.   In this movie we get our comeuppance, and it is delivered with the same  heartless passion that our uncivilized ancestors imposed on the indigenouspopulations. There is no why or how, there is only the relentless onslaught  of a technologically superior race that finds glee in our destruction, who  no doubt, intend to usurp our world.<br />In the War of the Worlds, we are  saved by Influenza, in real life, Influenza and small pox, brought by  Euroopeans, decimated indigenous populations.  Wells original parallel was  intended to be a subtle irony, a tribute to our tiniest, and most  unobtrusive weapon.  <br />Here we are saved by Slim Whitman's &quot;Indian  Love Call,&quot; an outrageous twist, but not one without it's irony.   Whitman wrote the song as an appeal to the romanticization of the American  Indian that occurred in the late 50's. It bears no real ties to native  american lore or tradition, other than it's name.  It is a romantic view of  a past that never happened, our &quot;plasticization&quot; of the very  people we've killed.  Isn't it odd that we would be saved by a cheesy  lounge song written about a people we killed with smallpox and war, while  we are being decimated with no hope of survival, in much the same manner?   Its doubly ironic that something so insidious, both in sound, and concept,  should turn out to be invariably fatal to our invaders.  Our bad taste  killed them. <br />I might suggest to those that are easily angered when their  expectations of an &quot;Independance Day&quot; style romp are foiled, that  they examine their dissappointment and ask themselves, &quot;why did this  bother me so much?&quot;  When you do, you'll often find that you are being  challenged to think or look at a thing in another light by your brain,  which is often smarter than you might think.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love it its awesome its the best the the only sentence I could say I just love this game
B005LAJ17M|5|Best Drama on TV. Maybe Ever. Period. Mandy Patinkin is the star as far as I'm concerned. This is a must watch for any thrill seeker.
B000XUBFE2|3|This book is a defnite page turner. I love that it is narrated by Death. But the book is backdropped in Germany, during WW II, so it is, if I may use this contradiction, a bright downer. The prose is gorgeous...it's written like English literature of old, where German in interspersed with English, sometimes translated, sometimes not. It gives the book an old world feel. and Oddly enough, the tone of Death's language is expressed in a comforting way and He moves you along swiftly, surely and calmly to the inevitable end. And isn't that what Death ultimately does, anyway? I am happy I took the chance (Kindle edition, $2.99) instead of seeing the movie.
B0064MPXFA|5|So smart, great writing! I highly recommend it .  I'm starting from the beginning and watching all over again.  You won't be sorry
B007J4T2G8|4|I started reading the book out of curiosity as soon as my Kindle Fire arrived. I didn't even think about all the fuss going about an erotic fiction novel like this taking avid readers by storm. It comes as no surprise to me how Anastasia Steele fits together in this horribly astounding sexual world of Christian Grey. Probably a lot of men dream to be this guy, though not as much as to the extent of his disturbing behavior and dominance.<br /><br />The book is quite well-written; I get to imagine what it is like in the world of the characters and the POV of Ana does really share plenty of witty and sexual detail (at most parts). Some real life issues arise, like abuse & even world hunger for some reason that are interesting in the development of Fifty Shades. Christian Grey, a man that has no idea about love, relationships and commitment but has awfully plenty of knowledge with sex, BDSM and control, meets Anastasia Steele, a college graduate who, innocent at first, gets entangled in his wild and confusing world filled in a DOM/SUB contract. She is definitely not the submissive he's ever expected or perhaps ever loved?<br /><br />The quest to find out the deep, sexual world of Fifty Shades is something that doesn't get understood easily so remember to read at your own risk and who knows, you might get hooked with this. Kudos to E. L. James
0142421715|3|The book, Crossed, is a satisfactory book filled to the brim with adventure and romance capturing the reader's attention. The use of two narratives throughout the book is a fascinating idea, as this allows a chapter to include a 'cliff-hanger' towards the end, maintaining the reader's attention. The use of poetry is clever, seeing the reason for Cassia desiring the revolution named \\"The Rising\\" is from a poem given to Cassia by her grandfather. Despite the admirable work put into Crossed, there is one flaw. The book would race through essential topics, thereupon referring back to that topic. However, the reader would not remember the section clearly because of how unnecessary it appeared at the point when they read it . Crossed is recommended greatly to others of any age because it is well written and full of shocks.
B000L43AN4|5|In a word, I would describe Orpans as 'amazing'. With a composition style that matches his voice, however, Waits puts together a compendium of work that isn't for everyone. Let me clarify what I mean: I don't believe that there is a such thing as a casual Tom Waits fan. You either love him or you loathe him. Outside of a couple of songs that have made movie soundtrack appearances, and a cover version of his work done by Rod Stewart, there isn't too much that he has put out that garners a whole lot of commercial exposure. An unfamiliar buyer would probably not pick this up. So far as \\"fans\\" who may be critical, what else would you expect? If you were expecting a perfect flow, or Easy Listening, then of course you will be disappointed. But, then, you probably aren't familiar enough with Waits to be able to appreciate what he does here. <br /> <br />What has he done? Assembled an incredible array of style and poetry that may be unparalleled by anything, save perhaps the Beatles White Album. It is not really possible to describe the range of Orphans without writing a dissertation, so I won't attempt to. I will say this: go with your gut. If you are a true fan of Tom Waits, then buy it immediately (...if you haven't already). You will not be disappointed. If you are new to Waits but are interested in his work, then I would recommend Raindogs or Swordfishtrombone as a better starting point. If you are someone who would describe yourself as a fan of conventional melodies and songwriting, who has never heard of Tom Waits, but has just heard a song that you liked on a college radio station, then I would advise you to stay away from this.
1564029654|5|Have read this to my granddaughter a bout a hundred times. We love it!
B00003CX6P|4|This movie was definitely a shocker ! It was absolutely not what I expected. Was this good ? Yes and no.Here's the good part:  The previews and ads led me to believe it was another typical film about someone  assuming the identity of another for wealth, power and the girl.I was under  the impression that Ripley was not only after Dickie Greenleaf's life but  his girlfriend as well.Instead, Ripley has another hidden agenda. For those  who have not seen the film, I refuse to divulge what Ripley's real sinister  intentions are ! <br />The bad is that the film ended with a feeling of an  unsatisfying closure. However, I'm sure it was done so as not to follow the  all too typical ending where the villain gets his just rewards ! It almost  had an undertone sub-plot feeling of Single White Female as well with a  Hitchcock twist...
B00AN0KBJC|4|I love the series. However, the episode 8 was the same as the final episode. I really wish I could see the finally episode of season 2!<br />I would rate it 5 stars if I actually received all the episodes I fully paid for.
B0000DJZB9|4|Ok
B002U5HKZ6|5|This is a delightful read for those who want to get a taste of indian culture from the perspective of a foreigner living there. Besides the culture, this book offers the reader a variety of topics and genres all beautifully merged in one story. I haven't finished the book yet, but I' m excited to see what comes next! Gregory David Thomas is a genius at story-telling, and at really making the reader feel as if they are right there in the middle of the action with the characters and the mysterious protagonist. Highly recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|3|When I am running I just randomly die in this game. But otherwise it's a good game. I like it.<br />I recommend it for people who like the movie.
B008PWUTJC|5|Perfect fit for Kindle Paperwhite. Protects from damage to Kindle either naked or with a skin on. I didn't want a bulky case for travel because I like how lightweight the Paperwhite feels without a fancy case. Paired this black sleeve with a carbon fiber skin by Armorshield. I think it looks as tough and masculine as an e-reader can look.
B008JGSM6G|5|Fun, sometimes it's easy....sometimes it's not easy at all.
B0018QOIXU|5|It was a nice gift
B00FAPF5U0|5|Love this game.  Keeps my interest and challenges you the deeper you go.
B00004LN16|5|Well since it's release on Tues. (2-29), I HAVEN'T STOPPED LISTENING TO IT!  This is by far their best release in 20 years, I believe due in most part to the return of George Young as producer.George has brought back the  basic early AC-DC sound yet it retains the hard hitting drive of recent  years. The rawness of this album recalls the days of &quot;Let There Be  Rock&quot; and &quot;Powerage&quot;. Angus and Brian both sound better than  ever,(man Brian how your voice is still holding up is amazing!), but I give  extra marks to Phil, Malcolm, and Cliff. Phil Rudd (so glad you're back in  the band)is sounding like the 'ole Phil of the early albums,Cliff's bass  lines have more freedom in this album than in the past few, and Malcolm is  really laying down good riff's to compliment Angus's playing. This is the  sound that I was hoping AC-DC would return to, a more &quot;bluesy&quot;  and &quot;rockin boogie&quot; feel, and from the sounds of Stiff Upper Lip,  they have done just that.For all you AC-DC fans out there, this album is a  must!
0441172717|4|This book isn't bad, however, it doesn't have the edge that some of the other classics have. The main attraction of Dune, is its characters and setting. I have to admit the plot gets monotonious and hard to read at  times. The main reason that I didn't give five stars, was because the  unreal change that Paul goes through to become prophet. He changes his  personality, and thus the quality of the book (for the worse),
B009NQKPUW|3|Not bad story line and concept but, no comparison to the original Alien. Price was right, .99 cents, so no complaints.

B00004RITP|4|Many conductors choose to conduct only the opening Adagio from this symphony, because it was the only movement fully completed by Mahler. Back in 1980, the young conductor Simon Rattle made quite a splash with his release of the Cooke version of the Mahler 10th as completed by musicologist Deryck Cooke. Others had recorded this completed version before, notably Eugene Ormandy, but it was the Rattle recording that really captured people's attention. I owned that version on LP, then some years later (it was released in 1992) purchased the EMI CD, which I still own.<br /><br /> In 1999, Sir Simon Rattle was appointed as the new music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, and he turned to the Mahler 10th for his first recording with that distinguished ensemble. This release was made from live performances that took place in September, 1999. The performances have almost a chamber-music kind of sound, which is a mixed blessing. On the plus side, the music seems lovingly played, with many lovely lines coming to the forefront. On the minus side, the music at times comes across as muted, restrained, almost timid, particularly in the opening Adagio. Although it may well be that memory has exaggerated what I actually heard at the time, I can recall being awed by the power that Sir Georg Solti unleashed from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on a London LP back in the vinyl era.<br /><br /> Also, there have been other versions of the 10th, such as Remo Mazzetti, Jr.'s original performing arrangement as performed by the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Leonard Slatkin, reviewed above. One thing that sticks out in my mind about that version is that Mazzetti used a solo string bass in the last movement in place of the tuba that Cooke had used; the string bass sound struck me as much more appropriate. Telarc released a recording of the new Mazzetti arrangement performed by the Cincinnati Orchestra under their departing conductor Jes&uacute;s L&oacute;pez-Cobos (reviewed below), and there are versions by Carpenter and Wheeler on various labels.<br /><br /> So, where does this all leave the new recording by Sir Simon? If you are a Mahler lover, you probably ought to pick up this disk. Sir Simon loves this music, the orchestra plays with precision, and this really is a disk that Mahler lovers ought to hear. For those new to Mahler who want to explore the repertoire, this disk would be an excellent choice for a first 10th.ions by Carpenter and Wheeler on various labels.

0307592839|5|I'm a formerly voracious reader that goes through phases of disenchantment with the state of the novel today. But this book just takes off in a direction that just makes me believe again in limitless human creativity. As a book it defies genre, weaving together a series of short stories. At the beginning, it seems a little shallow, as characters are seemingly left behind just as they appear to be coming into their own. But Ms. Egan keeps picking the key ones up, and by the end of the book you have characters that have grown and endeared themselves as much as in any novel you love. This one will stay with me a long time...unfortunately it sets a high bar for the next one on my list.
B007FG9LIE|2|Didn't really care how it ended just wanted to be done with the book. Started out interesting but about half way through it got too be too mush of a fantasy.
B00CHSPB8Y|4|Great graphic, challenging and fun to play. As many if these games go, if you really want to improve your equipment/suits you have to buy points. They have to make money.... Definitely a game worth having.

B000BW7QWW|5|I don't have a clue what Firefly is.. at least when I saw this movie I didn't.  My boyfriend hauled me to this one and I am really glad he did.  I was expecting the same old tired lightsabers and warp drive standard fare.  What I got was something totally different.  There was a distinct western flavor to this movie.  The characters were all fun to watch and the dialog was fresh and different.  I very much enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br />I was surprised that I hadn't heard about this before.  Too bad the movie studio didn't advertise it more.  Nobody I have talked to about this movie even knew what it was.
B009CG9PB8|5|Favorite movie.
B00H71PBQ8|5|I just love this show!I feel like I'm learning a lot about what it was like for the British aristocracy in the post war period.
B000002JS6|4|I purchased this album after seeing VH1's greatest albums of all time list.  Overall, I am pleased with the quality of the music.  Although most of the tunes sound the same, the album is a true classic of hard rock none the less.  However, because of this albums status as a classic, I thought it would have nice liner notes, providing information about the band. Instead I found 5 pictures and a list of the tracks. Disappointing.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I love playing this game. There is no stress because I know after some time I'll be able to play again without spending any money! I enjoy finding hidden objects so this is a good game for me.
B000031XCR|5|Of course, as a Celine fan, I love this collection. The hits they've selected are fabulous and the new songs are great. But I often wonder why they don't have other hits on here like her first English hit \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\\" and her rafter-rattling rendition of \\"All By Myself\\". Oh well, I guess there weren't too many complaints, since this collection sold over six million in the US and over 17 million worldwide. <br />My song-by-song reviews:<br />1. The Power of Love (5/5). This one's such a powerful song, and Celine delivers it passionately and emotionally. Some may find that she belts too much in this song, but I find it great to listen to. <br />2. If You Asked Me To (4.5/5). This is a great song, too. I love how Celine starts out sounding so vulnerable and ends up sounding very powerful, like that someone who's finally found their true love. <br />3. Beauty and the Beast (5/5). I LOVE THIS SONG! Celine and Peabo Bryson do a wonderful job on it and the lyrics are wonderful. A very \\"Disney-sounding\\" ballad that will still be heard years from now. I especially like the instrumental part in the middle. <br />4. Because You Loved Me (5/5). One of the two songs that got me hooked on Celine. Some may find this a gooey, maudlin tune, but I love it. Celine delivers it very well and it's one of her best. <br />5. It's All Coming Back To Me Now (5/5). This is the one that really got me hooked on Celine Dion. It sounds so huge and so epic, and those are the kinds of songs that I like, more like opera than pop. Celine delivers her very best performance ever in this song. Check out the killer video too!<br />6. Love Can Move Mountains (3/5). While this is a good song, very upbeat and perky, it's not really one of my favorites. <br />7. To Love You More (5/5). In my opinion, this is THE very best song on the album. It's a very different-sounding kind of song with the wonderful violin and instrumentation, and the lyrics are top-notch. Celine gives a powerful, wonderful performance. <br />8. My Heart Will Go On (4/5). Ah, here it is, the unversally loved (or despised, take your pick) song. While it's very good (very powerful, emotional and sad to an extent), I don't agree with the EXTREMELY massive amount of attention it got. Celine has done better ballads, and while it was great to see her on TV all the time, for THIS song? Just my opinion.<br />9. I'm Your Angel (5/5). Celine Dion and R. Kelly = a wonderful song. I love the lyrics, and hearing Celine vibe like an R&B artist was refreshing to hear. <br />10. That's The Way It Is (4/5). The only hit off of this album. While it was a refreshing change of pace to hear Celine doing something sounding upbeat and young for a change, hearing Celine Dion sing a Max Martin song just sounds kind of...oxymoronic. <br />11. If Walls Could Talk (5/5). HERE'S a change of pace that suits Celine just fine. This sexy pop/country number, composed by \\"Mutt\\" Lange (aka Mr. Shania Twain), is very sensual and lovely. I also like how Celine doesn't really reach for the big notes in this one, she sounds more human here. <br />12. The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face (4.5/5). Celine does a very good job singing this classic ballad, and you can feel the emotion in her singing here. <br />13. All The Way (3.5/5). Here's one that most people probably wanted to hear, the duet with the late, great Frank Sinatra. While it's nice to hear, it just comes off as a little eerie. <br />14. Then You Look At Me (4.5/5). From the composer and writers of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" comes the sequel to that song. In my opinion, it's better than MHWGO. The orchestration is a little better, as are the lyrics and of course Celine delivers a BLOWING-AWAY vocal performance. <br />15. I Want You To Need Me (5/5). Written by Diane Warren and produced by rock-producer Matt Serletic (sp?), this ballad sounds very raw, powerful and rock-like, something like Aerosmith's \\"I Don't Want To Miss A Thing\\". Celine has said that this is a difficult song to sing because it's very high. Of course, that's right up her alley, and she pulls it off incredibly well. <br />16. Live - Ah, the final track on the album and listening to it, you can almost sense that Celine was singing about her then-upcoming retirement, and it has a wistfullness and sadness to it that comes across very strongly. THAT'S good singing. <br />I just can't sign off without mentioning the immature, mean-spirited and badly spelled reviews that have come from Mariah Carey fans. I have two words for these reviewers: GROW UP!
B00FRQ32N4|2|This game is very disappointing. The loading screens take at minimum 20 seconds, the fights are unbelievably laggy, and, to top it all off, everything is insanely expensive. Plus it nearly crashed my device. If I hadn't read reviews and just started playing, I would have thought it was a scam game.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Once you get the hang of it it's not that hard. It's so addicting to.It's also great because it's not that hard and it's really funny when you die
B000IU3XU6|5|Lovely to see and hear Josh.
B000LXQVA4|5|I bought this product used and it was the best toy for my little one!  She loved to play and discover all of the toys on the jumperoo and she also loved to bounce!  When she started to cruise around furniture on her own she didn't like to be IN the jumperoo too much, but she still liked to walk around it and play with the toys.  It was a great relief for us as parents to be able to put her somewhere safe for a while as well. Great toy, holds up well, highly recommended.
B0052E6EY0|3|This is Not 2:35  its 16x9 and hardly the re mastered version one would hope for ,don't know what the mastered in HD means  ,its clear<br />the did little or nothing to their so so source ,It is 16x9
B00006399Z|3|This is not the best album of all time or even the best Traffic album.  It isn't even an official Traffic album.  It was released to complete a contractual obligation.  The sound is horrible, which prevents any chance of this being a decent album.  Traffic has a much better live album called On The Road.<br />This concert was poorly recorded and the original LP sounded pretty bad.  The first CD release was even worse.  This new remastered CD is about what the LP was.  There is not much you can do when the original masters are bad.<br />There is only one very good song on the album, an 11 minute version of Mr. Fantasy and it alone might make this album worth buying.  There is also a nice 6 minute version of 40000 Headmen which is an added bonus.  Mr. Fantasy shines in spite of the sound problems, but 40,000 Headmen suffers a little.<br />Medicated Goo is just like the studio version on Last Exit, so it adds nothing new.  There are two Dave Mason solo songs that are nice, but there are better versions on Mason's solo albums. There is no reason to own these poorly recorded, substandard versions of these songs, when much better versions already exist.<br />Gimme Some Lovin' is a noisy, sloppy mess.  All you can hear is the theme repeated over and over.   The musicians performance and \\"interplay\\" is sloppy and seems as if the band members are tripping over each other.  However, if this track did have decent sound quality, it might be enjoyable.<br />This album was released to complete Steve Winwood's contractual obligation to release 5 records for United Artists.  At this time, Traffic was already recording Low Spark of High Heeled Boys for Island Records, but were afraid of a lawsuit if they released it before completing the United Artists contract.  Traffic was going to do a major tour, but settled on a few dates in UK.<br />This album was never released as a Traffic album.  It was simply known as Welcome to the Canteen, and was done by the seven musicians listed.  But, there is a Traffic emblem hidden on the label of a bottle of beer on the cover.  And this album includes all the \\"official\\" members of Traffic. The CD releases actually now say Traffic. The album sold poorly, partly because it sounded band and partly because Low Spark of High Heeled Boys was released shortly afterwards.<br />Traffic has had more breakups and reunions than almost any other band.  They broke up between every album, and reunited for the next release.  Dave Mason was an original member and on the first 2 ablums (in the US release, was not listed as being on the second album, even though he wrote half of the songs).  Mason was kicked out of the band 3 times.
B007NESBK2|5|I pre ordered the DVD and as one of the other reviews states the lighting and set are just magical. Sade voice and looks get better with age. Her Band Sweet Back just pulls the whole package together. This is a must have for your collection.

067443000X|4|Thomas Piketty's tome, &#34;Capitalism,&#34; contrary to the one-star evaluations given by most Amazon reviewers, who mindlessly think it somehow is a &#34;pro-Communist tract,&#34; is instead a serious academic work. It is not a polemic or attack on capitalism per se, but quite the contrary, it is an unsubtle &#34;defense&#34; of Capitalism as the last-standing viable economic/political system in the world. A view I have no trouble agreeing with.<br /><br />The author uses as his data base, the evolutionary experience of the most successful capitalist countries since the capitalist experiment began with the post-medieval industrial revolution. The thoroughness of his analysis will surely set the terms of future debates about both the meaning, continued viability, and possible future evolutionary developments of capitalism as a successful world-changing economic engine.<br /><br />While one could quibble about his unique collection of data as being an unrepresentative sample population for a theoretical analysis, since among other things it does not include any of the failed examples of capitalism or its competing alternatives (failed or otherwise) -- thus the mere fact that such alternatives did not evolve to a successful endpoint is not in themselves definitive theoretical evidence that they are any less viable than modern examples of capitalism. After all today, survival of a system is not its only viable measuring stick, we now have theoretical tools like computer simulation to apply to even non-existent alternatives that can be &#34;played-out&#34; in the laboratory, and used with almost as much or greater degrees of confidence than real world experience. Yet, I do not hold this against the author's analysis or believe that this is its fatal flaw.<br /><br />That singular honor, in my humble non-economically trained-estimation goes to the author's rosy acceptance in the face of much evidence to the contrary, that future capitalisms will somehow metaphysically mimic the self-correcting capitalisms of old, and thus will also prove (as the old ones did) to be self-correcting in the future? This in my view is not only a draconian mostly metaphysically hidden assumption, but a fatal one as well.<br /><br />The author's refusal to even consider the possibility that there have been systemic and fundamentally game-changing practices during the more recent evolutionary development of capitalism, changes that may have forever rendered the old model profoundly resistant to self-corrective actions, and thus has rendered it obsolete as a model for the new ever-adaptive global capitalism, effectively reduces the author's otherwise fine analysis to little more that a kind of &#34;fairy-dust&#34; &#34;special-pleading:&#34; a &#34;wish full-filling side show&#34; for a new kind of non-existent metaphysical belief in the powers of capitalism, powers that seriously run counter to what we see in capitalisms across the new global economy and that even his own data does not tend to support or confirm.<br /><br />This inexplicably rosy picture (which, sadly is a &#34;faith&#34; shared by other economists on all sides of the political spectrum) is one that purports (again as a hidden assumption) that the capitalisms of the future will magically somehow veer away from their present non self-correcting suicidally greedy courses and will magically return to the theoretical trajectory and sociologically saner capitalisms of the past? I say loudly and clearly: show me the evidence? At least in the past, we had as many oligarchs guilty about the wrongness of what they were doing as those who gave it no moral consideration at all. Today, we only have Bill, Melinda Gates and Warren Buffet.<br /><br />All we can see today, as far as the eye can see is that the oligarchs are getting meaner, greedier, acquiring much more power, both obvious and subtle, and are increasingly thumbing their noses at the rest of humanity -- at least those that cannot be bought like 14th street whores and who remain resistant to being corrupted by money? Today, this group includes all of our politicians, most military contractors, all of our intelligences agencies and their operatives, anyone who works on Wall Street, and even the clergy of our mega-churches. They too want nothing more than to become trillionaires too!<br /><br />Thus the evidence in our contemporary experience shows quite a different picture than that of the past. It is true that the oligarchs of past eras were no less mean-spirited and pathologically greedy, but they were much less well-organized as a group, had less lethal tools to support their aggressively psychopathic tendencies, and found it infinitely more difficult to buy-off adversaries and challengers. Today, everyone in or out of government are &#34;on the make,&#34; that is to say, are just waiting to have their souls bought by the highest bidder. Just taking the U.S. as a &#34;best case in point,&#34; the oligarchs have effectively neutered our democracy. It is a shell for a four-year Kabuki dance. But the real shots are being called in the back rooms by the oligarchs and their intelligence agencies, and the hedge-fund managers. The rest is a carefully scripted Potemkin village, called the &#34;old US of A.&#34;<br /><br />I believe that this shows that we have unaccountably passed a new system-changing rubicon that will make it infinitely more difficult to control the insanely wealthy in the future: That genie can no longer be put back in the box, I don't care what Mr. Piketty says.. The fact that capitalism is now global and stateless, run mostly by secretive intelligence agencies, and militaries at the behest of &#34;big money Oligarchs&#34; is no longer just a scary sci-fi scenario, but an ongoing reality -- as much in the U.S. as in Russia or Communist China..<br /><br />Which simply means that free-floating mega billionaire oligarchs no longer have a need for a state, or, are the least concerned withthe idea of a common good, or saving humanity or the globe, etc. -- let alone a need for state control or supervision of their always mindless accumulation of wealth that can never be spent either by themselves or the next ten generations of their progenies. Couple this with the fact that democratic systems, (the end of the political evolutionary track, at least according to Francis Fukuyama) are as flawed as every other political system when it comes to being easily manipulated by fascistic monied interests, and it is difficult to build a case for the author's suggestion of a revived, saner, less greedy form of capitalism, one that will evolve in time to save the mad capitalist oligarchs from themselves? Seven hundred and fifty pages have not convinced me otherwise. One can still see the flaws glaring beneath all the neo-&#34;capitalist sweet talk.&#34;<br /><br />As a profoundly &#34;pro-capitalist&#34; myself, I simply see no logical way out: no way to wean the greedy billionaire oligarchs off the tit of accumulating more than they will ever need in the next 100 life times? This book gives me little or no comfort. Four stars.

0439023513|5|I did not immediately see the connection between the Hunger Games trilogy and Theseus and the Minotaur, but once the comparison was made...  It was like I was looking at two faces and suddenly saw the candlestick between.  This trilogy is beautiful.  In a way, it's more adult fiction than teen, especially as it moves through Mockinjay, but that's only because of the power of the first two books.  It's like the old author cliche, \\"the story just writes itself.\\"  I don't see how the questionable content of Mockinjay could have been removed without making the story too much to swallow.<br /><br />I enjoyed Collins's Overlander series, but they were like Goosebumps compared to Poe or Lovecraft when I compare them to the Hunger Games Trilogy.  It's Katniss's humanity that makes this so real.  Having just finished the last book, I'm left with the echoes of the story in my chest like when I choose to watch Saving Private Ryan again.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
B00005JM02|5|This is one of my favorite movies.  I could watch it day after day.  A definite favorite for kids too.
B000PFU7OO|4|I loved the movie and found the music haunting me afterward.  I waited sometime before I ordered the CD, but have been listening to it constantly since.  The first 2 tracks leave me refreshed.
B0012Q94QW|2|If you have seen the many trailers you have pretty much seen all the special effects this film has to offer. The rest is filled with bad dialogue and some pathetic acting. The woolly mammoths are the best looking SFX creatures in the film, but the saber-toothed tiger was barely even in the movie at all. I might say it's worth a DVD rental in the future, but nothing more.

0553582038|3|I will assume that the readers of Song of Ice and Fire series of novels are familiar with the above mentioned novels. Does everyone see the parallel? All undoubtedly great authors, the first three or four books in the series start out with great beginnings and you think WOW these are some of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. These novels garnish (deserved) great reviews. Expecting the next novels to be equally well written and purchasing them with great anticipation you are forced to read pages upon pages of how beautiful the women are and what they are wearing (Wheel of time) or read pages upon pages of the Authors philosophy yack, yack, yack, Sword of Truth. At least George R R Martin hasn't gone off the deep end yet. Although I think sometimes he should tell his story from the view point of a few central characters and not every character mentioned in his novel its just to much to keep up with and you feel the book is to convoluted. Heres hoping the next novel in the series advances the story.

Never see Bob Dylan write something like that.  You know it stinks becasue I've never seen Neil play any of the songs from this album live.
006202406X|1|I loved the first two books.  I think if Veronica Roth wasn't trying so hard to up J.K.Rowlings she would have done a better job.  It seemed like she took a sharp turn when it wasn't necessary just to \\"shake things up\\".  Shock value isn't always the best way to make waves!!
B00003CXTG|2|There are and have been much better war dramas - Tora, Tora, Tora, for example.  The story is primarily about a love triangle that just happens to involve two pilots - but that fact is really unnecessary to the story itself.  The love story itself could have been by and between any three people who happened to be in Hawaii when the Japanese attack took place.  The story wasn't historically accurate but the performances kept it from being a total disaster.  I'd pass on buying this.  If you must - rent it.

140006922X|5|Reza Aslan has written an exhaustively thoughtful history of the life and times that surrounded the historical Jesus of Nazareth as he came of age in ancient Israel. By bringing the history of the politics of Jerusalem, the Temple, and Rome into bright focus, he creates an extraordinary picture of the world that created many Messianic prophets, and one who would later become the center of the Christian church.<br /><br />Always respectful of faith, Aslan nevertheless keeps his focus on history. The way he explains the historical Jesus in context is illuminating. He brings a new, richer perspective on what kind of life a Galilean carpenter would have had in the time period, shows the threads of a growing movement of discontented young men in conflict with an entrenched elite.<br /><br />Especially fascinating was the reconstruction of what the laws and political structure were like, opposed to the softening of Jesus' message by the writers of the gospels later. Noting that they were written after the Massacre of Jerusalem, the refining of Jesus' message in reaction to that is nothing short of fascinating.<br /><br />This book is compulsively readable, impeccably researched, and a brilliant addition to the canon of research on the historical Jesus. A must have.
B00821OX98|4|only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the CGI isn't up to my high standards. I've heard it gets a lot better in the newer seasons. I think the show is great.
B00003CXB2|5|I've only seen this movie once.  My senior year in high school, I saw it in my history class.  I instantly fell in love with it.  It's hard to call a movie you've only seen once your favorite, but with Lawrence of Arabia, it's hard not to call it your favorite.  The scenes are cool, the directing is great and the directing is phenominal.  It doesn't get any better than this. I'm a film student currently and only dream of living up to this type of movie, which I'm sure I'll never be able to. I'll be honest, I don't own this film YET, but I strongly recommend, if you haven't seen it or don't own it, see it and add it to your coollection.

I am not a Kevin Costner fan in general, but I do enjoy his performance in this flick! And what a star-studded supporting cast! Some of the the stars' roles are pretty minor but still add to the greatness and validity of this historical film. Yes, it's a long movie, but if you're a 20th century history buff fascinated by the whole story of the Kennedy assassination investigation like I am, you will not be bored for a second throughout this film!<br /><br />Also, last night I watched this DVD on my Blu-Ray player and 42\\" HDTV. Even though the DVD is technically standard definition (I bought it two years ago, long before my HDTV), I was amazed at how sharp the picture is...it looked like HD to me! Just a great picture, quality-wise.<br /><br />The 2-disc edition features a very long featurette that details the whole story of the investigation with various interviews, footage and commentary from people who were there. It might be a little more tedious than the movie itself to watch, but still very informative. Highly recommended! Get the 2-disc edition!

B0047Y17P2|4|Good courtroom drama.  Good plot, quick pace, and solid characters.    Legal thrillers aren't my go-to, but I liked the story involving organized crime, the foreclosure crisis, and the dilemma of defending an unlikeable defendant.    Good twist at the end too.  Well written.  Read it in 3 days.

1594202842|1|After finishing this book what amazes me is why the author, a well-respected professor of law, would publish this book?  She comes across more like the mother of \\"Sybil\\" than the typical mother of a US president.  She should be embarrassed by how she treated her children.  The book contains no useful information on child rearing, except for \\"don't do this!\\"

B00BCSBU4E|5|This is a splendid collection of &#34;Early Music&#34;. Early Music is how the Archiv label of DGG defined its mission from the outset. I had bought many Archive LP's over the years. I always admired the sound quality, choice of repertory, performers. I also admired the scholarly notes, even though as a non-specialist, I rarely read them more than once. (The booklet enclosed, gives identification of the contents, a history of the label with highlights of some performers, in brief, and that's about it).<br /><br />What you get is 50 or so CD's of great music and performances, at a bargain price. This would be a fine starter collection of early music.<br /><br />For myself, it was a chance to hear some old friends, once more. (The LP's have long departed). It also brought new repertoire and performers to my attention.<br /><br />I am not going to pick favorites or the &#34;bests&#34;  I have been picking CD's at random, and have enjoyed every one.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!

0345803493|5|Hooked with Book 1 but surprised myself with some emotional attachments at the end of it that left me wanting more... Book 2 was the best of the series in my view with the right mix of plot and romance.  Book 3 got a little redundant(would never have not read it given how much I enjoyed the first two).  Foray into the genre was enjoyable for me but even he my husband thought book 3 disappointed and he didn't read them.

B003EYVXTG|4|That's me in the cattle auction scene, wearing my black, Vietnam cap, & the old, brown Hillbilly hat in the bar scene. Other than that, Sundance doesn't hand-out their top awards to just any film! This movie tells it like it is! If you're looking for disgusting language, you won't find it! If you're looking for blood & guts...you won't find it! If you're looking for nudity or steamy sex scenes...you won't find it! If you're looking for a well-writen, true-to-life depiction of a young girl's struggle to save her family, that's \\"Winter's Bone.\\" This film is done with taste, complimented by excellent writing, directing, & acting skills.
B003F3FJQO|2|I loved The Maze Runner and couldn't put it down, unfortunately this book couldn't hold my attention and I put it down for months before finally finishing it.
0399159029|5|I like these books.  I like police detective books in general but this one has a very interesting twist.  It is set during WWII in Nazi Germany.  Our detective was a policeman before the Nazis and WWII in Berlin and now he is stuck working for them.  Everything is upside down in Berlin because the priorities are all towards satisfying Hitler and the war effort.  So if a murder comes along which really doesn't advance his aims, it is given no priority.  In fact, a Dutch rail worker is murdered in Berlin and this murder is shoved aside by Bernie's superiors because of the far more important task of sewing yellow Js on Jews' clothing.<br /><br />There is an interesting way he opens this book.  It is 1942 and Bernie's superior is dead and he is overjoyed.  The Americans are also in the War.  In the very next chapter we jump back to 1941 where his detested superior is very much alive and the Americans are not in the war. Bernie had just returned from Prague in the 1942 opening so we know where we are going to end up.<br /><br />If you like this kind of twist, and these books are chock full of details about Nazi Germany and the war, then you should love these books.  I recommend them as a series and this one as a fine volume in it.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

1594744769|5|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children<br />Ransom Riggs<br />Quirk Books<br />2011<br /><br />A LibraryThing Early Reviewer book.<br />Jacob has grown up hearing his grandfather talk about the special place he grew up and seeing pictures of the \\"peculiar\\" children that lived there. As he got older, they seemed to him to be just stories, made up. After a disturbing and frightening incident he decides to hunt down the truth.<br /><br />This was an exciting, edge of the seat read for me. I was intrigued at the premise and was not let down by the execution. With this first novel, Ransom Riggs has definitely proven that he knows how to write, both for adults and young adults.<br /><br />The photographs used are odd and disturbing and surprisingly enough, not doctored.<br /><br />Interesting tidbit, the art director is Doogie Horner, the peculiar and wonderful comedian who appeared on America's Got Talent (I'm a fan).<br /><br />4 1/2 stars for a well written, exciting novel. I look forward to a sequel.
B00BAXFECK|4|Good character development, but was longer than it needed to be--could have been edited.
B00821OX98|4|This show is excellent although at times predictable. It has enough twists to keep me entertained, but it does require a healthy suspension of disbelief.All in all a great introduction to the world and a great framework for exploring some very interesting ideas. If you like science fiction, aliens, or post apocalyptic themes this show is a must watch.
B00AKKTDJY|1|Purchased on amazon. Following purchase and checkout it was stated that my game would be in my cloud apps on my kindle fire. It is not...went to apps store and tried to download there...and all I get is notice that I already own this game. Searched my kindle...the game is nowhere to be found. Paid for it but don't have it. would like this fixed.

B00000J7JO|5|Obviously one of the best, if not the best (who could, or would ever want to, make this type of distinction or claim anyhow?),album from the Chili  Peppers. It has all of it. It has fast. It has slow. It has the scream, the  funk, the junk. It is the stuff that makes the Chili Peppers all that and  more. It is why we listen to them. Don't they make you want to get up and  jam, and just rip something apart? They are all amazing musicians.  Anthony's voice is one of the best around. We try, some of us succeed, but  in the end, we step back and let them do it because they do it so well.  This is why we can listen and enjoy, all in the same right, &quot;Under The  Bridge&quot;, &quot;Porcelain&quot;, &quot;Parallel Universe&quot;,  &quot;Get On Top&quot;, and &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;. We  understand talent. This band has aged extremely well. This album rocks.
B000002JR8|5|This CD could possibly be the best CD in metal history....well in the 90's....that or Vulgar Display of Power....Pantera is soo f*ckin in your face, and straight the the point metal....its great..Phil can scream and sing...his singing is amazing, and he can scream his ass off too....\\"5 Minutes Alone\\" is one of the best songs.  My favorite song on this CD...Dime's guitar playing is friggin awesome, and very talented...Vinnie's drumming is fast and great...Rex is a badass on the bass <br />overall, great buy and it is well worth the money...i would give it more stars if i could..
B00BGI086Q|5|An excellent series.
0061191752|4|Roasting in Hells Kitches was a Christmas gift to my son Matt.  He just loves learning different ways to creating meals and different kinds of foods. All the tricks to the trade are in here and very easy to follow instructions.  Some even have short stories to go along. I myself just love reading up on Ramsey I loke his ways and all of his food...
B00HDMMISA|5|This is about a murder, but we don't find out who is killed until near the end. It's an easy, breezy read, plus being incredibly suspenseful. Even though the subject is bullying and spousal abuse, it still has humorous moments. Everyone has secrets and the author is very deft at handling the characters and their situations.
B00E688KA4|5|The evolution of this band is fantastic. They have create another masterpice for the viking culture. Thanks a lot men.
B001GAPC1K|5|Overall, Iron Man is the best two-disc package available on Blu-ray. The film is fun, the audio is mighty impressive and I can't in good conscience fault the video quality enough to deduct points. It may not be the most detailed picture I've ever seen, but I believe that could easily be accounted for by the camera work and CGI integration. Robert Downey, Jr. does a great job and the special effects give Iron Man a fresh, unique vibe that sets it apart from most action or superhero films. There are enough surprises and plot twists to keep any audience on their toes; enough humor to keep any audience laughing; enough character development to satisfy the critics and stark nerds; and enough effects and action to get the adrenalin rush thru our bodies. Iron Man gets my highest recommendation on Blu-ray.    Now this is what you get for the BD version:    Blu-ray Disc 1:    Hall of Armor   The Invincible Iron Man Origins  Friends & Foes  The Definitive Iron Man  Demon in a Bottle  Extremis and Beyond  Ultimate Iron Man  Deleted/Extended Scenes   BD Live: Iron Man IQ    Blu-ray Disc 2:    I Am Iron Man The Journey Begins  The Suit that makes the Iron Man  The Walk of Destruction  Grounded In Reality  Beneath the Armor  It's All in the Details  A Good Story, Well Told  Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man   Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test   The Actor's Process (scene rehearsal with cast)   The Onion \\"Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into Full Length Film\\"   Theatrical Trailers   Image Galleries    Overall 10 out of 10, this is how a superhero movie gets done and how a BD is made.
B00I29VGMC|5|All I can say is believe all the reviewers who called it a beautiful love story because that is exactly what it was. It was very well written and so moving. The principle characters,Bree Prescott and Archer Hale,have both suffered major traumas in their lives but their coming together proves to be healing for both of them. I highly recommend this one to any one who is a romantic at heart.
B00DVKOYBM|5|like it alot .great way to pass time. play a lot more than I thought I would only thing I don't like is not winning enough money lol
B009NOGSQE|4|a Classic Movie from my childhood. always fun watching the worms and the MIB aliens.
B007Y6OZE0|5|I knew this was going to be a good album! I like this album better than their last album to be fairly honest. There are only about two songs that are slow but that doesn't mean that they aren't good! Just pick it up, you will not be sorry!

B004J4WNL2|4|Book club reading which was useful and informative. I however don't see any place in my life where I am not valued because of my quiet nature. The book seemed to point out that happened often. Not my experience. I find people appreciate my intuitive and peaceful nature.
B000RIHBIE|4|This cd was nice but i think it was a little to emo though. i love march of the dogs though. keep it up, SUM 41
0316219266|4|I love what Jeff has done even though his methods may not be anything close to what I consider admirable.  Knowing Jeff (from reading the book of course) this message would be an afterthought.  On two good notes, I purchased the last copy from Barnes & Noble of all places.<br /><br />Lastly, I'm a Walmart store manager.  Our new CEO, Doug McMillon, recommended that his executives read this book.  I read it because my goal is to rise to the top as well.  All in all it was a good read.
B00H9KKKAY|4|HOWEVER, I did some googling research, and according to the players that were part of the real Wolf, It is all true....  with some modifications, given the usual need to compress, rearrange and add some treatments to accommodate a movie format.<br />( Remember the disclaimer at the start of 'The Great Escape' ?  Said similar, but as here, the story was all true. )<br /><br />Martin told it as it was, and maybe not fair, but I give it 4 stars because the truth they are telling is so disgusting and obscene, I just can't get over it.  So many were hurt by this amoral, degenerate hustler and his cohorts and never received due compensation.<br /><br />BUT, typical Martin, an outstanding movie of quality producion .  Just the 714 scene is worth the price of admission, easily DiCaprio's best moment on film.
B007THA4FI|2|I was repelled, disgusted, depressed, but mostly bored. But I kept forcing myself to read because it just had to get better, right? Wrong. It was Awful.  Dismal.  Depressing. Sad. Dirty. Tragic. The mind who created Voldemort and the Dementers created this book.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Fantastic. I am never disappointed by the quality of the products I buy on Amazon and the service is better than I find in many department stores. The Chromecast is outstanding. My only disappointment was realizing I was not able to use it with my online studies. But It works better than I thought it would.  Like I said, I'm never disappointed. Great venders, quality service and product. Thank you everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I love the books I love how they turned how and The battle each person that went through the games had to battle what happen while they were there what they had to survive.
B0013TXA5Y|2|After I read this book I was not sure if I wanted to read the second, and for me I feel like that is the main goal for the first bok of a series is to get you to want nothing more then to drop whatever you are doing get in your car drive to the store and get the second book to start reading the second book in the store. This book did not give me that &#34;rush&#34; to read the second book at all. If anything it made me question how this series is so popular.
B006MW3UZW|5|I just got on the bandwagon for this show a couple weeks ago but once I started, I couldn't get enough of it! It leaves you having to know what happens at fm the end of every episode! You will love it!

B0058YPLA2|5|Between Alias, 24, and Lost, for me the last decade was the decade of the highly serialized TV show.  All three of those were shows where you couldn't miss a second because something important would happen.  After starting a couple shows like that that fizzled, I was growing weary of that style of storytelling, instead looking for shows that were more episodic with just a hint of a thread that wove things together.<br /><br />But some premises are too interesting to dismiss out of hand, so I gave Once Upon a Time a try.  I was hooked after the pilot, and the pull only got stronger as the season went along.  I couldn't wait for Sunday nights to find out just what would happen next to these great characters.<br /><br />Our story opens in Boston as Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is celebrating her 28th birthday alone.  That all changes when Henry (Jared Gilmore) shows up on her doorstep and announces that he is the son she gave up for adoption.  He also spins a wild tale about Emma being the only one who can break a curse in his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine.  Emma's not buying it and takes him home.<br /><br />But something happens when she meets Henry's adopted mother, cold, calculating mayor Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla).  Emma decides to stick around for a little while and see just what happens.  Along the way, she meets school teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Ginnifer Goodwin), amnesiac David Nolan (Josh Dallas), and pawn shop owner Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle).  Is Henry right?  Is Emma really the daughter of Snow White (aka Mary Margaret) returned to save the day?  If so, will she believe the truth in time to stop the curse?<br /><br />The show is from creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis.  I have heard from several people that they ripped off a series of comic books for the premise.  Since I haven't read them, I don't know for sure.  To me, they are two of the writers of Lost, and that pedigree shows in how they tell their story.  Each episode features the latest developments in Storybrooke as well as flashbacks to the world of the Enchanted Forest where the lives of our characters before the curse unfolds before our eyes.<br /><br />Of course, these flashbacks include some interesting twists to the familiar fairy tales we all know and love.  I'm not going to spoil any of them, but just be prepared for things to be much more complicated than you ever know.  This is especially true for Snow White and Prince Charming who overcome lots of obstacles before getting married, only to meet up with this curse.  But they aren't the only characters who show up since Henry is right - Storybrooke is filled with every fairy tale character you know, including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, and Belle to name a few.<br /><br />And in Storybrooke?  Well, the plot there unravels each week as Regina tries to drive Emma out of town, and Emma tries to figure out a way to outwit the mayor.  You might think they are fighting over Henry, and to some extent they are.  But since Regina is the Evil Queen, and the curse is because of her, Regina has another motive to get Emma out of town.<br /><br />Now don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything for you.  Thanks to the flashbacks, I haven't revealed anything you won't find out without the first few episodes.  And the tapestry they weave their story through is so rich, you'll be drawn in yourself in no time flat.<br /><br />The actors do a great job with the characters, which really helps make the story that much more exciting.  You care about the outcome because you care about the characters.  I have absolutely no complaints in the acting department, although I do think the character of Emma is rather stupid at times, but Jennifer Morrison makes her stupid actions almost believable.<br /><br />But I must single out two of the actors for special praise.  Lana Parrilla absolutely shines as Regina.  She plays two faced so well when the situation calls for it.  And she seems to relish her role as pureevil when she gets to play that.  Likewise, Robert Carlyle is brilliant as Mr. Gold/Rumplestiltskin.  These are easily the two richest characters on the show, and the actors play them brilliantly.<br /><br />The show does have one flaw, however.  Any time they try to use CG for the special effects, it is obvious.  Fortunately, that usually happens in Enchanted Forest, so the Storybrooke scenes are all believable.  And the effects never last for too long, so it's not a major issue.  As the season went along, the effects budget must have gotten bigger because they did seem to improve, although they still are not blockbuster movie quality.  Still, with a show this good driven by characters and story more than effects, it's worth noting mainly in passing.<br /><br />Since the show airs on ABC, it is part of the Disney family.  The Disnerd in me loves the references, subtle and not so subtle, to the Disney versions of the tales here.  It's often small moments or a costume a character wears, but it is fun looking for these hidden Easter Egg moments.<br /><br />Season one had 22 episodes, and they are all collected in this set in widescreen and full surround.  Extras on the set include behind the scenes featurettes that include interviews with cast and crew on why they love fairy tales, creating the character of Belle, and how they create the town of Storybrooke.  You also get several audio commentaries, and the standard bloopers and deleted scenes.  It is available in both DVD and Blu-Ray editions, and there is an exclusive extra on on the Blu-Ray on the historical origins of fairy tales.<br /><br />If you've missed this wonderful show, now is the perfect time to catch it and catch up.  You'll be done with the first season of Once Upon a Time before you know it and ready for season two.evil when she gets to play that.

B009EE6WXC|5|A movie that ages well;  filmed in a NYC that no longer exists. Hackman stays in character throughout the movie, never backing down. Supporting cast is outstanding and director Freidkin's wastes not one scene.
B00005JOFQ|5|This movie is LONG over due, it is about time that ther is a movie that shows the other side of gay life. As a Idaho ranch boy I have long been involved with the western way of life. It is nice to see a movie that does not make all gay men look like the sterotypical. <br />It is nice to see that the main stream public can finally realize yes there are gay men who like to be around horses and yes we do rodeo and yes we live our lives in a manor that it is not the \\"normal\\" gay life. We all do not live in big cities we do not all dress flamboyant and we do not all act overlty Effeminate.

1454901276|5|The Black House is the first volume in a trilogy featuring Edinburgh detective Fin Macleod. Fin is in charge of investigating a grisly murder  of a disembodied man when a similar murder takes place on the Isle of Lewis in the outer Hebrides off the western coastline of Scotland.<br /><br />Given the similarities of the two murders Fin is sent to investigate the murder on the island, his former homeland he left eighteen years ago never to return.  Thus begins the story as Fin returns to confront his tortured past, one he has chosen to forget, In the process of solving the crime Fin must dredge up past memories and friendships and relive the pain he has ignored for eighteen years.<br />This is an extremely melancholy story written in an excellent manner, very atmospheric and full of personal conflict. I totally enjoyed this book and look forward to the next two volumes in the trilogy. This is an excellent mystery set in an atmosphere that totally absorbs the reader. Well done Mr. May!

B00001OH7V|5|Everyone is complaining about the fact that there were no bonus tracks included on the 1999 EMI re-issues of all of David's old cds. We would all love to have the rare bonus tracks that were included on the Rykodisc  re-issues in 1991, but that's not what I should be talking about.  &quot;Heroes&quot; (the album) is not as good as Low, but it's more  substantial than Lodger. Brian Eno's prescence is very noticeable. The  instrumentals are especially good (with the exception of &quot;Sense of  Doubt&quot;). This cd shows just how much potential two musical geniuses  working on one album really have.
0380820846|5|I REALLY liked this book. I have read every JQ book, and this one was just as delightful as all the previous. Colin and Penelope are an excellent pair! I won't give any details because I wouldn't want to give too much away, but despite what other reviews might say, this book is definitely a keeper. I have already read it twice!
B009ZQC7MY|5|A show where you really care about the characters,even when you do not like them very much.  Language and content not as offensive as the &#34;American&#34; shows.
B00H71PHS0|5|I look forward to this show each season and each episode.  It is well written and the actors and actresses are fabulous.  It is fun to be taken &#34;back in time&#34; each time I watch.  I just wish there were more episodes each season.  I am always so sad when the season ends!!  Great Entertainment!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|This was one of the best books I've read.  I could really see every character and visualize the court room scenes so well.<br />I loved it.<br /><br />Margo Williams
B009JZSC9S|4|Excellent drama filled with twists and turns. Love a multi-focal plot.
B0051ANPZQ|5|This was amazing book revolving around the life of a ten year old boy. The story allows you to see the same events unfold, but through another's perspective each time, reminding you why it's important to be kinder than seems necessary, for you don't always understand the full situation.
B00KMX5V8G|5|Love it.  I am so glad that they finally got it for kindle.
B00TYB95I4|4|Intense
B008AK8FHM|1|It is an eerie read regardless of the author's medical knowlege.  Biblically speaking, it omits the fact that we need a personal relationship with Jesus Christ in order to partake of the wonders of heaven, which take place after death, and not during our lifetime.<br />I do not recommend this book, but would refer to the reading of the last book in the Bible, the book of Revelation.
B008MG1E4A|5|If you read this, you will scratch your head as to why the Pentagon reacted the way they did, until you read how the SEAL's thought of the current Administration.  This book is well written and takes you not only into the Bin Laden raid, but you follow the author on his trip from civilian life to becoming one of America's elite warrior's.  I would like to thank the &#34;Mark Owen&#34; for writing this book, so that we get to see something that is not influenced by any &#34;political&#34; pressure or influence.<br /><br />DVSRomad, USAF TACP - Retired

B0052RDHTM|5|This historical fiction book begins pre-WWI and follows the events that lead into the war through the characters created by,  author Ken Follett as well as real people who are referenced through their contact with the characters.  It has everything:  intrigue, spies, diplomats, royalty, upper classes, lower classes, unions, overseers, owners, women's suffrage, violence, romance and sex.
B00B7Y0206|5|I don't see why people leave negative feedback there no ads and u can play it on urban background and download the videos it's great
B008FOB124|5|great disc, evocative haunting tracks, love it, another great disc to aquire, I will be buying more of this soon.
B00IK590UI|3|Not as good as original but still entertaining. Less action, more of the human aspect explored.
B001WCBPCW|5|This is the third album from a band I believe to be criminally underrated and largely unnoticed here in the United States. The store I went to only had 3 copies of the album...ON THE FIRST DAY OF RELEASE! Anyways this cd is a huge improvement over their second album. The strength of the songs here are incredible. Standouts include Underdog, Fast Fuse, Thick As Thieves, and...well pretty much the whole album. If you like wonderfully crafted pop rock with electronica and a hint of psychedlia thrown in then you're going to love this cd.
0316098337|5|\\"Room\\" is a novel of tremendous originality and poignancy. As a boy of five who has lived his entire life in captivity with his kidnapped mother, Jack's life in Room is his \\"normal.\\"  His Ma uses her considerable creativity to devise games to teach him and encourage him creatively, without letting on that the things they read about and see on TV are real and just waiting outside Room's metal door. Room is his entire world, and Ma does everything in her ability to enrich his life there, while shielding him at all costs from \\"Old Nick,\\" her captor who comes to visit most nights after 9:00, after Jack is put to bed in Wardrobe. As time goes on, though, Jack's curiosity and questions remind Ma that she can't keep shielding him from reality forever, and their life in Room cannot continue on indefinitely. She and Jack must combine their knowledge and creativity to come up with a plan.    I found this book fascinating all the way through. An adult novel from a little boy's perspective? High-concept, but it is brilliantly done. Although Jack is overall a happy boy, he is confused by the disturbing things he hears in Room when he is shut in Wardrobe after dark. Readers are gradually made aware of the frightening things that mostly fly over Jack's head because he thinks they're either normal or part of a dream.     Although the turning point of the novel occurs about halfway through, I don't agree that it loses steam thereafter. After this point in the book, one wonders what could possibly happen next, but it turns out that the major event midway through the book creates many additional challenges for both of the main characters, making the whole thing a riveting read. As for the criticism that \\"Old Nick\\" is an underdeveloped character--that is just not what this book is about. It's not about the backstory of a predator, it's about Ma's love for her son (and vice versa) and the challenges that Room imposes on both their lives. Jack is telling the story and he'll tell you allyou want to know about the pictures on their walls, their craft-friends Eggsnake, Labyrinth, etc., but since Ma protects him from having to see or speak to \\"Old Nick,\\" Jack only describes the bits and pieces he sees and hears at night.   You won't be able to put it down. Read \\"Room!\\"
B00ESNE696|5|There are some surprise nudity scenes, and a lot of the lesbian scenes go a little too far & are too graphic.  I will say the story line always has a twist though, so I like following that.

B00007G1ZC|5|Late in his life and career, Akira Kurosawa, whose star might have faded altogether were it not for the intervention of George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola (both ardent fans), gained a new audience and a new respect with a series of visually stunning colour films.  From 1975's saving grace \\"Dersu Uzala\\" to 1980's stunning \\"Kagemusha,\\" 1985's harrowing \\"Ran\\", we arrived at this gem in 1990.  Though I've long been a Kurosawa fan--starting with \\"Kagemusha\\"--I somehow missed this one at the time, perhaps because the concept just didn't grab me.<br /><br />17 years later and a recent rental through Netflix, I'm sorry I blew this one off before.  Other reviewers here have complained of the slowness of Kurosawa's work, long waits for any action.  Sorry it's not some bit of Jackie Chan or Jet Li chop-socky, guys; this is true cinematic art, which requires patience and tenacity (both of which are ultimately rewarded).  You want action, watch the \\"Die Hard\\" movies.  You want art, this is where you need to be.<br /><br />These eight segments are some of the most colourfully vivid Kurosawa ever committed to celluloid--one of my favourite moments is in the first segment, right at the end where the little boy stands in the field of flowers under the rainbow and the mountains.  Nature's blooms in all their glory make up some of the most beautiful scenery anyone could photograph, and for Kurosawa's direction, that goes double.  Correspondingly, the sequence with the dead soldiers' souls addressing their still-living commander in the tunnel in the mountains is dark and grim, echoing the commander's state of mind at being confronted by old ghosts who are unable to accept that they are, in fact, dead and are trying to go home again.  \\"Crows\\" brings Van Gogh's art to life brilliantly (and significantly, includes one of only two examples in Kurosawa's body of work to feature dialogue not in Japanese--\\"Dersu Uzala\\" was Russian, this sequence features spoken French and English--and Van Gogh himself is played unfailingly by Martin Scorsese); \\"Mount Fuji in Red\\" is genuinely frightening, the scenario of all Japan's nuclear reactors exploding at once the stuff of nightmares, as well as the following sequence with the mutant sunflowers and the horned demon-men whose punishment is to never die but suffer eternally.  The final sequence, \\"The Village of the Watermills,\\" brings it all together with its lush greenery, the philosophical old man, and the joyous funeral procession--its moral, to remember to respect nature, tradition, and live in peace with your fellow man.<br /><br />A gorgeous masterpiece.played unfailingly by Martin Scorsese); \\"Mount Fuji in Red\\" is genuinely frightening, the scenario of all Japan's nuclear reactors exploding at once the stuff of nightmares, as well as the following sequence with the mutant sunflowers and the horned demon-men whose punishment is to never die but suffer eternally.

B003G4W49C|5|I started to read and did not stop unti I had finished the book, what more can I say except BRILLIANT
B0095ZQ36G|5|Great book. Would recommend to anybody looking for a great story, a story that is true.
B008UCJ7KO|3|I agree with the other reviewers, this was to be a trilogy, and the newest book feels like it is being stretched out to cover two more books.  Unfortunately that means superfluous and dragging details to fill pages.<br /><br />As upset as I am about the extension of this series, I still love the characters and I enjoyed the read.
B00000J7J4|4|I am going to keep this short. This album in one word is great. Leading with the hit track &quot;Smooth&quot;, this album is a must to add to your collection. With hit artists helping such as Rob Thomas, Everlast, and  Lauryn Hill, it is classic.
B00A5052YE|3|I wish I bought the single of &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; the album as a whole is not great. I am disappointed.
145210655X|5|This is a fantastic book.<br /><br />While you are not getting an actual &#34;story&#34;, each page has great artwork, with a fantastic references to the Star Wars films while connecting it to the life of being a parent.  Definitely worth buying.
B00068IOWM|5|Another u2 Masterpiece? Could very well be. It might not be at the level of \\"Joshua Tree\\" or \\"Achtung Baby,\\" but its an extremely strong album with no weak tracks, unlike its predecessor ATYCLB.  The 2000 album was very strong, but a couple mistakes made it one step away from a \\"masterpiece\\" which a lot of people said it was. However, I found that this album takes a few listens to grow on you and really appreciate.  This will explain why a lot of people will give it 1-2 stars after a couple listens, or of course those u2 haters that haven't even heard the album.  This album has so many different sounds coming from everywhere (layers of guitars, great double & backing vocals, heavy bass, etc.) This album is another reason why they will be inducted into the Rock n Roll hall of fame in 2005, first ballot. <br /> <br />1. Vertigo: excellent first single and great opener for the album. U2 just doing an exciting track, loaded with great guitars by Edge and heavy bass by Adam Clayton. Hit written all over it. I could have done without the \\"turn it up loud, captain\\" line, but in the end it's just a fun song (9/10). <br /> <br />2. Miracle Drug: Almost perfection in every aspect. The first verse is slow, with stunning vocal delievery by Bono, but then jumps at you when the chorus hits. The highlights of the track are done by Edge, who does a phenomenal slide guitar solo, and then sings the following verse by himself. Chills...Incredible song (9.5/10). <br /> <br />3. Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own: I think this is one of the most emotional songs u2 have ever recorded, very confessional lyrics.  The \\"and it's you when I look in the mirror..\\" line sung in falsetto is breaktaking, the chorus is undeniable, and the understated, brilliant guitar work underneath it is perfect. I think the bridge might be a little overdone, but this is a big future single. (9/10) <br /> <br />4. Love and Peace or Else: Is this u2? Who said this album didn't have the usual experimentation?This track has masterful production as u2 do their best Nine-inch Nail impersonation.  Simply stated, this song rocks! And to tell you the truth, it had to with Bono serving the only political lyrics on the album.  Supersonic, dark, evil, distorted riffs from Edge throughout, and great solo to close off the song. A couple corny lines bring the grade down a little (8/10). <br /> <br />5. City of Blinding Lights: Epic u2. Beautiful build-up with the piano and guitar start this very 80s-sounding tune.  I think Bono owns this track, great lyrics and delivery, and an addicitve chorus which will be a big hit on the next tour. \\"Time won't leave me as I am, but time won't take the boy out of this man\\". How can I hate on a song with a line like this in it? (8.5/10) <br /> <br />6. All Because of You: The best song on the album. The intro  makes me want to cry it's so good, the Edge let loose and running wild! It's just a stomping, sing-along rocker with Bono yelling and bouncing you off the walls. It's like the Who made a cameo on the record, very 60's rock here. The way Bono yells the bridge (\\"I'm alive, I'm being born..\\") is one of his greatest moments, and Edge's guitar solo is one of his finest(11/10)!!! <br /> <br />7. A Man and a Woman: Now is when the album will require multiple listens.  This tune is the epitome of SOUL, people will think it's too R&B but that was the goal of this track.  Bono wanted to make \\"a summer Marvin Gaye\\" tune, and listening to this makes me wonder if they were signed to Motown all these years.  The dominator: Adam Clayton. Incredible bass completes this sing-a-long tune that grows on you more and more (8/10). <br /> <br />8. Crumbs from Your Table: Biggest surprise of the record, it is pretty brilliant. Edge swallows the track and dominates it with his guitar work. Bono's delivery makes this chorus amazing, very catchy..the lyrics are very strong, especially the second verse. Very nice surprise, a lot rawer and harder than I expected (8.5/10). <br /> <br />9. One Step Closer: People say it's the weakest track on the record but I can't understand that.  It has such incredible vocal delivery by Bono and fits the music and theme of the song to perfection.  It really would have been a good fit on \\"Zooropa\\".  The Lyrics are just genius to me, and maybe they could have done something more with the chorus, but it has this wierd feeling which grows on you.  Took many listens to feel all this, keep in mind (8/10). <br /> <br />10. Original of the Species = Although I absolutely love this song, I have the most trouble with it because of what it could have been.  First off, this the closest anyone has ever come to sounding like the Beatles.  It is incredible, great piano and its place on the album is perfect. My problem is the over-production, what a mistake! There is too many things going on here, especially the strings.  It should have been more stripped down, it would be far more intimate.  And get rid of the \\"doo doo doo\\" line by Bono, ugghhh (7.5/10). <br /> <br />11. Yahweh: Despite the wierd-sounding title of the song, this has geniunely great lyrics and ends the album very well.  The chorus is a little annoying, but the last half of this track is perfect. One of their stronger album closers, but definetly a grower (7/10). <br /> <br />Here's a statement of how strong this record is: the only real mistake was not adding \\"Fast Cars\\" to the regular edition! It is pure brilliance, u2 at their most experimental.  It is a middle-eastern influenced tune with Arabic guitars by Edge and hip hop style vocals by Bono.  What a gem, they left it off the album and I could see it being a single.  \\"I know these fast cars...will do me no good.\\"  One of the best on the album. <br /> <br />u2 arent changing music history here.  I don't know why some u2 fans want them to do this with every release.  It is just a very strong rock record filled with songs I can't wait to hear live.  Because as good as their album work is, their songs come alive on tour.  A new masterpiece? Only time will tell, but it takes time and multiple listens to really fall in love and appreciate this great record.   <br />
B00C7KXUOE|5|awesome!!!!
B00EOO1RHS|3|this is a terrible screen protector. It broke after only a month, and it wasn't even after a hard fall! it fell about 2 feet, onto carpeted flooring, and suddenly it began to crack near the corners. Another fall (about 3 feet, also not hard) and the screen cracked straight through the middle causing a large, distracting crack. This is not worth the price at all as you'll find yourself replacing it constantly. My advice, buy tech-armor screen protectors. Never buying an anker screen protector ever again.    *UPDATE*    While my screen protector may have been faulty, anker emailed me immediately and refunded the order. Their customer support team is pretty great and very on top of their products. They immediately resolved the issue and were very proactive in making sure I was satisfied with the purchase. Very responsible customer support team.
B006MW3V6U|5|What a wonderful series!  Thank you for making it available for free to Prime members!  It is good to have clean entertainment available.

B00FAPF5U0|4|This is pretty fun and a little addicting. If you have a couple of minutes to kill this is an easy way to do it.
B008JFUPK8|3|Saw it on tv for the first time today. 3 stars ‘cause it’s entertaining and I watched the whole thing through (although there were a couple of times at the beginning when I was tempted to change the channel). But I do think the script writer’s/director’s re-imagining of the traditional Superman story and above all the over-reliance on CGI special effects made for a weaker plotline and a sometimes silly movie.  I am a fan, growing up with Superman comics, through the Chris Reeves movies, and I even own the ‘50s TV series DVDs. I also realize that today’s audience expects special effects out the wazoo. I just think this movie went overboard in that aspect at the expense of good old-fashioned storytelling. But, as I said, I did find it entertaining and I intend to add this DVD to my collection. Who knows, maybe I’ll soften my opinion on a second viewing.
B000JIN3J8|5|Of all the adaptations I've seen, this is by far the best an my favorite. I feel like. I'm reading the book while watching it.
B005ES0XQY|2|I have worn these several times. They are lightweight and comfortable but very limited support. My feet hurt every time I wore them so I gave them to charity.
B001FXCE46|5|I usually start with song number 3 (sex on fire) and let it play to the end. Every song has a certain grit and feeling to it and is one of my favorite albums of any artist (and definitely the best Kings of Leon album).

B0006IIPIK|3|THX1138 is the apartment numbers seen on a glass window of a door in the film, notice the Star Wars connection there, remember the awful Aliens Vs Predator, and realize that fanboy motion picture films are really not what we want to see... ever. With that said and done the art value of Sky Captain is quite high, although certainly not the near perfect CGI as we have seen many years ago in a similar teenage movie \\"Final Fantasy\\", which did it better, but the story was not really there either, whereas Sky Captain has live action actors in with the CGI, doesn't really end up doing that much for it in the end considering that the best thing in this offering is the sexy/funny/action heroine character that Angelina Jolie plays for the ten minutes she is in it and not the dumb blond character of Gwyneth Paltrow actually playing a dumb blond and obviously hating every second of it because Jude Law gets to blame absolutely everything on her (he should have loved it a little more maybe), Episode 1 has certainly much better background composite effects work, plus animations, Sky Captain never breaking the airplane special effects that Pearl Harbor had, EP1 though had an even better story, so that will tell you what kind of audience this End of Summer 2004 Sci-fi was catering for.<br /><br />By all the means, this is a great movie for young kids because there is no elements of strong violence, except for very light comedy violence towards the end and is devoid of bad language meaning anyone can watch it, and so for that reason should be not be trashed for being at least a glamorous looking Saturday Cinema morning candy stall sell-out that is probably actually worth their dollars this time but if you are older then maybe consider watching all the originals that this one tries to pay homage too first (everything from Jurassic Park to The Day the Earth Stood Still). I maybe still get a better kick out of watching black and white Flash Gordon episodes to give this anything more than a solid three stars. Fun if you like Flash though, but I think this one could have been better.than a solid three stars. Fun if you like Flash though, but I think this one could have been better.
B00BG0RSJ4|5|The Best Children's movie I've watched! Dory definitely keeps my kids entertained and laughing. I bought it when my kids were around 2 years old and they still watch it at age 10 and 13 years. I'm not one for watching kid's movies but even I thought this movie was great and I've found myself watching it with them several times . I think all parents' and grandparents of young children would benefit by adding this movie to their DVD Collection.
B001THZAAI|2|Excellent movie. Very funny but poor DVD quality. It freezes at time.
0439813786|4|My mother gave me this book as a gift for Xmas and it has just been released in Italy. I hope that the success will be huge also here. Italian translation is excellent.<br />I don't want to write too much and to tell what's inside the book. I think that everyone should read it, as every details of the book is worth seeing and it's such a beautiful object to have. The illustrations are amazing, in black and white, and the plot keeps you reading all the time, I finished in three days and I was hooked as I was in The Da Vinci Code and the atmosphere reminded me of the great book Emile and the detectives by Emile Kastner, which was my favourite book when I was a child.<br />I saw a Selzinck's interview before reading the book and I was thinking that the danger was that all the research made by Mr Selznick for Hugo Cabret could make the book too cold, but this luckily doesn't happened. I do really appreciated this invention. It's a very nice book.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Excellent product!!
B0064MPXFA|5|This is one of the best shows on tv!! I love the plot lines and the acting is terrific! Every episode makes you eager to see the next one!!!
B00IF8Q4FO|5|If you're reading this review as someone who already enjoys Chromeo's sound wondering if White Women is for you, stop reading right now and go buy the album. It has everything you've come to love about the Funklordz. Nothing but love for the ladies in every song, P on talkbox (albeit less than previous albums), big words that you have to pull out a dictionary for (I'm looking at you &#34;attenuate&#34; and &#34;acrimony&#34;), saxiphone solos, and nonstop thrilling funk that will have you moving all summer long. The throwback 80s sound is extremely popular right now, and no band has been doing it better than Chromeo. Several of the songs off White Women evoke such a feeling of nostalgia I feel like I should be sitting in front of a console television watching new episodes of Miami Vice, it's that authentic. From the 10 year old, almost primitive in comparison album &#34;She's in Control&#34; they just keep refining their sound; getting better and more funky with each offering. White Women is hands down their best album yet, and it will be hard to top.<br /><br />My top 5 songs in no particular order are:<br /><br />Jealous (I Ain't With It)<br />Somethingood<br />Come Alive<br />Fall Back 2U<br />Sexy Socialite<br /><br />Everything else is also very good, with the exception of &#34;Ezra's Interlude&#34;. It feels tacked on and lacks that Chromeo polish that the rest of the album shines with. It would have been much better had they dropped it off. If I had to pick a different least favorite song it might be Frequent Flyer, it's a little cheesy for my taste, but it's in a distant second to last place from Ezra.<br /><br />Overall a solid album for existing fans and people new to electrofunk as well.
B000000OQF|5|Possibly the greatest debut rock album ever!
B00LXTZ51Q|5|Great music as usual. Maroon 5 fantastic

6301792734|5|This VHS set was truly brand new, still with the plastic wrapping and special offer sticker from 1995, each individual cassette still shrink wrapped. With all the DVD sets available it was confusing as to which was the actual theatrical release before Lucas began 'fixing' them with enhanced sound and all, so I went with this VHS set. Also MUCH cheaper than all the dvd sets since I only wanted these three. The set is of the final retail offering of the original theatrical version of the 'first' three Star Wars. Thank you for offering this set, I truly am very grateful you had it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I love every season of Downton and will be so sad when it is done.

B00192IV9U|5|OMG. I love this album. Michael really put some work into these songs. Every song has that perfection that only Michael could bring. My favorite songs are \\"Best Joy\\" and \\"(I can't make it)Another Day. I have other favorites but these two stands out to me the most. If you are a big Michael Jackson fan you will love his latest work. R.I.P. Michael Jackson.
B00BD99JMW|4|This is a well written, very engaging book.  The main characters have depth and are sympathetic.  I do not want to spoil the ending so I will just say I wish it had ended differently.  Other than that, I really loved the book.  Would recommend this book to anyone who has been reading this series.  It would be difficult to read this book as a stand alone, though.
B000PKX2KA|5|Works as expected.  Use it with OpenCPN on a Windows 7 Laptop for navigation on our cruising sailboat.  Install was a snap and it picks up satellites in seconds.

B000002MQ9|5|This album is the best Gothic album around. Even if you are not in the Gothic scene. You'll love it!!! The song Xavier is the most moving song I've ever heard in a club or on the internet. The group alone is something to admire. Two individuals that come from differant parts of the world and from different lifes coming together for the pleasure of making music.
B0018QCXGY|5|I'm at a loss as to why Cloverfield has gotten such wildly varying reviews. This is one of the best \\"giant monster\\" films of all time, and I can only assume that some people are just put-off because it doesn't follow the usual template. The effects are fantastic, but not over used as is the current Hollywood practice. Also, unlike most monster movies, this film is character based, and that's the secret of its success. Make up your own mind... see the movie!
B000ICXQOM|4|this is a story of when Sam Raimi completely gave up trying to make horror and learned how to capitalize on his own farts.
0684833395|5|This book is not written in the normal prose most books are and if you can  get past that, which you should, then you will find a wonderfully written  book that is one of the better anti-war books of the last century.  Heller  keeps you entertained in following the war time experiences of Yossarian,  Milo, Major Major and many more in this book that everyone should  definitely read.
B00AEFY3MC|5|It's fitting that one of the funniest satires on space travel films should include in its cast the award-winning star of one of the best of the space-ship serious epics, Alien. That, of course, is Sigourney Weaver, who looks very good in this one despite being pretty far from a young woman in the first bloom of youth. In fact, everyone associated with the film looks good, or at least acts good, in this funny and even somewhat touching movie. One need not be a space junkie to get a kick out of it. One needs only to like a good laugh, a good natured laugh, at one of the most popular genre of  popular entertainment. Nothing in it to prevent it from being a movie of choice for the whole family (save, of course, the littlest among us who might be frightened by the action.)
0345803485|1|I've heard a rumor that this was actually written by a ghost-writer employed by J. Q. Rowlings, intended as an insert in an upcoming novel for adults. In the novel one of the characters talks about the junk being published and read these days, and uses the \\"Harry Rotter\\" books as an example of that. Another character mentions a vampire novel called \\"Dusk\\". Another character then hands another character the book \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\" as an example of the really bad stuff, much worse than \\"Rotter\\" I, II etc, or Vamp I, II etc.<br /><br />Then another character points out that another character is reading the whole thing online, and another character asks if it can be deleted. Then another character says, \\"then please do so\\". Then another character deletes it. Then another character says \\"Glad we live in a parallel universe\\". Then another character says \\"Yeah, you better believe it. Try living in the real one, where every ditz and her sister sends c--- like this around in email attachments\\".
B008FTAAG2|5|I heard one song on the radio that peeked my interest and once i listened to the whole cd i realized there was not a bad song on it.

1416960953|5|My second copy, loved the first one too much. Great graphics and explanations to accompany the Spiderwick books. May have to buy a spare just in case the kids ge hold of this one.
B00HQIZBE4|3|Carton box not enough hard to protect the logo box.
B000N2HBSO|5|An exceptional journey through Lincoln's political life, and his genius as one of the truly great men of the ages. Reads like a novel, hard to put down.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This is a fun game. I hope somewhere there is one for young children. The graphic are very nice to see.
B00P7PBD2C|5|Truly great movie.
B007C7UZIG|5|Awesome!!
B0018PJEYY|5|Not as loved as &#34;On the Threshold of a Dream&#34; or &#34;To Our Children's Children's Children&#34; or &#34;In Search of the Lost Chord&#34; but loved all the same. Any of the great pre-Pinder departure are pure art. This copy has so many extra tracks is a bargain for that reason only. Obscurities, yes. But if you have the great love of story telling in musical form, this is for you.
B0000AFX64|5|Loved it
B00E978FGQ|4|We purchased this so we could watch it on our camping trip.  We saw it three times and found something new each time.
B005GFPZYK|3|I'm not going to get into the controversy over the American war in Iraq or that of Chris Kyle. I think the way this book is written is more interesting and better written than the lone survivor by Marcus Littrell, because includes passages by his wife, Taya. Ultimately, I think it's interesting portrayal and self reflection of a man that has had to deploy into combat zone four different times and what that has done to him and his family.
B008Y7X50I|2|I guess this was for the younger group.
B000006TRV|5|The wall is most certainly the best cd ever created in the  last 40 years and will remain as the benchmark that other albums will be compared with.No cd collection will be complete without this album.So what are waiting for,please buy it.FIVE STARS.
B000GT6L9Y|5|my two nephews loved this and cracked up the whole time.  The story has two brothers and teaches and important theme about family and how you should not take each other for granted.  My nephews were about 7 and 9 and just could not stop laughing.  This movie was more pricey to rent which I don't understand but it was worth it to watch them laugh.
B00B0A5XQU|4|This is a great story for a rainy or snowy or lazy afternoon.  It a good mixture of sappy, funny and sad.  Not enough sadness to drag it down but to add character to the story.  What's even better is a free knitting project.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Downton Abby is perfectly written, perfectly executed and perfectly appropriate. I love every square inch of it!!
141694737X|1|Both my spouse and I dislike this book. While our child is semi-interested in opening the flaps, the actual story is wanting. Reading this story book aloud makes me cringe as the sentence structure is awkward.<br /><br />Why is this person writing a zoo? Why is the zoo sending this person dangerous animals? It makes no sense. Further why does the zoo send a dog in the end? I don't know of any zoo that has dogs. The story is idiotic and I don't recommend it for any adult that is interested in reading to their children.<br /><br />Update: My child now loves lifting the flaps and finding the different animals. I still hate the story and ignore the text completely opting to create my own narrative of what is happening. This can be a fun book, but the story needs to be rewritten.
B009UZBLSG|5|works like a charm, being able to view all my phone content on my flat screen? who needs dvd players or tv anymore
B0070Y46UY|5|This is a wonderful novel that contains rich narrative about a stowaway's survival in a life boat containing a Bengal tiger. There is much to be learned about life and living in this story.
B0047Y0FGY|3|I was disappointed that for me it just wasn't very funny. I feel like I got to know the author a bit and she seems like a very nice and fun person but didn't find her book to be very interesting nor that amusing. I did not appreciate some of  the language she used as well. To each his own!
B004GYY714|4|I use this more on my ROKU and listen to it through my television. No need for XM radio you can get everything through this app or channel depending on which device you use.
B00A9X9TIW|5|Always enjoy Bruce Willis.  Is there anything he cannot do?  Also, Joseph Gordon-Levitt shows great promise as being another actor who is chameleon-like in his on-screen portrayals.  There was enough publicity beforehand that we were able to follow the plot and make sense of the seemingly senselessness.  Only criticism:  wish there had been subtitles!  Us baby boomers are getting hard of hearing and are still vain enough that we do not want to buy hearing aids!
B00AU15HPC|4|I have been a Moody Blues and Justin Hayward fan since I first heard them in the 60s. I don't care for the &#34; country music &#34; style he has chosen for a couple of his songs but all in all a good CD.
B002ITWSUQ|5|I absolutely LOVED this movie. I'm a big Christina Ricci fan and loved every bit of this movie. I hope to get it on BluRay soon.
B000002NIW|5|Deftones.........thats all I really need to say is just Deftones. This band never ceases to amaze me in every aspect of their music. For a band that's been together for more than ten years, never broken up, and never EEEVER changed their style or music, I think they deserve respect from everyone.From &quot;My Own Summer&quot; to &quot;Damone&quot; the special hidden track 30 minutes into track #10 Mx(favorite), overall the cd is non-stop, get up, bash your head on stuff, hard rock with a couple of spots to sit down and rest(Mascara, Dai The Flu).And I dedicate the song &quot;Lotion&quot;,track 7 on Around The Fur, to a man in the music business who took a perfectly good hard rock band, practically turned it into a terrible rap rock group,and then loses his chance at signing an awesome band by trying to change their music in the process of ruining his own. But he will not be named. I will simply call him &quot;Dred Furst&quot;. Around the fur gets a 10 out of 5. DEFTONES RULE!!!! `:-)
B00992CF6W|5|it is.awesome that what I think
B000002B36|5|THERE ARE PARTS ON THIS ALBUM WHERE DAVID GILMOUR STUMBLES (TIME, US AND THEM, AND BREATHE) BUT THE MEMORABLE PERFORMANCES OF SHINE ON..., SORROW, LEARNING TO FLY, BRICK 2, RUN...,COMFORTABLY NUMB, AND MOST OF ALL, WISH  YOU WERE HERE, MAKE THIS THE  BEST PF ALBUM EVER.  YOU MIGHT SAY &quot;DARK  SIDE OF THE MOON IS BETTER&quot;, BUT CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT  DSOTM IS  ON THIS ALBUM IN ITS ENTIRETY (IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME NEW SOUND EFFECTS.   MONEY IS LONGER TOO! )AND THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS GREAT TOO.  BUY IT.
B000ZMCVRI|5|This is one of those albums that you HAVE TO own.... when you are in the mood it fits like a glove, at the end of the day it will put you in the mood... Rich Sultry and always smiling back at you.

B00DRPVE3M|4|It's a fun game. Sometimes messes up and freezes. But I would say that is normAL for a lot of games.
B007W8S2MG|5|It has great gameplay and really good game-time and has a lot of replay value.
B002KSPKRS|5|I bought this headset for my husband.  He absolutely LOVES it!! My boys also use it when playing games.  It keeps me from having to ask them to turn down the tv 20 times and they love the sound quality they get.  I would recommend this product to anyone who loves gaming!  It's also great to use when watching movies on the laptop.
B005HQ5S3G|5|Kelly,<br /><br />You support for Ron Paul shows that you are not only an incredible talent but also a smart person.

B0032CVAQQ|4|What Mr. Chapman explains in this very insightful book is something I've always known and struggled with because until now no one has explained it quite right. This book is a useful addition to any library.

B0026P3G12|5|Enjoyed Susan Boyle's /cd....I Dreamed a Dream.  Beautiful voice...good recording quality.  Well worth the $$$.
B008673ZAQ|5|I loved this book cannot wait untill the third book comes out. Couldn't put the book down. I felt close with the characters and can't wait to find out where the third book takes them
B001OQCV6A|5|This was the greatest Sherlock Holmes movie I have every seen. This is exactly how Sir Doyle would have done this movie if he was alive today. If you are a true Sherlock Holmes buff you will love this movie. And Please do not base this movie with the old Basil Rarthbone ones. That is like comparing apples to oranges.  Robert Downey Jr. is the new Sherlock Holmes. I can wait until they make the next one. I will be the first in line to see it. And you will be right behind me.
B0058UXHHK|4|This was a cute story, not quite what I was expecting from the cover (with all the pink I thought it would be more like the Shopaholic series - no I didn't read the blurb!), but it was nonetheless a fun beach read.<br /><br />The good: cute story, fun characters, and a good Voice. Good character devlopment. It was nice to see Rose grow up, and the author hit on some very difficult issues of domestic abuse (Trigger Warning).<br /><br />The bad: predictable... this is the same plot you've seen in almost every Small Town Mystery With a Pretty Girl ever. It's not breaking any new ground.<br /><br />Verdict: Perfect for a beach read or something to flip through while the kids are in swim lessons.
B00H1RMOI6|5|i did not open this blue ray yet,but i ,saw the movie in amsterdam,and i enjoyed the movie,and the sound in the theatre.i am sure that all fans of the actor will enjoy the movie,and the sound in the blue ray version , will be powerfull in dts-hd 7.1 sourround sound.

B0083EM24C|5|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />Passion Pit's new album GOSSAMER bounces and pops with color and frenetic energy.  Fuzzed out electro bass beats and poppy, high register vocals weave with skittery, electro soundscapes on one fascinating track after another.  Fascinating, because for all the get-up-and-dance dynamic there's an underlying sadness to many of the lyrics - which creates kind of a tasty musical sweet and sour effect.  In other words, the album cover is right on target with its depiction of sunshine and clouds.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener

6303407161|5|full of moral's and emotion's dialectic. But I always feel the director like to made(create and control) emotion. His movies are artificial...anyway I knew Relph Fiennis from renting this video two years ago and since then I've been his fan. And, about his another movie \\"Avenger\\", I need to replenish my review: He's exteremely charming everytime he's in the telephone booth!
B00005NKCM|5|If you're reading this you don't need to be convinced as to the quality and worth of this series.  However, you do need to be told that both the picture and sound quality of this new DVD release are EXCELLENT, and a marked improvement over both the previous A&amp;E video release and syndication copies which have aired on various PBS stations over the years.  While a previous review printed here mentions queer &quot;green tints&quot; and audio problems, NOTHING of the sort was in evidence in the copy I viewed. Quite simply, a beautiful job was done in remastering the original video elements for this DVD presentation, and you're likely to see and hear many details that have previously gone unnoticed. Don't hesitate to purchase this fine set for a moment, and let's hope that the remaining four seasons will follow shortly. Ruby would be proud!
B001KDQ4KQ|5|This book kept me turning the page. I loved it. The ending haunted me. I wanted to read a sequel. I thought about it for days afterword.
B00SSQZ076|1|I'm hoping this is a downloading error.  Cover page does not match - mine has Chinese characters on the cover page.  Formatting & grammar make this unreadable.  First paragraph - &#34;If always doing is obvious or everyone at do of matter, you could not earn money&#34;.  Second Amazon needs to pull this version!  DO NOT BUY KINDLE EDITION!
B0050PYNO4|5|First off, it looks great.  The bigger thing is that this is a wonderful movie. I loved Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in SHAUN OF THE DEAD but I love this movie more.  It looks great on Blu Ray and has an alternate cut -- whose differences are in early scenes -- but the story is the thing and it is a really fun movie.  I am not crazy about Seth Rogen but as PAUL he rocks.  So many good actors in this.  I saw this on HBO and knew I had to own it.  Extras about the movie are really interesting. Hey, an Alien with three tits -- you have to see the movie to know what I am talking about -- \\"awesome\\".  If you love Simon Pegg, Nick Frost movies ( SHAUN OF THE DEAD, HOT FUZZ) YOU WILL LOVE THIS!  You just have to kinda trust me on this one. Others will go into spoilers  -- like you wanted to know the whole damned story before you got to see it.  I refuse to do that.  This one is worth your time and a keeper.
B0000027F3|5|I have been a Priest fan since high school, as well as a guitar player.  I have always admired Glenn Tipton as the finest heavy metal guitarist.  He is not only the chief songwriter on most Priest songs but their main axeman as well.  Don't get me wrong, KK Downing is a very good guitarist but he uses the tremelo bar way too much and doesn't play with feeling.  Glenn, on the other hand, is incredibly melodic and super-fast, when necessary.  This album has some incredible guitar solos, particularly on &quot;All Guns Blazing&quot;, which is done by my pal Glenn.  If you want music faster than Megadeth, but more melodic, this is it!

B003O86FMW|4|The second installment in the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy, continues to chronicle the misadventures of our teenage heroine, Katniss Everdeen. Growing dissent throughout the district's culminates in dramatic fashion at the announcement of the 75th hunger games. Drama and carnage to ensue. Delightfully written with much of the original cast plus a few new players and a fun twist at the end. Really builds suspense for the climax that is the final novel.
B00DRPVE3M|4|I like to play this game it's fun and helps pass the time. You should play this game you will enjoy it
B0049J3QF4|5|We rented this for the weekend for my 2 1/2 year old who had never seen it before.  Good price for a rental and now he is really into Lightening McQueen and the other characters.
B006LSZECO|4|Saw movie , want to see how book is.
B00HG1UNIU|1|You spend a ton of time upgrading, but the ride along the way is fun.  I got it free... but I would pay for it.<br /><br />Updated 10/19/14.  I updated the program and everything was wiped out except my starting throne and the alternate universe finn.  Hours upon hours of effort now gone.  It is unacceptable.  The game originally received 5 stars from me, but 1 or zero sums up the way I feel right now.
B0040Z9H5K|1|I did not get this item. So I am not able to give a review on this. Was not charged
B006LSZECO|3|It was difficult to get my interest . Had to read over 50 pages but then I HAD TO FINISH IT.
B001N1DPDE|5|The perfect survival knife is all but impossible to find, my list of criteria that I look for in a survival knight is pretty demanding and includes the following items:<br /><br />Around 10 inch overall length<br />Full tang (the metal of the blade runs all the way to the butt of the knife)<br />High carbon steel (holds an edge longer than stainless)<br />Straight blade, no serration (easier to sharpen in the field)<br />Pronounced hilt, fingers won’t slip onto blade<br />Thick steel, can be used to pry and not bend or break<br />Removable handle grips (can be wrapped in paracord)<br />Made in the U.S.A.<br /><br />That said the KA-Bar Becker BK2 Campanion Fixed Blade Knife is the closest to perfect that I have found. Although this knife is a little heavier than I would like, I strongly recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|4|I don't usually read Stephen King since he scares me! But this book wasn't his typical horror read.  I enjoyed it since it made you think \\"what if?\\"....I would recommend it highly. The time travel plot was fascinating....he did a great job researching how it was back in the 50's (when I was growing up) Do more like this one Stephen!
B005WUHAX8|5|Love ie !! A girl at work has one and love it. Fix really good. Was easy to put on and take off again.
B00EIL7E9C|5|One of The best so far.
B00005JKWJ|3|I saw the first Blade when it was released in theaters and enjoyed it. Though perhaps it would be more apt to say that I bought into it. Being a vampire aficionado of a sort, I was willing to accept the idea of Blade and found a chuckle or two in the idea of vampires being able to walk in sunlight after a good dose of sunscreen was applied. What supported the first installment of Blade so wonderfully was the atmosphere. (That and perhaps Stephen Dorff who pulled off the smug vampire villain quite well.) Blade II, however, was missing that key ingredient as well as a couple of others.<br />The whole of Blade II is based on exaggerated violence. That's about it. The story plants a series of \\"mysteries\\": who's the traitor inside the Blood Pack?, being the primary. Unfortunately, it's not all that difficult to figure it out and once that falls into place so does the rest of the plot. It really shouldn't have been that predictable. The basic idea, a new mutation of vampire bent on wiping out the original strain, is not necessarily a bad one, but the unexplored  psychological motivations behind their attack reduces it to mediocre at best. And, really, the task force, known as the Blood Pack, that is formed in order to hunt and destroy the Reapers must be the most ineffectual group of vampires I have ever seen. With the exception of possibly two members-- where's the speed, the grace, the unparalleled strength? They show no signs of heightened senses whereas Blade, half mortal that he is, knows all and sees all.  And as I've said, the atmosphere in this installment is lacking. It doesn't seem as charged and energized. It isn't as sophisticated as the original and it isn't conducive to the violence that is presented--with, again, perhaps one exception. But even then it harkens back to the original Blade with its strong sense of the night club scene and the abandonment that the vampires find in their immortality.<br />The action sequences, the ones involving Snipes and somereally snazzy martial arts moves, were very good. The ones involving blood and turning vampires into ash and bone were pathetically overdone. It was a case of special effects overwhelming everything else. And the very amount of fake blood they used alone must have severely taxed the budget. They were going for gore, that much is obvious, but it seems much too foolish to be realistic.<br />Overall I thought that the original Blade was much better, much more interesting and fresh, but if you've seen the first one you should see the second one as well. There's enough action to keep one satisfied even if the storyline is lackluster.
B00AF6MF9I|4|Fun way to kill time. You can sit down and immerse in the games strategy  or just play around trying to build up your base.
0783229526|3|The main thought that kept occurring to me while watching &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; was: IS there ANY movie that could translate Hunter S. Thompson's book to the screen in a satisfying way?<br />And I don't think there is.  It's also just as difficult to re-create an acid trip on film.  And Terry Gilliam tries very hard to accomplish both of these impossible tasks. (is it any wonder that Gilliam's has been trying for YEARS to film &quot;Don Quixote&quot; for???).  <br />Gilliam throws EVERYTHING into the mix.  He starts with the kitchen sink and then moves into the basement and the garage.  And as a result, the movie is polarizing: people are either going to love it or hate it.  From scene to scene, my opinion goes up and down.  But the bottom line is -- as long as there are bongs, dormrooms and undergraduates: Pink Floyd will never stop selling albums and this movie will always have an audience.  <br />For a Hunter Thompson fan, there are things to love in this film.  It looks incredible: bright and shiny as a new red shark, with a production design that must've taken an army to assemble.<BR>And Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro completely nail their roles.  They BECOME Ralph Steadman's illustrations with performances that go all the way and then some -- at times, watching this movie was literally like seeing the images from the book projected directly on-screen.  Although it's a bit funny that Johnny Depp tries so hard to recreate Thompson's sprawling crab-like walk -- Thompson walks like that because he's 6'4 and long-legged... and Depp is, well, less strapping. That's a quibble, of course; Benecio Del Toro put on 60 pounds for this part, but Depp can't exactly gain height -- he did shave his head, though.<br />On the other hand, the movie is too all over the place to be completely successful.  The tone changes drastically on a regular basis, plunging from screwball comedy to somber message to disgusting regurgitation to sly social commentary to vicious anger, then moving off in another dozen different directions.  By the time Raoul Duke flashes back to San Francisco in the 60's (and the Youngbloods are hauled out to provide their oft-used historical/musical cue with &quot;Get Together&quot;), you will believe a movie can have 120 different personalities in just under 2 hours.  <br />Which is not to say I don't like this film.  You can't love it, but it's hard to completely dislike, and I find myself dropping it into my player every six months or so and skipping to favorite scenes (the wild, confusing opening; the Circus Circus fiasco; the elevator stand-off).  Personally, I always thought that, instead of making &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; Oliver Stone should've tackled Las Vegas (using the same cinematic techniques and Kelsey Grammar as Raoul Duke, but saying that always makes people look at me funny) but Stone didn't do it (and probably would've made an equally problematic movie) so this is the film that was made.  It may leak noxious fluids onto my carpet whenever it's on my TV, but... it has a certain charm, nonetheless.
B00CW6DAKC|1|This was a great game I really enjoyed this game. But I got to only play it for a little over 40 days. One I turned it on to play the game and it started me all over at the beginning of the game. Why? NO warning and all the money I put into the game. I will never pay for another game again.  Free should me free anyway. What a rip off. I feel like I got sucked up with this game only to be taken advantage. So for that I can only give you 1 star.
B0034G4OQS|4|It is Christmas and Santa's gift delivery is a high-tech operation assisted by the elves. Arthur is his youngest son and is a bit if a misfit helper. After a child is missed during the gift delivery, Arthur sets out to make sure she gets her present. This is a fun movie with excellent animation and very effective 3D. The characters are endearing without pandering too much to the child audience. It also provides children some insight into how Santa is able to deliver gifts to millions of children around the world. The finale has some Christmas magic, and overall, this is a film that both the kids and their parents should enjoy.
B00004BZ16|4|When I first listened to Sandinista!, I told my wife that it sounded like what happens when a talented band smokes a lot of marijuana, goes into the studio and leaves the tape running for us to hear everything, warts and all.  There are all sorts of quirky moments, odd sounds, a deliberate lack of focus, and an overuse of dub echo production that leaves one bewildered as to whether this is one of those bad experimental albums that all bands feel compelled to make.   <br /> <br />After several listens on long commutes across L.A., I find myself asking the question, \\"Is this the boldest, most sublime record ever made in western music?\\"   <br /> <br />That is Sandinista! in a nutshell.  It is amazing, confounding, delightful, challenging, maddening, forward-looking, retrospective, ambitious, uncompromising, sincere, hopeful, despairing, pretentious, and above all, compelling.   <br /> <br />Sandinista! feels like the soundtrack to a film or musical that was never made.  That film/musical is the world of 1980 as seen by Joe Strummer and Mick Jones.  <br /> <br />Sandinista! is defined by its diversity of musical styles.  The record embraces nearly every form of music that comprised western music during its day (1980):  rap (`The Magnificent Seven'), motown (`Hitsville U.K.'), punk rock (`Police on My Back', `Somebody Got Murdered'), smooth slow jazz (`Broadway'), big band music (`Look Here'), waltz (`Rebel Waltz'), 60's psychedelic pop (`The Street Parade'), Beatlesque arrangements (`Something About England'), Afro-Caribbean music (`Let's Go Crazy', `Washington Bullets'), ska-jazz (`If Music Could Talk'), 80's new wave (`The Call Up'), Bluegrass country rock (`The Leader', `Midnight Log'), and of course, dub reggae (`Junco Partner', `One More Time').   <br /> <br />There are 36 songs on this sprawling journey, so taking little bites at a time is the best way to approach it.  A good way to get a handle on the record is to divide the tracks into A Lists and B Lists.  Thislist is likely to change, but here is where I stand at the current time: <br /> <br />The `A' List Tracks:  These are the no-brainer classics, quirks and all. <br /> <br />`The Magnificent Seven';  <br />`Hitsville U.K.';  <br />`Ivan Meets G.I. Joe'  <br />`Somebody Got Murdered'  <br />`Up in Heaven (Not Only Here)'  <br />`Police on my Back'  <br />`The Call Up' <br />`Washington Bullets' <br /> <br />The `A-`  List: (not quite A list, but solid tracks that grow on you so much you look forward to hearing them as much as the A list standards): <br /> <br />`The Leader' (The Clash meet Johnny Cash);  <br />`The Street Parade' (which could've been a top 40 hit if not for the overuse of dub production);  <br />`One More Time' (probably the best of the reggae influenced tracks);  <br />`Lose This Skin' (sounds like a cross between a Mississippi riverboat fiddle band and a broadway musical with impassioned singing);  <br />`Let's Go Crazy'  <br /> <br /> <br />The `B+' List:  Songs which have many endearing qualities, but are just a notch below the others: <br /> <br />`If Music Could Talk' (Joe Strummer's favorite) <br />`The Sound of Sinners' (fantastic lyrics and a very catchy gospel chorus) <br />`Rebel Waltz' <br />`Version City' <br />`Charlie Don't Surf' <br />`Junkie Slip' <br />`Kingston Advice' <br /> <br />The B List:  Songs which aren't bad, but haven't really clicked with me, though I know that others like them: <br /> <br />`Lightning Strikes' <br />`Junco Partner' <br />`Something About England' <br />`Midnight Log' <br />`Corner Soul' <br /> <br />The C list:  Everything else.  This includes novelty items, throw aways, dub, and stuff that probably should've been left on the cutting room floor.  Good examples would include `Version Pardner'; `One More Dub'; `The Crooked Beat' and the horrible (though humorous) remake of `Career Opportunities'. <br /> <br /> <br />That's 20 great songs, 5 additional pretty good ones and some novelty tracks that might click with some but not with others.  That is better than most CDs released in any era.  Get Sandinista!  It is a very fulfilling musical journey.  Just don't expect something straightforward like `Give `Em Enough Rope', anything off the first Clash album or even `London Calling'.  This record has more in common with The Beatles `White Album' than most any other Clash record.   <br />

B00008S2VG|5|Almost everybody in the world heard the single and title track of the 'American Life' album, and for the first time in years, people had an opinion about a Madonna record. It might be a difficult single to get used to, but it serves as a good introduction to the album. Too bad the non-controversy surrounding the video marred the album’s release.<br />On 'Ray of Light' post-motherhood she was spiritual. On 'Music' she was in the throws of Guy Ritchie induced love and a newfound friend in Mirwais. On 'American Life', Madonna talks and really opens up.<br />'American Life' succeeds as an album where 'Music' failed. It sounds like an album, with an agenda of what the singer wants to say. On 'Music' the mix of Mirwais, William Orbit and Mark 'Spike' Stent all producing made it sound unresolved as a whole and a bit messy. And it had 'American Pie' on it. Here the sound is consistent and as a result it's brave and strong where 'Music' was afraid to really go for it. <br />Initially it's not an easy listen. There is a lot going on here, but it sounds fantastic and definitely an album that you want to listen to again and again. <br />With her vocals right up in the mix, this is as close as we've ever got to Madonna. More so, than the last album and also on 'Ray of Light'. <br />It's braver too - no longer does she hedge her bets and mix an album with people which she scored earlier successes with like Pat Leonard on 'Ray of Light' ('Frozen'), and William Orbit on 'Music' ('Runaway Lover', 'Amazing'). On 'American Life' it's her vision and Mirwais's production alone - and it's all the better for it. <br />However, like 'Erotica' this album could be overlooked if people judge the album by the first single. And like with 'Erotica', that would be a real shame. <br />Here is my song by song break down:<br />American Life - <BR>First single and it's the mission statement of the album. Whether you love it or hate it, as the beginning of the album it makes sense and serves as a good introduction as to what the rest of the albums' lyrics are about. It's also, in my opinion, the weakest song. <br />Hollywood - <BR>This is the second single. After the first track it's actually a huge relief - instantly catchy and fast-paced it reminds you of what Madonna is about when she's good. Great tunes, attitude. It starts with bird singing noises in the background, and soon Madonna gets into the Hollywood is not-a-very-nice-place theme of the song. <br />I’m So Stupid - <BR>A bit slower with her voice distorted at the start. It's sounds a little 60s with the synths in the background, and has more of a rock feel to it. With lyrics like 'Everybody's looking for something', it's a grower. The lyrics are a little basic for a Madonna song, but the vocals and stop-beat guitar riff is truly infectious.<br />Love Profusion - <BR>Single No.4, probably the most straightforward dance track on the album. I think this is one of those that could become a favorite and it feels like a classic upbeat Madonna song. It fuses the message behind the song 'American Life' with Mirwais' beats and acoustic elements really well. <br />Nobody Knows Me - <BR>This song is insane. Very electronic, chaotic, fast, manic. Pounding synths. There is so much going on here several it'll take several plays to really get it, but it's ace. Includes one of the best Madonna lyrics ever: “No one’s telling you how to live your life, but it’s a set up until you’re fed up.”<br />Nothing Fails - <BR>A grand choice for single no.3, this is classic downbeat Madonna. It's also the first time the album drops the pace. Think 'Don't Tell Me' mixed with the low, gravelly voice on 'Live to Tell'. The London gospel choir sounds amazing when their voices take off. Strong, with beautiful strings. It really is a shame that the Nevin’s mix was used as a radio single, because more people should have had the chance to hear this far superior version.<br />Intervention - <BR>Mid-paced, it builds up to be a lovely album track. Not a single, but with its REM 80s-style guitars in the background it's a good track to follow 'Nothing Fails'. <br />X-Static Process - <BR>Rumors that this would be the big 'Impressive Instant' dance track, like that from “Music”, were wrong. It's one of the slowest tracks. It's also striking because throughout the album Madonna’s vocals feel very close and real - here she sounds bare. Intimate. <br />Mother and Father - <BR>This isn't the sad confessional track the title leads you to believe. It's stronger than previous attempts on a similar theme - 'Inside of Me', 'Promise to Try' and 'Oh Father'. The Daft Punk-esque beats and yet another rap by M herself, relegate this novelty song to album track status, as I’m sure even Madonna herself is a little embarrassed by it, now that it’s out of her hands!<br />Die Another Day - <BR>Like the 'American Life' single, this song had mixed reactions when released. But bizarrely, because the production sounds consistent throughout the whole album, it fits. Die Another Day finds itself a home here and compliments the set. The electro/organic combo is elegant, Madonna vocals are bang on and this easily ranks as the best Bond theme ever!<br />Easy Ride - <BR>Like 'Gone' at the end of “Music”, again this feels like an epitaph for the album. It sounds like she's exhausted - and no wonder - in a good way, again the strings sound amazing. A great and natural end to the album. Also rumored to be the 5th and final single, with remixes for it and Mother and Father, supposed to hit the shelves somewhere along her “re-Invention Tour”.

This is thrilling on Blu , if you like this sort of film (disaster) . The cast is fun and interesting . Pierce Brosnan (in this film) strikes me as a good old fashioned rugged man of action . I'm a fan of the guy in general . Linda looks lovely . I really like Pierce's boss in this film too . I recognize him most for losing his head in John Carpenter's 1982 remake of THE THING . I've seen him in other stuff as well , but am uncertain where . He's perfectly cast to my mind . I love the diversity of the science team and the beautiful locations . Yeah , some of the dialog is pretty unintentionally funny . I don't know or care if stuff that happens on screen could actually happen . As a matter of fact , i'm certain MUCH of it could not . Roger Donaldson really does a swell job here though . He meted things out and i like morsels . FUNtastic and having a protracted and very exciting pay off . Gold standard in subtitles as well . Providing much more description (similar to closed captions) than MOST subtitles .

B0000029DD|4|GRACE was Jeff Buckley's first album and sadly the only album ever released by him, as he died in a tragic drowning accident in 1997. GRACE contains moments of instrumental glory, presided over by Jeff's passionate voice. \\"Mojo Pin\\" is a well-written opening track, beginning with a slow introduction and ending in a maelstrom of guitar and wailing vocals. \\"Grace\\" is emotion made song.<br />One must, however, consider GRACE a landmark album only because it was Jeff's first and shows the potential that he had as a musician. If Jeff had lived to release another album, calling GRACE a masterpiece would be like calling a baby's first steps a spectacular ballet performance. There are positively dull moments on GRACE, such as Jeff's cover of the Leonard Cohen travesty \\"Hallelujah.\\" I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels it's a shame Jeff wasted his talent on Cohen's painfully contrived lyrics. \\"Lilac Wine\\" is also a rather annoying track.<br />I am a fan of Tim Buckley, and came to Jeff's work hearing that he was Tim's son. For someone familiar with Tim Buckley's work, Jeff's songwriting is an interesting perspective. Jeff only met his father once, spending a week with him when he was 8 years old, but in spite of the absence of a relationship between them, echoes of Tim permeates the songs of Jeff. In \\"Mojo Pin,\\" Jeff sings of love in a masochistic sense (\\"Send whips of opinion down my back/give me more\\") like his father did in the infamous 1973 album GREETINGS FROM L.A. Most haunting, however, is the final track on GRACE. In \\"Dream Brother\\" Jeff begs a friend not to abandon his pregnant girlfriend and unborn child like Tim abandoned Jeff. \\"Don't be like the one who made me so./Don't be like the one who left behind his name,/'cause they're waiting for you/like I waited for mine/and nobody ever came.\\"<br />Jeff Buckley's work is truly \\"alternative\\" music and may not appeal to those whose music tastes run to the mainstream. His use of unusual time signatures and song structures can be best compared to Red House Painters, although Jeff's song do not use acoustic instrumentation as much as RHP. GRACE also requires a few listens to grown comfortable. I would recommend GRACE to those who have eclectic tastes, and I'm certain that any listener on hearing the album will reflect on what a shame it is that such a talented musician was lost so young.res can be best compared to Red House Painters, although Jeff's song do not use acoustic instrumentation as much as RHP.

Again, like a GREAT book I don't want to end.

B00T3DNKIE|3|This novel illustrates the fact that the reason To Kill A Mockingbird is such a great book is not because the author writes beautifully, but rather because she tells a great story.  That is not the case with Go Set A Watchman.  The best parts of the book are when Jean Louise (the adult Scout) has flashbacks to her youth and childhood and this explains why Harper Lee was instructed by her editor to rewrite the story from the perspective of her childhood self.  This book is interesting from a historic standpoint, but it never would have fared well had it been published in the '60s instead of To Kill A Mockingbird or prior to it.  Its perspectives on race are very dated and it does not seem to be a work that would have had much impact on changing hearts and minds in that regard.  This is a one-time read for me.
1594200653|5|\\"Postwar - A history of Europe since 1945\\" by Tony Judt is the best book I have read on the subject.  Its perspective on events since 1989 up to 2005 is remarkably good.<br /><br />Only two generations have passed since World War 2, and the risk with a book about this period is that its conclusions and themes may prove to be foolish in the fullness of time.  One is reminded of Mao's response to a question about the consequences of the French Revolution, \\"It is too soon to tell.\\"<br /><br />We can probably be reasonably sure that the history of Europe from the collapse of the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires plus the Soviet upheavals after WW1 to the final territorial and ethnic spasm in the Balkans in the 1990s can probably be written with some certainty, although we still lack access to original source documents for the Soviet role over that period.<br /><br />All books dealing with post-war European history suffer from the fact that limited archival material from the Soviet Union has been available for study.  Historians are forced to rely on sporadic Soviet documents and speeches and the assessments of western diplomats and analysts to interpret Soviet thinking and intentions.<br /><br />The result is that this book (and others) views the history of the Communist world with Western eyes and Western mindsets.  We are denied access to the thoughts, fears and hopes of communist politicians and dissidents and their influence on history.  Hopefully, one day, more archival and other documents will become available to historians and a more balanced history will emerge over time.<br /><br />If I may give another analogy: at present historians writing of the Communist world are peering through the windows of a house trying to understand the lives of the family living there.  They see people going to and fro in the rooms.  Occasionally they get glimpses of what the individuals are reading and writing.  Sometimes a resident will hold up a photo or document for the historian to see.  But the historian cannot hear what they say, nor can he go inside the house to talk to them or inspect their documents, or ask them their views on the outside world.  He can draw conclusions only from what he sees through the windows.<br /><br />A big message from this book is that the recovery and prosperity enjoyed by Western Europe for half a century is due to both the US and the USSR.  The US provided critical economic aid and political support to Europe, including West Germany, because of the threat assumed to be posed by the USSR.  Without such a threat, the US may have retreated into isolationism, leaving the Europeans to sort out the mess.  Without the threat of the USSR, there may not have been the will forgo reparations from Germany and to encourage West Germany to recover.  These were distinct possibilities in the immediate post-war period.<br /><br />The book deals only with the history of Western Europe, with very little explanation of the impact of the rest of the world on that history.  Events and policies in the USSR and USA are covered to the extent that they directly impinged on Europe.  However, Communist and post-colonial developments in Asia and Africa certainly reinforced cold war attitudes in Europe, if they did not directly influence them.<br /><br />What must still be provisional is the history of Europe since say 1990.  Will the European Union and the Euro survive the test of time, or will one or the other go into the dustbin of history?<br /><br />Judt's description of the moribund Soviet economies in the 1970s is the best I have read on the subject. The joke \\"You pretend to work and we pretend to pay you\\" sums up the cynicism and inefficiencies of Eastern bloc economies.<br /><br />His account of the final years of the Eastern Bloc is excellent, as is discussion of the key issues facing Europe in the aftermath of its collapse and the apparent success of free market ideologies.<br /><br />The final chapters of the struggle between socialism (in the form of modern European social capitalism) and capitalist individualism on the US model has yet to be written.  Communism has probably failed for all time, but that does not mean that unrestrained US-style free enterprise will take over Europe.  Beware of historians who proclaim \\"the end of history\\" and the \\"triumph of liberal democratic capitalism\\".  Fortunately, Judt is too sensible to make such hubristic claims, although he does lean towards the European model.<br /><br />Which model of society will \\"win\\" in the course of the 21st Century - the unfettered capitalism of the US, or the social capitalism of the EU?  What is the future of the nation state in the face of the challenges from terrorist extremism?<br /><br />These are important questions, and Judt's book provides the reader with an excellent exposition of the political, social and economic circumstances surrounding them.rs of the struggle between socialism (in the form of modern European social capitalism) and capitalist individualism on the US model has yet to be written.

B001CTA1RK|3|\\"Transporter 3\\" is an action film in every sense. A brain isn't required to watch it, and I have a feeling there wasn't much of a brain at work when making it. Does that make it worth seeing? Not really. I'll be the first to admit that mindless action can be a fun, harmless distraction. Consider this summer's \\"Wanted,\\" a film I recommended not for its story, but for its stylish comic book excess. It was meant to be preposterous. \\"Transporter 3\\" doesn't have the same appeal. It feels forced, contrived, and desperate, as if the filmmakers knew right from the start that they didn't have much to work with. Maybe it's become tiresome to once again watch Jason Statham play the exact same role. Or maybe it's the fact that the plot is paper-thin, awkwardly humorous, and oddly derivative of older James Bond films. It could be any number of things. All I know is that, even for something that's purely escapist, it isn't trying very hard.    There are, however, a few interesting ideas at work. Having moved from Miami back to the South of France, professional Transporter Frank Martin (Statham) has the odds stacked against him when an American assassin named Johnson (Robert Knepper) forces him into moving a package from Marseilles to Odessa. The package: A beautiful, if sulky, Ukrainian woman named Valentina (Natalya Rudakova), the kidnapped daughter of Leonid Vasilev (Jeroen Krabbe), the head of his country's Environmental Protection Agency. In order to ensure compliance from both Frank and Valentina, Johnson has each fitted with a special bracelet that will explode if they step more than seventy-five feet away from Frank's car, an Audi A8 W12. But you know Frank--he doesn't even follow his own rules, let alone rules that are imposed on him. So just imagine all the eye-popping visuals and impossible stunts that are in store for you.    Here are some examples. (1) On a long road in the middle of nowhere, Frank is speeding away from a pursuing car. Up ahead are two slow-moving eighteen-wheelers, which, for reasons known only to the filmmakers, are going in the same direction while occupying both sides of the road. In order to escape, Frank has to go between the trucks. But how can he when the gap is so narrow? Somehow, he manages to tilt his car to one side, balancing it only on the left-side wheels. (2) After driving his car into a lake, Frank uses the air from the tires to inflate large orange balloons, which, of course, returns the car to the surface. After he somehow gets the engine restarted, he drives to a bridge, zooms off, and lands on top of a speeding passenger train, where poor Valentina is in Johnson's evil clutches.    Yes, it's all in the spirit of fun. Even so, something was missing. I couldn't suspend disbelief as easily as I could for films like \\"Wanted.\\" It could be due to the character development, which is not normally associated with mindless action films. Consider Valentina, always moping, always aloof, always thinking about death. Yet at the same time, she yearns for Frank's affection. I think it all began when Frank found himself in hand-to-hand combat with a group of Johnson's thugs in the middle of a mechanic's garage. In that particular moment, Frank's fighting style can essentially be described as an aggressive striptease, his jacket, tie, and shirt removed at one point or another. Needless to say, Valentina liked what she saw. She uses it against him later on after grabbing the car keys, exiting the car, and moving away; she won't give Frank the keys back unless he removes his shirt.    And as for Frank ... well, there really isn't much that can be said. Twice before he's been a monotone, wisecracking, testosterone pumping, seemingly indestructible action hero, and he remains one in this new film. Of course, the fact that he's always so serious and professional doesn't stop him from falling for Valentina, which is hard to understand given the complete lack of chemistry between them. It probably would have been better had writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen hadn't made an attempt at character development. Don't expose Valentina's frailty or even her uncanny ability to tell Frank where in Europe to find the best food. And don't have her and Frank fall in love. Love is too deep and meaningful for a man that transports things for a living.    The comedy relief--for lack of a better term--mostly comes from the interactions between Frank and his long-time friend, Inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand). At the start of the film, they have a spirited debate on whether Jerry Lewis was funnier than Dean Martin. Tarconi, true to his French upbringing, believes Lewis is a comedic genius. Frank takes the opposite approach: \\"Anyone can fall down and get a laugh, but a real genius does it while drinking and smoking.\\" This is, we eventually discover, a parallel to a later observation made by Tarconi about why Russians are always so morose: \\"I remember reading Dostoevsky and thinking, `Don't these people ever laugh?'\\" Maybe they do and maybe they don't. What does it matter? It's an amusing line, although I wonder why there needed to be a sense of humor at all. Who made it a rule that action films had to be funny in order to be entertaining? Normally, all you have to do is give me something good to look at. Unfortunately, for everything \\"Transporter 3\\" could have been as an escapist action film, it just didn't live up to my expectations.
B00HDMMISA|5|This book speaks to real life people.  It had parts that made me laugh out loud and parts that left me heartbroken. You can easily relate to these characters and see how one \\"little lie\\" can snowball into catastrophe. Great book that kept me engaged the whole time.
B00001SIES|5|I think Showbiz is one of the best albums released in 1999. This album gives me the chills - the singer`s voice is one of the most beautiful Ive heard in a long time. Its not that far from that of the great Jeff  Buckley. Muse are often compared to radiohead, but in my opinion theyre 10  times better. This album rocks - I listened to the first track (sunburn)  &amp; the album hasnt left my cd player since. A really cool band. Get the  album now before they get HUGE.

All the other DVDs work well (though i hate the fact that some of them are full  screen - despite the fact that's supposedly what Kubrick wanted) - but this  DVD is doubled layered - and my DVD player has a lot of trouble reading the  disk - with screen pauses between each scene!<br />But the film itself was  very entertaining - yes it's long, but the cinematography is great - and I   noticed all sorts of trick Kubrick plays with the viewer -
B005GFPZYK|5|This book was an easy read and unlike the movie was not a propaganda piece. It gives the reader a small glimpse into the life of Chris Kyle while serving as a Navy Seal sniper. The novel gives accounts of Kyle's life in small snapshots of his time prior to joining the military, meeting his future wife, during his many tours into Iraq and other moments of his life. The reader will get a better sense of the man and the struggles and sacrifices he made to keep our service men safe while still trying to be a husband and father. Good read.
014242417X|5|This book was funny. The characters were funny. The book made me realize a lot of difficulties  that people with cancer have. Also how close family's are. It is a funny romantic novel when a girl meets a boy. The boy meets the girl and they fall in love.They go on a trip. Then the boy confesses that his cancer came back. Then the boy dies of cancer. That is pretty much it. It might seem like a boring book. But I read this book and its one of my all time favorite books. In this book you will like the character and then you will hate the character again. Its a love hate relationship book.

B00RW1J72C|4|Nice cross between the lore of Vlad and myth of Dracula.  I would watch it again.
B0066WJLU6|4|Great app it is a very good source of light when you're in a bind. The color wheel is a neat feature just for kicks.
B00DC7N9NS|1|I don't know what they were thinking when they chose the cast for this movie. The CGI was cheap and unrealistic, the actors delivered cold and unbelievable lines and the costume design leaned more towards an S&M movie rather than a children's show. Too much skin-tight leather pants a leather bosom corsets. James Franco plays the part of the Great and Powerful Oz but his character is never warm, never wise and always sleezy. The story was terribly written and poorly executed. The little china girl was the best actor in the movie, and SHE WAS ANIMATED!  Just TERRIBLE!
B006CA9ANK|5|I can't believe I didn't know this was released over two months ago!  I just downloaded today and can't stop listening.
B0009P66TK|4|Bought the watch as an anniversity present for my boyfriend and he loved it.  Loved the large face and especially the band.

B00P42WROG|1|It didn't keep my attention.
B00B2EWNWG|2|There were a few clever moments in this, but the picture overall was a bit of a disjointed mess.<br /><br />I was not aware that it was going to be a hip-hop fighting show, which could have been interestingly stylized (Last Dragon, Samurai Champloo, Black Dynamite, etc.), but such was not the case. I love kung fu films, so was disappointed there were only a couple scenes that really had notable choreography (the yin-yang fight and Lucy Liu were cool). It felt like they kept picking facets of the project to focus on that ultimately did nothing to contribute to the film as a whole, such as story points that didn't matter, character development for someone that didn't motivate the story, etc. I could have forgiven even that if there had been more kung fu in the movie!
B000002KDX|5|Out of all of the America CD's that I have heard,I think that the best are &quot;America,&quot;&quot;Homecoming,&quot;&quot;Hat trick&quot; and &quot;Hideaway.&quot; The &quot;America&quot; CD,in my mind,stands out as one of their fresh and different creations. I like all of the songs on the CD. Some stand-outs are: &quot;Three Roses&quot;-A six string acoustic guitar gem with an impressive guitar solo by Gerry Beckley. &quot;Donkey Jaw&quot;-A six and twelve string guitar collaboration with synchronous leads, written by Dan Peek. But the song that I like the best is &quot;A Horse with no name.&quot;    Being a bit of a loner myself, I think that the song represents the human expression of solemnity with its haunting words and melodies. Dewey Bunnell is my favorite songwriter in the group and I think &quot;A Horse with no name&quot; is a peak effort. This song sounds so rich and full for a song that only has two acoustic guitars (six and twelve string),bass guitar,congas and drums. With a comparison to todays recording standards, this song is evenly matched in richness and clarity. Gerry Beckley even pulls off a twelve string solo! This CD will be a gem in your collection!
0345803485|5|I absolutely loved this series! I have never written a book review before, but felt compelled to do so with FSOG. I loved the Twilight Series, though the love story was very juvenile. Hunger Games was just okay for me. This series is very adult and yes very erotic, but again ADULT. It has an powerful love story behind it which is what offsets the intensity of the love scenes for me.<br /><br />I debated whether or not to read this searies because I am not into BDSm, but believe me the love story completely overshadows and will have you wrapped up!
B007MNV5WU|5|please I beg you to please make a free full version on all devices cause I love these games but my mom wont let me buy apps but I played a free download of this on Pc and loved it that's y it is five stars

B002NJUN44|5|Received fast. Love the movie.
B0002NRQTS|5|Presto is easily the most underrated album Rush put out and an underrated album in general. Hold Your Fire had the band mellowing out in the late '80s while still retaining the techno of their last couple. They toned it down somewhat from their last but the band didn't seem sure which direction they were going since music was changing a lot in '87. Presto is a return to form and introduced us to a more modern, mature Rush. Presto brought back the guitars as a lead instrument rather than bass and keyboards but it wasn't the same Rush we heard on Moving Pictures or Hemispheres. Presto is something different and something more Rush had to offer. Presto is mature, melodic and powerful lyrically throughout. It might not be their heaviest and isn't really a rock album but they hadn't really been playing rock since Signals. Presto is about the lyrics more so than the music but the guitar is done well throughout and the bass was done exceptionally well in Scars. Lyrically it's among Rush's best work and really is a masterpiece although an acquired one. Presto isn't album I play often but when it's the right time, it's really a great album which I rediscover every time. Chain Lightning, War Paint, The Pass and Available Light are some real masterpieces but the others are great as well such as Superconductor and Presto. The ballads are probably the best but Superconductor is a good heavier rock track which we don't see a lot here. Presto is a Rush masterpiece and arguably their most underrated.

1451627289|5|This novel was simply fantastic and unforgettable.Stephen King has written an amazing story of history,time-travel and love. To this reader it was the prose that will seal the deal as the best book of the year. The storytelling craft on this one was written with as much heart as it was with talent. The time that was spent by the main character leading up to what he stepped back in time to do, could have been an entire new story in itself. Through this a story develops within itself of passing time and finding love. Mr. King developed characters and situations that made the time spent \\"waiting\\" by George Amberson(or Jake Epping) seem as if those 6 years between 58' & 63' were as much painful as they were heartwarming. This was a well developed storyline that kept the reader aware of just how long those 6 years were, while never seeming overly written or boring. It was strange in a way that it made the story seem so believable because you feel like you spent the time \\"waiting\\" right along with George(or Jake). This was time well spent literally!!!!!  All in all, this an amazing story that can only go from the mind to the paper by a TALENT that is Stephen King. Hats off to Mr. King on this one. This is by far the best story I have read in 2011. Well done!!!!
B0044XV3QY|5|I liked the movie, but I wasn't crazy about it.  The only reason I got this is because I found it on a day were it cost $19.99<br /><br />For my surprise, I got way more than I was expecting.<br /><br />The package is a deluxe one.  A little bit like Lord of The Rings Extended Edition package.  Slipcase and all.  Not expecting that.  Looks very pretty in the eye.<br /><br />The movie quality is top notch, and the discs are PACKED with extras, that for people like me, are the first and only reason to get movie special editions.<br /><br />I just found a new respect for the movie and it's creators, and this package, even at full price, worth the money.
B000JIHP88|5|My son loves this!  The bright colors catch his attention and help him sleep.  Recommended

B00C7DGRL4|2|Watched hoping plot would improve; cast is great but story line was weak and predictable. Okay fantasy for just passing time.
B00005JLWN|4|Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium is a good science fiction movie that went fantastically unnoticed.  It is not however, in my opinion, \\"the best Sci-Fi movie ever\\", or even \\"better than the Matrix\\".  Common praise, perhaps intended to raise it from its pathetically unfair obscurity.  That's not to say it shouldn't be seen.  Quite the contrary.  Equilibrium is a movie that, from the beginning, surprises with its excellent cinematography, big-budgetesque effects, and admirable performances.<br /><br />Set in post WW3, Equilibrium portrays a world fed up with violence, so fed up that they turn to imposing a drug that inhibits emotion.  This, by theory, would neuter man of his violent tendencies.<br /><br />Ok, I thought the setup was cool, so to were the excellent performances by Christian Bale and Taye Diggs.  There were however some annoying inadequacies.  Most notable was the obvious emotion shown by those characters who were supposedly emotion-suppressed.  In fact, the enforcers of societies condemnation of emotion are called \\"grammaton clerics\\" (of which Christian Bale and Taye Diggs both serve), they're supposed to bring \\"sense-offenders\\" to justice (usually by bullet or baking).  However, in key scenes, these clerics would carry on like a bunch of pre-menstrual high-school girls on prom night.  That really hurt the immersion factor.<br /><br />Another minor issue surrounded the ability of these clerics to seemingly bend time and dodge bullets.  About midway through the movie they give that ability some basis, but it would have been cooler if they beefed the science of that up a bit, and did it earlier, as most viewers will probably be going \\"um, ok, cool outfits and all, but how come the clerics are dodging bullets, and everyone else is getting mowed\\"?<br /><br />Minor gripes.  Fact is, I went into this movie with very low expectations, and was completely blown away.  I would have watched The Sound of Music in its entirety just for access to the 5 minute fight-climax at the end of the Equilibrium.  Truly fantastic!<br /><br />Anyway, I hope you enjoy as much as I did.<br /><br />Christian Hunter<br /><br />Santa Barbara, Californiaght-climax at the end of the Equilibrium.  Truly fantastic! <br /> <br />Anyway, I hope you enjoy as much as I did. <br /> <br />Christian Hunter <br />Santa Barbara, California

B00P28XCLE|5|Manson has had a very long, successful career but I really think he hit his stride with this album. Every track from start to finish is excellent and very catchy to listen to. Easily, at least in my opinion, his best release to date.
B008NMT684|1|After a dozen attempts, the app still will not load.  I have not been able to use it so I can not give it any more than one star.

B004I2K4DY|5|I loved seeing all the stars.  When a person has sung a song 1,000 times or more - it is so much better<br />than one who has sung it maybe 100. Nice voice.  I like the original from years ago more of course.

B000002G0P|5|Since my teenage days, when I first listened to Extreme while starting to learn to play guitar, Nuno has become one of my guitar heroes, not only for his soloing, but also for his versatility and ability to communicate through his guitar, wheter it would be a funked-up rock tune or his acoustic playing. But wow...he is truly musically gifted as a songwriter and keyboardist too!!    As for this album, it has great performances from all group members throughout, excellent tunes (not only the funky metal vibe from Pornograffitti, but this album is rather diverse but very likable all the way), which vary from heavy to mellow. Can`t say enough about it...simply great!!!    I used to have this album back then as cassette (way back then), somehow I lost it and decided to order it. My favorite Extreme album used to be Pornograffitti, but, having become somewhat \\"mature\\" (I hope), now I appreciate this album more for its diversity.    I also have recently purchased \\"Saudades de Rock\\"...excelent album...glad you guys came back togehter, I think you still have looong way to go musically and professionaly. Keep up the good work!!
145470246X|5|I checked this out at my local library and kept renewing it so I decided to buy my own copy.  The projects look very interesting.  I have not had a chance to make anything yet.
B00B4VI8MQ|2|I found that the hos were too small and many items were hidden in dark spots that only could be found with hint button.  Would not recommend it for learners.

0805047905|5|Great durable sturdy book that holds up to my two year old flip each page and pointing at the animal while trying to sound out each brightly colored picture.....a classic book to read to your child!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5|allows you to remember stuff no matter where you are. by pica, text or audio. couldn't be simpler. I can take a pic on my phone and then look at it later on my kindle. awesome app.
B000001FKY|5|As by far one of the best releases of the 80's, this is a must-have for hard rockers and heavy metal album collectors alike.  'Hysteria' is practically the band's greatest hits by itself, with the exception of a few  other gems on previous and following albums.  'Pour Some Sugar on Me' is by  far the best single on the CD as well as Def Leppard's greatest hit itself,  and the ballad 'Love Bites' is a keeper.  Other picks being 'Armegeddon  It', 'Animal', and the title track.  However, the rest of the album is  equally entertaining.  If you are to just get a taste of this kind of  music, pick up a copy of 'Hysteria', it's truly satisfying.
B0006GAOJA|5|Excellent movie. Robert DeNiro plays the part of Jake LaMotta with his whole heart (when does he not?)!! I don't care much for boxing, but this movie, made in black & white for authenticity, is a riveting story based on the true life of the boxer LaMotta.
B000065VB9|5|His third solo album, _Melting Face_ is a dark, dark album.  Instead of the upbeat guitar and drums of the strangely joyful &quot;Solsibury Hill,&quot; this album contains the creaky, ominous &quot;Intruder.&quot;  As that track suggests, &quot;Intruder's happy in the darrrrrrrrrkkkkkkkkkkkkkk,&quot; and apparently so is Gabriel.<br />After the downright sinister &quot;Intruder,&quot; Gabriel seems to be coming apart at the seams on &quot;No Self Control&quot; and &quot;I Don't Remember.&quot;  These songs sound light years away from his more upbeat material such as &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, &quot;Big Time&quot;, and &quot;Kiss That Frog,&quot; but the material on this album is more powerful and lasting than the lighter side of Peter Gabriel.  It's hard to pick just one highlight from this album, but the mini-suite &quot;Family Snapshot&quot; is immacuately arranged, going from a gentle vocal beginning, to driving verses and chorus (&quot;I don't really hate you/I don't care what you do/We were made for each other/me and you&quot;), and back again.  Elsewhere on the album you will find the politically-charged &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; and &quot;Biko.&quot; <br />All I can say is that this is an excellent album.  I think if people who know Peter Gabriel just from his hits on the radio pick this album up, it will definitely shock them - but in a good way.  Gabriel is probably one of the most successful musicians at fusing rock with other genres and not making it sound forced.  This was a very important album for me to listen to because it showed how an album should be put together in order to make listening to it an 'experience'.  Out of the 450+ albums in my collection, this easily is one of my favorites.  Pick it up - you won't be sorry.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Love it 😂
1931955085|5|Mark Ryden continues the tradition if big eyed painting and the Tree Show was an excellent show was an excellent exhibition of his artwork. This book reproduces all the artwork from that gallery show and also includes photos of the objects that inspired him.
B00L9B7IKE|5|I loved this read!
B00L8FC1QM|5|Although I should probably WAIT until this package is released, I thought I would say a few select words about the film itself. Although I have yet to see this METALPAK, I offer my comments only on the film. I went into the film with NO expectations, I came out pleasantly surprised and at times AMAZED at some of the visuals. Although the story itself is really nothing new (it is really just a variation of the recent excellent GAMERA, Guardian of the Universe) - the overall film itself is briskly paced until the big MONSTER showdown at the end. Truly an EPIC film that needs to be seen on the big screen, as many of the shots are composed to show the massive scale of each monster, and the 3-D works amazingly well. The story is smartly constructed, as Cranston's more methodic and restrained personna steps aside halfway through the film to introduce his more action-oriented son. As for Godzilla himself, truly EPIC in every way, handled with respect, artistic flair and a real sense of DREAD. Overall, feels like more of the more traditional 1960's TOHO films. SOLID in every way! Still waiting for DAMON F. to weigh in!
B00DPM7TIG|5|Really enjoyed this book - we'll built characters and plot.  Interesting from a historical perspective.  Fascinating to understand WWII from both the French and German perspective.
B000AWYOGE|4|I started watching Dark Water a few times in the last five years only to find myself a little bored half way through, or maybe i just wasn't in the mood for a slower paced film. But it always did stick out when i went through my movie collection to watch other things, i'd think ok, umm nah. So finally i popped it in a few nights ago and said ok i'm gonna get all the way through it. The first time it by no means sucked but i couldnt really remember a whole lot about it. Jennifer Conelly is great in every role i've seen her in, this one is no different, also she's really cute, lil to skinny in this film but i won't hold that against her ha. The atmosphere is great, dark, wet, creepy, and old, u can almost smell the dank air and mill dew in the apartment complex of the film. Dark Water mainly revolves around the complex where Jennifer C moves with her estranged daughter, who really doesnt have any issues until after they move in. The leak in the ceiling, the creepy upstairs apartment thats flooded with dirty brown water, but full or furniture, these all play a big part in the whole premise of the film. I won't say much else but the front desk gentleman might not be quite who u think he is, and James C. Reily as the landlord is just classic here. Very realistic. So the movie is by no means terrifying as i said, but indeed, unnerving, creepy, and very weird in some cases. But at the end you'll be glad you finished it, it might not be what you thought, or how you thought it would end, but hey i was satisfied once i finihsed it.:D
B0006J28MI|5|Such a cute classic movie.
B00992CF6W|5|I absolutely love Minecraft it's Great for Creating Several things. Watch Stampylonghead, Iballisticsquid, SkydoesMinecraft, TheDiamondMinecart and other Minecraft Players on YouTube for a look at PC and Xbox Minecraft.

0307716988|5|very good book .. i got it off ebay and read it and a gf wanted it so i ordered it off here for her for christmas....
B00C7KXUOE|5|So,<br /><br />Are you interested in seeing people mess with other people's heads? What about seeing rare dishes exquisitely presented (and probably made with human parts)? What about wickedly sharp dialogue and subtlety layered upon subtlety like a great wine?<br /><br />If yes, watch this series. It delivers. If not, well, there is always Taco Bell.<br /><br />And yes, the headline is a contradiction of sorts.
B00MILGKPI|5|its very good!
B00CW6DAKC|1|I really want to play  this but I can't. I downloaded it several times and for some reason I can't get pass the tutorial. It stops when I get to the rewards you get when logging in. Also it keeps saying that it's out of sync. My internet works great and I can't play this wonderful game. I am sad and disappointed.
B0079TQHDO|5|Enjoyed the ongoing journey of all characters. Iam about to commence the 3rd Chronicle. Hope Jeffrey Archer gets moving on books 4 and 5. Most enjoyable

B00KW272YS|2|Started interestingly enough but complete lack of plausibility makes you roll your eyes too often.  Too neat and tidy and the world's problems solved in about 10 minutes.
B00BD6RFFS|5|I have NO business background so when asked to formulate a business plan for a small start-up I needed some help.  This book is visual, simply and clearly laid out with easily accessible definitions and descriptions.

6304057709|5|I just got done watching this movie, and I think it's great!  Granted you pretty much have to be into these kind of movies to like it (it's NOT a date movie), this is more of a rainy day on the couch under a blanket kind of movie.  The music, the visuals, and each character's swirling emotions drag you in.  Emma Thompson did an awesome job writing this screenplay!  Each character was well-developed (except the now you see him, now you don't Willoughby), and each actor did an excellent job bringing their characters to life.  If you like this sort of movie, don't pass this one up!
B0001NBMBC|2|WHY? WHY? I was never a HUGE slipknot fan. Who knows, i could've become one, but this album sure as hell didnt help. I own Iowa and think that is a truly remarkable piece of work. Awesome screaming, growling, and singing as well. This? I don't know what to say to this.I've been to numerous Slipknot concerts and have enjoyed jumpingdafukup with them and this cd has ruined that. Duality is an ok song, but alas, the radio has ruined it for me by playing it over and over and over and over again. Opium For The People Before I Forget and mabye Pulse of The Maggots are the only other songs on this Disk that are worth mentioning. Mabye Corey should've stayed with Stone Sour. We'd all be a lot better off. Overall i'm pretty much speechless on how big a piece of trash this album is, which is why i heavn't written much. And sorry to all the Diehard Slipknot fans out there who think this is their best album yet. I completely sympathize. But this is not.
0440237688|1|I bought this based on all the positive reviews and the fact it was a Newberry Medal winner.  However, after reading it, I'm not sure I really trust the judgement of the Newberry Medal now.  As one of the negative reviews I read mentioned, any book that portrays a society nonchalantly 'releasing' newborn infants to maintain the order of things should not be a 'children's' book.  There are other young adult books that depict this type of apocalyptic society just fine without resorting to that level of monstrosity.  I did not feel enlightened at all upon finishing the book....just depressed and sorry I wasted my time and money.
B00E8KLWB4|4|If you like hidden object games, this is a good one. Objects are not too easy to find and graphics are well done. Story line is cool too.
B00BZW5W3W|5|Maysa fans will like it.

B008JFUO4U|5|Oblivion, the first thought a lot of people had was that it was video game based. Or so most of the people who I knew, that had seen the trailer.<br /><br />Oblivion is visually stunning, with deep, enriching environments and beautiful shots. The soundtrack that accompanies the movie is memorable, and beautifully haunting.
B005HSL626|5|Love this game, makes waiting for anything a lot easier. My 4yr old also loves it I like that we can both enjoy the game together.
B008JGSM6G|5|this game id extremely addicting I play it twenty four seven its easy at first but then it gets really challenging
B00CJGP116|5|Just another one of Marc's best work to add to my collection! Absolutely wonderful as he has always given his best to his fans.
B00DPM7TIG|3|New look on an old subject. Enjoyed it much better as I talked with others that had read it.
0804172072|5|Extraordinary beyond words!!! Absolutely love it...
B000FC1LOC|5|Everyone needs to read this book! I couldn't put it down! Never cried about a book before I read this.
B000F1IQMS|5|I have had the opportunity to meet Guri Weinberg, Moshe Weinberg's son.  For those of you who aren't aware, Guri played his father in this movie.  Steven Spielberg always does an amazing job portraying history through cinema.
1250034485|3|Not as good as the previous books...
B000VDDDY6|5|Watched it on my 70 inch Sony Qualia ,player was Toshiba XA-2.  I was Blu-ray only until I heard about this set.I must say that I  had seen every episode atleast 20 times ( I know,I need to get a life),but watching it on HD-DVD on a 70 inch screen was jaw dropping.Every hair follicle,skin blemish,background set imperfection ,bead of sweat,and makeup powder was evident.Vivid colors,60's style jumped off the screen.Soft focus  was purposly used on the hot chicks to make them look better,otherwise MOST shots were razor sharp.There was  texture and stiching in the uniforms that I had never seen before.Yes,the packaging kinda sucks,but you'll forget about that as soon as you pop in your first hd-dvd.
B003UAMWWQ|3|As a Star Wars fan, not sure how I missed seeing this film for so long. When it became free to watch with Prime, I tuned in and was disappointed. Spaceballs is juvenile and not particularly original. Perhaps it was original when it was first made, but I felt I had seen every joke before.<br /><br />Mildly amusing but not memorable movie, and only that if you're a Star Wars fan. Others should totally skip it.
B007SGM084|5|Very good book
B00SH00N3Y|5|was a good movie
B007J4T2G8|5|Couldn't, didn't want, to put it down. Unexpectedly enjoyable for many reasons. Sex, love, pain... True to form for many a relationship. Can't wait to download the second chapter in this series.
B00BWBHIUG|4|I downloaded this game for my grandson. He loves it! He loves tapping the screen to gather the algae and the sand dollars. He's crazy about all the fish. Thanks
B004Z4LYU2|5|As a retired PhD air pollution professional, I have considerable background in physical chemistry, fluid dynamics, and the like. This book has opened up the world of modern physics for me. It is a report from and about modern physics from a person who has been there and done that. It is a summary contrasting and comparing approaches such as string theory, QED, quantum gravity, cosmology, and related topics from a scientist who is active in several of these fields, and writes with grace, clarity, and imagination about the strengths and weaknesses of current theoretical approaches. He starts by identifying five major unsolved problems in modern physics, and uses these problems to rate modern theories for efficacy, He points out some novel and thought provoking new experimental data, and suggests where they might lead. He is careful to distinguish background dependent from background independent approaches, and allows for the possibility that general relativity needs to be amended. Without a single mathematical formula, he conveys the basic characteristics of a plethora of theories, and references who developed each one and when. This book has inspired me to pursue more information on several emerging theories, and provided an opening to the literature through which to pursue this information. I fully recommend this book to anyone with even the slightest interest in cosmology or modern physics as an enjoyable and readable way to put those interests in context.
B00BEK6Z7M|4|I read the book, and it was just not quite up to the other Pendergast novels- while quite good, it just did not have that added punch I usually expect from the authors.
B0000025ZK|5|really good diamond in through album by gilmour......
B0010V4TZU|1|This is STUPID MUSIC by well educated people. I can't believe the press are touting this band  the Next great Indie band. This CD sucks! This is just bad music that's marketed very well.  I wish I could give this disk 1/64th of a star but I can't so here's a one start review.
B00K2JH9ZS|5|What a delight to read this. I have loved her other books and this new one didn't disappoint. We've all met people like her characters from the fluffy Maddie to the over assertive Kindy mum Renata. I was sad to finish this. I could not find fault with it.

0679731725|5|The only reference in this book of the title occurs on its second to last page: \\"Perhaps, then, there is something to his advice that I should cease looking back so much...\\"  Notwithstanding the above, this book is not at all melancholy or particularly depressing, although Stevens (the butler character/narrator) does look back much. The whole book is a reminiscence actually.  Stevens played a role and did so ably, very much obsessed with dignity and continuing on, ala the British since the Second World War, but not to the same successful extent.  I suppose you can draw many parallels here: Stevens, the British butler in England, serving an American, trying to uphold his dignity and being beholden to an era that was passing and is now gone, but the book is an enjoyable read without having to \\"read\\" anything into the story as it unfolds.  The film that is based on this book was excellent too, but seems to make the story very much more  political, stressing the \\"little guys\\" of society (Stevens included) trusting to British gentlemen to do the \\"right thing\\" by them.  The book, in contradistinction, seems to stress, in a different manner, that the \\"little guy\\" who trusts others winds up being one who cannot say at least that one's own mistakes were one's own; but that to trust \\"gentlemen\\" types and ones simple devotion to duty may cost you, that a person should have personal accountability.  Stevens trusted Darlington Hall and his role as a part of it, and in so doing believed his work was consequently paramount and of a particular importance; that, in a way, he was part of something good and/or had some part in effecting developements made by those men of politics who peopled the manor he served.  So his trust engendered duty and duty negated personal fulfillment.  He lived not for \\"The remains of the day\\", but for his work.  In so doing he consequently missed out on a possible romance---with a Miss Kenton in the story, not owing to his own fault, but because he trusted Darlington Hall, so to speak.  The key to human warmth, Stevens  ponders at the end, may lie in bantering; just the sort of thing he had no time for while Miss Kenton herself was employed at Darlington Hall.  What makes this well told story  unique, however, is the author's writing style. A sample: \\"It seems increasingly likely that I will undertake the expedition that has been preoccupying my imagination now for some days.  An expedition, I should say, which I will undertake alone, in the comfort of Mr. Farraday's Ford; an expedition which, as I forsee it, will take me through the finest countryside of England to the West country, and may keep me away from Darlington Hall for as much as five or six days.\\"  That's the opening paragraph to this concisely written joy to read; and it goes on thusly for 245 pages as Stevens tells us the story of his devotion to duty during his journey to see Miss Kenton after many years.  This is a book that lingers with you and which can be re-read with pleasure. Cheers!d Darlington Hall, so to speak.

B00AZMFK3K|4|They are telling all the old stories I guess for a new generation. In spirit, I generally find that a cop out by Hollywood, but credit where it is due, they managed to take an iconic Star Trek story, and twist it up just enough to make it work.<br /><br />It helps that the cast they have for the new series are well chosen, and seen to have done their homework on the characters they play.<br /><br />As always with the franchise, the effects are top shelf. The story telling fast paced. This is the third time we get a story about Khan, and it can stand up as a worthy addition to the series. They took freely from Star Trek II, but thought to mix it up just so we could say ahhhh... There you go...
B005LAIHR2|5|good stuff

B00IS87HYI|3|Puzzles require special treatments to complete in most puzzles after the first level and of course, you must buy them. The game visuals are simple yet engaging in an adorable type way, even tho most puzzles are set in a no win without using a special aid, it is still fun and addictive.
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love this app! When I am watching tv I get bored during commercials, so I play minion rush! It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun!
B00004RF8J|4|I really enjoyed this movie.  I've always loved the music and have wanted to see the play (high school drama department just can't do it true justice).  The ending strays a bit from the play, but it was well done.  Rick Morranis is terrific and an excellent singing voice.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Basically I love it.  I'll keep playing until my hand goes numb.  The playing has bonded me with my'granddaughter who also loves it.
B000003S2O|4|Brian Eno knows how to bring background music into the foreground.  I'm reminded of David Behrman.  The mood is also similar to the Eno/Fripp collaborations; soothing music that will also make you think.
B00BAXFECK|5|I was moved by this book. the writing is so brilliant and profound.  it will take you a bit to get to the end - but well worth the journey.  you will think of Theo Decker for years to come.
B009UX2YAC|5|I think that this game is awesome for time passing and is very addicting and entertaining!!! I recommend this game to EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00F91G5BS|1|What a lost opportunity. WWZ was such a great book, it could have been a great movie or mini-series.<br /><br />Instead, Brad Pitt purchased the rights and made a vanity vehicle out of it, thereby ruining it for all of us.  WWZ was a serious approach to horror literature, and made the most of the zombie genre. I was so looking forward to a great film adaptation.<br /><br />If 'The Walking Dead' is an example of the right way to treat this genre, then 'WWZ' is exactly the opposite.
B00DR0PDNE|3|So far I have yet to get this thing to work!<br /><br />1.  Mother's Sony flat panel, without network access - FAIL!<br />2.

B001F12J48|5|great
B005DOL0R0|5|I like it because it is so compact and protects the Kindle Fire.  I slip it into my purse and I'm ready to go.
1780674880|5|This coloring book is absolutely stunning. The images are so pretty it seems a shame to color them, but I couldn't wait to get started when I got my copy. Very detailed, enough to keep me busy for months if not years. At first I thought Amazon's price was a bit high, but it is worth it for what you get. The paper is very thick and a good quality. I have been pleased with the results I have gotten with a simple box of Crayola colored pencils. I would not recommend using crayons because there is so much fine detail. I can't wait to get the Secret Garden coloring book Basford made. Planning on giving these as a birthday gift as well.
B004W2UBYW|5|I loved this book. I'm not big on autobiographies, but this was an amazing read. Jobs was an incredible man.....not the nicest at times, but an incredible entrepreneur and visionary. I recommend this book to any fan of business and/or technology.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|If you like floppy bird and play it a lot,this game will definitely be harder. (My score on floppy bird-28) (My score on floppy wings-4)
B00821OX98|3|it seems to fit the kind of series i like. i have also noticed that it's still on tv so it has a following. i may up my rating after the show gets more organized
B00B2JSRAS|3|My general thoughts are that I lost interest in doing the experiments after the 2nd or 3rd one. It's not that it's hard to follow the instructions its just I don't think i was participating well enough. I will hopefully come back one day and give it a more honest effort and speak of the results then.
B00000JCB2|2|The new rap/rock combo has been getting major bucks but the actual sound of the music is horrible.  There's no beat and the guitar mind-as-well be a noise maker.  The rap is &quot;hardcore wanna be&quot;.  Fix up the style, because there's nothing worth buying here.
B00013RC8O|5|I thought it was a pretty good movie as well as a pretty good bargain at $8.99.<br /><br />I think you would like it if you like those 70's movies...Especially those with a counterculture theme to it. But I had already seen the movie several times so I knew what I was getting beforehand.<br /><br />David
B009NFHF0Q|5|Loved this book, don't normally go for fantasies but this author writes so well you get into it from page 1. Highly recommend this book!
B008WCP2PG|5|Talk about eye candy!  This movie sure has a lot of it.  But even with all the great bodies the storyline is real and dramatic.  Highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|4|I am addicted. It is very fun and I enjoy unlocking boxes, don't understand certain aspects but doesn't ruin the game.
B006885EFE|5|This series is a wonderful reminder to most Americans that have not experienced true life-commitment to another human bring is all about. These men gave everything for us. The fact that many came back and &#34;just carried on&#34; with their lives is remarkable after what they had seen and done. They come from an era where to things &#34;above and beyond&#34; the norm was just expected - no trophies for being a participant.

B00CNQ7HAU|4|An easy and enjoyable read, especially for a vacation.  For anyone who enjoys John Grisham novels.  Good characters and a compelling story.
B00RDZMYWW|5|It is basically a documentary of the way the world is headed, with everyone taking drugs to suppress being human.  The book 1984 was amazing, though the movie was quite average, in a way this movie makes up for that by showing the same themes, but directed at a more action oriented audience.  Definitely in my top 10 of all time.
B00ESF285S|5|Awesome book! Great confidence builder for kids. Can't beat that! Dr Seuss is always a win for both parents and kids.
B00BD99JMW|1|This book was very much a let down from what had seemed like a talented author. The end might have been acceptable if she had done a better job of writing it. What a waste.
B004R10L4S|1|we knew sean penn was a loon, but when you consider the degree of the lies in the movie and also consider how relatively soon after the scandal this movie was made, it's shocking how much disregard the film shows the truth.  as if there isn't detailed information all over the internet to refute the lies.  no valerie plame story would be complete without dick armitage and it's almost as if he doesn't exist.  so i guess this was a fun little dress up movie for sean penn and hopefully naomi watts isn't part of the leftist scum brigade in hollywood.
B000003TAW|5|I first heard Weezer through the walls from my brother's room and begged him to sell this CD to me when I was young.  Since then I have never stopped listening to it,  I thought one day I might get tried of it, but I haven't.  Whenever I find a Friend that doesn't know of Weezer i alwayse pull the CD out and loan it to them.  They alwayse come back with a smile on their face.  I use this CD for anytime that I am not sure what I want to listen to.  Their other 3 CD's are great too.  Check out their website at weezer.com.  I actually got to know one of my best friends now because we both liked weezer. Everyone should have this CD.
B009VSW15Y|5|Fun and easy to use the HD Camera. A nice way to document things around the house. Looking forward to tinkering with the photos on Photo Editor that I just bought through Amazon.
1582701709|1|You too can make millions of dollars by way of blind consumerism and false advertising.  The secret is that there is no secret, which you'll find out AFTER you shell out the $$ for this pointless book (or DVD).  The content here isn't worth the paper that it's written on.
B00FATEJYE|5|Gameplay is fantastic, progression is slow but hardly boring, but glitches cause game to frustrate regular players.  Glitches cause game to exit randomly or freeze at the start/end of battles which can be annoying if your low on energy or just defeated a hard battle.

B000JLTRKE|5|This is a great movie.  Powerful, inspirational, moving.  I have watched it several times and I love it.  It puts the tragedy of 9/11 into a place where you see the tiny ray of hope. <br />
B00005JLEU|5|One of Miyazaki's best movies. Some of the characters and imagery might be a bit frightening to small children but as an adult fan of Miyazaki's works this movie comes off with warmth and a perfect fantasy get away.

B0056BMK6K|5|Dang, read several of the bad reviews and thought to myself, \\"huh?\\"  This guy is hilarious and he kept me reading because of it.  Thought it was good information and gonna use every bit of it.  Everyone should have a mentor.  If you want to be succesful in something, what is the best thing you should do?  Find someone who was succesful and do what they did.  This guy is sharing with us step by step what he did to sell 1 million ebooks in 5 months!  Who is a better mentor than that if you are an author getting ready to sell your ebook.  Give me a break, yes, it's a ton of work duh...most successes take tons of time and effort.  Back to the basics...set goals and focus on accomplishing them.  One step at a time, you will get there.
B00NCGXYJS|4|It was OK I wish she had done other more &#34;popular&#34; songs!
B00C8S9W0G|1|I was VERY  disappointed in this book.  I felt it was very disjointed and hopped around a lot.  I have read the previous 7 books and enjoyed them very much.  This one should have started out with a synopsis since the books were written so far apart.
B004Q7CIFI|4|Well written & suspenseful.  It was hard to put down!
B00000IQMT|1|The soundtrack of the Phantom Menace as played in the movie was great.  The basic well-loved themes were there, but had matured just as all the original Star Wars fans had matured.  The addition of the chorus,  especially in the Jedi battle scene, only added to the tension and  excitement of that scene.  I practically ran out of the theater and bought  the soundtrack!  But I was so disappointed when I played it at home.  First  of all, why did John Williams mix up the order of the tracks on the CD?   Where is the continuity in that?  Everyone who buys the soundtrack is going  to see the movie at least twice, and part of listening to it is replaying  the specific scenes in your head.  Second, whether he cut the length of the  Jedi battle scene or what I don't know, but it is not as half as long or  dramatic as the music in the part of the movie is.  What with the shortened  versions and the mixed order, it doesn't bring the movie to life at home at  all! In short, don't buy it- it does not live up to the music as heard in  the movie!!
0440246318|3|Standard beginning with Reacher thumbing a ride from A to B. Finally picked up but the company is strange and Reacher has a busted nose, with duct tape on it? Did I miss where and why he got it? Is it relative to the story other than it just IS? Lots of car talk which moves the plot along, personalities of the characters expanded. I am a big Lee Child fan but this story seems to go in spurts and then gets stuck in the mud a while then more spurts and action. Finally, near the end, all the facts come together with the big shootout, Reacher and Delfuenso against 24 bad guys. Outcome? 24 dead bad guys, small cut on Reacher's hand. Reacher did have real guns with more than 6 inexhaustible bullets, like the old cowboy shootouts, but the parallel is a little hard to ignore.<br /><br />With all the above said, I still look forward to the next Lee Child book with more of Jack Reacher's adventures.<br />Walter.

B003VANOFY|1|READ REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT! I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS HEADSET! purchased this for my son's b.day gift.his astro a40 mix amp pro finally bit the dust.2 gaming friends suggested this one,so thought we'd give it a shot.i read the reviews (mixed)-SO many saying they had issues w/this set,but some said they had no problems.received it,hooked it up,and immediately a VERY annoying buzzing sound came on and DID.NOT.STOP.no matter what we tried to do,it did not work.the buzzing never went away.sending it back tomorrow and going back with the astro.yes,the astro set is pricey,but well worth the money.my son is on his way to becoming a pro-gamer and his astro set has taken a beating,but still worked perfectly....but,just like anything else,it's time was up (r.i.p. astro.lol). the sound quality on the astro is truly amazing.i've purchased MANY different brands/styles of headsets over the years and thus far,NOTHING has come close to the quality of the astro.i had high hopes for the g930-love that it is wireless!,but...the whole loud,buzzing noise thing? uhm.yeah.think you get pissed off when you're jacked by the snot nose cowards who camp?try having that happen WITH a constant buzzing sound ringing thru your set.ha! only good thing i can say about this set is that the reception/distance IS impressive.we live in a large historical home,our modem is on the 2nd floor,at the front of the house.the headset was clear as a bell all the way in the back yard (minus the annoying buzzing sound).if they fix this bug,i would likely try it out again.  ***UPDATING:so-i'm sitting here reading even more reviews on this set-SO many of you singing its praises.if ANY of you have a remedy to eliminate this constant buzzing sound thru the headset-PLEASE EMAIL ME RIGHT AWAY.i JUST purchased this.plan on sending it back within the next 2 days.if this is something that can be fixed-LET ME KNOW. thanks! sethsmommy38@yahoo.com
B0001HAHXW|1|I have a lingering suspicion that many of the 'reviewers' don't have the life experiences to back up their vapid opinions. As a middle-aged man with divorce, AA and countless personaal demons in MY past, this album spoke to me like nothing E.C. has done since Behind The Sun, a record some of you kids could use a dose of. I have waited since the Bluesbreakers for a full-length treatment of Johnson by Clapton, and I was nothing less than exhilarated by this all-too-brief disc. Like those old Johnson discs, these tunes are not intended as easy listening!! These guys, who are ten times the men you're likely to be...are singing to themselves, and to GOD!

B0089LOG02|5|This book was so well written and delightful to read. I fell in love with<br />the characters and did not want it to end.
B003Q6D2B4|5|Loved it
B00FAPF5U0|5|I've played it on Facebook and love it there so I know I will love having it on my Kindle so I can play more often.
0440180295|5|It is rare for me to read a book in one sitting, I normally like to allow a night of sleep for full absorption, but this one got away from me.<br /><br />Billy was abducted by aliens, the tralfamadorians, who taught him that life could be viewed on a fourth dimension.  The forth dimension allowed you to move through your life, past or future and see yourself in different circumstances.  It's an interesting concept and is also the outlay of the book.  What it really helped deliver was a picture of Billy in all his complexity.  Since each of the main events in his life were introduced in pieces and gradually added to - by the end of the book the appreciation I had for the whole life of this man was immense.<br /><br />This is my first Vonnegut.  I was blown away by some of his theories, and whether he was quoting real people or invented them on his own I found him brilliant.  In particular there is an American, by the name of Campbell that I won't quote, but summarize:<br /><br />Americans (I'm adding Canadians, trust me it applies) are raised to believe that anyone can make money.  Money, in actuality, is not that easy to come upon.  What this theory has created a mass of poor people who live with the shame of being poor.  To them, it is not sociological or economical, but personal failure that has landed them in this state.  Above this, the ideal of anyone being able to make money has diminished the good will of the wealthy.  It has also decreased the brethren that exist among the poor in other nations, where you do not have to be wealthy to be knowledgeable or good.<br /><br />It's inspired.  Bravo.
B007FG9LIE|4|I'm no great literary critic, but I liked this book. It was well worth the bargain \\"special offer\\" price that Amazon offered for it for my Kindle. I liked the twist at the end and its slow reveal. There are some plot elements which don't really work, but overall it was a fun read.
B00E8KLWB4|1|i was never able to down load this app. my kindle was on all night and only downloaded 10 percent. i aborted the process
B0076DCT2G|5|I am a big Nelson DeMille fan and enjoyed this new book so much. He really does his homework as you can visualize what the characters are going through within the story in foreign lands. I hope others would like another John Corey adventure such as this one.
B00F7YHDWC|5|One of the best apps I've ever played! Hard but fun. Get it! Right now! Why are you still reading this! Get the app! The best app ever!
B00BD99JMW|1|Ok so I loved the first two books but I hate the way this ended... I looked forward to a conclusion where tris finally gets what she wanted, what she fought for. I was very disappointed. Just my opinion I'm sure others will love the way it ends but I wish I stopped reading at book two.
B000286RNY|5|Yes, it is in Chinese and you have subtitles to read, but it is so funny!  I love this movie!  Stephen Chow is truly a comedy master, such that even to those of us who don't speak Chinese, it is side splitting funny!
B00N6PD3GE|5|Remarkable book and story.  Larson is a great writer.
B0094BB4TW|5|Love it!
B00E5Q1HJS|5|They did a good job on selecting actors for the parts.  It has the same quality as the rest of the trek movies
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is fun and keeps your attention.  It makes you hungry for candy though. It's not as easy as it looks.
B00C28J2VQ|2|Disappointed in product description.  Listed for sale as : blu-ray 3d + blu-ray+ dvd + ultraviolet + digital copy.  Instead, the product is actually ultraviolet OR itunes digital copy.
B00T6NBG2I|2|This game has too many glitches. It's no fun to play.
B002VWNIDG|5|I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters and have wanted it ever since.Now I can finally enjoy whenever I want.
B00AB55BS0|5|Not as good as the book of course, but a great show.  This was on sale at a great price so I couldn't pass it up.
1423113497|5|My 8 year old daughter started reading these after finishing some fun kid books on Mythology. She read the entire series back to back over the summer break. They were as much of a hit as the Harry Potter series was in our house.
B00BB8RKH6|4|I was hoping for a little more action, but the pilot's personal story was compelling. It had a good message, you can overcome your addicitons.
1452122210|5|Great compliment if you collect all the books of the Pixar films. Sometimes I think I'm missing some conceptules arts but you can not put all the work of a film on a book.
B00B8M4IMK|5|Works great!
B005GSZZ1A|5|All I have to say is wow, this is an amazing read. Thanks to the author for opening eyes and minds. Thank you to Shin for sharing his story.
0812974611|4|Well-written novel with fascinating characters.  The author makes seemingly effortless use of his knowledge of the period, and from my own reading, I think his portrait of the first century under Roman rule is realistic and richly detailed.  Harris weaves history, science, and engineering into the fictional events, but never loses focus on his tight and fast-moving plot.  He also does a convincing job with dialogue and descriptions of his main character's inner thoughts.  The novel keeps the reader's imagination fully engaged as the plot moves swiftly to the final crisis when Pompeii is destroyed, and the main characters make a desperate dash for their lives.  I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the period, as well as to many who just appreciate a colorful and exciting yarn.
159420229X|4|Good book concerning memory improvement and methods operating since ancient times. This splendid story twisted with science, philosophy, theory and history. But it is not only about memorization techniques and scientific studies. I liked the idea that memory and creativity are connected. Here is another really good book: [[ASIN:B004X2WZ2M Memo: The Easiest Way to Improve Your Memory]]<br />Foer's writing is pretty funny ,definitely well worth reading, interesting and quick.
B007HACDLK|4|One of if not the best in the series.  Would recommend it to those who have read other Flynn books, or those who have not.
B006Q1TNM8|5|Great book to get students into the classics.
B005QYKD4I|2|So so
B00KA87GCW|4|Nice one..
B00F8F3J2S|3|This book deals with two main topics. One is the way Gates, working as secretary of defense first for President Bush and then for President Obama, tried to make the best out of the disastrous wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Pretending that the wars were not disasters, or were being won, or could have been won, Gates goes into he kind of detail--who in DoD and the White House said what to whom--that is absolutely boring and all but worthless. It would have been better to acknowledge the disastrous decisions Bush and Rumsefeld made and move on.<br /><br />On the other hand, the chapters dealing with life as secretary of defense are very good. One learns a lot about the way the Pentagon, the White House, and Congress go to work in defense-related matters.<br /><br />All in all a schizophrenic volume with some very bad chapters and some very good ones. A final comment: Gates is too hard on Obama, whom he accuses of never really getting enthusiastic about the two wars. How on earth could he?
B004J4WN0I|5|Awesome. Good sense of comedy with a nice mix of lore in it. Recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Pure Grisham. Doesn't disappoint.  Would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys his works.  Usual trial drama as the crescendo of a good story.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Who wouldn't love Downton Abbey?  It has history, adventure, love, and there is always something new happening as the family moves into a new time in their lives.
B004UO0SAO|1|Poorly laid out and confusing.  Use of the second and third functions on a key are not clear or intuitive.
B00QW8TYWO|4|It's awesome but not like the original one.I like it but it cost to much for a gift in the game.
0452295548|5|An almost unbelievable story for us all:  the actual journey through the experience of having a stroke!!  By a neuroscientist, to boot!!!  This is a 'must read' for everyone having had a stroke, or friends & family of a stroke victim!  Extremely informative!
B001HNE3NO|5|Sarah's Key was a great book!
B002UXRGLG|5|Amazing photography. Best ever natural history series, along with Planet Earth. A must see for every inhabitant of the planet we all share. This is the BBC version of the same series we saw in the states, except narrated by David Attenborough instead of Oprah Winfrey.
B00DR0PDNE|4|This was really easy to hook into my tv, and super easy to coordinate with my ipad (even though I am not a computer person).  Love watching the crystal clear picture on my HD tv, but I can't get it to work with my surround sound - either through the traditional manner or via wifi.  Sort of disappointing, but nice to watch things on the 55&#34;.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|I could not put the book down, loved it!!! I'm ready for your next one!  Don't keep us waiting long.
B00AN0KGWE|4|Me and my wife finished the season in one weekend. Loved the new characters introduced in this season. Can't wait for Season 3.
B00008DDXC|3|The movie was good, even great if you haven't read the book. It poorly followed the book and all of us crazed, wierd, Harry Potter fanatics will be left tripping along as things move to quickly through the story, with strange unnecessary  additions to the small parts, and giant cuts in the important and big parts. I liked the movie and I plan on buying it to go along with my collection (of course I'm considered on of the most serious Harry Potter fanatics in my high school so of course I would buy it and like it) but, I think that if you're a big fan of the books than you will be dissapointed. But, that's only a matter of opinion. I would reccomend this movie and do reccomend it, but if you've read the books you might want to lower your expectations and forget the way the book was. Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix comes out on June 21st! Don't forget! Harry Potter forever!!!!!!!!!!
B000QUCNP4|4|I missed this in theaters, but this dvd is well worth watching for its procedural approach to a famous case I knew nothing about. The performances are first-rate, but the sound is a little muddled. The period soundtrack is cool. There's the usual serial-killer vibe going on, but the movie overall maintains its pace and intensity without overkill or gross-out scenes that go on too long. Intelligent movie.
B0035LMTZA|1|I was enjoying this movie when it disappeared.  It is very frustrating to be caught up in a movie and have it stop in the middle of the action.
B008MEM24S|5|just like where's my water except in someways easier. u gt to go through steam in the first section not 7<br /><br />great app I recommend it
B004132HZS|5|This is what television can be...exceptionally written and produced! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman were born to play Sherlock and Watson.
B00004S35Z|5|This seems to be less highly regarded than &quot;Innervisions&quot; or &quot;Songs In The Key Of Life&quot; by critics, but don't believe it for a second.  While the aforementioned may have hit higher highs than anything  on &quot;FFF&quot;, there is not a wasted moment on this disc.  Every song  is a classic. If anyone can think of a better succession of 70s albums than  &quot;Talking  Book&quot;&gt;&quot;Innervisions&quot;&gt;&quot;FFF&quot;&gt;&quot;Songs&quot;,  then I would sure like to know.  10 zillion stars.
B009EEFTMC|2|I love playing this game but will stop at finishing one cube. I absolutely cannot take the music and there is no option to turn it off. I will wait for that option to be provided, if that happens.
B000BCE918|5|Some people complain about it and I think they're just finicky.<br />Some of my favorite movies boxed together for a great price.
B000WS4OZM|5|Not being an expert on country music or on Johnny Cash, I must say this album is moving and very very suggestive; with simple but clever arrangements, beautiful songs and amazing vocal...<br />Obviously more than merely touched by age and various ailments, mr. Johnny Cash performes with great passion and suggests wisdom no young singer can convey (or even come close to conveying)...<br /><br />I like it very much!
B0000025VU|5|After reading some of the reviews, I understand this most people don't get the lyrics or the subetlies of Mark Knopfler playing which is usually in the back, beneath the overall sound with Mick Taylors guitar playing out in front. knopflers leads take quite a few listens to even hear. Lets get beyond that and get to the lyrics Jokerman is a masterpiece warning of the coming of the beast( a woman gave birth to a priest today dressed in scarlett)the only real question i have about the song is what is the Jokerman ? A country, mankind as a whole or the devil in disguise. Yes this album is full of biblical and social commentary. Neighborhood Bully is about a large portion of the worlds perception of Isarael, Man of Peace is about how the devil disguises himself, current president Bush, Arafat and host of others who seem to give goodwill in the their perception of peace. License to Kill is about man's obssesion to dominate through force and his clear abandonment of Gods laws. I and I is man inner struggle with the forces of good and evil. This Cd I have owned for over 20 years and his (Dylans) genius at wordcraft and music never fails to amaze me. For those who have'nt heard it buy it for those who have listen again and ask yourself what do you think he was refferring to when he sings the book of Leviticus  and Deutoromy,the law of the jungle and the sea are your only keeper means?
B00J2PEZAU|5|Very entertaining, well acted and directed.
B0008KLVG4|4|From the sound of it, the 2 hour \\"making of\\" documentary on this disc is the same as the one included in the 1995 Collector's Edition LaserDisc box set.  The documentary is fantastic and worth every penny on DVD (please don't ask me how much I paid for the LaserDisc box set -- it was horrifically expensive compared to DVD prices).<br /><br />The 25th Anniversary \\"Jaws\\" DVD had about half of that documentary, and I was plenty peeved that they short-changed us.  Finally, we get the whole thing (I'm being led to believe).<br /><br />The 30th Anniversary edition is worth buying for the full-length documentary if you are a fan of filmmaking and a die-hard \\"Jaws\\" fan.  If you are just a casual \\"Jaws\\" fan and already own a DVD copy, then at least consider splurging on the 30th Anniversary edition as a gift to yourself -- you will probably be pleasantly entertained and fascinated by this documentary.
B00B6QXN56|5|This cd is a must for the Bonamassa fan, it is so wonderful and his talent shines through in his acoustic performances
B001FTKOTC|5|what more can i say about john steinbeck's classic novel about the dustbowl? not much that has already been said.<br />this novel is detailed and extensive. to sum it up.it is the joad family,circa 1939 from oklahoma,forced to leave<br />their ramshackle house,on the road,heading for california\\"there might be some work there\\",meet some mean people,<br />meet some nice people,granpa and granma die along the way,hunger,some violence,and, a still birth child and<br />at the very end...a type of \\"re-birth\\" or at least an idea that these folks will survive as they have that<br />instinct in their blood. let us hope so.<br />this book is for older teens and adults. much of the dialog is what i would call,\\"local color\\" or in other words,<br />it is written the way these people speak. for those who have not read it,it is a great american novel,an american<br />story(our story) about the american people of the lost and lonely dustbowl era. sit back and enjoy. i think most<br />readers will never forget this book.
B0001BKAEE|4|I would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could, but I can't. It like The Matrix Reloaded wasn't quite as good as the original, but still is a brilliantly written and important piece of sci-fi literature. Although it starts out directly where Reloaded leaves off, the situation is completely understandable and not confusing to a non-Matrix person. Like the others, its soundtrack of classical music with a blend of rock gives a nice feel.<br />Mind-boggling conversations between characters sieze to get old and Keanu Reaves gives his best preformance in the trilogy. It ends strangely, with Buddhist-Christian philosophies that balnket the sad ending with a happy, touching feel.<br />My only problem with this film is that the battle scenes are to elongated, and after a while become tedious, and just blurres of flashing light and loud noises.<br />Overall, I thought this was a great ending chapter to a science-fiction masterpiece.
B004MC8CA2|5|Very good. Easy to access and find the exact place in the Bible. Also very good that you have access to many differnt translations. Can be recommended.
B00AGOGOLE|1|I would not recommend this app because it was not user friendly. This is the 2nd camera app I have tried and did not like. The first one I paid for, this was free and not worth it.
B007Q476KU|4|I can see how this would become a classic like Iron Will and the Black Stallion. The story did not go how I expected which was a nice surprise and loved the ending! The cinematography was phenomenal!
B00FAX6XQC|5|Love everything great game play change of the kill the great HD close up on final shot.... but what's good with the content update cant play Deer Hunter on the train ride home because of it _smh SUCKS!!!!!
B009QW6ZT8|5|This is the most watched tv show in the fall. If you haven't watched then you are missing out on what everyone is talking about. Well written script, great actors excitement and thrills abounds. If you like scary creepy charaters this show won't let you down. Hard to wait for the show to come on. I highly reccomend having this in your video library.
B00IS87HYI|3|This is okay not nearly as good as Farm Heroes Saga and Candy Crush but still a fun addictive game in which you have to rescue the animals from their block prisons.  Same concept to get rid of many like colored blocks but the idea is to rescue the animals.
B00DHKKN6Q|4|Good game reminds me of the dinosaur egg game from Pop Top games which was the very first flash game I played on line.
B0070Y46UY|5|Grreat story!  Recommend to anyone who is in for adventure.  Haven't seen the movie although they say it is good too!
B002XZNHG4|5|Annie Hall is my all time favorite Woody Allen movie. I would recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys witty, charming, and deeply intellectual comedies.
B008N1V11U|5|this game couldn't be much better people. you play similar to arkham city of course arkham city is better but for a tablet this is damn near perfection. I got this game for my son and have been playing it myself. sometimes the flying is a little radical because of the speed slow it down to a glide add a few more devastating power attacks and its perfect. still giving you 5 stars cuz this games well worth the money great job by gameloft.
B00DF0ZP8Y|5|My granddaughter has enjoyed this immensely!
B008XG1X18|5|Pinterest is very relaxing with no expectation of having to socialize. It is gratifying to see others repin your pictures, to know that others are out there with similar interests and tastes- even if they are very weird. It's like a massive collection that takes no space.
B000GCFO0I|1|I guess you have to be a \\"fan\\" of the video game to appreciate the garbage movie this was. Drab and depressing movie with a terrible ending you could see a mile away. Honestly, this has to be the stupidest movie I've ever seen and would not recommend it to anyone.
B005K0HDGE|5|Never did I think that a book involving time travel would be so intelligently written. I have a negative bias against most time travel stories for many reasons, but this novel is simply too well written for me to find much fault.<br /><br />This is the. Stephen King as I remember him from his earlier novels. His writing is taut, engaging,  and has that Everyman quality that just pulls you in. The main character is well written, as is the supporting cast. By the end of the novel you will certainly. Have feelings for them.<br /><br />The time travel element, while central to the story, disappears. It simply happens, and then fades away into the background of the story. I found myself shaking my head at how craftily he manages to tell his story and keep it soundly grounded without calling too much attention to the fact that we are indeed looking at a sci-fi situation at it heart.<br /><br />KIng, like Koontz, have often disappointed we with the final acts of their novels, building up to climax that doesn't suffice. It's tough to wrap up a superlative novel sometimes without letting your readers down. Not the case here. He put together one of the best conclusions I have seen from him in ages. Very neat!<br /><br />One of the best King novels - period!
B002WIDRM6|5|After reading other reviews I decided to order the US version, big mistake as I then had to pay custom charge!!!! for 2 CD's it cost another £12.18 be aware...... I am getting over it, great CD just love this band.
B00B2V66VS|5|I love this game, play it all the time!  It's exciting and easy to move around.  I like that I can completely control my character.
B0069G5Z9K|5|This game is super awesome I'm level 100 &amp; something. This game is so addicting that I'm still playing it even after that high of a level. There is always something new!You know what I'm giving to play right NOW!!!!
B0006L16N8|2|After discovering Coldplay by hearing and enjoying \\"Rush\\", this is a big disappointment. The music sounds like one long song split 14 different ways, and left on the floor from the previous cd. Coldplay will need to make some dramatic changes to their next cd, otherwise I'll be looking elsewhere for some new music.
B00992CF6W|5|I love love love minecraft so much but whit the new update I cam mot connect to my friends I wish the new updade was beter :(
B005LAIHZY|5|Thanks, I love this movie and all of the Movies of pixar, for me is the best of all Disney's princess and the first princess of Pixar
B0052GACNM|5|I have always liked Tony Bennett and this CD featuring him singing with varous stars is really nice. I play it often and have it in my car.
B00OKYQZDI|4|This is fun playing and I enjoy it when I sit down to rest.
B005LAIH54|5|Tremendous film and excellent buy at such a low price. For a gift is excellent. It is an excellent movie and excellent quality.
B00PSID6ZK|4|Angela is adorable !
B00PSLQYWE|5|Love this show
B00I2TV3NO|5|This is one of the better ones.  We really enjoyed this and I have to admit a few tears were shed.  Awesome movie and I would definitely buy it again.
B008M4OYYY|4|Fun little piece. Instructions aren't as bad as the typical Nanoblock set. The repetitive build of the pyramid is a nice way to zone out.
B00OKYQZDI|1|The game is OK......I just don't like paying for more lives.  A person or child could get into a lot of trouble.
B000W7JWUA|5|Awesome game!
B008B9JSD2|5|What the Pope in the film said that the church needed in order to not accepting the position is what is happenning with Pope Francis:<br />He is a real blessing from God to The Church. Great movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00475AYJQ|4|First of all, this was a very long book that probably rambled a bit at times and had multiple plots and plots within plots. The ending was also somewhat anti-climatic. However the stories told were entertaining and at times very exciting. I will be curious to learn more about Bast and what his role in this is.
159562015X|5|New
B000AMJG4Y|5|THANKS FOR IT AND HAPPY NEW YEAR AND CHRISTMAS AND ASIDORA FOR IT. HOPE LIKE STARS FILL IT UP! a
B00E1LQ7Q0|4|I don't think I really liked the packaging of this CD, but I do like the fact that it was available for automatic download so that I didn't have to wait for the CD to arrive before I could listen to it.  Overall, it's a pretty decent CD.  I've always been a fan of Justin Timberlake and his last CD FutureSex/LoveSounds was an excellent CD.  20/20 has a more jazzy feel, which I like a lot especially in Mirrors, Pusher Love Girl, Take Back The Night and TKO.
B0099RFVXQ|5|I bought this movie to watch on the plane to Las Vegas. My husband watched it on our iPad. It made the time go faster on the plane. The movie is action packed and we love the cast of super heros.
B00003CXB2|1|This film is maybe the greatest motion picture ever made.  But if you don't have WINDOWS software, you can't watch this DVD.  Be careful, nowhere in the information provided can you learn this.
B00280LYIC|5|My first time reading Percy Jackson was when I was 8. I didn't like Percy Jackson but when I stared learning Greek Mythology I understood it. I tried reading it again when I was 9 and it was amazing. Now I am 13.<br /><br />  One tip is to learn Greek Mythology and then read Percy Jackson.
0316247545|5|Very colorful! The format and layout is a perfect reference book as well as something fun to read on those lazy afternoons.  Love it!!  And yes, I'm a brony!
B005ORVMCY|4|The new remasters sound wonderful, I like them better than any previously released recordings. A Farewell to Kings in 5.1 is a gem!  The packaging however is an unmitigated disaster!  Every single disc in my Sector 2 box set has feathered scratching on the disc playing surface. They either came out of the factory that way or the plastic sleeves are the cause. Either way, this is totally unacceptable. I ended up putting the entire set in jewel cases to avoid any further damage to the disc surface. The plastic sleeves are a joke. The playing surface of any CD should never be in contact with anything period.  5 stars for the remasters....they sound absolutely superb.  1 star for packaging only because Amazon doesn't allow 0 stars which is what it should be.
B00DR0PDNE|4|I'm really happy that I bought the Google Chromecast! It works as expected and it turned my non-smart tv into a internet tv. I can now stream wirelessly from my computer, tablet, and phone. I give it 4 stars, not 5 only because my tv is somewhat far from my wireless router and sometimes I have streaming issues and the picture quality is not that great. Also I wish the chromecast was compatible with more sites and apps that offer streaming. Super fast shipping!
0062238868|5|Great book!
B00IINPXLW|4|Love the game, but the constant need for microtransactions and ads drives me crazy
0385507755|5|I am an avid reader and this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a review. This book is hopeful, disturbing, thought provoking and absolutely impossible to put down. Mr. Frey finds a way to give the thought process behind addiction  and recovery without sensationalizing the process.  When I bought A MILLION LITTLE PIECES I never thought I would come away from it feeling inspired,which is exactly what I did.  could not put this book down and have recommended it to 10 friends who all loved it  or are in the process of loving it.
B002XTBE8I|5|A truly solid album by the Greatest Hip Hop artist of this generation.
0345495004|5|I really enjoyed reading this book, and I would look for more books written by this author and also about Frank Lloyd Wright. I have visited one of his homes in the mountains of Colorado, and I found it a fascinating design. This was many years ago, but I thought about this home often as I was reading this book. \\"Loving Frank\\" isn't only about Frank Lloyd Wright, it is about the love of his life (not his wife) and the affair they carried on. It was in the early 1900's so this living together was not acceptable at all. Mamah Borthwick Cheney was part of an early women's movement. Both she and Frank were very intelligent people and shared many interests, including the pain of not living with their respective children.
B0000041XX|5|When you get the best Tenors in the World together, this is what you get.! Absolutely wonderful listening and a CD that's always ready to please!
B00EW9GQR6|5|It is such an amazing album! I love it!
B000FBJAEG|4|Very good. Sometimes got a little confused with the characters.  Had to keep reading:)
B00992CF6W|5|it is a fun game that you have to sirvive in! zombies creepers spiders. I love it! best app ever mojang is awesome and so is the game.
B00139B39E|3|As an avid Dream Theater fan who appreciates Dream Theater albums as complete works of art, rather than a collection of songs, I got what I expected from the Greatest Hit album and ranked it three stars accordingly.    Dream Theater's music is complex and their albums are very thematic. They are written like epics and can only be truly appreciated when listened to from beginning to end with little or no interruption (just think [[ASIN:B000021XS0 Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory]], [[ASIN:B00005UEAR Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]] Disc II, or [[ASIN:B000002JKA Awake]]). Many songs which used to flow into each other have been abruptly truncated or awkwardly resolved so they could stand alone as singular pieces on this album and some of the most amazing feats of musicianship (Petrucci and Rudess at the end of Solitary Shell) have been tragically removed altogether.    As a collection of songs for someone who wants to listen to \\"cool music,\\" this album does the trick and may inspire one to purchase some of the albums the individual songs come from. But what is lost is analogous to listening to a \\"Broadway's Greatest Hits\\" compilation.. the songs are pretty, but you lose the story. Listening to and understanding Dream Theater is an experience which can only be understood by listening to their songs in the context of the entire album.    All in all, I agree with the majority of the reviews on this album.  For the DT fan, realize that you're not getting a work of art, but a collection of pieces.  For those interested in progressive rock, I recommend you start with [[ASIN:B000021XS0 Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory]] or [[ASIN:B000002JKA Awake]].  For the casual listener, this will be a nice and interesting album to have in your collection.
B0040X46TE|5|The best music I have heard since Elvis.
161655164X|5|This is an amazing book for anyone who is a fan of The Last of Us. It contains a lot of information about the creation of the game, and the illustrations are excellent. I originally bought this to get a few prints that I could frame for the man cave, but I couldn't bring myself to tear anything out.
B000003H34|5|This is one of those albums people tend to either love or hate, without much middle ground existing between the two. I happen to be among the former catagory.  To me, The Silent Enigma is a quintessential Doom album.  Sure, Vincent hadn't quite reached the peak of his vocal abilities when this was first released but he sings with more emotion on this than any other album.  Kinda remiscent of the clean vox of My Dying Bride in some ways.  the music is dark and brooding with influences ranging from Pink Floyd to Bathory.  They also experiment with innovative reverb techniques that add an extra dimension to the overall ambience.  When it comes to an ever evolving band like Anathema it is difficult to say which is the best album because all of them sound so different.  Personally, I consider this, Judgement, A Fine Day To Exit and Eternity to be their best, however I know there's quite a few people who would disagree. So in conclusion I'd just like to point out that it wouldn't be a bad idea to just listen to the sound samples and figure out what you like from Anathema because the opinions differ so much.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|Thoroughly enjoyed this classic Baldacci novel. Especially at $8.99. See Amazon now charging $14.99 for same Kindle book though. .
B007N5YIUS|1|How could you make an update that does not keep the progress??? I can't believe I have to START ALL OVER!!! DO NOT UPDATE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR PROGRESS!!!
B000S56R1I|5|I've never heard of this guy until I happened to hear \\"Chicago\\" on my local radio station, WXRT. It is rare that I hear a song this perfect. A perfect mix of strings, woodwinds and brass. I immediately wrote down the artist's name, incorrectly.. After a few hours of searching I found \\"Illinoise\\" and downloaded \\"Chicago\\" and a few other tracks. This stuff is simply amazing. Such rich, melodious, thoughtful music. Hmm, soo good!    Do yourself a favor, buy this CD. It is a great cure for that toxic, top 40 goop.
B000S58428|5|I've listened to this a lot in the past year, and have to say it is one of the very few modern albums I love. &#34;The Scientist&#34; is a great song, and &#34;Warning Sign&#34; is excellent. I bought it for &#34;Clocks&#34; but have to rate this Coldplay's best work. Great download.
0671027344|5|I don't think there was one moment through reading this book were i was not satisfied. After every letter i read, i found myself lying back down and just thinking &quot;wow.&quot; <BR>I read this book for the first time around ten months ago. One of those books that i picked up from the airport and then realising after i had purchased it, &quot;why do i need to read a book in mexico?&quot; But i picked up the book during a flight delay and fell in love. With Charlie. The book made me think about myself, and my place in the world. Not like other books on teenage angst that made me think, &quot;where do I fit into everything?&quot; but the perks of being a wallflower made me think, &quot;where does everything fit in around me?&quot; For that, i was grateful.<br />\\"I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why.\\" <br />I think it was when the writer touched on the song &quot;asleep&quot; by the smiths. Which has always been one of my fabourite songs. And the way that he described it as 'the perfect song, on that perfect drive, on a road to feel infinite.' I was in awe. And i still am. And i yearn for the day where i can drive through a tunnel, with the wind in my hair, listening to a beautiful song, and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and feeling infinite. I can't wait.
B0002VEPRQ|5|One of my favorite movies of all time!!
B00G7QPXUI|2|Yeah, I don't get the fascination with Woody Allen movies. The characters from all his movies could easily intermingle with each other among his films and be right at home...they all seem to be cut from the same cloth. As with main characters in his other movies, the one here, Jasmine, suffers from a major case of discontentment as her life spins out of control. She's a stereotypical society wife, all about superficiality and appearances. I found it a bit 'Twilight Zone' creepy. When she feels she is wronged, she exacts revenge which has further devastating consequences for her.  About half way through the movie, I worried that the ending would be predictable, and guess what. It was. It left me feeling like the movie was rather pointless and that this story has been told before.  So nothing new here.  And somewhat depressing.
B00KFUU6H2|5|Great
B004MNVKVO|5|Nice addition to my collection. Would of liked some \\"live\\" concert videos instead of the common studio ones on the 2nd disc. Sound is much improved over the original CD. You'll like it.

B002MQYOFW|4|I really enjoyed reading this book. I caught myself thinking about it and what the next pages would hold. Excitement and suspense!
B005ZOBNOI|5|This was an easy read due to the fact you are swept along their journey of dying with them. I couldn't put this down but when I did I kept thinking about what will happen next. A good read!
B0079XPUOW|3|This is only my second book of Scalzi that I've read but I enjoy him as an author. His &#34;Old Man's War&#34; series is very entertaining and well written. That being said, I don't think this book is anything that amazing nor is it terrible. I enjoy the meta references and the world it sets up. But the story is very ho-hum. Scalzi always does a good job on his main characters and Andrew Dahl was no exception. As far as the story line goes, I think there could have been a lot more with the potential of the elements. The solution seems to come way too quickly and there is too much focus on very trivial matters. The solution gets overly complicated and seems to work for no reason. The very last paragraph of the main story line is very clever and points to the fun that Scalzi writes about. There are three after action story threads that aren't at all necessary and do not add anything at all. However, the broad story is a focus on incidental characters so this is kind of a meta joke. I have to say one thing about the three (final) character story that I think almost steals the show. There's a line (and this will only make sense to those who have read the book) that one of the characters is thanking the main character for allowing him to experience a world with his wife. There is something so amazing and philosophical and meta and existential and surreal that it's quite beautiful. Then it's ruined by the completely predicable conclusion that it almost ruins the nice moment. Getting back to the main story, the ending to it is ok. There isn't a full answer which works in some instances but with the total tone of the book it doesn't work. The meta aspect and the tropes necessitates the outcome to be tied together in a nice package with bow and every thread tied together and it doesn't do so. I'm sad to say that I didn't like this one as much as most people seem to. I think it'd work as a short story and all the themes and talking points could be covered in a 50 page short story. Final Grade - Ctory. Final Grade - C
B00005R2M3|5|LAUNDRY SERVICE is, by far, the best album that has ever been released.  Never before have I purchased an album that I have loved every song on.  Shakira is amazing.  Her music and lyrics are so full of meaning...not only to her, but to her fans as well.  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys music.  The contribution that it makes to nearly every genre of music is priceless.
B00MU9R5OI|3|is ok,
B008M721MS|1|After reading all reviews no way am I getting this and it would have been so great to have.
B00CGFHUI2|1|I have no idea how this is rating 4.5 out of 5 star unless there were some paid reviewers along the way.  The first episode was pretty neat and interesting and then the show went down hill from there.  I quit watching the season after three episodes since it lost my interest in a heartbeat.  Funny, I saw another 1 star reviewer say they quit watching after three episodes too.  Don't waste your time on this one and watch something like the Bates Motel instead.  Now, that kept my attention.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Good fun all around but beware of all the chances to spend money. When you change to a new destination of levels you must wait three days or pay. Genius marketing. Reel you in and then fail you and encourage paying 99 cents at every opportunity.
B006OCM0G0|5|I love this game and it is very addicting! Great for all ages! This is probably my favorite game! Works great with a kindle fire.<br /><br />P.S. You might like backery story too(:

0385738781|4|two things bothered me about these books: first, why is it necessary to map the brain using emotional roller coaster in order to fight  the virus?  cures for viruses are created using immunology and biochemistry, understanding of how viruses bind to cells, how they insert themselves into host DNA and how they multiply.  How does emotional blueprint of an immune brain helps to do that, to stop the virus from invading it?  If the virus lives in the brain, then biochemistry of that has to be researched, not how a teen reacts to the death of his best friend..  that just does not make sense.  Second, how is it possible for Immunes not to spread the virus that lives in the them?  what, they don't breath?
B00FAX6XQC|4|It's a fun game and It is very interesting to play. Extremely realistic and I like to shoot stuff. Lots...
B002M5E2DW|1|Anyone with an iota of common sense and intelligence should not read this book, unless they would like to live a delusional life, and no there is no formula in here to get you rich or find happiness.
B00DJFIMW6|5|i was obsessed with minions now i am addicted to the game... its almost like there should be a illness its so good!
B009XIXVU6|4|What I like about Hosseini is that he is an excellent storyteller.  However,  in this novel,  his stories were somewhat confusing to me....  times, places, people, names became mixed up.  I was most disappointed in the ending because I so wanted the brother/sister reunion between Abdullah and Pari,  who were so close in childhood,  to finally come together and for them to get it all together once more,  which didn't happen because of his dementia;  I found that very sad and unfulfilling.  Many of Hosseini's observations of Afghanistan  were thought-provoking:  &#34; There are a thousand tragedies for every mile.&#34;  I'm glad that I read this book, but I didn't like it as well as his previous two.
B009SJ3H8Q|5|excellent
B000WQ9UA8|5|I have been a Britney fan for a long time, but after seeing the VMA's I was skeptical about how \\"Blackout\\" would turn out. But, after reading critic reviews about it actually being good, I thought that I would try it out... It is AWESOME!! I absolutely love this record!! She has done it again. It has many club-worthy beats and songs to workout to (which I love!!).     Go buy it Go buy it!! You will not be sorry!!!
6300274195|5|Walt Disney's fourth animated feature, &quot;Dumbo,&quot; is one of his best movies. It is the shortest Disney film ever. It has some of the best  songs a Disney movie has ever had. One song in particular, &quot;Baby  Mine,&quot; just brings tears to my eyes. Two sequences in this movie stand  out: the pink elephants dancing and the scene where Dumbo goes to visit his  mother in jail at night. My favorite character is Timothy Q. Mouse. He is  the only friend that Dumbo has. This movie is another one of Uncle Walt's  great classics.
B003TNQEF0|5|One of my favorite short story books, made into a good movie.  Steven King classic.

B000LTAY1U|5|This watch is a little tank - it keeps excellent time and I wear it pretty much 24/7. Love the colour, the aesthetics and the sweeping motion of the hand especially. So far it's held up really well - I accidentally bashed it against a door frame and I can't find where it got scratched - definitely a quality product!
0143120581|3|Amy Chua is a ruthless dictator to her children.  She embodies the worst of the upper class.  She wishes for the picture perfect family and, in doing so, is a menace to all those around her.<br /><br />Her \\"self-parody\\" doesn't salvage the the obvious flaws within her tale.
B00F2HW20M|5|I purchased this set through a European outlet, as it was released a week earlier there and it aligned with my son's birthday.  We had seen Steve Hackett and his band on this tour in October 2013 and were simply floored!  I am so glad this set has been released and that Steve delved back into the early years of Genesis.  If you have the chance you MUST see him in concert and purchase this set.  As of this review Steve and the band have some \\"live\\" dates set for New Jersey, Atlanta, GA and three cities in Florida in the Spring of 2014.  My son was a Genesis fan, post Hackett, and seeing Steve \\"live\\" has opened up new chapters he was amazed to discover in a way that \\"sealed the deal.\\"  The audiences are polite and appreciative!  This is a MUST OWN set for avid Genesis fans!!
B005OCFHHK|5|My kids love to watch over and over again.

1439190275|5|This book is a great step in the wonderful Atkins legacy.     I've read a lot of the studies cited in this book, and am looking forward to researching the cornucopia of scientific studies cited in it.      Atkins turned the nutritional field on it's head almost forty years ago when he published his initial book. But he was NOT the creator of the low-carb diet.  Doctors were putting people on the low-carb diet in the 1800s after they found that too much bread and ale were causing obesity.  It wasn't until the 1950s that the field of nutrition was subverted  by Ansel Keyes and his followers.  Low carb is NOT the \\"fad diet\\" of today. Low-Fat is the fad diet. A costly fad diet that is killing MILLIONS of us from diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease.     A LOT of the anti-Atkins people say \\"I knew someone that was on Atkins and they had XXX health problems because of it.\\"  The question to ask is...HOW did they do Atkins? Did they only eat meat, cheese and eggs? If so they WERE NOT DOING ATKINS.  Atkins requires 12-15 grams of NET carbs (total - fiber) from VEGGIES every single day.  It also recommends that you get 25-30 grams of fiber per day.  What is unhealthy about that?       This book was incredibly well written and did a great job of pulling together some of the groundbreaking scientific studies that have been done that DO prove that low-carb is a phenomenal tool to reduce risk factors such as high blood sugar, cholesterol and high blood pressure.     I did find things that I disagreed with in the book such as the recommendation to not weigh your food, but that is minutia, and each individual will find tools that work for them.     If you want to understand how the nutrional field got so screwed up, a good book to read is Gary Taubes' \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\".

B008IJTFYW|4|I really enjoyed selecting the sounds that fit me personally. Very relaxing and restful.<br />On the down side, the soothing melody would stop abruptly. I'm not sure if this is because I am using the free version. Probably.
B00006LIRI|5|About five years ago I was doing a road trip around France and a self-declared music Connoisseur was looking through my albums.  He dismissed that they were 'Not bad' but said 'Katrine, you really don't learn the most about music from 'Best of' Albums.'  This comment has stuck with me from that day forward and I feel U2's latest compilation is proof that this is not the case.  There is a simple pleasure derived in this age of mixing one's own CDs, of letting an album play all the way through and not once wanting to skip tracks and this is definately the case with this offering.  <BR>During a pretty pathetic time for pop music U2 produced memorable hits in their albums Atchung Baby and Pop.  These are now blended with their latest singles the hauntingly beautiful 'The Hands that Built Ameirca' from 'Gangs of New York' and the energetic 'Eletrical Storm.'<BR>Listen to this, and discard your remote, you won't need it.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|This is a really fun game for people who love racing......without lags. Also it's great for all ages from little kids to older people
0307712508|5|Usually a book is either a great story, or well written, or enthralling or informative. This is one of the few I've ever read that tick all four boxes. I bought the audio version, and even after hours on the road I found myself sitting in the driveway because I was so caught up in the story wanted to know what happened next.  It seamlessly incorporates the writer's journey into  the story of Henrietta and her family, all the while asking ethical questions that need to be answered. It's a wonderful book, and the audio voice is enthralling.  I can't praise it highly enough.
0765322889|1|After reading about 100 pages of this book, it came to decision making time... should I hang myself and end the misery or not?  Lucky for you, I simply put the book down and stepped away.  No really - lucky for you.  Otherwise, you would have to read a much longer review that broke down in amazing detail how messed up this book was.<br /><br />I used to really try to read bad books all the way to the end.  Heck, I stuck with that turd Cryptonomicon until the conclusion.  I even stuck with On the Beach.  However, after reading numerous terrible books, I've found that I have just lost the patience for it.  It's like going out to dinner with a girl that you can't stand and having to listen to her talk about her problems.  Ahhhh... just let me pay the bill and get out of here!  I've had the appetizer and I can tell that the rest of this meal is going to suck.<br /><br />After 100 pages, I would expect a book to make some semblance of sense.  Who are these people?  What are they doing?  Why are they doing it?  What the heck is going on?  Why is the soul of some dude running around in a puppet?  Where did the author come up with these ridiculous names for people?<br /><br />If you want a true measure of how bad this book is, look at how many reviewers stopped reading it after about 100 to 200 pages.  That seems to be a common theme running through the poor reviews.  The readers give it a reasonable chance, but just can't take it anymore after 100 to 200 pages.  Lots of books get their share of bad reviews, but it is unusual to see so many people simply quit reading out of frustration.<br /><br />I read one favorable review (on another website) that stated that if reading epic fantasy was like jumping into the deep end of a pool, reading this was like jumping into the ocean.  The reviewer stated that the author has created an epic fantasy world and drops the reader into it with no background or explanation.<br /><br />Yeah, I think that is accurate... and that is the problem.  An author dropping you in the \\"middle of the ocean\\" is a good thing how?  While some may view this approach as admirable or profound, I just found it to be an unnecessary pain.  There are dozens of books that I wish to read, so why put up with this nonsense?  It's like being a rock star - I have dozens of groupies waiting outside my hotel room, so why put up with the \\"high-maintenance\\" one.  I'd rather just dump her back in the hall and grab another that won't make me have to put up with her crap.
B0098VYCCE|5|really good movie.

B0000041WV|5|This is an excellent collection of the best Dvorak symphonies. They are a pleasure to listen to and help to generate a variety of moods. Some are slow, some are fast, some are motivating and direct. Dvorak is doing his best! I highly recommend this multi-disc set for the classical music or general music collector!!!
1476746583|2|I'm upset with the way they portrayed the book to be. It was an overall good read, but I would have loved to see more of Werner and Marie. I thought the book was about their story, not about their lives individually.

B004N44SOI|4|I had given up on all things associated with Motley Crue some years back, so I was floored by the last Sixx:A.M. effort of the Heroin Diaries Soundtrack.  I spread that album recommendation around like wildfire.  I still would have that album on my \\"desert island\\" list.  This effort has some good moments, but did not have the incredible impact that I was hoping for.  We all hope, pray, wish that pinnacle work can continue, but this one fell little short.  The superfans will still love it, but for the rest of the crowd it will be hit or miss.  I bought it sound unheard and am having a little buyers remorse to be honest.  Shame on me I guess.  Give the samples a listen, see if you like it.  I think that tracks  1 & 2 are tops, and that 5 & 7 are the bottoms.  Everything else falls someplace in between.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Once again I couldn't put this book down. Full of intrigue romance and history. I never get tired of reading about this family.

B001J1S4F2|4|Take a 17th century setting of beautiful villas, interiors and costumes, add a twisting plot full of manipulative characters acted by actors well up to the challenge  and you will not be able  to look away from Dangerous Liaisons.  Glenn Close and John Malkovich play their parts to perfection.  Spite, cruelty and insincerity challenge innocence and trust in the characters of Michelle Pffiefer and Kyanu Reeves.  John Malkovich's performance alone keeps me coming back to this movie time and time again.
