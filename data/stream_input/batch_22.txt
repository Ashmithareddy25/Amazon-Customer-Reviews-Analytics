B007ZDDUCK|5|Used this on my leather Nike Dunks and Air Jordan 1s. Great results, will definitely try their other products.
B00L99C608|5|greta service and the sticker is just like it is in the picture!
B0036IA6JI|5|Everything Good, No Problems
B005FNKSMW|4|The product is what I expected!. Would have gave five stars if the tracking was better. But was on time.
B0002JR9HG|5|Great product.Worked perfect.
B00YFFECQE|5|Very nice product! I would recommend for my friends!
B00TQWUSFA|5|Love them
B00R9UV8HS|5|Good quality, works great with the SCT.
B00AQFEB18|5|My 2nd one ,, easy to install and very strong
B00AU2P8PA|5|Fat old & cranky. Fits me. Looks cool on my rifle case. Sticks well.
B00URR4O5I|5|This stuff is amazing. It is easy to work with, cuts easily, applies easily, dampens sound really well. I used this product on the insides of my Toyota Rav 4 doors - prior to putting on this Noico film, when you tap on the outside of the doors, it sounded like a tin can. A lot of vibration, tinny sound. Now, when you tap, it sounds almost solid. Definitely no tin can sound. When the doors shut now, it sounds really solid. A friend of mine told me I turned my Toyota into a Lexus with this.<br /><br />One note on the application: Watch out for the sharp edges on the foil backing. I applied this material with my bare hands - I rubbed it to make sure I got good adhesion. Later that day I noticed my fingers had a ton of micro cuts - not deep enough to draw blood, but enough to be rough. The foil backing is stiff enough that it cuts skin when you rub it. So I recommend gloves.<br /><br />Oh, and the product definitely reduced road noise - I did not get a decibel meter and measure, but I can listen to my stereo at lower volumes and it sounds clear.<br /><br />One last thing - 50Sq ft is about twice as much as what you need to do the 4 doors - I am thinking about tearing apart the rear cargo area and rear door and applying some material there as well, since I still have about 25sq ft left over.
B007I6Z05Y|1|I was under the impression this was suited for the 98TJ and was told by jeep specialists it was not
B003V9XYNW|4|I hate changing flat bicycle tires.  I heard about Slime and I thought it was only to fix flat  tires. As I was reading about how to use it,  I saw that it can be used to AVOID flat tires---even better if you ask me.  It was easy to apply (I watched a YouTube to learn how--I admit). I have Schrader valves on my tires. The cap on the Slime works as a tool to removed the core from the valve before applying the Slime. The only problem I had was the little tool broke before I finished Sliming the  tires on my two bikes. Of course, Amazon &#34;fixed&#34; the problem and replaced the product. You really can't ask for better service that that. The only problem with the Slime is that  when you are using a multi-application bottle it is hard to see when you have squeezed enough Slime into a tube before moving filling the next tube. It would be nice if it came in &#34;individual doses.&#34;
B00DOS0T0G|5|This stuff is absolutely amazing. I have tried a lot of instant detailers but this one makes the rest stay in the shelf. I have a red Mustang and a black Parhfinder and works great on both. A must buy for car enthusiasts!
B008SEBQ2G|1|Only get 4 of my 18 preset channels
B004QEH1QW|5|Works as expected.
B008VLVDII|4|Very heavy duty, but does not fit my car back seat as nice as it does in the picture.
B0009IQXFO|5|I tried it for the first time today. It made my 2016 Corolla shine like a mirror. I wanted to buy the best and in my opinion it is.
B00DVOZ2VY|5|It came on time and it is a great product thank you so much it was for my dad and he loves it
B00RRCHND6|5|Perfect organizer!
B00OIK3UQO|4|Good quality.
B00NBE05T8|1|Needed more instruction s for sock extensions u bolts were poor quality
B00NWT69Z6|5|ok
B0012S9A5U|5|Speaks for itself a+
B004KEJXGE|1|Doesn't fit 4.9L I6 300ci
B0055AW0N0|3|Did not fit in my Toyota Yaris
B00GYHU1N4|4|Runs out within about a week if you drive with your windows down.<br /><br />Lasts about 3 weeks to a month with windows up.
B00FY813OU|1|Wrong part. Used the fit my vehicle guide and read reviews. Still wrong part. I called dorman and sorted out the issue. Correct part is on back order and I cannot find it anywhere. Don't want to goto the dealer and be forced to buy an entire 160 dollar assembly because of a broken 20 part. Uggg
B008NMHDLG|5|Bought for a friend, fit up like OEM, can't find a better price than here. Gaskets came with it although description didn't mention that so another bonus.
B001BAF5YY|5|Smells good; I recommend it.
B001BAFAQC|1|I wont be buying this brand again. The tubes I received appeared to have been hardened inside the canister and unusable. The seller gave me a refund immediately, but this set me back a day on a build that every day counted. Luckily I found some SEM sealer locally and it worked great. BTW, when I called the manufacturer at 11AM on a Wed. nobody answered and there was no option to leave a message. This seems to be more common than ever these days. In a day and age when competition is stiff, a manufacturer only gets one chance with me. Neutraders/McKanica, you just wasted your only chance.
B000COCUF2|1|Used on commercial truck. Color went off in few weeks. And lifespan disapointed me as well. I used 3 bulbs with similar result.<br />I will try other brand.
B0040CTYAQ|5|Fits as advertised
B00GU9V8FG|5|Exactly what I needed.
B000EGRA5I|5|Great quality
B008RU3FRA|4|Received the CDI today.  Noticed a increase in acceleration but I lost about 5 mph top end speed on my 150cc scooter.  I noticed on the label on the packaging that's it's for 50cc & 125cc. I don't know if that makes a difference but I will use until I get a better one.
B000YS9P54|5|I bought this cooler for our vacation trip from PA to FL.  We kept water bottles and my wife's insulin in it. I added an ice pack to the top of the bottles and everything stayed nice and cool. Also the size of this unit is just right to fit in between the middle seats of our van. The shoulder strap came in handy to transport the unit back and forth.<br />  I haven't had a chance to try the warmer.
B00SSF6U26|5|Very good. They are tough!
B001RERKTC|5|I use this sealant for most of my small repair jobs around the house...from fixingceramics to installing knobs onto my mirror closet doors, use as pipe thread glue, etc...and it has never failed me once.
B009FPQMO4|1|item does not fit as advertised.  picture shows it has 3 sections.It only has two sections and it it approx 1 foot to short. needs the third section. Should have trusted the other reviews that stated the same thing. will be returned
B00BZVYNZG|5|Even though the models listed did not include my van, I carefully matched the numbers and took a chance. It worked on my 2011 GMC Savana.  Didn't save me much money because we still paid the dealership $60 to program it.
B002P8L7U2|5|Good product.
B00CYLKBUM|5|Perfect for under child car seat.
B00KVT2RF6|5|Awesome
B005NLQAHS|4|Easy peasy; great value.
B004TC19KA|5|Minor modifications needed but it comes with the wiring harness to do it.
B0006MWPZU|5|Good for the price.  I was having extreme back problems riding in a new car.  This product really helped me in being able to continue driving the car.  I bought two.  I use one on the dining room chair and one in my car.  The reviews I read before buying stated that the straps were weak.  My straps are still connected just fine with no signs of breaking.  I bought these about two months ago and I traveled from Florida to Indiana and back to Florida with no back problems.  I consider that more important than a strap.
B009HHHQMC|5|fit right fit tight, right price.
B001TEIJJU|5|A perfect replacement that fixed a really annoying problem in my daughter's 1997 Volvo 960.  Replacing this part may trigger Volvo's anti-theft system, which happened in my case and made me initially think the part was defective.  Do not jump to this conclusion - look online and you will find the information you need to reset the system.  The ignition switch works perfectly now, this is a great product!
B001O7PNS2|5|A perfect topper wax. Spray on, wipe w/ microfiber cloth to spread, and give it a final buff. Works great on plastic trim and glass, too. Lasts close to a month on a car that sits all day in the Florida sun.<br /><br />The only complaint is that one bottle lasts little more than three Civics worth. I use it on every inch of the exterior except the wheels, though.<br /><br />I've also used the Meguiars Detailers Synthetic X-Press. Functionally, it's the same, but the results aren't quite as good. (And it has a more perfume-y smell.)
B002PJXFK6|1|Had it less then a year and it just fell apart. Won't ever buy again or spend that much money
B0087XOTWW|1|Did not work at all
B000CF6S2C|3|Does not indicate that these are in-channel type Ventshades.  The rear Ventshades being in-channel make contact w/rear windows making closing difficult w/o placing hand in the window channel.  Vehicle will have to be operated for several days w/the rear windows closed and then the double-sided tape sticks sufficiently to allow operation without the window hitting into the in-channel Ventshade.  I would do not recommend in-channel Auto Ventshades or any in-channel type products.
B000CMHV4O|5|Fits great.
B00OKXP0C6|5|Great tool if you work with wire loom at all. Makes feeding wires through loom SO MUCH EASIER. No more cut hands and bunch ups. This was a life saver for multiple projects and the size variety is excellent. Highly suggest even if you are only working with wire loom on a few things.
B00NF1RCB6|5|great price, would have cost me twice the amount, fit perfect
B002ONEC8C|5|was perfect and exact fit.
B005OOHRLM|4|Like it
B000WPB8YU|5|Fit perfectly.
B0054SL9N0|5|Great quality, but not as deep as I thought it would be.  It fits perfectly into one of the dual cup-holders in front of the gearbox in my 2015 Toyota Yaris SE.  The rubberized sides and raised edge-ring ensure a tight, rattle-free fit.  It is too small for the big cup holder between the seats, and won't fit into either front-door cup holder.
B00AWGN932|5|Awesome product and great price on it and shipping.
B002SB03IS|5|This thing is amazing.  I can put things in the bed of the truck now without everything bouncing around.  Easy to clean and it fit like a glove.  Super happy!
B00BNX7A2O|5|fit great on a 99 ford ranger xlt 4wd<br /><br />does not have provision for abs so if your vehicle has 4 wheel abs you need a different model
B0001CMUV4|5|These things are quality products, heavy! did the job, recommend, a tad on the pricy side, but again, good quality.
B00BF23HVQ|5|I purchased this because none of the local tire shops had the programmer to reprogram a faulty sensor in my 2012 Tacoma and the nearest dealer is 130 miles away. right out of the box didn't even charge it. read the instruction on programming my Toyota and 5 min. later no more light and new sensor programmed and system working flawless now.
B00MH4663C|5|as advertised
B004A30AOY|5|works great thanks
B007S2ZYY0|5|Its on my r1, been good for 3 months now
B000E288B2|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B008CE06ZA|5|Great hitch for the money.  I know people mentioned the loose fit but I don't notice any slop when towing.  Easy and quick adjustments.
B000XRHRZQ|5|They look great:)
B003VBLGVM|5|It was exactly what it was suppose to be.  3 minutes to install.
B000PCAGLG|5|Looks good
B00133VP8O|4|Very nice, very heavy duty.  No fault of the tack, but significant wind drag (enough to see a difference in my fuel milage).  Looks good and is as good or better than what I could have ever made myself.  I will take it off when I am not using it though due to the wind drag and than will take the removal of 4 easy to access bolts and a second set of hands to help pick it up over the jeep to put in storage.
B009BNG4IY|5|Great replacements, used on my Jaguar XF
B00FSCAEYW|5|Working great so far! Thank you. Will buy again to keep as a spare. Just in case.
B0002NYDZ8|5|Well worth the money, I got so tired of cheap grease guns that never would pump.  You get what you pay for in this case.  Would buy again.
B00APTRI88|5|It was cute but didnt fit my truck window
B00MB0D9G4|4|Fit and grip/looks exceeded expectations by a mile !
B000COBCF6|5|excellent, highly recommend them
B000C11JMA|5|This. My mechanic wanted about $400 to replace a window motor using Honda parts. This came well-packaged and already greased in all the right places. My install was a little more complicated than most of the tut videos on YouTube, etc., as my motor broke and stuck with the pane in the closed position, making the bolts that secure the glass significantly harder to get to, but that's not this motor's fault and still only took be about 90 minutes stem to stern to replace. Worked like a charm.
B0085LX60W|5|Very good product.
B00CXU2WX8|5|Fits and works great. Mistubishi Montero 2003 Diesel Engine 4m40
B00IMVNKOM|2|Lacks the force to make a good car-washing nozzle.  So far hasn't leaked and is probably a good all-around nozzle - flowers, plants, pets.  I am looking for something with more force to wash vehicles and driveways and sidewalks.  Volume is there - just not the force.  Quality construction.
B00TEH1482|5|It is exactly what it looks like in the picture.  Basic decal.
B00L26U1CI|5|Switch is well built. Installed this in a 1995 Toyota 4Runner with Viair Constant Duty system. Comes with a slip of paper for wiring instructions. Can be confusing. The slip has various switches depending on the amount on terminals on the back of the switch. Just make sure you read the correct one. Fits nicely in a standard pop out tab. Would buy again without hesitation. Wired to parking lights so bottom half of switch comes on and both lights come up when the switch is turned on. See photos
B00YDZL15Q|4|Easy to install and well worth the money. Not to mention the colored chain really sets off the look of a bike.
B001VA39JC|5|Perfect fit
B00KBKOAGY|2|things are not clear when looking through this
B00KBQBDB8|1|Completely worthless. The plastic this is made of is no thicker than an aquafina bottle. It squirts water all over from the weak connection between the bulb and the hose. It siphons absolutely nothing.
B00M0TSPUG|5|Good quality vest with fast shipping. Thanks
B000XTHUHE|1|Does not fit the liftgate of a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee - even though the compatibility tool at the top of this page says it does. This is the wiper that does: http://www.amazon.com/Trico-14-C-Exact-Wiper-Blade/dp/B001KRYIC8/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1440788073&sr=1-1&keywords=trico+exact+fit+14c
B003CMSFH8|4|Nice bars good fit, they are very heavy wall and strong but still so light.
B00BMTZRWY|5|Fast ship work great
B00TIU4Y50|5|Parts arrived quickly.  I have quite a bit of circuit-board soldering experience, so the installation went quite smoothly.  Thank-you for a great product and a cost-effective solution vs. what GM wanted to charge!
B000C492O4|5|Fits my 86 Chev pickup. Getting the old one off took some time, there is limited access to the linkage, very little space to work in. Be sure you slide off the rubber bushings on the 3 mounting bolts, you will need them to put the new motor back on. I spent about an hour on mine, most of the time was loosening the bolt to the linkage on the old motor. I sprayed it with WD-40 and let it set for awhile, even then it took a lot of force to loosen the nut. Once I got the old motor off, putting the new one in was easy. Cranked up my truck, the wipers worked flawlessly on high and low speed.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|The shade fits perfectly in my Ford Expedition.  It does an excellent job of blocking the heat and sun rays.  It's easy to install and store.  I love it!
B00G09VDQU|5|Easy to install on my 328i
B00E1SKAI4|5|Worked great.  No issues and it saved us a trip to find the part locally.  We live in the boonies so that is a bonus.
B000A8JNF0|5|As someone else had mentioned before, the sprayer was easier to apply to the cloth top. I recently did try and use the cleaner to remove some wax spots I had on the top, and it did remove them. I do highly recommend this product. It made my top look new again and protected it now. Thanks
B000JIND4S|4|Cheap, but it gets the job done!
B007JEK2SK|5|Worked like a charm.  Toughest part was getting old antenna off- out of the collar nut anyway since it was pretty mangled..  The instructions are OK, but take a look at YouTube to see how easy it is-  didn't have my car on on the 'tube, but the principal is the same.<br /><br />A real five minute install (but 10 minutes getting the old shaft out of the collar nut).<br /><br />I used to think was a major deal to fix a power antenna- and expensive- but for about 20 bucks, can beat it!
B000BZ509U|5|Perfect fit
B000WGNNUQ|4|If you accidentally reverse polarities from battery there are 4 internal fuses that will blow and the unit will become useless. To replace the fuses you have to open the cover and once you open the cover the warranty becomes void. The Sunforce doesn't have any service centers in the USA. They tell you that Warranty is not valid for reverse polarity misoperation and that you are on your own. Technical support person # 1 suggested that I may have fried the Thyristor and that I should look for a local shop to get it fixed if al all it can be done ! Pretty frustrating for me because I open the unit just from the box and get it going. A few days later I again called the technical support hoping that I could get some else with a better advice. Technical Support person # 2 told me to open up the cover and look for blown fuses although he said that if I opened the cover the warranty would be voided. I was able to remove the  cover and successfully replace the fused. The fuses a automobile type and easily available in local auto shop. Thereafter unit tested fine with or without any load. Also the remote ON/OFF tested good ( BTW the front breaker should always be on OFF position for the remote switch to work). I think this is a good product otherwise and that is why I am giving it 4 stars.<br />Perhaps the manufacturer can locate the fuses outside for ease of replacement and write something to this effect in the instruction manaul.
B009EV0ZOC|1|Not user friendly installation.
B00UVZ2QW4|1|Cup holder looked cool the start but after a couple rides the rivet pen holding the cup to the handlebar attachment Comes loose. The pen is just shoved in to the handlebar attachment that has nothing to hold it.
B000Q0AG08|2|Just received my item and I'm not too happy with it so far. The item arrived exactly as shown in the photos - a totally bare pipe. There is a pretty significant dent/bend in the pipe either from the supplier or the mail carrier. I can't imagine the supplier letting an item so obviously dented leave the warehouse - so I think it was most likely the mail carrier, but who knows. I do think that the fact that there was no box or protective wrapping at all definitely contributed to the issue.<br /><br />I'm almost certain this is going to cause alignment issues (seems out of alignment by about 5 to 6 inches on the end). I need to install in the next day or so, so my only resort is trying to un-bend the area. I'll update the review if I get it installed and see how it performs. Just wanted to let people know that it ships bare and unprotected and might be damaged.
B00OU5LOT2|5|Love my new lights !!
B00AQKHO4Y|5|great
B0066R7FCW|3|Giving this 3 stars until I put more miles on it. The rubber bushing seems a bit cheap. The ball joint longevity will be the the basis for an update. Used this as a quick replacement for a friends vehicle. If you know what you are doing installation should take only a half hour or so. Use an impact hammer and at least a propane torch if you have any rust on that pinch bolt!
B001G7E6RO|5|Works great
B000C2QMZI|5|I was glad to find a good deal on this product couldn't find it cheaper anywhere else so i came to Amazon.com
B0018RFBJ4|5|very nice
B006K8V96A|1|I've installed 2 of these in my 73 Mustang.  The first one would fail after I had been driving for a while and the engine compartment was hot.  Amazon replaced it under warranty.  The 2nd one only lasted 3 weeks before failing.  I will not install another one of these.
B007IKOX7Q|5|Hey good on the taotao ATM 50
B000WKAWAG|5|Just what I needed!  These fit the 5/8 x 5/8 square bar with 1/4&#34; bolt mounting hole on the set of aftermarket forward controls I installed on my old Sportster.  I installed a set of Kuryakyn large pegs, and my feet love them.  Greatly reduced vibes, and my feet don't want to slip off the pegs like they did with the o-ring pegs.
B0018EO2VK|5|The shields work and look great.
B00DYTD9EI|5|I like it
B00L4TF32G|4|Good stuff for hot tub cover
B007GGJWSW|5|2005 Saturn Vue--arrived in a couple days, fit perfectly, works great, and took about 15 minutes to change out.  Can't believe I drove around 6 months with busted mirror:}
B00JY03Y8M|5|great fit
B00862215Q|4|This product is great and effective.  There is a major drawback, however.  The part bolted to the car has a section pushed in to only allow their products to fit.  This is an attempt to force you to buy their products.
B00WDVE9RO|5|Love the selection and the price.  They work great!
B00KL27PQO|5|Perfect fit for my Dodge Ram. Love the complete coverage from a product that quickly folds small enough to store out of the way.
B00MP146DE|4|They work nice but are on the tighter side.  I checked fox sizes and measured my hands.  After riding for a little bit they have stretched out and fit nicely.
B00DI3DV6G|4|Liked it and it works well
B007V2E3CG|5|Exactly what I needed and expected.  Quite pleased.
B009I6CE92|2|Rear license plate holes are too big, had to jerryrig them to stay on.
B000EQ767A|5|Doesn't slip like most belts.
B00099BJUC|2|Color comes out more baby blue than anything
B009AQS5H0|5|makes my car look like a million bucks i would recommend this to any girly girl. It is also metal, i was expecting a cheap plastic
B001JSYCDI|2|Probably made for a much bigger truck than I have.  It was way too big for my Ford Expedition EL.  A quality product, just too big.
B00K1NS0PS|5|Nice
B0009IQZPW|4|Meh, it's foam. Nothing to get excited about. I like using this better than the corner of a rag. I can force it into nooks and crannies (e.g., around the door handle) easily.
B013SK0U94|5|Very resistant. I have a jeep Sahara and the cover fits perfectly to the wheel that is in the back of the truck. The material is very resistant and it doesn't matter if rains it will get dry very quickly. I recomend it a lot
B00D1CQVIY|5|great kit fast shipping
B00SMH58RI|4|These are very bright lights indeed.  I am not sure what I can use them for as I am not law enforcement.  If you are a cop, these would make a great complement to the standard equipment. I received this at a discount in exchange for my fair review.
B008XNZZ7O|5|Excellent to toss on the shelf and forget about the foul odors, especially in a confined space!
B00PYCXMUE|5|Love it
B000HBI9YQ|3|Difficult to use per the directions.  Requires multiple coats and still didn't repair all the grid lines.
B005CWSBT8|1|Carb is leaking from bottom bowl gasket
B00JVWDWPS|5|For the price this has been awesome.  Picture shown is accurate.  It has meet and exceeded my expections.
B003SZLSM8|5|Fit great. Came on time. And even had new bulbs
B00Y0MVELS|1|Let me first just say I do not fault the distributor for this review. I gave it three stars based on the fact it isn't that good of a fit.  I put this on my 94 accord ex, sedan.  My recommendation would be to spend the extra coin and purchase legit clip on jdm visors.  I attached a picture to show that the adhesive doesn't adhere too well.  I don't think these will last a year but I had to give it a shot.  As you can see in the photo the adhesive doesn't stick too well and that is after cleaning the area with additional towelets/alcohol swabs (which were provided).  There are also gaps where it won't adhere to the window frame.  This is a flaw in the design.  I attached a picture but it show the gap very well if at all.  Another picture I attached shows how the adhesive is not very adhesive.  The first picture shows the over all appearance.  Edited as the two rear ones fell off as I suspected they would.  Do not recommend.
B000C545MC|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B0002U2V1Y|4|decent kit for the money
B001JT58OY|5|Great condition.
B0017UBHQS|5|good universal clips and really nice price.
B0040CU1JO|5|fits nice
B00E0REPQ4|4|great product...
B00EP49SIW|1|Not what is seen in pic this is what I got instead
B00LFW4FAI|1|Honestly this thing is garbage. Cant smell it when you put your nose to it. Much less freshens the car. Barely smells like mild dish detergent. Nothing Hawaiian.<br />Trash.
B000BGJWA2|1|made from very cheap plastic and flexes to easily.  The sliding gate used to close the hole where cord fits through came off on 2nd use and although u can put it back in it comes loose again, finally it fell off and i lost it
B00OS47AIY|5|Very fast shipping, packaged very neat. Smells great. I will diffently be ordering more!!
B00ED4JAIW|4|Worked perfectly!
B00SEOIW2C|5|Love them. Arrived so quickly I wasn't ready to install them
B000MUTAGS|5|I use this tool every time I install belts and it works great.
B0007D5DZC|4|These have a thick gripping surface and may not fit your filter wrench.  Otherwise, who knows how well they filter?
B0002MSY7M|5|Important part of my body work arsenal.  I only use 3M wetordry sandpaper.
B000C16XCG|5|Faster than factory item and fit perfectly.
B00KTHYCEO|5|Very satisfied!  I have a 2007 Toyota 4Runner.  Dealer wanted something crazy like $250 to replace my key fob.  This works just as well for a fraction of the cost.  Replacement has a different texture than the OEM fob, and feels a bit lighter.  But for the cost savings, it is definitely worth it.  I programmed this myself in less than 5 min by accessing the instructions on the seller's website.  I saw a few low reviews on this product, probably because those buyers did not verify this fob was compatible with their vehicle, or they were too stupid or lazy to go through the self programming process. Will definitely buy again if and when this one fails.
B005NSLDBO|4|Excellent
B008TDAJL0|5|Charges my Husqvarna garden tractor with ease. Even in the cold. Came with the adapters and battery connectors. The cable is pretty long. Nice product.
B004QHOOE6|5|These are great and well design lug nuts. Fits perfectly in my aftermarket Ray's Volk Racing rims. These lug nuts also have a very good weight to them unlike the one's you'd get for $25 - $30.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The only problem was that the paint may wear off fast. Mine started to wear off near the loser end of the lugs.
B00GHQC46E|5|great price
B00FA5ZJZQ|5|As advertised, quick shippment.
B009QLFF4U|1|It worked ok for a few weeks then it started not working correctly.  Then I dropped this piece of plastic crap and it broke!!!
B00TH1VU7K|3|Works great for me because I got a BALD head.<br />... not so well for my girlfriend, as she has hair and it is too snug around her eyes.
B002R4V1AA|5|Great bulbs great brightness. Much better than OEM. ..highly recommend these bulbs.
B0068EOX9Q|1|Cap showed up with chunks missing from threaded area. Looks like cheap material/ manufacturer defect. Company was reluctant to issue refund and waited for returned product.<br />I would think twice before installing a cheap piece of metal to my engine.
B00H03GK68|5|put it on my mail box, quality decal
B000CIQ47S|5|Emits a spark that is ignited by the air/fuel mixture from the carb.
B00JIIZCM6|1|Does not work to remove denim jean marks from my leather purses
B00OK702NO|5|Great lightbar
B002PQS9KU|5|good price
B000NVW1LM|5|I used this in a hydraulic car jack. mixed it with the hydraulic oil and it solved a leakage problem. I can noe use the jack.
B00Z709KKY|3|It was little dirty
B00OEQ3HBA|5|I was well satifide
B007XD1SJ4|5|What I expected from Mintex, fit some obsolete disc brakes.
B0083W17K4|5|Now runs like it did when it was new
B0006H938M|5|Taller, far more comfortable than the unit I removed and the flush action is quick and powerful. BTW, it was a snap to install and I'm a novice do it yourselfer.
B00MVN6V52|3|The switches work, but they are NOT LED.
B00RW7W9I0|5|Work great and seem to be of high quality
B0041UF7JY|5|Fit perfectly on my 2006 Explorer Eddie Bower edition.
B00OTK5JHG|5|Vibrates a bit in your hand. But does the job. Not quiet. But works
B000S2STJ4|5|Fit perfectly and works like new.
B00ITPK01M|5|Work great and easy to install
B000C5YCUW|5|Thank You!!! Denso👍👍👍
B000C545I6|1|the description insinuated that it came in two piece (one for each side of the car !! and instead i got 1piece! what i suppost to do ? camber one side of the vehicle!!!
B00CJCTWVU|5|Good for price
B00DOLOGC0|4|Best value. I wrapped my motorcycle exhaust. The retaining clips are terrible though!
B004DRQJBK|5|Awesome quality for aftermarket.  Nice clean wire harness with oem style bulb connectors also came with bulbs.  Nice!
B000VKPRZC|4|Great price, but have someone install it for you, bit of a pain to get to!!
B00X6DHY5W|5|Just  received them and put them in my car 💜💛💚good quality thanks prompt delivery
B007SCPH88|5|I thought they were great, my husband not so much.  I would recommend them
B000XQ9MGE|5|Have not had to use, but stays charged for at least a month and is compact and easy to store.  Glad I purchased, hope I never need to use.
B00CASDZKC|5|Just Wray we needed for the car.. Thank you
B000C9KTAK|4|worked as expected
B008XNZZ7O|5|I was very skeptical about buying these as nothing else has helped with the cigarette smoke that was coming into my apartment from the other tenants.  I'm a non smoker and the smoke smell was aggravating my allergies.  I purchased two and put one in each room, on opposite ends of my apartment and I was amazed when I came home from work the next day and there was no smoke smell!  My air cleaner (with a hepa filter) wouldn't even eliminate the smell.  Will definitely purchase again!
B00EI6CKVE|3|I love the design and all, but the actal sticker isnt very pretty on my back windshield, i can clearly see the border of the plastic and its actually quite annoying but its okay
B00KY6IHNM|5|Awesome! My husband saw mine and now he wants one too.
B0093Y3YCU|5|Used them on a winch moter.
B00386UHWY|1|Did not fit my truck?
B004OCM0C6|5|works great fast install
B00QMNW7H8|5|Easy to put on and worked great.
B00HFE5ALS|5|Arrived quickly and quality is good. The decal is extremely sticky to the point once its stuck you can't reapply like other vinyl. Luckily i had it in place and was able to make a small correction. Other than my almost screw up on installation it is great. Everything released from the backer great and decal looks awesome.
B007OX5YNE|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00BD8MSRG|3|It filters oil (I hope) and it fits the car.
B00WXBYYR4|5|exellent value
B000HNAA8W|5|Worked as advertised
B00K8VQE7Y|5|This has a very vivid, quality image and it really does help a ton at keeping the sun from turning our black vehicle into an oven in the Texas summer. Once when it was raining and muddy outside, I dropped it and the bottom got mud all over it. A simple rinse in the shower and all the mud was gone, and it dried up beautifully just laying out on the counter. I believe it will last for a very long time.
B00NH1FMY8|5|OEM quality, exact same reference and manufacturer as the original BMW belt.
B001O2T43M|5|Good set for any mobile job, would've loved a guitar pick.<br /><br />Not a crazy idea to include a pouche to keep tools away.
B0087Q2RIW|4|works great
B003L9K9HQ|5|really great product
B00AMPHDJY|4|Fit perfectly
B000F3RYGA|5|Great lock for my teardrop camper.  Seems pretty secure.  Easy to use.
B00E7WEFQ2|1|They came off 1st time I rode my bike
B0086I9I5Q|4|stylish
B013AGP500|5|[[VIDEOID:9ba47f35a3076dc43ad96fa1ab1adf80]] Check out my vide review of the Dry Rite Heavy Weight Microfiber cloths.<br /><br />These cleaning/drying cloths are perfect for a variety of household tasks, including automobile cleaning and drying. When I received this, I immediately noticed how soft and plush they are. The have microfiber on both sides. One side is very plush with a high pile, the other side has a lower pile. They both work very well at cleaning and drying just about ANY surface. They also have a satin basting around all of the edges that makes them very durable, ESPECIALLY for auto detailing!<br /><br />I immediately decided to wash my car with these cloths. I used one during the washing and one for drying. These worked perfectly to get my car looking SPOTLESS with very little scrubbing!<br />Overall, I think this is an excellent product for any type of cleaning! I love these cloths!<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion.
B00K2DVR6Q|5|take awhile to revieve it but its worth it
B003RW29FW|5|works good and is easy to apply
B008TT0DG0|5|Good product, recommend
B000S2QMES|5|Direct fit and works like a charm.  Can't complain with using direct replacement GM parts!
B00DTU95Y0|5|Good product, recommend
B005DUMUIW|5|The video demo of this product was good enough to buy it. When I used it I was quite impressed. I got a used Honda Shadow, 1997, spokes never been cleaned. I used the Newspoke twice on the spokes and each time rinsed with a power washer. They are now nice and bright. I recommend this to anyone with dirty spokes. I don't have a before pic, but here is an after.
B005DPNUZ4|5|Comfortable fit. No &#34;mushroom head&#34;. Color is a perfect match to my Honda Grom.
B00APOFQYQ|5|Easy to install and matches perfectly.
B00P67GT7K|5|Use with D/A on my two vehicles to bring out the best in their paint.
B000GKIDGM|2|I was disappointed with this product.  Bussmann is normally excellent quality however the design of the jaws of the puller is too wide to attach to install fuses to pull.  also the back end of the tester is too wide to allow the jaws to reach the install fuse to pull it out.  Will not work on autos or other areas with fuse boxes that are normally in autos. Would not recommend this product
B000C2Y4HQ|5|works perfect
B001Q4XIJY|2|This thing falls off all the time.
B00QMWQJRS|4|The fit isn't exact for my CRV (on the driver side),but it's safe  and looks good.  For the price, it does the job.
B00G620ZVU|5|boom boom on come the lights. put them on my 4x4 Gator and they really light up the night
B00GOXW7K8|5|Excelent price and fast shipping very satisfied with this ourcase
B00HDERBLC|4|I purchased this inverter in June 2014 as an emergency power source for lights and such.  Never needed it until now still in the Amazon box.  I wanted to run an electric drill from my pickup or tractor battery.  The drill pulls 3 amps which should be no problem.  It does not work, it only &#34;pulses&#34;, I tried another drill and vacuum cleaner with no luck.  I checked the output of the inverter with a meter and it registers 120+_  volts but the power seems to surge...the vacuum cleaner goes &#34;Wa&#34; silence &#34;wa&#34; silence, etc.  Tried different batteries including a freshly charged battery from my boat.  Since it has been over a year since I bought the bloody thing, there is little or no chance of replacing it!  I recommend spending a little more and getting a more quality made device.  After posting this review the seller responded and has sent a replacement which I will try as soon as received and will update this review.  I can say that the seller exhibited extraordinary concern and the customer service is superb!  Will comment on the product as soon as it arrives.  OK, I quickly received a replacement and tested it with the drills and vaccum cleaner with excelent results.  If the first device had performed as well, I would have given a rave review.  It was almost as if the AC current was running at other than 60 Cycles.
B00D8YKIN4|5|Exact fit works great
B00N3VYMJ8|5|Very nice. The material is smooth to touch and the grip is great
B0097W98W8|5|Installed in 20 minutes!<br /><br />Works just like original.<br /><br />Just remove the screw in the bottom of the door grip, then gently pop the door covering off (do it in warm weather so the plastic clips don't snap), then squeeze the clips on the connectors (2 for the switch, one for mirror control if installed, and one for the door locks.<br /><br />Need to insert some putty knives/screwdrivers/whatever so you can release the snap clips and push the switch out.  then just pop the switch in, hook up the connectors, snap the door cover back in place and replace the screw in the bottom of the door grip.
B00062YIDM|5|Works great.
B009LOO1DS|5|Works ok. It could be held up tighter where it hooks in. It's a little loose there.
B00C7XZJFO|4|Inexpensive replacement compared to the OEM shield.  This part doesn't come with the clip bolts that attach to the front bumper, so make sure you save the clips if you still have them.
B007TYPZNW|5|Fit perfectly.
B004HCM9H4|5|I was trying to decide between traditional carnauba wax and a synthetic wax. I decided on this wax because of the better protection and longevity that synthetics offer. My first application I allowed the wax to sit for approximately 5 minutes before buffing off, but next time I am going to try leaving it for longer to see if the results change. My primary goal is to protect my paint and clear coat for as long as possible and also provide a great look. I've only used this product once, but it seems to do the trick
B001G6GYBQ|5|Quality Japan product, used on 2.7l 96 tacoma, it's been over 6 months no leaks, comes with the screw washer seals too! Definitely a good buy.
B0125PHYJ2|5|Lightweight and easy to store.  I had a single ramp for my motos for years.  always a 50/50 chance I'd make it in my truck bed OR take a digger halfway up.  NOW, I put these two ramps together and presto!  No diggers.  No slipping when its wet either.  I have two options when their together: tie one of the straps around both of them and then hook it on my tow hitch. Or, buy a couple U-bolts and U-bolt them together.  All my moto buddy's always want to borrow one of the ramps (so they have two) to make it easier loading/unloading.
B00HFA4MW0|5|Very cute. Looks just like the pix
B00V6WXX50|5|This is the best battery I bought so far, thanks, nice battery.
B00LPP46GI|4|Super nice cover.  I love the colors and the materials.  It looks great on the car.  The only reason I'm not rating it at 5 stars is that the fit is not quite as snug/tight as I would like, and I have a ZO6, which is 3&#34; wider than a standard Vette.  To me, it would be too loose on a standard Corvette, but that's just speculation.
B000BRMYN8|4|Good product. Need to duct tape it to the floor.
B00JTTQV06|2|Everything works, but the build quality is very low
B00JHEG85Q|1|This is a horrible product not only do they not work they don't fit.
B009XIW2G0|5|I noticed an immediate change in performance on my Fatboy Lo. Though this air intake was a lot smaller than I expected. Even my Sportster 1200 intake (similar style, different brand) was larger. But it does look cool. I will be receiving my Power Vision soon to tune my bike and will post an update if needed.
B000C5H2ZE|5|works great
B00M0CQD9S|5|Just like most people have said, it fits good and looks good. I paid three times as much for a complete chrome assembly and I sent it back...did not look half as good!
B000ZAWWTM|5|Nice
B002XM59F4|5|Great product, work perfectly for my curtains in my RV!
B0101SLT5U|5|I totally love this! it really adds that extra sparkle and now matches my steering wheel perfectly. It fits well around the ignition of my 2014 Jeep Compass (: I'm even thinking of adding another somewhere else in my jeep. I just love the bling bling! I definitely recommend this item as it is so cute!
B008Y3OBG4|4|fits & works good
B00G6FDT7E|5|Fixed the AC in my 2008 Tacoma.
B0053TR7B8|4|Ordering a new one, after 17 months of it reliably doing its job. It did far better than some of my snowmobile batteries, in that I got two summers out of it. It never saw a charger, and until the last week or so, was very reliable. I'd hoped it just needed a charge, but it seems to be done. It is well worth the money!
B004GZSHSC|5|awesome!
B0040CVOZ4|5|fits nicely.
B000ZMYJJ6|5|worked fine -great price
B0040CX0SS|5|fits nice.
B00CMR79H6|5|Perfect fit. Just what I was looking for.
B00XBUK19Q|5|My stickers got here 2 weeks earlier than expected! I loved them! They are so random so not all were a good fit for me, but the stickers are fun and durable. I totally recommend!
B005BB84R4|5|held up perfect
B0009IQXCM|5|Bought this to wax my '14 Jeep Wrangler.  Comes with an application pad in the twist off lid.  The wax itself smells really nice and applies best thinly.  I have found that the wax buffs off best if I apply it on my whole Jeep body and then go back to the starting point to buff off.  It needs a little bit of time to dry.  TIP:  If you get this wax on any black plastic on your vehicle it leaves a white residue that doesn't wipe off.  I do this every time no matter how careful I am.  To remove white residue: take peanut butter (creamy is best) and an old toothbrush and apply to residue.  Wipe off peanut butter with a cloth.  White residue is gone!
B0015SCLNA|5|Love it! Used on our quad, dirt bikes and cars. Shiny shiny shiny!
B00BL7ZRAO|5|Sizes run small
B0052XFWCG|5|Great stuff! My 6.0 use to smoke on start up. After about 500 miles no smoke and runs like new again!
B004JO7PA6|5|The mats are good quality, and met expectations.  However,  I assumed that when I ordered them for a 2015 Touareg that they would fit my vehicle.  The mats themselves fit perfectly, but the holes for the fasteners do not match the hooks on my floorboard.  Was too much trouble to return so I am using them anyway.
B003XWXW7K|5|I got this really quickly!  It's increased the curb appeal of my car too.  It was as easy to install as the factory cover & looks and works better!
B00JNEAQIA|5|Nice product. Would buy again
B002OR41UM|5|Easy to install and definitly controls charge rate better than prior to installation. Dont have to add as much water to house batteries as before.
B0002UQAY8|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B00W4IDIGE|5|same as pic
B007JMOTJK|5|Fits my 9000lb Badlands winch perfectly.Hugs my winch well. I added zip ties on ends for HWY use for just in case. No problems. like a canvas water proof.But I sprayed more water proof liquid on just for more water protection. Would by again if available.I m thinking on buying another one soon as a back up.
B003VLBPJA|2|This thing was mint... until after about 2 months of daily use. I use this on top of  2 bungees to strap down my lunch bag for my daily ~60 mile commute. Also on occasion for an extra safety measure when transporting 12 packs of beer. Well as of right now this thing is stretched the F out and there's no saving it. It has lost its elasticity. It was $2 shipped from China which took like a month, so I guess you get what you pay for?
B000CO8RVS|5|arrived quickly just as advertised
B000BRJVUW|5|I built wall light boxes, with frosted glass 'bottoms', using LED strips, powered off of solar.  These switches were perfect to mount on the end of the light boxes.<br /><br />Great for 12v solar projects.  I have ordered to twice (multiple switches per order).
B00FC22PVS|5|very pleased, bery bright, look good easy install
B00OZ0P5MO|5|I had it installed and it works great!
B00E9SLL8Y|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B005N53AM2|4|There was a smell, but it was not anything that didn't fade in a few days. So if you're hesitant of not buying it because of the smell, just buy it!! Although, It was SUPER hard for me to put it on the wheel, but I had my mom help me and we applied it in no time! Have a friend help you!! It's super comfortable, and easy to grip. I LOOOVE spotting my car in a parking lot and to see the pattern!! ☺️
B00FOG9S4E|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00KE8LSPE|5|Very satisfied with the product
B00EPDL42Q|3|Made to fit smaller size car seats such as sports cars and subcompact vehicles. Pay particular attention to your headrest design and seat width or this will not fit. Most SUVs are out of the question for a proper fit. The logo is nice and the upper part (back rest) material is durable, however the bottom (seat) is like a rayon material and may struggle over time to not tear. The seams can be easily over stressed if stretched too much in an attempt to fit over a larger seat.
B004WNZ4FM|5|Man these leds are awesome.  Hooked them up to my f350 grille.  They are holding up nicely.  They still work even though they been through a pretty bad storm, and a flood.  The only thing i dont like is the double sided tape it comes with.  I replaced it with a heavy duty double sided tape.  Things are bright compared to other leds i have seen.
B005LD3QFC|3|Very wide angel makes for small image.
B0009I2OPM|3|Wrong wiring plug for my car.
B002KS6LLW|5|GREAT
B00KTIVHLY|2|These remotes work great!  Programmed easily with no problems.  Range is very adequate as well. Pleased with this purchase!  UPDATE:  After having used these regularly I have to knock my rating down!  The range is not very good and they are unreliable in getting the passenger door to unlock (second press).  The OEM is night and day better and I can't recommend saving a few bucks for these when they are not fault free.
B00S0I613Y|5|This is the best spray paint that I have ever used so far, It is well mixed and lays down smoothly. No runs and can be sanded to a professional finish.
B008T4YOSS|5|Better that I was expecting,thanks.
B004EDFF90|5|Came rather quickly and I'm very satisfied with it
B0013LJ1L4|5|I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but feel I had to offer a review, nonetheless.  I decided to change out this component when I replaced my clutch cable on my 2011, Harley Davidson, Road Glide.  After much research, I decided on this Muller Power Clutch.  All I can say is, this is one of the best changes I ever made to my bike.  I really had no problems with the stock set-up, but who wouldn't want an easier clutch pull?<br /><br />Installation was straight forward and especially easy if you are changing your cable anyway.  Just make sure you follow the installation instructions included, especially the part about adjustment.  For my particular application, the service manual says to turn the adjusting screw clockwise until you feel it noticeably bottoming out and then back off (counter clockwise) 1/2 to 1 full revolution.  The directions for the power clutch says to back it of 1/8th of a turn, I went 1/4 and it is perfect.  It goes into neutral easily and the 'friction zone' starts at about 1 to 1.5 inches from the bar.<br /><br />If you are looking for easier clutch pull for those days where shifting typically breaks your hands and fingers, this is what you are looking for.  I would say that it is better than 40% easier than the product claims.  I have never ridden a bike with a hydraulic clutch, but I can't imagine it being much easier.
B003DNJ728|3|Average quality
B008JYXYNY|2|This could not hold the seat belt in place -- too much seatbelt tension and this is too weak.
B000WJA5ZY|5|Typical RAM product.  It gets the job done.
B001PL7ZA6|5|It costs a bit more than the cut-yourself bubble looking ones but I'm glad i did. Thick, quality made, perfect tight fit and it works VERY well. Temperature in the truck is at least 15-20 degrees lower with this in place, and my dash is protected.
B00GVUG2SM|1|So far off, don't even waster your time. Mind has original paint, has been garaged everyday of it's life, and waxed every week or two since my dad bought it brand new in 1989. I take even better care of it.<br /><br />Glad I tested this first..... Not even in a same league and I was only planning to use it on lower balance but it would have stood out like a sore thumb. If your current paint color is best described as &#34;multi,&#34; this may be decent option to make the scrap yard fender almost match.<br /><br />But if your over all paint is a C-, stay away from this.<br /><br />BavarianAutoWorks has FAR better alternatives.
B00NQ6GE1Y|4|Smells great. 3 stars because Smell only lasts 3 days.
B00TEF4ZZI|5|Just what i expected.
B007OWVWDQ|5|Put it on my truck 2 years ago, still hasn't peeled or faded
B000F0ZEQA|2|Does not fit very well near ac vents. You get what you pay for. But better than looking at a cracked dash that dodge should of had a recall on. Big f/u to dodge for selling crap. Every dash made in 2001 ram was junk
B003UNDQQE|5|Hard to put on
B001OBECXU|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B00SM8R04Q|1|The description IMPLIES that it will work as a Bluetooth ELM327 adapter to OBD2. You state clearly that it will not work with Apple. What you FAILED to describe is this does NOT work with ANDROID either!  I should have tried it when I received it, but was not in a hurry. Now it is too late to return. It is a useless paperweight, now! AS I look at the description now, it does state Windows, but does not include ANDROID!  IF you expect to use this with ANDROID phones, or ANY phone, DO NOT BUY THIS!
B000C54388|5|Good product and worked well with no problems.
B00C5RHTG4|4|It does what it is supposed to do.
B00EXIEVO6|5|Works great,
B004BR5T8G|5|The feel of this clutch is amazing! Engagement is perfect and predictable. is doing a great job of holding 550BHP with no slippage under hard shifts. I put this in after a disappointing centerforce DFX chattered badly, was as on/off as a light switch and squealed on take-off. ACT was recommended by multiple racers and race shops at my local racetrack (Sears Point Raceway, or whatever they call it these days...) Just buy it, you wont regret it! Please click the helpful button if you found this review informative and helpful. Thanks!
B00LPJSOKS|5|Exact fit
B00891EDCS|5|Look great
B00S05MSRK|4|Works great for all of my work equipment!
B009S7I96I|5|Perfect replacement!! Highly recommend.
B001KQAAAS|5|part was the perfect fit and arrived in a timely manner!
B00FFYM464|2|These look cute but don's smell at all
B00SZAFULQ|5|They are easy to install, no mess at all, nice product. I hope this will prevent my wheels to be stolen!
B002ONTBMO|3|Its a sticker and it worked just fine
B00GI9NP0O|4|Fast shipping.  Genuine Honda product . Less than1/2 price of any dealership I called. Fit and function ok.
B00873J0YY|5|Just what I wanted
B00YI3IGA6|4|No complains this far, it doesn't fit as well on highlanders but it worked great for the RAV4
B000C9426W|5|The items that arrived is as described.
B005JPJJ1M|4|Works for what I needed.
B001OBJ14K|3|One was new and in a sealed bag.  The other was not sealed and had small spots of rust all over it.  For the price, it was acceptable to me.  It didn't appear to be warped, only lightly rusted.  I assume it may have been a returned product.
B002EZZ8Z6|5|It is amazing how when you put a glass case on top of one of these things, it STAY'S right there on the dashboard, even while driving and coming to sudden stops!
B003P64XU4|2|Very disappointing. Cheap. The base is not even a flange (buy a funnel at K-Mart same thing) so doesn't seal well to roof, and too small.  Why remove a good high quality plastic RV vent cover from the manufacturer to put this crap on? Look for another manufacturer, not Camco.  It does swivel in the wind just like a kids pinwheel.
B00FASX8FG|4|Perfect fit - and somewhat easy to install.  I would have liked for it to be a bit more pliable and just a bit larger.  Adds a small amount of protection, so that is good ... not great.  Fits so well that you cannot tell that it was an aftermarket addition.
B00895BT3U|3|like the look but it sings at 45mph and above. what i mean by sings, is a high frequency sound
B00X35L3IW|5|holds my set perfectly
B00NFSNAS8|5|Works great 12 volt and 110 volt ,and appears powerful enough to inflate a car tire if low on air in no time , nice nylon carry case in which you can store in the trunk of you vehicle and doesn't take up a lot of space and has a easy to read psi gage !!!!!
B002OUMVWY|5|Easy to run clean, compresses to easily store in bumper. No blue hands!!
B00CEX45O8|5|Looks great, You can't really tell that this is a cheaper version of the louvers, Great quality and very fast shipping!
B000CSGWZC|5|well done.  Arrived as advertised
B008B897CK|1|The screws don fit!!!
B008YNCIN2|5|Have this as a gift! He loved it
B00GOY3F1W|5|excellent
B005FOMYIM|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00ISA3LA0|5|Fits my '93 Wrangler like a glove.  Instructions say you have to drill but all the holes matched up on mine.  Took longer to remove my old rusted bolts than it did to bolt this baby on.  Only negative is my new black bumper doesn't match my beat exterior.  But i will fix that with some mud and snow.
B00TAESFXQ|5|Worked like a champ.  corrected all my issues with this one part.
B00BT0Y1NM|4|Used in bedside sconce lights in motorhome.  Nice white light great for reading and no more heat being generated by the incandescent lamps. Bulb is twice as long as the 921 bulb it replaces so make sure you have room.
B004IL96U2|5|Looks great on my son's truck!
B008JYXYNY|2|Kept coming apart.  Would not recommend.
B00D7TD7VU|5|Legal in my state, but against my university's rules. Keep that in mind before buying!
B001KQDV72|5|Had a leak and swapped it out. Works good so far! :)
B002LGTDAY|5|Stopped handle bars rattling.
B00I0L81UC|5|love it
B000C5BODA|5|Received the Motorcraft OEM part in perfect packaging with the instructions. Installation was a breeze and I saved a fortune buying this versus the &#34;non severe duty&#34; airbox.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Awesome lights that worked just as expected for my mower.  I'll attach some photos.  They have to be wired in parallel - I found a wiring diagram on the internet that showed them wired in series and they do not work like that.  I bought a simple wiring harness for $10 from a local farm supply store that had a switch, fuse and clamps for the battery.  I zip-tied the cables in place and off I went mowing until 9:15 tonight!  Yayyyyyy!
B00II8HCZC|5|Easy to install and really looks great
B007DKQ0EA|5|fit my 2008 elantra injectors. order another set for the other end of the injectors. one injector = 2 rings.
B01328OJAI|5|WOrked great
B0000AUSEW|5|Took it camping and it worked great. Will defiantly be using it again.
B011MYS34W|4|I like it it is a great birthday present it was late by 3 days but the company made it up
B00VZP1IXW|5|Great product.  A must have item in every vehicle.  Flares are not cheaply made and can be used in a variety of ways during an emergency.  The magnetic end piece allows you to attach directly to the car/truck.
B00G4YM13K|4|They work perfectly but like all screws they can loosen up so just a periodical check does good.
B00NPYXAWS|5|I haven't had to test this out yet, thankfully. But I'm relieved to know that if I'm ever in a situation where I need to break my own car window or cut my seatbelt to get to safety, I have a reliable tool to do so. Hopefully I never need to use this.
B006JXSVO4|5|worked great as expected
B00IEYDSHQ|5|Good price. Quick delivery.
B008Y841Y6|5|Yup its a locker...says FORD...does what its supposed to
B007ECE1FM|5|Great quality
B00T8DSA6Q|5|Perfect - mounts easily, stays put and is very comfortable
B000NC0SA2|3|They're OK.
B004PQ13WE|5|Working great.  Just what I ordered.  Breathing new life into a 30 year old sports car.
B004PHDWMM|5|Nice and easy to stash away. I hope I never have to test how well it works.  EDIT: Unfortunately, I did have the opportunity to test this out. Very easy to get the tab off, and sprays just as easily as a can of wasp spray. Sprayed a good 5-6ft. Wasn't enough to put out the fire (through no fault of this product, took the fire company 1/2hr and over 2000 gallons of water).  It would have more than been enough had it been a small kitchen fire, and not a fully engulfed Ford minivan.
B004HMBK5G|5|Best money I've ever spent. FINALLY gets that dang seatbelt off my neck! If you're short, you need these. Now I just need all my friends to install them in their cars...
B00852684M|5|looks great at night can be seen for a long ways away
B001C4SL3G|4|Typical K&N
B009J6AAGU|5|These work very well to Eliminate any type of foul odors. But beware: they are very powerful!!
B00TI9OFFU|5|Leader Accessories X-plus car cover arrived today and I just finished installing it on my 2013 Chrysler 300c. It fit perfectly! Thank you for prompt delivery and a good quality product! Now my baby is protected from tree leaves dust and bird droppings while I and my girlfriend go on vacation. Hers, the Leader Accessories Large, came in today as well and fit her 2011 Hyundai Sonata flawlessly. She is so happy!! This is the start of a wonderful trip!:)
B00TEA14ZW|5|Perfect fit
B00E9FS3VU|5|Product as described.  Fast shipment. Easily installed.
B007VG9E9Y|5|trouble free
B00G1BXINI|1|Highly fashionable however small Allen wrench bolts did not fit into the product so it deos not serve as a protectant from theft rather just a visual enhancement
B00QI6RRQU|3|This is a universal bracket plate with arms welded on to fit the floor pan of your Z33.  The mounting holes lined up perfectly (floor to bracket).<br /><br />WARNING - the passengers bracket sits higher than the drivers side.  This is because it is a universal bracket with mounting arms welded on in correct location with correct angles.  I am going to take it to a metal fabricator and get them to tweak it with a few cuts and reweld.<br /><br />Aside from that, the coating was fine but overall weight and design was heavy compared to others I've seen.<br /><br />It wasn't packaged that well but that's ok because it's solid metal and it arrived on time.
B0009IQZH0|5|super absorbent
B00684TAYY|5|Good remote
B00803BCUG|3|I would have preferred to email this vendor privately hoping they would rectify this situation. First, these are PLASTIC. That being said, one of them had a broken &#34;tab&#34; right out of the box. The tab holds the wire ring onto the cover. So I'm worried because this ONE does not seem as TIGHT to the wheel as the others.<br /><br />They look cool, but I wish I could get a replacement one for the one that came broken.
B000VVW984|5|Very easy install.  My 8 year old actually installed it.  I was just there to &#34;supervise&#34;
B001445IZ8|5|I have used it twice to change the transmission fluid on my Mazda 5.  Instructions are very clear.  The pump worked perfectly both times and extracted 3 quarts of tranny fluid in about 3-4 minutes.  There was no mess.  I measured the extracted tranny fluid by pouring it into 2 different<br />2 1/4 quart containers that I had purchased in my local hardware store's paint department.  The side of the containers were clearly marked in ounces and quarts and I didn't need to use a funnel when pouring the tranny fluid from the blue container.  After refilling my transmission, I used the funnel to pour the old fluid into the empty tranny fluid containers and then recycled it at Autozone.<br /><br />I also extracted a few ounces of power steering fluid from the power steering reservoir and refilled that too.<br /><br />Cleanup was easy.  Took about 45 minutes from start to finish.  Everything  is airing out now in my backyard.<br /><br />BTW, after driving with the fresh tranny fluid for 400 miles, I repeated the process.  I will probably change it again in 15,000 miles.
B003VASDL4|4|Screen is nice. It is a full ten feet in width and my Care free awning is ten feet to the outside of the roller. I had to cut about four inches off screen and stitch a new seam on it.
B000CPIJFG|5|Good price. Worked for my oil cooler.
B00HDTFDNK|5|This worked as great replacements for the ones the broke off my oil filter relocation kit for my 97 eclipse
B007ZGBLNW|5|works perfect!!!
B003AV69W4|5|Quiet and stops quickly
B0039XSROG|1|2 of the 4 rachets fell apart before I could even use them. The other 2,  I got one use out of before falling to pieces.  Straps themselves are thin and cheap.  Someone could offer me a new set of 4 for a nickel and I'd tell them to go f**** themselves...
B00AQZB9FO|4|Good product
B008HIT2ZG|3|Well not much to say its a sticker and it works, thought it would be bigger, but it does the job by my camera.
B004LY5W2M|5|Highly recommended if using POR-15 to paint an area.
B0044AVL8W|5|Excellent product.
B00SGLYO7U|5|Great levers for the price. Make sure you get the proper style for your machine. I have a 2000 Triumph Tiger and had to swap the clutch-mounting piece because the mounting and cable holes were reversed.<br />The company was more than happy to send me the appropriate piece free of charge. A+ customer service.
B00B0QWXW6|4|thanks
B0035HAS6G|5|Perfect fit open end grips here. Dual compound & nice KTM logo design. I'm expecting these to last a long time.
B003FVFV46|1|Every time u get of your seats, the covers come off with you
B005NLQAHS|5|This helped me track down EVERY issue to fix my vehicle for emissions inspection
B00LBEUY1O|5|Fast delivery, good quality.
B00S4J4U7S|4|bought these for my 2012 Tacoma. the width was goo but had to trim some off the length to fit opening in console. only complaint so far is the light symbol is painted on cheaply and has already worn partially off. does not come with wiring diagram that was a little frustrating. easiest way to do this is to place the positive and switched wire on one side of switch(four terminals) and the ground on the opposite side next to the switched lead
B00IX5MOD0|5|super dope....received so many compliments and everyone wants to know where I got them from. Very bright in the evenings.
B00LGJ7TLC|4|My son gear shifter got too hot. Since he did not want it on the shifter all the time, he cut off the narrow section so he can slip on and off easily.
B00IQXKB4I|1|BEEN WEARING XXL ON EVERYTHING. MOST OF THE TIME CLOTHES WEAR BIG, BUT THIS VEST IS SMALL IN SIZE! JUST ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN OR EXCHANGE! I WOULD ORDER AT LEAST 1 SIZE BIG IF YOU ORDER THIS PRODUCT! LET THE BUYER BEWARE!
B002NETMZU|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B001U522GO|5|It's a real branded Gamma Seal lid, a pretty thick plastic bucket that just a little shorter than the standard 5 gallon and a HUGE wooly washer. The citrus car wash smells awesome. One thing I have to give Chemical Guys is you don't smell like a a chemical after detailing your car. You'll probably smell like lemons and bubble gum. Thanks again Chemical Guys.
B009NLL6G4|5|These are working great on my 2012 Pilot
B004RDONIQ|4|it works well
B004I0PHBK|1|Not a proper fit for my truck gmc2500 HD I had to cut and drill get different screws to make it work and then I got water leaks that I had to silicone all the way around<br />I should stick with original parts but that's what you get when you buy cheap
B000C55O2C|5|Perfect for what I need.
B000NUBH22|5|Good value per unit volume.  This type of anti-seize is invaluable for certain applications.
B0049TUI6E|5|great job
B00B62LXO8|5|Bought a new Honda Civic and was worried about getting my trunk dirty so ordered this cargo liner.<br /><br />I was not sure how this compares with the OEM honda cargo liner but thought since this is Weathertech's bread and butter, it must be good. Plus I liked the styling.<br /><br />Must say, I am very happy with my purchase so far.<br /><br />Only think I will say is that it had some minor scratched when it came in. Nothing too much to worry about tough.
B00H9KHA4S|5|This shade is a life saver.  I had searched high and low for the perfect sun shade for my Honda Odyssey.  The search is over, this baby fits like a glove in the Odysseys huge windshield.  I absolutely love it.  Easy to put in and take out.  It rolls up nice and I can store it in the back when not in use. I highly recommend this for any Odyssey owner, you won't be disappointed.
B000LC87V6|5|Fit perfectly, looks great
B0074MNHSO|5|Exactly what I needed.<br />Quick ship!<br />Even came with a good fuse.<br />Thanks!
B00HZU42Z2|5|Works as you'd expect it to.
B00KLK0QUS|5|wife loves it. works just like the OEM ones.
B004GEYF9I|1|The plastic around where the bulb goes was cracked and fell apart when installing and thus the entire headlamp was useless.
B007DJ1RR6|5|Been on my cars rear window for a while now. Looks awesome. Good quality.
B00LUUK2KC|5|Used it when installing aftermarket fog lights work great love it
B007R4VCWM|5|Very nice key chain for your pony's key! Seems to be well made. I did read a review who said the screw on the back fell out. I haven't had that issue but may put a drop of super glue on it to make sure it stays put. But all in all, I highly recommend this key chain & the red is a very nice looking red. I also purchased a pink one so I can keep track of which key goes to which Mustang, it's really nice looking also (& I'm not a lover of pink).
B003L7T57S|5|Everything the reviews say about this stuff is true.  Just get it.
B00BQ257FY|4|Bar and  shield is nice and  the chain and  link is holding up compare to Eagle HD chian I had order.
B00B62LWMG|2|So... It does fit behind the second row of the 2013-2014 Nissan Pathfinder.<br />That's the only thing that's right about this product.<br />Otherwise, it's hard, the margins don't get to stay all the way down (which is annoying, something will always fall under the liner).<br />If you have something heavier on it, for example a big cooler with stuff in it, it will slide with the cooler on it.<br />I got it on the 10th of August and I had it in my car the next day. I really hoped it would get straightened in time. It never happened.<br />No, I don't like it and I don't want it.<br />Probably if it would have rubber in it's composition it would fit even better and it would worked better.
B0081ZYPLG|5|Perfect
B001E1OJ4W|5|good quality and good price
B000ER47ZS|3|Product exactly as advertised. Thank you very much. You could improve product by making it magnetic - I don't want to use the adhesive tape provided on my car!
B0009H51WQ|5|Fantastic delivery service and high quality product.
B009IE2JTE|5|Always buy the correct trans fluid for your vehicle and never let someone sell you some fluid that's &#34;for all cars&#34;. This went into a 1998 chevy with 125k I did the filter and all 13 and some odd quarts and you will notice an improvement in performance and fuel economy. This fluid is top notch for your gm don't waste more money on acdelco brand at the dealer this stuff is way better. If you plan on keeping your car buy the good stuff.
B00004SQK3|4|Of course, ever since I bought them I have not had to use them. But they seem ok.
B00HHNRPWY|5|very nice. fits good, looks good.
B00B8Z5G82|3|had dent's when i got it
B002R0NJBI|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B000CIY1BO|3|This is a great tank, however Amazon said it would fit my 2011 For F250 and it does not!!! I checked Dee Zee's web site and they do not recommend it for the Ford 250.  If it wasn't so large I would return it.  It is a nice tank and I will use 2x4's to get it to fit.  First time Amazon has steered me wrong they need to check fit information before listing it as a &#34;fit&#34;
B002VI2YG2|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B00MJ43ZQG|2|Not what I was expecting honestly. Kinda disappointed, the front two aren't even the right fit. They're a little too big but they look good.
B005FI5BBA|5|Cool product
B0009V1WS4|5|No one is stealing my trailer hitch cover with this lock.
B0098B6ZQK|5|Cool product, fits perfectly to the key and keeps it safe
B00684TIVE|5|Easy to program with included manual.
B005UQQ74C|5|Better than expected
B001J0RJJU|1|it was what we were looking for but after the 2nd ride with it on our bike the flag came off the pole now I have to figure out how to put it back on the pole and make it stay on was hoping it was going to last longer then this  flag already starting to fray also
B00MEVPQLG|1|Returned. Deemed unsafe by my mechanic. Replaced with Weiyi model 600a with all safety features.
B010R0MBX6|4|I got the Matt black &#34;Scallop&#34;...fast delivery and in good shape...have not applied yet.They list it for the 2011-2013 Charger because of the &#34;indent&#34; in the door...don't care gonna stick it on my '06 &#34;slab-side&#34; look doors...should give it that &#34;update&#34; look!!Matt black matches my spoiler/hood scoop....and &#34;Batman&#34; emblems!!!(Going for the Lebra front cover and rear window &#34;spoiler&#34; too.)OK got that &#34;C-stripe&#34; on there...used the wet method worked out pretty good..strip looks GREAT!!
B004IV8NBU|1|These doesn't work at all really disappointments I don't hear nothing
B00GJJNQB6|5|This is a quality PCV valve.  The body is metal and circular, it fits into a round hole.  It's pretty simple so I don't have much more to add.
B00ASN0EZK|5|Good quality, reasonable price. I recommended
B00YEIWSI6|2|The product looks good and it is in brand new condition....but it didn't fit my car even though the specifications included my car's model and year!
B00OPYP6YW|4|The console  broke off  2x since I had the car and both times I took the car to the dealership .. where else could I get the part? ...paid over $150 for it each time.  It's not like I was &#34;rough&#34; with my console.  Just perhaps made to break easily so one has to get robbed at the dealership? I suffered thru having it not there for the 3x it broke as it just wasn't worth it until I found this on Amazon. Since gray wasn't available I got the black one but it still fit my Jetta.  I do have to pull up on it once or twice before it opens but it is better than paying hundreds of dollars for a replacement (again) or having no console at all.
B006LVY22E|5|Matches OEM,
B007V5BL96|3|THIS DOES NOT FIT 2004 HIGHLANDERS AS AMAZON SAYS IT DOES. The receiver is well made, but the packaging was an embarrassment - not at all protected in shipping, so it came with lots of scratches and chipped paint. It was certainly usable, but did not fit my car. My suggestion would be that if you are looking to install a hitch for your vehicle, go to a specialty website to check for size and price first. I ended up exchanging this for a Curt receiver that came in a much nicer package and was in better condition. It was also a significant savings over list price.
B0028JQYPG|5|Quality jacks for home use. Not sure I would use these everyday, but for weekend projects, they are perfect.
B00GRISB78|1|Half of the LEDs blew out or became disconnected from the circuit first time I used this.The LEDs are not very secure inside the housing and I do not suggest this at all for vehicle use. Perhaps it would make a good stationary work light but not for vehicles like the listing suggests.
B004MDCTCS|5|Product as described, it was packaged appropriately and arrived on time.
B0053H8MKK|5|it's been running strong for a month and holding voltage
B000NJSGV8|3|Ordered these boots in the size I wear with all of my shoes and boots, but they were at least a size too small. Tried wearing them one day, but they were killing my toes. I couldn't wait to get them off. Should've been a size 10, but they were at least a half size too small.
B00EA2DMJK|5|Looks and works great.
B007OW6MD6|5|nice
B000ALBROC|5|Easy to install and works great
B000C9S7E0|4|Ordered a bunch of AC Delco Pro. Replacement Parts for my steering system. All work well, seem sturdy, installed properly, and have proper ball joint rubber caps. Only complaint was the factory grease- half the parts had next to jone, the other half had none. Take advantage of the grease points and push out the stock crap for some decent grease.
B00KTG4YDY|5|Fit perfect on my o4 sienna as it should since it's a toyota part... my old one was clogged up... you can't really tell if it's doing its job but it's a peace of mind knowing you changed it
B001Y8XWAW|5|perfect fit love it -------<br /><br />1997 Toyota Corolla
B0035JLODK|2|This bag is designed nicely, but needs to be made of more durable materials.  The first day I had it I went down on a rocky trail the material tore and the retaining clip pulled out!  The material is thin and not very strong.  I also had a zipper break.  I will spend more money next time and get a better bag.  One with reinforced tabs behind the buckles, Cordura material and better zippers, I like YKK.  It would probably be fine on a street bike.
B00EN280EY|5|Looks cool on my rifle case. Sticks well.
B00BK85HHM|5|Fits perfectly in my 2009 Murano
B0002NIL74|5|well m ade and very sturdy
B00KBQB1OM|3|I wish I could adjusted the volume on the horn
B004I18GGW|5|Actually fit pretty good! Couldn't tell the difference between this one and factory only that this one looks clearer (other one is 10yrs old.) Guess I'm going to get the other side now!
B002E5HMSC|5|Cost less than Autozone and  my local dealership.  Perfect fit for my 2014 Mazda CX9.
B00YC6JGSU|5|My girlfriend bought me this headlight for my 2009 Harley Davidson Dyna superglide because I've been wanting to upgrade the headlight to LED from the standard halogen headlight. I had to make a bracket, but it wasn't too difficult to do. I LOVE this headlight. I can see everything ahead of me now. Amazing clarity! I definitely recommend this light for motorcycles, ATV's, trucks, etc. Easy plug and play instal, other than mounting. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
B00KTHZISI|5|Exactly what I needed.
B003LITGFI|5|thanks for having this item, I tear them up you all give me the parts to put it back together
B003GC74S0|5|Simple and easy to use.
B002GTKAHQ|5|Easy to install and don't have a lot of vibrations. great price!
B00O4Z4J5O|4|Bolted right on and works great.
B00142RTWK|5|On time good price...
B004A9UCAA|5|Arrived on time and was the lowest price I could find on the market. I bought this to replace my old ceramic dc sports header which rusted away. Overall it sounds a bit different maybe because it's new. Fits perfect on a 02 rsx-s to an 06 type-s.
B000C31J9G|4|Can't say anything bad about Fram filter. I normally use either Fram, ACDelco or Purolator depending what is on special or in stock.
B0050SFVO2|5|Item as described.
B00HZNNWL4|5|Great match for my Arctic Cat 250. Kit even includes the valve seals. Made for a really nice top end rebuild. Make sure you have a copy of the ATV's service manual handy for piston gap info, torque values, piston gap orienting, etc.
B00L2OF1NO|5|The product is a genuine Subaru PCV Valve for my '06 Subaru Forester Cross Sports JDM.
B00E1SN1OE|5|Excellent
B005JU5XYE|5|best wiper blades I have tried yet. Worth the cost.
B00MG687JW|5|This Product has tons of attachments which can be used for multi-purpose charging. It has an emergency flashlight which helps a lot in camping. It is a must buy product. It is very simple to use.
B0048IVY8C|1|Complete waste of time and money. I installed the first one in the correct manner and it began to flash violently before becoming very hot and burning out. Figuring it was just a defective light, I installed the second one and had the same result. I know it is not a problem with my car's electrical because every light works fine. I even ordered two day shipping for this garbage, I guess you get what you pay for.
B00RUEAHD4|1|Quality is nice.. But the plastic sleeves they give you are slightly too thin for a 35mm fork (cb750).. With the pinch bolts tighten to the point of snapping, it's still not tight enough to hold the brackets from sliding up and down the fork tubes.. for the $$ I'm disappointed
B00X74YAJI|5|I ordered these to replace all the headlights on my 2015 Subaru Outback (Low Beams, Fog Lights and DRLs). I was a little skeptical whether they would be as bright as the regular bulbs and also match the beam pattern. Well they do both very well!<br />BUT - it turns out that on the 2015 Subaru Outback the Daylight Running Lights (DRL) are ALSO the high beams - just dimmed when in DRL mode. Unfortunately the LED bulbs cannot be dimmed which means that they are always High Beams and therefore are not usable for the DRLs. Again, this only applies to the 9005 size for the DRL/High Beams.<br />They work great for the Low Beams and the Fog Lights and definitely match the brightness and beam pattern of regular Halogen bulbs.
B001P2H4U6|5|i was able to install by myself.  fit my 2015 toyota tundra perfectly.  highly recommended.
B0048EDUYW|5|Love it.  fits the dash 98% perfectly.
B002L1IMJM|5|Very nice seat. Good lumbar support. Comfortable even for my 260 pounds.
B00D8FUM8E|5|Terrific product
B0062PTJWC|1|Broke immediately.
B0009JRVWC|5|As descibed, good quality, and arrived on time.
B00QW3ODX4|5|These things are beefy.  I was expecting a standard bosch relay with some better wire in the plug but no.  The 3 power wires are either 12 or 10 ga and the spades are quite a bit larger than the standard 1/4&#34;.
B0007RDVGG|1|Dulls the finish. I used this on the interior of my truck and it made it look dull and worse than before I applied it. I was surprised too because of all the positive reviews. Maybe I just got a bad bottle but I'm going back to Meguiars.
B000P9GO0Q|5|Made my job alot easier.
B003UXZ6RG|3|Very nice wheel cover, however it's very smelly. Has a very strong medicine like odor that won't go away.
B00SVXS3A2|5|Great product!
B000CFS028|5|Super easy install!  Just came back from a quick test drive.  A really noticeable improvement in ride quality.
B0082365AQ|2|Annoyed as mine didn't come with any pins to keep the tires in. Haven't been able to use them yet as I have to find something that will work. sigh. Oh and stinky tires is right.  Update: ended up getting some cotter pins as I was unable to get a hold of support. Complaints about the valve being too short to be inflated by most standard pumps is absolutely right. We ended up getting a cheap mini pump that was able to fit.
B009V4YACA|5|Quality product. Timely arrival.
B00KMDDM96|5|Exactly what I expected!
B004GDILL2|4|Good product but I had to install the lock upside down because the grove is reversed. Witch made the lock hard to turn. Does fit good, feels nice and heavy.
B00DTVTS64|5|Works great.. no problems..
B000CKBH4G|1|Drums would not fit back over once these new shoes were installed on my '55 IHC. Adjuster all the way in still would not fit. I find this with most of the crappy slave labor built Raybestos stuff.I sent them back.
B000HBGIOO|5|Yea! cool
B00IKVRCBQ|5|Amazing! Good quality, good look! I'm really happy with this buy.
B00480J4NW|5|Worked great.
B00OZ6TB1E|4|Fit great looks great but I thought I read someplace that these smart o bolts are magnetic which wud b cool and helpful with where its used but it is not magnetic not sure if others might b but ya :/
B001DRLPIK|5|Perfect
B000B68C1W|4|It ok
B004HCS4PK|5|Makes a super long lasting shine...your car will look like new for months
B0130NLX8G|5|When I ordered the item, I thought this was a bit small<br />,but when I receive the item I was soo happy and glad that I ordered it because the quality is super approved and great!! So happy ...
B00681BE2S|1|These things are so cheaply made. I bought 2 and they both broke within a couple months. First one broke into pieces at complete random while I was driving. The second broke in my pocket from my phone hitting it.
B00FPLDAP6|5|AAA
B0039ILD42|2|Foam that surrounds the perimeter of filter is much thinner than OEM filter.  Leaves filter pretty loose when installed not as snug as OEM.
B001933OP0|4|Module was easy to install and packaged nicely. Not a huge gain in power, but it is noticeable. Good product for the money.
B00DGVRXD2|5|Thank god these exist! Does exactly what its supposed to. Ordered a second set for another can.
B008KWP84I|5|Perfect fit for my 2015 BMW F800GS motorcycle.  Easier to remove and seems sturdier than the original BMW filter.  That is a plus since on the F800GS the filter sticks out there just asking for a rock or limb to puncture it.
B009GLDSTO|5|I bought this hitch to use for bike rack. Arrived in less than 48 hours. Installed in about an hour with minimal help from my wife (she helped me steady and align while I attached the nuts) without a jack. The fishing wires, which are included, are key to installation. Lube the rubber muffler hangers with a Teflon spray or wd40 prior to removal. Read the instructions and watch the short Youtube video and you will have no problem. I also read some others' reviews which were helpful.
B00BT86O66|5|Sounds and performs great on the wrx
B000I991LM|5|Good adapters
B003WOXOD6|5|as promised
B0043YIFGU|5|VERY GOOD
B000BNS7Y2|2|The first one lasted for one pressure measurement.  Then the backlight failed.  I returned it for replacement.  The backlight of the second one works fine but when I look directly at it the display is invisible.  I have to look at a 45° angle from the edge opposite the hose connection to read the display.  I thought the batteries may have been weak so I installed new batteries but there was no change.  I contacted the company directly and they claimed that looking at it at a 45° angle is normal operation.  I have used many products with liquid crystal displays and that statement is pure nonsense from a marketing type person.  I decided to cut my losses and forget about it.
B00GHSD3O4|5|Installed and does what it's supposed to... Delivered on time.
B00ABYVTZA|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B00029J3BG|5|great.
B002AFCANS|5|I wanted this for displaying small books and pictures on our Waldorf nature table.  It does just that without taking up a ton of space.
B000E7WLJW|5|nice and roomy.Good quality
B00DTB4NUU|5|Looks gorgeous on my Jeep Wrangler!
B000CKLXAE|3|It is not as good  as factory part that would have cost me $ 450.00. For the money and cutting off factory pig tail connector and some work getting the factory blower out of vehicle it works at about 80% efficiency. That is what I expected. It is worth the money. It helps in 115 degree temperatures of Arizona.
B00O5IEKUO|1|Bearings failed in 10hrs.<br />Poor quality bearings.  Wouldn't recomend
B005R5TLBM|1|This item does not fit most IV2 Helmets. In fact, the helmet I ordered the same day from the same company did not match. The helmet does not list a &#34;series&#34; but does have several 3 digit numbers starting with 9, while this does list a &#34;series&#34; it is clearly a different one. They should really take a picture of the connector or describe it better to avoid this issue. The connector is a round raised circle with TWO stubs that snap into the helmet, whereas many IV2 helmets have 1 stub.
B005OVM1KC|5|Worked great. Pain in the rear to get to but did the job.
B0045H3TD4|1|Rotters are noisey and the company is not responding to any questions I have.
B008G20RL6|5|This product really transformed the look of our Toyota Tacoma.  Good product and a company that stands behind their product!
B0014H6AA2|3|looks nice ripped the 2nd day
B00EDFM6R8|3|Update: After about a year and a half, and maybe 2 or 3 weeks of use, I'm having elements fail on the bulbs. Have a few that will annoyingly flicker (more like a flash since the elements are individually so bright). I am detracting 1 more star for longevity.<br /><br />Previous review: Bulbs are still working after several months. I have had maybe one that has started to flicker and may need replacing, but for the price that's totally acceptable. Even if I had to replace it, it would be cheaper than ordering elsewhere.<br /><br />Original review: The color is pretty much spot on with the previously installed incandescents and the power draw is 1/12th what it was. Excellent!
B009C5T2E4|2|Not low profile at all and the helmet i got did not have a quick disconnect strap like the pictures show.<br />Helmet did look good and feel solid, just misrepresented and didn't fit the way it says it does.
B00NBN1C78|5|From experience, I can tell you that something as simple as a flat tire can ruin an off road adventure and turn it into an ordeal instead.  We OFF off-road people.  It mounts securely to the trailer, fitting snugly on the side beam of the trailer tongue as if it were custom made. I appreciate how it mounts in a spot that wouldn't be used otherwise, freeing on board room for other things. Thankfully we haven't had a flat since we got this, but my husband did check it out thoroughly to make sure it functioned properly and would stand up to the job.  Having this jack box attached to our trailer means we don't have to unpack our vehicle to get to that jack in the event of a flat.  It is also handy to remove and put in the back of the side by side along with our spare when we are traveling a lengthy distance away from the trailer.  I would love to think we'll never have another flat, but at least with this onboard I'll can hope I never have to walk out again.
B001UC36QM|5|Very fast shipping and very happy with it.
B000CF6HYQ|5|These go up into the window channel so you don't need to glue them to the side of the vehicle.  Very easy to install.
B001C6JCTQ|5|nice
B000CF8VY0|5|work and look great
B001MKAXE0|1|Dont waste your money. this thing is so poorly made its like a 7 year old made it...Actually thats probably true. nonetheless the top was made so slopping it was sitting directly on the hump and wouldnt even sit down all the way. The entire ashtray would rock because they didnt bother to make it on a flat surface. these could easily be mass produced at much better quality. the only thing this ashtray had going for it was the handpainted decorations. nothing else.
B00XN2XLQ2|5|Been looking for something for my car for awhile now. This has a long enough handle to fit on my gear shift, yet sit on the floor. It's flat, so it doesn't take up the leg room on the passenger side. Taller than I need...but that just means I won't have to empty it as often!
B00ML7G5X6|5|Awesome lights! Super bright!!
B00C5SOWLS|5|easiest installation ever.. this is the way things should be made quick..good..and easy...excellent product..  con.. will need alignment afterward
B001NOU92G|5|I refining cars with liquid wrap products and this gun lays the product down smooth and with ease.  It has a nice big hopper and an included pressure regulator.  Great value and 2 day shipping, what more could you ask for!
B000EDSSDO|1|Very small compared to the listed dimensions.  The size listed is for the cardboard paper that it comes packaged in.  The actual dimensions are 1.75 inches x 2.25 inches.  When it comes to using a leveling device for accuracy, size does matter and I can't understand how anyone would pay this price for such a tiny level.  I'll be returning mine.
B00Q34DSU6|5|This steering wheel is absolutely wonderful.  I purchased two of them.  I like the quality and cushioning.  It is a wonderful way to show your faith.
B005K6UHCA|5|Fits. Feels solid. Yet to use. Would recommend.
B00158SFNK|1|Does NOT work with my Koolatron retro Coke cooler.
B00WIUB6FS|5|Fits perfectly on my plate number, Looks sturdy and the Good quality, it is definitely just what i need to protect my plate. I have been trying to flatten my front plate since for some reason it was bend. I didn't even flatten it as soon i got This frame from The Better Trader. i just slide it and screw it back. looks perfectly, Made a lot of difference driving my car now that i have this frame.<br /><br />I have Received License Plate Frame Black Metal Matte by The Better Trader on a discount price in exchange of my unbiased and honest own opinion review.
B002J7VX4Y|5|Smells like the plastic in new cars with a heavy dose of ArmorAll, It really does smell like a new car, not some perfume like most other new car smells. Not yest sure how long the smell sticks around but 2 or 3 sprays is enough. This stuff is potent but not in a bad way. One more Chamical Guys product I can say I love.
B001EL9EME|5|This starter was an exact replacement for my 1998 ford ranger and worked perfectly.  No complaints, very happy with results.
B002H8LS8Q|5|Looks sick
B00LO0M918|5|Lights work and run cooler then the other bulbs. would recommend.
B003TTRORQ|5|It erases brake dust. It smells like bubble gum. You cut it 3:1, making about a 1/2 gallon of powerful cleaner. It makes your wheels easier to clean after each use. It's gentle enough for PVD coated rims. Really, what's not to love? Keep it up Chemical Guys.
B00Q8DRAGU|5|These were the brightest 1156 bulbs I have found.  I use them on my motorcycle brake lamps. I would recommend.
B00GBQYFVC|3|This part worked but it is NOT an exact replacement for the OEM part.
B0002STR22|5|Used when I spray a cyanamid paint -  No coughing no &#34;paint breath&#34;.<br />I'm still here!
B000C17G9A|5|Exact replacement for the OEM part.
B000KPVFG8|1|Definitely misleading pictures on Amazons Site,thought this jack was bigger and more durable than what was sent,cheap material,very flimsy and not reliable.Bought this jack for my wifes Ridgeline,i don't trust this jack now that i see it in person and tried it on her vehicle...
B00IU158JY|5|Fast shipping and the part fit perfectly.
B003IS3HV0|5|Brought out the real appeal of my leather furniture that I thought was gone, I am very satisfied.
B001JT16LS|5|Muy bien
B002E2UK8O|5|Love them
B00ML0843C|5|They worked out well as a replacement for my 94 Corvette; I would recommend them to anyone who is upgrading their lighting
B004KED7RU|5|Works as expected.
B0007RDVH0|5|product works well, it cleans a mildly dirty wheel ,
B002W2V19I|2|Is as some people described. The silkscreening is not the best and will eventually rub off. Purchased two, both of them were in zip lock bags each one was stuck together. When gently pulled apart it removed silkscreening leaving behind white shadowing of BMW
B000A0EJ1Q|5|Great!
B00AN7CT4K|3|No better, no worse than other products I've used but it didn't live up to the claims.
B000VKVXOG|5|Great!
B002JBM9WA|1|I put these on a 2002 GMC Yukon XL.  They look terrible installed.  These lights were built with the passenger side housing on the driver side bracket and the driver side housing on the passenger bracket.  There is no way to swap the brackets and housings.
B009DJUTRI|5|My existing window regulator allowed the window to pop off track every time it was 2/3 of the way down and frankly, pi$$ed me off. This is an inexpensive fix and runs nice and smooth all the way, up and down even though my window channels are 37 years old. A tip, when re-installing, bolt in the regulator and run it all the way up 'til the rollers stick out of the door, slide the window on and bring it back down. It's much easier than Chilton's method, trust me. Liberally apply a high quality lube (I like silicone synthetic) to the mechanism and leave it for your great, grand-kids to replace in 50 years.
B0049D9OLK|2|I need gray color...
B000C2YXFY|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Isuzu rodeo LS  4x4 automatic transmission 3.2L
B009IK98GA|5|make a big difference to my back packing straps. love these. easy to use.
B006VB8JTQ|5|it works great! FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPECT TO TAKE ABOUT 45 MIN PER LIGHT
B001DRNAT2|5|Nice
B00NPIF4LY|5|I've had this key for months and is still good, I don't know why ppl are saying they cracked theirs, just be gentle with it
B0040GU4EM|5|the were perfect
B003SS62PS|3|It's not bad, although too noisy
B003ULT88G|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B0002MSY8G|5|Important part of my body work arsenal.  I only use 3M wetordry sandpaper.
B002R0NH1K|5|Product works perfectly with my 06 RAV4.  Shipped quickly too.
B007U7X4W2|5|feels weird to write a review of a sticker but this is a cool one!
B0006IX7UQ|5|Good product
B00BTSFN54|5|Exactly as advertised. Great product.
B0036E81OY|5|easy to install. love it in my camaro
B00G4S0DMW|5|This was an exact color match.  Still need to clear coat it but you can't see the rock chips any more.
B000C5SGCM|5|I was a little suspicious about if it would fit. But it does it's the exact one for a Montero sport 2001. Buy it for shore.  I will have it in my list just in case I need it again.
B001Q3E5W4|5|great idea for temporary use of winch.
B002FPAASK|5|Perfect, no issues at all
B0002RNSKK|5|This worked perfectly, and having the LED's on it helped diagnose any wiring issues.
B001JT12A8|5|Great look and makes much more easier to turn my steering in my freightliner..
B00YGB4IGQ|5|Works great.
B00AYXM4DY|1|Requested immediate return from Amazon.  By the time you read all of the warnings about possible paint damage, you will not want to use this product on your vehicle.
B00AGLOAF4|5|Arrived fast, and these look awesome. Very pleased will buy again. I highly recommend these.
B000NCUWIK|5|Good replacement, and works as expected.
B00D90UGS4|5|worked great
B001JDE6ZW|5|great mirrors, very easy to install and remove. highly recommend
B00JAAFH40|1|These are beautiful, but super thin, extremely fragile will break easily during installation. Don't recommend these at all.
B009OJ43KQ|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B0002SQUTU|5|As a pro I use this daily A+
B000C55LZW|5|Perfect fit on 1997 Ford F150.
B000H8W1KW|5|This product is great!  It was extremely easy to install and came with a headlight already pre-installed.
B00HR0DC9M|2|Cracks in the lights. Powdercoating came off after a week. Returning the item at the moment. Looks good but made kinda cheaply.
B0074SMGXA|5|Perfect color
B00QFEJVG4|1|Advertising said that it fit a Ford Escape but it did not fit my 2008 Ford Escape because the cheap plastic clasps were to small to attach. I would return, but shipping cost back eats up most of the price paid. So, I will not go to extra time and effort to return.
B00KTIYXLU|5|I love it & I'm so glad I ordered them!
B00UTD63GS|4|Bought these for my 2002 Yamaha yz250f due to the original front brake lever being busted when I bought the bike. This set comes with both the clutch and the brake levers. These fit well in place of the oem levers, and they look a lot nicer. Another plus it that both of the handles are adjustable, unlike the stock clutch lever which is not adjustable. These do fold forward very far to prevent breakage. My only complaint is that they are not greased where they pivot for the adjustment and ubreakablility function, so you need to put a shot of wd-40 in each one otherwise they do not fold forward and spring back by themselves. The grease solves the problem. I would absolutely reccomend these for the price!
B009PQGKK4|5|It's brake fluid.  It works.
B006O85R3C|5|Exactly what I needed.
B0050I15OC|5|works great & saved me about $50.
B000GV8AGO|5|Quiet
B00GMRM3KA|5|Weary bright. Easy to install. To install it on my Road King 2004 I had to order round mounting bracket.
B000GU3MRM|5|These are BIG, about the size of a toilet paper roll.  My feet love them, less vibes, and my feet stay on the pegs, rather than vibrate off, like they did with the o-ring pegs.
B00EA0ZB7I|4|Work pretty well considering the size of these small lights.
B000C9SJUC|5|Fits perfectly and without all the hassle of going to the dealer.  Price was excellent too!!
B0015RWQ6S|5|What a difference! Awesome rotors and quite inexpensive.
B00Y4DIH7M|5|looks and works good
B001C6NL52|5|I have several sets of these and for my deep tool drawers they work awesome - this is the best way to keep oversight in all socket sizes.
B000ELQO50|4|This is a great tool!  I've used it several times to buff up the the polished aluminum rear wheel on my Harley!  The size and extension shaft allow me to get the entire wheel surface even behind the brake disc and the drive sprocket.  Couldn't be happier!
B003FFVI8A|5|bought 4 to put in zeon tractor.  tractor can mow 1:45 minutes instead of the 2 hours as before.  they do charge up in 6 1/2 hours.  so I can mow in the morning and charge it in time to mow in the evening.  48 volts charger works well with it.  did have to call the factory rep to find out that the 200 amp hours is at 25 amps.  the amount necessary for the tractor to work.<br /><br />not having to mess with the acid and water levels priceless!
B00XVQFO42|5|They look awesome on my cb450sc.
B00XZ9OZXG|3|Quality of this fob is not great.  It's not the same as the OE for sure.  It does work but the plastic is cheap feeling and the paint has little to be desired.  You defiantly get what you pay for with this product.
B0053P69IO|4|good
B005XOY072|5|This is a good product for a good price!
B009MATGVI|5|this fits our 2012 Leaf perfectly -- nearly such that we don't even need to flip the visors down to hold it in place.<br />exactly what I was looking for.
B00X41NK4A|4|Easy to install after looking at the old parts when the shaft was removed.  Leaked for a bit until the seal swelled up but only a few drops at a time.  Saved $100 vs buying a new one!
B002LGXYOU|4|looks great.<br />the clamps/brackets that came with product were wrong. Had to make our own.
B00QRVJ7XM|5|These work exactly as described. These are expandable and fit around a variety of tire sizes, and secure tightly around the tire using the velcro. Once secured, the handle works great and easily supports the weight of the tire. These totes make it so much easier to carry two wheels/tires at once!
B0037DD3RO|3|Good solid pot, cups and lids. Sporks break very easy.
B00I3JWJV8|5|Awesome stuff thanks
B00C73D8V6|1|This is horrible.  2x now one of the coin holders will get stuck and cannot get back loose. First time I hoped it was just a glitch, but when the second one did the exact same thing?  Nice concept, but pure poorly made junk.
B001AGFI5U|5|Looks well built. The tip measurements were not list listed. The inlet is 2 & 1/4&#34; and the outlet is 2&#34;. Seems really quiet.
B000C34L00|5|Works great.
B0015PK3AG|5|works great.
B000VEKRTE|1|they do not fit even though they were suppose to be made for my SUV.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;My leather seats are no longer burning my legs!&#34;
B00MNQWHYG|5|I ordered these seat covers directly from the Durafit factory after researching the product on Amazon and reading the reviews. I could not find the color and print I wanted for my 40/20/40 front seats and 60/40 split rear seats in a 2013 F150 (Adobe interior). I paid $259 for the entire front and rear set, not bad for custom fit.<br /><br />I ended up ordering the C3 Tan with XD3 Camo as it appears in the photo. The covers fit like a glove. The Enduro material is a bit firm as I expected. The C3 Tan in just a bit darker than the original material, but it blends well with the truck's interior. The covers go on fairly easy but it is a bit tight in places as one would expect. I had to work with the center console / folding seat to get it right. The covers appear to be well made and provide for a very finished look.<br /><br />The time from order to delivery was 13 days. The website states that it takes 10 -14 days to produce the covers which is totally understandable considering the number of color and material options offered by the company. Shipping was approximately $14.00 via UPS which is respectable.<br /><br />I can't provide any insight into the durability of the product right now but don't expect to have any problems.
B00DSGIOP6|4|If you have ever tried to dislodge grit from a jet with a wire,this is your tool.
B00NGI80BY|5|works great
B0031HUVA8|5|Direct replacement, easy to change and get to clean the car interior at the same time.
B001GPZ300|5|Go Cubbies!
B003CMIH2Q|5|Looks nice, perfect size !
B00ILNEUQI|1|The band snapped in two where the metal rivet is before I even got to use it. I stretched it a little bit to test the quality. NOT that hard, i'm not a muscle builder, so i really don't think it should have snapped that easily. I bought two of these and will be overly careful with the other one. I stapled the broken one back together and might get some use out of it. We'll see.<br /><br />This item is just a fancy over sized rubber band attached to a key ring.<br /><br />I did not contact the seller or company for replacement bc I figured the shipping cost wouldn't be worth it.
B00BKW444A|5|Wiring directions were a little complex but finally figured it all out.
B000C9TC3A|1|filter does not exist but sold to buyers anyway  stay away.....
B001GBIEIM|5|This is one of the best tool purchases I have made in a long time.  I was really hesitant due to the cost and I wondered if I could justify the cost for the occasional use.  I just received it yesterday and I am waiting on the plug wire I ordered to try that portion of the crimper out, but I tried the insulated crimper dies tester day and they do a wonderful job.  This item sells for a much higher price other places.  Only thing lacking was any type of instructions.  It is pretty intuitive to use but it seems it may have been nice to have some instructions as far as adjusting and swapping out the different dies.
B00PV5F7NO|1|I got my liner in the mail.  First when I opened the package, the liner was dirty.  It was easy enough to cut.  However, I noticed that it smells so bad.  I drove everyday to work and the smell gave me a headache.  It's smelled of cheap plastic.  I removed it tonight, I've had enough.  I will try to wash it tomorrow and if it doesn't work, I will return it.
B001EOYIVS|5|Fits perfact!!  Fast shipping.  I did not had to remove the muffler to install. I just move it around like tetras piece and it fits in perfact.<br />2005 Hyundai Santa Fe. 2.7L
B0085J2420|5|Great stuff love it!
B00NI6U238|5|Installed in a 2006 Chevy trailblazer that had been having issues with the fan for years. First just level 5 wouldn't work for about 4 years. Finally the rest started going out. When I took it apart the blower motor resistor and wiring was all burnt up. I replaced it and it has been working good for months.
B004IYY8SY|5|Part fixed the check engine light for evap leak...screws rusted in so be prepared to work to get them out...this new part went in with no issues...
B001SG8ZC0|2|great to bench bleed the master cylinder, ripoff because connectors do not come in pairs so have to buy 2 kits
B00HYTWWT2|4|They are good light just didn't sit flush on my 93 step side but overall good
B00IUQUPFG|5|Amazing product. Fast shipping and works perfectly. Matches my car exactly.
B00QYZIVA6|1|I had a head gasket leak on Nissan Altima 20016, 4 cyl engine, on fourth cylinder. This product worked for one day, with 20 min drive. On the second day the engine reverted as before. This product is a waste of money and time to deal with the manufacturer.<br />I would not buy this product again.
B004BFW82I|2|Not very durable and they don't stay screws on right and loosen. Won't bug again.
B00C0SQDJM|5|Good quality
B00DIKSX5I|5|i put these on the back of the 'Baby on Board' plaque and use that instead. Looks better and cuter I guess.
B003TU6066|5|I used it on furnace air conditioning closet door. Definitely lowered noise level. Also put some on wall vents near AC closet that had some vibration noise. Does not help air flow noise.
B004I131RG|5|It was a perfect easy fit! Thank you!
B0002BC0T6|5|Had one before, forgot it in a car I sent overseas so needless to say I wanted one again. Proven quality, best price was here.
B004QC1066|5|Build quality was great. Fit was perfect.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Light weight, easy to use, works great.
B008X63R44|1|The kit does not include solution or any tools or instructions so buyer be aware.  I am really disappointed
B003UVCY00|4|I received this light, plugged it in and charged it for 24 hours. Turned it on and the battery lasted about 2 hours with the light turned on the entire time. I was a bit bummed by this because the light is super bright and shines far out into the distance; but the price was good and the trigger plug's a nice feature, so it's worth 4 stars.
B000182B9Y|5|Worked right out of the box. Fast shipping.
B00DQ4TJUO|5|Good
B001O0ZFCI|5|These fit a 2008 Nissan Versa perfectly!
B00PYCXH7C|5|Works well .ok
B005XXY83Y|1|I actually like the &#34;Hitch Plug&#34; which is what I ordered.  What I got however, was a &#34;hitch cover&#34;  (see below). The hitch plug simply slides right into the receiver hole (it's simple, easy, and looks great), the hitch cover fits over the entire hole (a little more effort to put on and take off).  Not a huge deal, but it wasn't the look I was going for.  Not worth the time and effort of returning, so I kept it.  Live and learn.  The one star is for the supplier.
B00GI77A2K|5|Very bright and fit perfectly. Looking for others to put in our other car now...
B000C59WGQ|5|Beware that it is not pre-greased. So far another great moog product.
B00NONOCD6|5|awesome
B00Z7KIZPA|5|I like but I have seat covers on the seats. So I am going to connect it around the headrest. where there is a will there is a way
B008G2J9ZG|5|Perfect match, way cheaper than anything else in the market
B006A3RHSE|5|Nice
B00E3CASSU|4|This item fit as described.
B004FJT242|5|OEM product, fits perfectly with the Honda Roof Rack Rails. Good price!
B00E1SM0BE|5|Construction looks to be of very high quality. Everything fit perfectly. It would have been nice to have a tube of disk quite adhesive as well as caliper grease included in the package.
B000TRBOK4|3|The bottom is narrower then the top. I can't use it for the intended purpose but will use it elsewhere.
B00MJ43ZQG|4|Does not fit, despite how people answered my question stating that it would.<br />Description states not for hatchback, but when I input they kind of vehicle I drive Amazon said  that it would fit (2007 Mazda 3 hatchback)<br />Box only came with four rain guards, no instructions.<br />I will be returning this.
B00OR6L2PK|1|its not what i expect
B00PHRICWE|5|Good quality at a fair price.
B0007OWD2M|5|works great.  Now if they could somehow make it less difficult to reach the bottom of the inside of my windshield...
B000GTWV3O|5|Found one on ebay for $11 in great condition- and I got the 2 zip strips for free at O'Reilly's Auto from an open bag the guy at counter supplied.  I've got a '95 Shadow 1100 in nice shape and have spent long hours making all the cast aluminum and chrome look almost new. This is a great add-on because it balances the exhaust pipe chrome on the other side. I give it 5 stars- but I don't have $40+ to spend on a curved piece of metal when a decent battery will run $100 in a couple months. If you have the bucks to spend- it's worth it. Easy install and looks great!
B00PFI7A3W|1|Came with none of the hardware that is pictured. Packaging was a zip lock bag. Cheaply made and are all scratched up from just being in a bag. If you want to get knock off stuff, pay the extra $10 to get a set thats in original packaging and with hardware. This set is practically useless without installation hardware.
B005OZHFBS|5|held up perfect
B0095TCU4G|1|Did not fit 2003 pace arrow slide out corner
B00ODM4I90|2|Items are well made and sturdy.  Problem is I was planning on using them for my camper.  The dual axles are on pressure treated lumber.  These wheel chocks will not grip into smooth wood.  Would probably work great on pavement or stone.  As I said, they are well made but did not work in my instance.  Unfortunately, I destroyed the plastic wrapper so do not believe they can be returned.  I ordered the plastic ones and will see how they work.  I will save these for working on the car in the driveway.
B005545PEW|1|The photo shows it wrong it is actually female ends
B00BTLEIIY|1|Doesn't fit in my car seat
B0001EXBQ0|5|Could not be simpler to install, adds some style to my Hoe and will prevent any more scratches on the front.
B00IMQ4XDE|1|Item arrives broken in the middle.
B00X6J4F1W|5|delivered as promised
B00VT9DKPI|5|pretty dam good.  you do have to cut your plastic factory load side tops to fit the clamps or it will move around a bit.  After I did that it is solid.<br />It is a little heavier than you think, but a strong guy can move it on and off by themselves.<br />Looks really good.  Is strong and solid.  My two kids can jump around on it so about 140 lbs. no problem.<br />so far no water intrusion really.  Seals are good.
B0049OOJQE|4|Perfect replacement for Government Motors shoddy engineering.  While the stock parts should have been recalled by the NHTSA, not enough people have been injured or killed yet.  Fixed the problem with GM's inability to supply quality ball joints.
B00JNAM628|4|I bought what I expected! Happy
B008YUE9KA|5|great filter
B00HRPI7AQ|4|I found this vinyl wrap to be of good quality, although maybe a little more shiny than I'd like.  Most impressive is how easy it was to apply, I could fairly easily peel sections back off and reapply if it wasn't put on right.  Bubbles work out effortlessly.<br /><br />I used this for an interior home application.  I might be a little nervous about applying it in an extreme environment like a car interior which will get very hot.<br /><br />NOTE:  As another reviewer noted, the grain direction is in the short direction and not along length of roll (NOT like as shown in photo).
B004VW7B78|2|These did not fit as expected and when I email customer service it was a nightmare. Don't Buy!
B0065MEZVW|5|Product arrived promptly and exactly as described.
B00FOSSLHW|1|Waste of money.  Saw absolutely zero improvement.
B001FZNDXA|5|Fit great - extremely nice quality!
B006GZHJTS|3|I picked this up for my 1988 Suzuki GS450 cafe build as a way to replace the enormous stock taillight. It's small, easy to mount, and the awkwardly-angled license plate mount is removable if it's not to your liking (it wasn't to mine). It's not exactly the most durable feeling unit, so I wouldn't trust it if you ride in the rain frequently. The other thing that isn't great (that others have touched on as well) is that the beam pattern is fairly weak. Looking at the light straight on is fine, but looking from various angles really diminishes the visibility. The brake light is also a bit too close in brightness to the running light for my peace of mind. It's acceptable and worth the low price, but I'll likely be replacing it in the next few months with a brighter unit.
B00JGG0W0C|5|The frame is very good quality. Heavy, looks like it will last a long time. Good quality finish & graphics. It is a nice finishing touch for our new 50th Anniversary race red Mustang convertible.
B00EZNF4XG|5|These make a perfect pillow for my son to rest his head on even when he's not sleeping.
B0001EFSTI|5|Good product, I got this new one to replace an old rusted one I had.  Works great.
B0002SRL20|5|Great product. Good  value
B00H4WP9CQ|4|I bought this for my daughter, who still thinks she is immortal and impervious to accidents and injury.<br />Had to put batteries in it myself because she never would have bothered, so I got to try it out---everything works fine and is self-explanatory.  I especially like the alarm mode which she can use if she feels threatened in any way.<br /><br />I hope she never has to find out that mom is right, but this gadget gives me some peace of mind, even if she is rolling her eyes at me.<br />Too bad batteries never last long in a hot car; I will have to take it upon myself to change them periodically.
B000E4QLNC|5|Very happy with product
B00SBZAG5U|2|frame does not hold plate tight, was too big for my car and bottom frame does not block out bottom scree holes.<br />in my opinion a poor design
B00LL4CEO4|1|Garbage! Don't waste your money on this product.  I bought this for my 2003 CBR 600 RR  and it will not fit.  There is no were to mount this to the bike.  The bracket is just big enough for a plate and that's it.  I have a Scorpion after market pipe and the bracket wont even fit around the muffler.  There are no direction or pictures.  absolute waste of $18.00.
B00TUNST10|5|Get stuff
B004C67FLA|5|Drops right in and Price is right
B00GJ1D7ZY|5|I had to purchase a new lower steering shaft due to my factory shaft having a TON of play in the lower u-joint. This unit installed with ease and took care of all the sloppy play my steering had. There are a couple of SLIGHT differences between this unit and the OEM shaft, however. The bolt holes are flip flopped and the actual joint that attaches to the upper steering shaft and steering rack are smaller than the OEM as well. Therefore, you will need to purchase new shorter bolts, as this unit does not come with them. Re-using the original bolts is not recommended anyway. I recommend using grade 5 or 8 fasteners with nuts on the end for some extra security. If you're looking to save some money and not break the bank paying for OEM parts, this Dorman replacement is the way to go. So if your Dakota or Durango has some play in the steering wheel, most likely it will be a failing u-joint like mine. Save yourself some $ and get it here on Amazon!
B002ZTGLCK|5|Fuel line OK.
B00CF5LTFI|5|excellent
B00H1I639Q|5|After painting the rims on our Wells Cargo Mini trailer the old beat up lug nuts looked pretty sorry, so the decision was made to dress it up a bit with these chrome lug nuts. They look great, and there is also a side benefit that the socket (or lug wrench) no longer bottoms out against the rim when removing wheels, thus scratching up the paint. The length of the lug nuts eliminates that. Especially like the fact that the company wants you to contact them if for any reason you aren't completely satisfied with the product. Great price performance. Would I purchase them again, or recommend them to others? yes.
B004FOUANO|4|It has the right spline to attach to the steering column of a SW20 MR2, but the metal ring around the bottom needs to be cut off or there is no way it fits. Its a universal part, so some modification is acceptable. I used it with an autotecnica Maloo steering wheel, the 6 holes lined up perfectly. It has two different 6-hole patterns, so I imagine it will accommodate a wide range of aftermarket wheels as long as the wheel has a 6 bolt pattern.
B006UKGBLQ|5|Mine was badly deteriorated, as was the lower shift boot in my 90 Miata. This was a perfect replacement. Installation only took a few minutes.
B004P5G2GM|3|I like the concept, product is of good quality, but not as &#34;sturdy&#34; in place and out of the way as I would have hoped.  It does provide more cup holder space.
B00YBK0IM0|5|excellent, highly recommend them
B00CJFQD5U|3|fits but kinda cheap ,will see how long they last
B00C7Y36A8|5|It is what it is, and it's what I needed
B00NSA46CC|5|Really happy with the decal; looks exactly as pictured. I applied to a black hard case suitcase and it survived four plane rides!
B003SS8AMQ|5|Very high quality! Super happy and would definitely recommend! Go green! Go white!
B007N6YWQM|5|delivered as promised
B00K2A9Z0Y|4|Installation was a snap, The lock washers supplied are garbage, replace them with ones of better quality
B007V2C59E|4|Good coverage and fits well. Well made.
B00029WYEY|5|works good
B0002MABGE|5|Easy to install, I have a 2011 Toyota Highlander. Fits perfectly and stays up with my rambunctious puppy
B00BITJHR4|5|👍
B002PYBZJO|5|Very cool tool, wish I knew how to use all its features...
B00C25GRI0|5|Exact match for my 2000 Chevy Malibu.  Purchased to fix the annoying and constant inability to turn my key without messing around and wiggling it &#34;just right.&#34;  No theft system issues before or after.  Programmed itself in minutes.  Key now turns easily and freely!  Hardest part is getting the dash apart without breaking or scratching anything.  GM doesn't make it easy.
B000IZTD1O|5|These guys just make great products. It took 5-10 minted to install by myself and it looks and works great. The tension knob makes it super easy to adjust to keep it tight. It rolls up easy and out of the way when I need to haul things and takes less then 30 seconds to unroll it's and strap the sides down. Not to mention is me right here in the USA.
B00OAFU9B6|5|Cleans  like it should. It doesn't leave behind greasy residue or funky scent
B0036VQIKQ|5|SMELLS GREAT
B00K2AGAUC|5|This is an excellent shackle mount for my F-450 service body truck with a Warn 16.5K winch.  Safe and easy to work with.  Thank you!!
B00X4RXP62|5|Go Bernie, Go!
B009UYO3D2|5|Received parts in a timely fashion. Bottom grill will not snap in place on the right side. I cannot remove the other parts and now my brand new 15 Sierra is driving around with 2/3 of a grill. Not happy and waiting for a resolution from the seller. Will change rating if properly addressed
B00NAQUQ3W|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 gsxr 600, The wires weren't even hard to connect properly.<br /><br />Although you will have to cut and strip some wires you dont have to have any prior skills to do this.<br /><br />So take the two wires leading to one of the stock bullet style blinkers, and cut them a close to the light as you can (so you have as much wire to work with as possible)<br />So out of these two wires one of them is ground, and one is positive or whatever. But youll notice on the integrated taillight theres only one wire for each side that you need to connect.<br />So turn your bike on (dont need to start the engine) and then turn on the blinker that youre working with, obviously since you cut the wires its not going to light up.<br />So while the blinker is on just touch the wire from the integrated taillight to one of the two wires you just cut (make sure the copper is touching)<br />If the integrated taillight starts blinking its blinker then congratulations you found the right wire, if it doesnt start blinking then try the other wire.<br /><br />I made a crude diagram in paint to describe what im talking about.<br /><br />After you get everything hooked up youll notice the blinkers blink really fast. If you dont have a problem with that then youre done but if you do want them to blink slow again youll need to buy a special relay which you can search for.<br /><br />I used http://amazon.com/gp/product/B003UN4FXW?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_21<br /><br />And it is located at the front of my bike in front of the handlebars on the right side. Didnt even need to unscrew or take anything off. Just pop the old one off and then pop the new one on. This will probably be one of the easiest mods you do.<br /><br />One more tip, and this may be obvious but take the tail fairing off and getting to the screws for the tail light is a million times easier.
B000CMI7BU|5|product good
B000N2XOYE|5|40000 volts. Swapped out old original coil and engine fired up first crank. Can't get much better than that. This is my 6th VW and my 6th PerTronix system
B0130NLX8G|5|Very high quality, completely lined to make sure any messy spills do not get out. Velcro closer on top. Fits in any vehicle, Adjustable strap. Makes it perfect to hang on the back of the car seat. You can stand it on the floor as well.  If you don't want to use this as a trash can, you can use it to store items in your car, to help organize you better!.
B0086C1JQI|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B0033QQ4VW|5|Works I guess
B003UI57UM|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B0002YUQ4E|5|NOTHING BETTER!!
B0096BAMA2|3|Just put into the vehicle. Seems to be holding up well.
B001UC3C0M|4|The shop could not get their code to read the sensor but the vehicle does so all is well.
B0010E00T6|5|Took my car to the dealership for an oil change after their &#34;21 point&#34; inspection they stated that the filter would need changed and quoted me $75! Well needless to say I told them I would do it myself. Really easy to replace on my 2014 Honda CR-V. Took all of 3 minutes and it looks to be even better quality than the stock Honda filter.
B000MD4YKM|5|Good product, well made
B0067O6412|5|Great Coilovers, A+ built quality...for the price you can't beat. ..Recommended them to all my friends... I changed my car but whenever my 09 civic si needs new shocks...I'm going to buy Megan racing Ez streets adjustable coil overs. ..
B003LTNABI|5|The best filter on the market today without exception. However be carful when cleaning & re-oiling your filter. Do not over oil or you run the risk of contaminating your MAF sensor. But if you due its easy to clean and reinstall so no need to panic if you pull a code.
B000N3LG2K|5|Factory new! Just what I needed!
B00PTTGPRY|5|Pleased with purchase, item as described and looks good on my wife's CRV.
B003NH6RA4|5|Very sturdy metal,
B00UVJI9RQ|5|Nice product. Perfect fit and color
B000CMHVGM|5|Worked exactly as described! took 5 minutes for install and very good quality materials used.
B004AGB6US|1|despite amazon saying the part would fir. it would not fit on the hub.<br /><br />the great price was not worth the hassle.
B000HUPEMW|5|has been perfect so far.
B00BJ5OWT0|5|It was the right kit. Delivered on time.
B000BUU5Z4|5|Purchased for my camp trailer. Works great!
B005PYHYK0|3|These seat covers are a great fit for my 2015 prius.  good for price!
B000BR3BF8|5|I've been using K&N for many years and love the product
B000C15MUU|4|Not what I needed so I had to return it.
B00J51HJ7W|5|Forget the pen tipped ones. I have Honda Civic 2012 opal green. This is the exact color. This one is perfect.
B00KWNUGHW|5|2015 Sierra SLT 1500 Double Cab - Fits perfect.  installation took a few minutes...literally...fits well...seems to be pretty solid...I can't wait to see what the future holds with it.  Locks down well, tail gate works well with it...I had to double check the diagrams for the weather strip for the front of the bed (closest to the cab)...wasn't sure that was entirely necessary, but ultimately I put it in as there was sunlight coming through the gap between the bed and the cover (again, by the cab)...once installed, looks great...I will update in a few months.  Have a great day.
B001P2X4EQ|5|Heavy duty however the depth of the pin hole on my Arctic Cat receiver wouldn't align with grinding done to the rear of the hook portion. Works great now tho...
B000CMKEIY|4|Fit as advertised.
B006DX15DY|5|Perfect fit. I went from Yellow stuff to this because I just didn't want to dish out $130 again. This fit perfectly but doesn't stop nearly as great. Gave it 5 stars because I knew it wouldn't be as good.
B00IICYTDG|5|It was ship to me fast and work great . I'd by again thank you .
B001B7BUAU|5|Works great
B00HM92O06|5|We get looks all the time I love this sticker
B000C9JTGK|4|Fixed the problem
B006OQ35GU|5|can't wait to see my black water rushing thru !!!!!!!! Tank has a good rinse system on arctic fox camper so will be able to tell when rinsed
B00W20X73S|5|Awesome deal
B007J3DJZ4|5|Nice
B002P8UQWW|4|It's an OK quality replacement part.  The plastic cover is not interchangeable with the oem style. So be prepared to paint the new one to match the car.  Other than that it works great.  Notice a little shaking on the highway at high speeds.  Fits  nice and took 5 mins to replace.
B00144GN3Y|5|worked well in a semi-enclosed painting area. Got the dust off
B007Y4BL1C|1|these suck.  I had two break that were hard wired into my car while on a road trip.  the USB port would work but not the plugs.  the customer support folks said there is only one fuse and if it broke, neither the plugs or the USB would work.  so they were just like &#34;I dunno&#34;.  it's incredibly difficult to get packages delivered while on a road trip to be replacing stuff like this.  and it's terribly inconvenient to not have this working while you wait for the new one to ship out while you are over landing.  so skip it and go with a cobra.
B0033WDI0G|3|As many other reviewers have stated, This is a VERY long way from &#34; Plug & Play &#34;  Only start this project when you have NO time  issues....&  access to ALL of your tools.  Read all the reviews before you take this install on.  The Curt hitch for my Transit Connect was a well engineered unit that I installed in a quarter of the time.
B004A2IJDY|5|It takes about 5 minutes to install and is inexpensive.
B008VJZ6YW|1|Wrong part dont buy
B000CQDK9K|5|It fits on my 93 Integra and does not leak. It seems to be made out of mostly lead.<br />Not much I can say about it as it's such a simple part, it's just a lead ring with a steel wool type material in it.
B00ARUTZ1S|5|reserve part
B000C2SJ90|5|Fits perfectly onto my Infiniti 2002 G20. Good printing on the belt, the groves were the right size, and right away the squealing noise went away. I like how inexpensive the belt was and that the size was right on the money.
B000F2VX5E|3|nice but not the right one for my 94 gmc vandura
B008DK8YU2|2|Poor quality, the tabs don't like up with the headlight, they are too short. And they don't hold the bulb tight at all, it moves around a good few millimeters, had to use some glue to fix it in place temporarily. Would not recommend. Used on my '01 525i halogen projector lights with H7 HID conversion kit.
B00BVQ4B70|2|Same as the others reviewed, wired backward. Got it to work. Also, you don't need this one with the motor attached, as your motor is most likely fine and the OEM motor in there is a Bosch, and this one is some knock off. It works until next time it breaks! Then I will probably just buy the Evan Fischer.
B00K53EEOK|4|Worked good on a sunl 50cc moped.
B00IKPF3HC|4|Worked perfectly. Price was great. Shipped fast.
B00262OFWE|5|Perfect fit.
B004W97D3C|5|EXCELLENT.....installation instructions could be improved.....
B003DXMUMM|5|Horsepower increase was very noticable especially when paired with the econoaid throttle body spacer, but I would highly recommend getting a tuner to get full results, this was used with a dual in out flowmaster and high flow cats by magnaflow, trust me when I say you won't be disappointed with the results if the right setup is used
B009HYO88K|5|I put these plugs in my Stihl, Husqvarna and Toro engines, and each performs well.
B000EVWDAK|5|Works great on a 2003 honda accord and 2003 chevy tahoe..cleared codes,easy to read and functions as advertised!
B0024E6W02|4|Does what it is supposed to do... is a hose for cleaning the crap out of our camper. I can't give it 5 stars and say I love it because who actually loves a poop hose? Came in great condition and we haven't had any issues using it.. and that's about all I can really say about a hose for poop.
B006QLHOY2|3|Did not come with the adhesive pad so so I have not been able to put it on.
B004940ZSK|5|It's been working well so far. Installation was a breeze.
B004SS8CDM|5|fit nice
B00SSC4BPC|5|Fun
B00KTIZ2C4|3|Not the best range. had to replace battery right away.
B000CM2VE4|1|Although our GMC Yukon was listed as compatible, the mirror did not fit at all.
B00NXLXQBS|5|excellent
B00UN1V5FA|4|Worked as described for a 2013 Nissan Altima.
B00IMUC9YU|4|Nice but really does not match my cars theme...&#34;Batmobile&#34;.Will keep maybe put on another vehicle or give to someone.
B00EP3PW4M|5|Fast shipping light is perfect and definitely bright thank you
B000CRVFYQ|5|The original was dry and crumbled when removing the PCV valve.  This one was new and rubbery.  It arrived on time and it worked.
B001LHVOVK|5|Good scanner for the money.
B000C9QPAS|5|Nice
B0019O1BS6|5|Perfect fit. Buy this together with the cabin filter and it's a 5 minute job, 0 tools required. Save yourself the hundreds of dollars the dealership or auto repair store will charge you for both installs.
B00OZSLZBG|3|cup holder looks like original but the &#34;tab&#34; part is a bit to long, which makes it fit very tightly and it sits on top of the other cup holder insert &#34;tab&#34; part. i will have to sand it down a bit  then it might fit perfectly.  it is just a piece of molded plastic, it should fit perfect every time.
B000QIWAJ0|3|Luckily I got it for a low wholesale price from Amazon. This thing better not delaminate like the original. These badges can be relatively expensive.
B006EIPGUG|5|Worked as designed
B00OU5LOT2|4|nice kit<br />took less than an hour to install (cigarette lighter method) in new ford edge.  underneath front seats for the back and in front foot wells.  zip ties came in handy,. extensions were plenty so i can hide underneath sills , etc.  The lighting itself is real good .  gets bright.  Iknow I wont have brightness to max when driving - that would be a bit too much for my bad eyes.  Great option that you can dim them down quite a bit for just a little glow.  very cool.  Since the car is leased I really like that it will be quite easy to take them back out and switch to new car in 3 years !!  Very cool.
B001NZQCS0|5|Item arrived on time and in good condition. The construction of the link is stronger than OE and the added grease nipples is great.
B005ASY23I|4|Very good product, fills up SUV tires fast. i would have given it 5 stars but the cable is just a little short. I have a Sequoia and the pump reaches the back tire but the hose and wires are taught. It works but it would be better if the cables were just 2-3 inches longer.
B000EH4V18|5|good quality A+++
B00ATE00KW|4|These are good quality but not the high quality of the mud guards I put on my 2008 Prius at the same time.  They also cost $26 more and are much smaller.  That being said, they should do the job.  As long as the clips are used with the supplied screws these should take a beating.  It took some patience to get these mounted but it was well worth the effort.  I did remove the rear wheels to get easy access to the two screws used back there on each mud guard.  The material used appears to be a bit more brittle and hard than that used in the 2008 mudguards.  Time will tell but these look ok once on the car.
B00SNCYUCG|4|I like it
B00QK0F7UC|4|Gud parts fit perfect
B00OX5GSRW|5|Works perfectly. This glass was manufactured by the same company that makes them for General Motors. It had the same logo on the back, was just was good a fit and finish and was over $100 cheaper.
B005C2ACBI|5|As expected , strong and will last long time.
B003SOKEXI|5|same as parts store mirror switch  half the price.
B007V2CNG4|5|This is a nice sun shield. I have had these for other cars in the past and they have held up well. I like the color choices now available. While it is a tight fit installing it has to be to give the most protection. I bought a a roll up sun shield first but ditched it for this, I'm much happier now.
B000B6JJUK|3|works
B00112DMCY|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B00NI00D74|5|LOVE this sticker. Looks great on the car, easy to apply. I get compliments all the time!
B00TUNSOMO|4|We sold our boat to my daughter and son-in-law, so when I received this product, I went for a visit to try it out It does a pretty good job at shining up the paint and giving it some protection from the elements. But, it isn't easy to buff out. It didn't take me long to hand it over to my son-in-law and let him finish the job. Other than it being a bit difficult to buff out, it's a good product. Keep in mind that I am a 52-year-old old lady who is out of shape. So it may just be me having trouble with it.
B00ELJLV8G|4|Easy fit nice upgrade for a sweet price Honda lettering adds a touch of class.
B00BD5GZK0|1|Very confused on how to put it on my seat...not enough instructions...
B00T3TMTMQ|5|Perfect item for occasional use! It isn't a hardened tool designed for frequent use, but this was critical to getting my engine back happy!
B00CB8WM2S|4|Well made and hope i never have to find out if it works. Just felt i needed to keep in car after watching people and three cops try to break glass to get to child left in boiling hot car. Tried canned goods rocks and even tire iron nothing until one cop used his baton one smack and it smashed. Need that little metal tip i guess
B00496ILZC|4|Can't really say I love an oil filter. It does the job. I never use anything but ACDelco and my vehicles last what seems like forever.
B008ECC31U|5|My car is 2005 toyota corolla. It is  very good. And it is easy to replace the original one.
B004K6LJ96|3|It was on sale for under $20 with free prime shipping- what can I say, it seems to run a little small but it fits me perfect.  No complaints, hope it does what it was designed for if I ever need it.
B00BWX5U6I|5|Just what I wanted.
B00LGDOP0Q|4|A little short for my valve stems But still looks good.
B00YB99NPY|3|Close, but doesn't fit a 2001 Malibu. Nice product and adhesive but wrong for the application.
B008WH1JS0|5|It broke
B000CPI5XW|5|On recommendation from the forums, I tried this in the transmission and final-drive on my Moto Guzzi Breva.  The bike only had 3500 miles when I changed to this from factory-fill.  There is a noticeable difference in the shifting.  Also on-off throttle drivetrain 'lash' is far less harsh.  Happy I made this choice, will be doing it on my clunky Ulysses transmission next!
B00809W470|5|came early bit worked as said no hitches, hope to use again if needed
B000MWIHTC|2|There's a fatal flaw in these otherwise excellent mud flaps. The quality is great, installation is a breeze but...and this is a big but....they're not good mud flaps. The spray pattern and density of mud on my truck is virtually identical to not having them installed. I was hoping the front mud flaps would somewhat reduce the mud from getting all over the step rails but they don't. I'm not talking about &#34;mudding.&#34; I'm talking about normal use on a dirt road with some puddles. So they're really well made DECORATIVE mud flaps but not truly mud flaps. I have them on a 2015 Silverado 2500HD High-Country truck. Maybe they work better on other trucks?
B00EWHO2P6|5|Amazing! I got this product a couple months ago, kinda thought it would be broke or dead by now but I can say it went through some tough storms, and still works. I put them in the grill of my truck and their visible. Im a firefighter and they work great for going to calls. Recommend to anyone who is a first responder
B001O0CC1U|4|I have been threw many different kinds of lugs for my custom wheels and these are hand down the best for the price. I have yet to have an issue with them. most lugs for around this price the finish will start coming off quickly or they start rushing, not these though. I love how light weight and the fact that each lug is almost a lock.
B0069TND14|5|Much better quality and better looking in person than on site. Order came in half the time than was initially told to me.<br />I have zero complaints and will buy again
B000HBNTX2|5|I use this for cleaning oils from tinkering, acrylic paint and ink from my hands and brushes, any grease or petroleum substances from the garage, and sometimes just to get my hands clean for jobs that oily fingerprints could ruin.
B00J12PALC|5|Great price
B0084UINKM|5|Quick shipping and excellent quality.
B004ADUMMY|5|Very similar to Toyota light unit and a lot cheaper easy to install.
B00DQEVFLU|1|paint falls off after a few car washes..
B00JXI9Q78|5|Good
B00BBMDAL2|5|Love it! Works as expected
B002ENZ4RU|5|Exactly as described.
B00NHJDZBC|5|Quality is very good no difference between original and this one.Highly recommend.
B005SB0JJS|5|Easy to install and great looking.
B00620PXMW|5|Just what we needed to help us recharge our AC in our dodge ram van. Easy to use.
B0050DCX2A|1|No it did not meet my expectations. It was plastic and looks very cheap. The product should be removed from from the website
B00AVQSFT6|5|I own a 2011 VW Tiguan, this fits my key fob perfectly and adds a little pizzazz to my collection of keys. I ordered the hot pink and just love it. I also tend to drop my keys a lot, and hope this will protect my key from cracking and what not. It slipped on perfectly and am able to operation all buttons.
B0068NY1O4|5|Love Bilstein shocks. A quality product. Replaced leaky/shot shocks on a 03 Chevy Silverado with these and the ride is great. Very happy. Installation took a hour and a half each side. Would have been much faster if I had the right impact sockets and extensions, so I ended up using hand wrenches.
B002R4U72I|5|This definitely kept my exhaust temps down under the hood and keeps the heat in the system til it reaches the outlet - great purchase.
B00AZOJB2O|3|These are tiny!<br />even though the length and thickness is correct, head size are plainly tiny not much bigger than the shaft.<br />does not provide a lot of holding power
B0007ZK3S2|3|I wanted something better but this is OK
B001C99T3W|5|Looks and functions just like factory part for a MUCH better price
B0036GGFV8|4|Nice all purpose bag carried three Chinese dinners home no problem.  It's a little bigger than I thought hangs over taillight obscuring it so I installed it on my rack at an angle, what ever works!  Also the attachments could of been a little better thought out but they work.
B00P32EQKU|5|cute
B000TYEDN2|5|What can I say. They are Great bars. I love the staighter bars with less pullback or sweep. They are easier on my wrists. No more pain. Much more control, for me.
B00FSCAZ50|5|As described. . Ontime delivery
B003VCCUJI|5|Pros:<br />-Fit perfectly on my 2014 Scion FRS.<br />-valve operation is smooth<br />-hasn't leaked yet (and probably never will)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-the lever to open the valve ended up in somewhat of an awkward spot for opening the valve. It is still very accessible, but when tightening the valve, you can't really control where the lever is going to end up.
B005X4FPAS|2|Nice tee fades fast though
B00H6XPZN6|4|My wife thanks it is great.
B000MV599Y|5|This is great stuff - I've used it on my airplane for years and leaves a wet and shinny look on my cars as well.  I believe its the best polish on the market and have sworn by this product for almost twenty-years.
B003VAXT68|5|Very simple and well made.  We did not hook up light because we already had an outside light over handle.  Holes lined up very well on our 2002 Monaco Diplomat.  Much better appearance than original handle.
B000CFDGO0|5|Wow what a differance! Took off the old sway bar and put  this bad boy on. Holy cow drives so much better on turns and rough road. I used lots of PB blaster air rachet and brute force and it is done. Awesome product!
B008J25JHA|5|It worked great. Sold the car to a friend. He still uses this.
B0027AGFLY|5|What can I say its a wheel hub its the FORD F350 OEM its cheaper then from Motocraft yet it is the same part. Probably the best in the world, for cost. The bearing itself is Korean but the hub assembly is made in the USA. Much better than any china crap you get at NAPA etc.
B009DJPOU0|1|Some parts are to short for proper installation
B000ET5264|3|I did not buy this exact model from this seller, but I bought one from an auto parts store. Does not work in cold temps. In addition, you have to click through other types of measurements to get to psi. Very annoying when it's -10F and snowing. And, of course, it relies on a battery so it could conceivably stop working some day. I bought the TireTek gauge: 20 bucks but bullet-proof. Do your future, road-tripping self a favor - spend the extra money.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PT18QAQ?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0

B00LNNR9GG|5|bright lights with a hint of blue, love them
B003UWQFKY|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B00MGI60RQ|5|Work and looks awesome!  I can't comment on longevity but they're cheap and bright!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Excellent
B007N6GNT6|4|Good quality and not too hard to put together. Always amazes me that these products come with just the right amount of nuts and bolts. I recommend this cart..
B000TYOS3C|5|Direct replacement.  It worked great.
B000CODLZU|4|The box that the cone fits in not a good fit. Had to fabricate some sheetmetal, then foam it at the bottom to seal off hot air from engine compartment.I'm still satisfied with the product.
B000EDUUG2|5|This is a great broom for our trailer, or for anyone's rv. It adjust really small for storage and really large for use.
B00353PWAW|5|I like the Meguiar's line of products for washing/detailing my vehicles. This wash does a good job, but just because it says wax does not mean it replaces a routine waxing. Overall a good product.
B00MUF1APW|4|Reverse lights are not the best.. But this LED's do a way better job in helping you see what's behind. They're way brighter and more noticeable.
B00JBJ3LKW|3|I just got my truck back today after having these headlight assemblies professionally installed.  Already there is moisture inside the passenger side headlight.  Others have reported similar problems with these headlights.  They would need to be removed from the truck and returned in order to take advantage of the 30-day refund policy, which means more expense and inconvenience. I do not recommend this product - they are a waste of money!  UPDATE: After a few days the moisture inside the passenger side headlight seems to have disappeared; hopefully it won't return but I'm keeping an eye on it. I am willing to give these headlights a higher rating (between 3 and 4 stars), but I'd caution anyone contemplating the purchase of these for their vehicle to be aware of the moisture issue.  2nd UPDATE:  It's been nearly 3 weeks since these headlight units have been installed and the moisture issue has not returned, despite driving in several heavy rainstorms. I can't explain why the moisture first appeared or why it later disappeared - and I certainly can't predict whether or not it will return.  In fairness though, and giving the benefit of the doubt, I will increase my rating to 4 stars.
B00029XGAU|5|Exactly what I was looking for easy to install
B001UC729O|5|Outstanding, fits perfect, functions properly and the price is right!
B0006309MK|2|chaeply made....
B0051TPJKG|4|I have not used it, so I do know how well it work on fires. No plan to ever use it, but if needed it. It will be there.
B003W8FX90|5|Arrived quickly<br />Looks great
B000CQFVOC|5|Warn makes a solid product, these have already taken a beating on my Jeep, would buy again in a heartbeat. I might purchase a set for my TJ as well.
B0019WPJS6|4|no issues as expected.
B008GBSBPQ|5|Hahaha this is great.
B00XQVA6GI|5|I have been anticipating receiving this item all day.  As soon as it was delivered I grabbed it out of the package and arranged my trunk area.  I love all of the pockets and spaces in it!  My trunk was a hot mess of stuff.  Having a two year old calls for keeping random things in the trunk.  I was able to get three beach towels, a first aid kit, toddler shoes, a few small toys, a hat, and more in this organizer.  I took detailed pictures and have attached them so that you can gain a better understanding of how helpful this trunk organizer is.<br /><br />This is a very lightweight material, similar to that of the reusable grocery bags.  Sturdy enough to hold items, but I would not suggest using it to physically carry things around.  The organizer took up about 1/3 of my trunk space when fully opened.  I drive a small SUV, Acura RDX.  If you don't need all the spaces it neatly and easily folds in to a half-sized organizer.  Within each of the large rectangular sections there are elastic straps to hold items in place (see the photo of the paintbrush for an example).  On the sides are smaller mesh pockets for holding other small items.  On one of the ends are pockets with flaps to close as well.  I counted 9 different &#34;spaces&#34; to organize your goods.  I have been wanting one of these for years but always put it off because they were always heavy and expensive.  This was is great for what I need!<br /><br />I have received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. With the intention of helping potential consumers make a more informed purchase decision. No other form of compensation took place.
B00QC28M4G|1|Dome light and cargo light don't fit 2011 fj cruiser! Useless!
B006BDF5PA|5|Worked perfectly!!!! Got it in the mail much sooner than expected and the dealer only charged me $35 to program it to my car
B00U27FO2A|5|Great product
B0041U588Y|5|Perfect replacement after my teenager backed into our mailbox. Seriously thinking about replacing the leaky original on the left side with the same brand.
B0002M7CX4|3|A bit small, but usable. I should have looked at the dimensions first.<br />We have them on a Ford Escape and they could be bigger.<br />It's a clean, well-made product. Also, package contains only one mirror.
B003IS3HV0|1|I am gnashing my teeth that I did not buy the leather conditioner I originally intended to and bought this Leather Honey instead. I'm sure this type of conditioner works well for some types of leather. For me, after cleaning my butter-colored beautiful soft leather love seat well, I find the Honey Conditioner left it glistening and tacky feeling. As some reviewer say, the glistening look should tone down. I hope so. And probably it is some my fault because it does say on the label use a light hand when applying the product. I sure started out that way but I probably added too much. I dried off the excess when I was finished, and I hope that overnight it will dry more and tone down. Four hours later it is still glistening and looks like something I bought at K-Mart, not the expensive Italian leather muted butter yellow so-soft leather sofa I bought. At least I hope it comes off with leather cleaner and I can start over. I am so sorry I spent this much money and did not just stick with the leather conditioner I intended to buy.
B00NS6YC5W|1|Worst shocks ever one went out after 3 months buy Rancho
B00PW30PSC|5|These work perfectly on my 2016 A7. Easiest one minute installation as well. Highly recommend!
B00E0I4T78|4|Did the job just as expected - upgraded bulbs with these harnesses, and it worked just fine! Easy to install - plug and play, really, and seems to handle the additional wattage of off-road only bulbs quite nicely.
B00YBBK9OG|5|Good seller, communication is good. Fast shipping, recieved item a few days early. Easy to install with ability to fit many to all shifters. And so far good quality and hope to get a long time run with it.
B00I1PMDUQ|4|Good product, recommend
B00ES2FT02|5|Nice
B00FQ0ROZS|4|On time nice light
B000C21I16|4|One wire was too long so there was only 1 wire that was the correct &#34;short&#34; size for the front 2 cylinders.... I guess I got a &#34;mismatched&#34; set. They also don't include enough grease
B00X4I95X8|5|Seem good.
B001FCE3SC|5|no more hand crank, and beat the price at the camper  place i baught my camper.
B002VVGPE6|1|After reading all the great reviews I was excited to purchase the Klock Werks 8.5 windshield for my 14 Street.Glide. It looked great. Got on the bike and the turbulence on top of my helmet gone. Yea! One big problem, it created a new problem, major turbulence on the side past my ears. Even with earplugs makes the bike almost unrideable. Such high hopes dashed.  I got busy doing other things and missed the window to return or exchange. I'm 5'8 with lowered seat. I put my $38 dollar 9 in Fastair back on. Not great but much better than Klock Werks. I'm very disappointed.
B010NWSXF8|5|Really cool product, worked great for my chainsaw.  Not a whole lot to say, functions as advertised, quality seems great.
B00IN6XW4Y|4|5 star
B00GOO3RI8|5|Yup, it worked
B00RZ4IKXS|5|i had another set that lasted a year before the wires broke on the the canceler box. These are much better quality. The old set was 32 watt and I can notice the difference in brightness already.
B00HE6CI58|5|I gave it five stars because they work great! Fit perfect in my Frontier map and cabin lights. My only disappointment it's they are not true white, there is a tinge of blue. If I had to guess I would put them at 5500k. However, it does state Xenon White.
B009S31VVW|5|very easy to install. Ive had for about 2 months or so now and it works perfect.
B001FAK28E|3|Hardware is very simple to put onto the windshield body of vehicle however it's difficult and aggravating to remove the factory mirror from the plastic surround in order to mount on this relocation kit.  If you are planning to take off your doors multiple times in the season I recommend relocating until the season is done and then putting the mirrors back on the doors for the winter. It's not worth the hassle of going back and forth more than once or twice a year.  Also, you will not be able to see the passenger mirror. The dashboard and glove compartment obstruct the view. The easier solution (which I ended up doing) is to just buy quick release mirrors for when your doors are off and leave your factory mirrors on your doors permanently.  Much less of a headache.
B000WKCMD6|4|plug worked o.k. - BUT it leaks  -  the outside diameter of the plug would work better if it screwed all the way in not letting a passageway for oil to escape.  Also the outside edge should be knurled to permit removal.  If left in the plug will melt due to engine heat.
B000KK2DZU|5|Great item, fast shipping thankyou
B009DJQ166|5|Works great!!
B0031GRUD0|5|These work for my 2003 F150 extended cab.
B00NF18G98|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 Mercedes E500.  Popped out the old broken one and slid this in place in minutes.  Seems like a factory original for a fraction of the price.  And 5 stars for Amazon too....SAME DAY Prime shipping in Phoenix for no charge -- ordered it from my office at 9:30AM and it was waiting on my kitchen counter when I got home that night.  Wow...
B004I0IJM4|5|Excellent!  Came packaged will, and installed easily...thank you Ford
B00EF1EW6S|5|Quick shipping, easy install without having to remove wheels on my 2500HD, nice fit
B00EC108OG|5|looks great easy to install
B000LNN11G|1|Received completely wrong item.  Threw it away.
B00CPRV6W2|4|Great towel. use for drying my car and when its really dry likes to sometimes stick to the car as you dry. Big deal but its kinda annoying.
B0018EV8QW|5|Looks great. Hesitated about getting the 6 on street glide. Gave the front some lines. Really pleased. I'm 6'1&#34; still get some buffering at this height
B00N4319HS|1|Don't buy to big
B00T9BJ2GE|4|2nd Update: Manufacturer contacted me after reading my review, and has since sent me a new light bar at no cost. So customer service is pretty good!  Update: Light bar has quarter inch of water in it and does not function anymore. I heavily applied sealant to prevent this from occurring, but it was not enough. Looks good In the box, but not a quality product. Cheaply manufactured, but good deal for the price I suppose (if you don't expose it to rain or basic car washes).  The light is super bright and fits perfect in my 2013 F150 Ecoboost 'grill gap'. Fills the space in perfectly. Looks great and is super bright..  However.. 1.) When I received it, the bracket used to mount the light was bent so badly I had to use a vise and plyers to make it usable. 2.) Despite applying automotive silicone to the back of the light where the cable comes out, it has quite a bit of condensation built up in front of the lens. It has been roughly 3 weeks since I installed it.  We'll see if it lasts longer than a few months.  Overall.. you get what you pay for, which is a bright light and a lack of quality control.
B008BVNNK4|1|It wasn't what I was expecting,they don't fit my car the way I thought they will be,dint even put the back cause they don't have seatbelts assembly,so therefore am not to happy&#34; about my purchase.
B00QSLP61S|5|Exelent
B0031I2SNK|5|Great Price
B00FU9R3VA|5|Great product love it very fast shipping and reasonable price
B00AAYG6EU|4|Some lights did not work or maybe they were just backwards. Great overall  i used them for my 2002 civic cluster
B00JBHY0PO|3|It looks great!
B002BRN09I|5|This seems to help alot on our 40' carriage. Our rig was farely stable before but this has helps quite a bit. Its a very well built kit. Comes with everything you need for a variety of different rvs. I installed my self and it took about 5hrs. This WILL NOT REMOVEV ALL MOVEMEMT. However it will removed 90 to 95 percent. If you have a lot of movement i definitely recomend this it will help a lot!
B00O4G1OYW|5|Badass key chain. I love it. Looks great!
B00X52EEU2|5|Took me about 20 minutes to install, in the dark.  So far it is working really well.
B000EQCZ4E|3|The gasket on this filter is a lot thicker than the one on the old filter, making it really hard to fit the cover on. I had to use a large wrench as a lever to force it into place.  Probably not a good idea, but it seems to work. I have a 2005 VUE.
B001KS2R34|5|Better than my stock one and keeps my car clean from dust
B00F8NVQ7K|3|Great light! But the brackets don't work for my 06 Dodge Durango..
B006B7YJ2Q|5|At first I couldn't believe it, but over time my miles per gallon kept creeping up. Now it's higher than ever. Sweet!
B001U7FT9E|4|very simple concept. Easy install.
B003VMVHJW|5|I did not purchase this particular item from Amazon, and I purchased it in gray and black.  I really like the jacket, so I thought I would put my review here as well as on the site from which I purchased it.  I have so many jackets at home.  It was hard to justify purchasing another, but none of them had the breathability for the warmer weather while riding.  My husband rides in his shirt sleeves, but I'm just not comfortable with that.  I don't need the sun directly on my skin, don't really like my shirt blowing all over the place and prefer the containment of a jacket, but it was just so hot!  I didn't want anything really expensive, I wasn't looking for armor and I didn't need anything with a zip out lining because I already have a leather for the winter.  This jacket is perfect!  I've only worn it once (in the evening, 80 degrees and low humidity) and was very impressed.  I'll be interested to see how it feels when the humidity is up, as is typical in the south.  I thought it would feel bulkier because of the armor, but it felt so light on - not at all bulky.  It wasn't confining or stiff; it's soft and moves easily, like wearing a comfortable jersey jacket.  I felt the air flow on my arms through the sleeves.  It appears to be exactly as advertised.  I'm 5'-6&#34; and 160 pounds (yeah, I know, I never thought I would weigh that much either - getting old sucks sometimes).  I'm evenly proportioned, and I purchased a large.  Fits perfectly!  I've only worn it with a short sleeve shirt, but I'm confident a long sleeve, heavier sweatshirt would fit comfortably underneath. I am a happy customer!
B0033XXXG4|5|little welding but knew that going in. love the new jacks.
B00E1ETJNU|5|Excellent!
B0002JMFKW|5|Just PAG Oil only. Getting harder to find this product. Works great where you only want to add oil.
B00I1PFD4Y|5|I really like these twist tie wire connectors.<br /><br />So much better than the crimp style connectors.  I frequently have problems with the crimp style connectors - Crimp the connection, give the wires and one of the wires pulls out about 20% of the time.<br /><br />These connectors worked great for me.  The nicest thing is if the connection doesn't hold or if you need to change the connection you can unscrew the twist connector and redo the connection without having to cut and strip the wires back.
B005ETCIO8|5|We used these to replace the inside lights of our car, and the difference was SO DRASTIC. Easier on the eyes, brighter, and much more even lighting. We also were able to get the added benefit of the lights not generating heat!<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend if these are the right size for your vehicle.
B00KFOGWDU|5|Soo many compliments! Very cute :)
B00BTLEIIY|4|nice seat cover, good thickness and material stitching seems sturdy.  Straps seem good and well attached. Fits my 2014 toyota rav 4 seats.  Yes, there is some negotiation and wiggling, strap tightening and shimying to fit in place- think of how many different make and model car seats this applies to.  different sides of zippers for different sides of 40/60 or 60/40 splits for your back bench seat.
B00979NOWQ|2|Be careful they run really small. I wear a large and I couldn't even get them over my fingers.
B000778LCU|5|Nice
B007FSDRLE|5|A+
B00M01CM80|5|Working great thank you
B00OQVWP6Q|3|This product is good if you can get it from the roll to the car with out it sticking to it self. Very hard I'm not joking it's so sticky that if it touches it self your all done throw it away. For every one you actually get on the floor you go threw 4 lol
B002YKER7G|5|Great product
B005O021OO|5|Excellent, exactly as described!
B00TGPQQTE|5|I got this fuse set for my husband. Him and a few of his buddies are always messing with their cars and the stereos. This fuse set is a perfect little set to have, and it comes in a nice little plastic storage case as well. 100 piece set with 10 each of 10 different size fuses.<br />2A<br />5A<br />1A<br />2A<br />3A<br />5A<br />6A<br />8A<br />10A<br />15A<br />My husband is very pleased with this set and its a great addition to any tool box especially for us since we live in a very small town can't just run to the store anytime a fuse blows out.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B000G6M3VC|5|Easy to use and seems to be accurate.  Highly rated by Consumers Reports.
B000CJ601M|1|TIPS DO NOT COME OFF ... NO GOOD FOR VSTAR 1100 CLASSIC
B000C2WC5M|2|well, it didn't fit, and I had to cut it to try, yet the bend was wrong,
B00JVHLS3G|5|Just a  plastic emblem that you put where your old one went, idk if it's a direct replacement but definitely buy the new keepers for the emblem pins or face the fact that you'll soon loose your emblem because it's not secure properly
B0061GQUS8|3|I bought 3 at the same time and one of them only works when it wants to and that was after only 2 weeks. Hopefully the others last. Looks great and feels strong though.
B00UY5OB1K|5|Very good delighting instructions are in the package kid that is sent with the nerf bar
B0000AXZS0|5|This fits just right for the 15&#34;  5 lug spare tire for the 6x12 trailer that lowes sells.
B008OZY9QO|5|Great!
B00D9DTWQ8|5|I love my Minnie Topper. When I seen some of the reviews saying the color faded or it cracked during the heat I was a little worried. But I've had mine for a little over a year I believe and I live in Nevada and mines still the same color on fine condition. I love it (:
B00K886UJE|3|The Decal is exactly as shown...disappointed in the quality of the material, but OK for the price...also the adhesion is weak...tried to contact the seller, but no response
B000XVZ8F8|1|Trash. Tried it a few times, never worked. One day it just stopped altogether.<br />Power Probe makes a similar product, the ECT 2000, buy that instead.
B00YT1I314|3|Decal showed with no transfer paper on it (AKA a sticker) although its listed as a decal.  I proceeded to put the decal on anyways and while rubbing the bubbles out of the decal, the color started rubbing off. Basically this is white gerber with pink screen printing on top of it, which will never last in the sun or normal car washes.... I contacted the seller before posting this review and the ONLY reason I'm giving these a 3 vs. a 1 is because they sent me a second one free of charge.  So I guess once this one fails, I will at least have another to replace it with...
B00G3Z3TMM|5|Perfect fit - saved a bunch - easy to install
B000X3ZLAS|3|Handy item.  Purchased as a summer motorcycle neck gaiter and occasional face/nose protection.  It is what it is, a seamless, soft, cloth tube.  I laughed when I first opened the package, which no doubt costed more than the actual item!  Another reviewer said it looked like a cut off yoga pant leg, lol.  That's a fair but not totally accurate depiction, as a yoga pant leg has a seam, and this is seamless.  I needed something to cover my neck for those sometimes brisk summer mornings, out of the shower and straight out on my commute.  It fits the bill for this purpose.  Light enough for summer riding, moisture wicking, protects my fresh-from-the-shower neck from the morning (and afternoon) wind.  WOULD NOT recommend for Fall/Winter.  But it could certainly be layered, or used for other purposes.  Neat little thing that you can get creative with, or just leave in your motorcycle or bicycle gear bag for whatever you may need (trail fixes?)<br />I gave it 3 stars because it's really a .25 cent piece of fabric, cleverly marketed in a $5.oo package.<br />***Note to manufacturer; Lower the price to $5 shipped, and you'll likely triple your sales.<br />Cheers!
