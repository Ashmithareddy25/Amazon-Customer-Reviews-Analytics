B004JRVQX0|5.0|Yeah it looks really cool, but the reason for getting it is that many new software developers require this generation of the iLok versus the older ocean-blue ones.  I would say plan to get one because by the time you are about to purchase a new plug-in that needs it, it will be there.  Case in point, ProTools 11 will require this version of the unlock and not the older.
1427210241|5.0|A friend and I read the entire series and I couldn't bare her not being able to finish it. She was able to listen to it before she past. Thank you.
B002UD56I6|5.0|This Blu-ray video shows a wonderful depiction of his final performance rehearsals.  It is both a joy to watch and sad to see.  Despite the declining health of Michael Jackson with his drug abuse problem, he still showed a significant amount of talent and agility that made you love him.  This is a perfect movie for those that truly enjoy the talent of Michael Jackson.  A must-have for any seasoned musician.

B00BEZTMFY|2.0|I have read all of the Tolkien books about Middle Earth, most of them many times.  I was concerned when I heard that they were making a trilogy out of the shortest of all the books, and my concerns turned out to be fully justified.  The Hobbit, as written by Tolkien, is a journey of discovery and self-discovery, wondrous at both.  Tolkien was a meticulous, careful writer and everything in the books is there for a reason.  The books lend themselves to cinema, with their brooding landscapes and range of strange creatures, so it's no wonder that Peter Jackson wants to film them all.<br /><br />Sadly, Jackson gets so caught up in his visuals that the wonders present in the books get sacrificed continuously to the lusty special effects.  Start with the visit of the Dwarves to Bag End.  In the book, the dwarves come in pairs, and each pair comes with a hood of a specific color.  Jackson gives us Dwarves dressed in some cross between Viking travel wear and cloaks designed for winter in Game of Thrones.  No hoods, nothing to make the travelers invisible to the casual eye.  Worse, the brilliantly humorous troll scene, with the trolls tricked into arguing until daybreak about the proper way to cook hobbit turns into an action sequence.  The only scenes that were substantially faithful to the book were the ones between Gollum and Bilbo.  The rest is just a more or less standard fantasy adventure.  I wish Jackson had taken the lessons he learned from the LOTR--that, when in doubt, use the language of Tolkien--and applied them more to the Hobbit.<br /><br />That said, my young adult son loved it.  For him, the brilliant special effects were enough to keep him enthralled.  The trilogy will make money, and no doubt set a new standard for digital film making.  Too bad that they did not leave in enough Tolkien for those of us who love the books. [[ASIN:054792822X The Hobbit]]
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Another great Jane Austen book - as are they all.  Pity there are no more!  A keeper on my e-reader for sure. Great read.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I simply love this bag.  What you get for the price is fantastic.  They clearly took the time to think about what the average photographer needs!
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|Easily the best alternative rock album of 2013 so far. Anyone who likes alternative rock with classical influences can't go wrong here.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful Camera work, terrific acting, and the scenery is divine.  Very thoughtful and interesting.  I truly love it! I really cannot recommend it high enough!
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I loved this movie. I give it the highest rating possible because it was an amazing movie. A must see for Angelina fans! She is terrific!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Once I downloaded this, I couldnt get away from it!  This is such an addicting game. I found myself playing this until my kindle died.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|I give this movie the highest rating possible. It blew me away. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves horror!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Honestly I was ready to be done with this book.  It seemed to drag on for too long.  It did pick up at the end, but if I were to do it again I would choose something else
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I think so much of her books are very close to sposal abuse.  It amazes me the number of women that love the trilogy.
B008N9AASC|5.0|This is one of the most visually immersive films I have ever witnessed. I definitely recommend it. The music and the imagery are woven together in an unforgettable tapestry capturing the splendor of life, death and the never ending dance of the two.
0545323126|5.0|My son read all in a week. Need more books for boys of color. I can't find any here on this site.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|Little predictable, but good nevertheless. Know several people would recommend it to. Good character development. Felt as if could connect.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book is horrifying,, illuminating and enthralling. What a blessing to have simple freedoms we probably take completely for granted.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really liked this book.<br />It was a very easy read and let you get in touch with a more personal side of the zombie apocalypse.<br />It wasn't just about the creatures. It was about the people and how we came together to overcome our enemy.<br />I am really looking forward to see how this is interpreted in the movie version. I hope it captures the true heart of the story - the people.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I got this app for my 4 yr. old cousin. She really enjoyed it. It held her interest which is the biggest test. She was able to figure out how to play it by herself, which was the next big test. Dr. Panda past both. I recommend it for the little ones. Its cute.
B007Z9QY1S|5.0|If you love Madonna for her fashionability, cinematic presentation, and her varied musicality then you should enjoy this movie tremendously.  From the actors to the costumes to the musical score, there permeates a level of sophistication and romance that is held together throughout the entire movie.  Madonna deserves a lot for the crafting and re-telling of one of history's most famous couple's love story. Kudos, Madonna and team. Bravo. Muito leggao!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I LOVE this album. I can play the whole thing on repeat. As on the first he crosses genres. He also crosses decades. It's like going on a journey. I love the throwback feel of the songs and I don't mind the explicit lyrics. The album is just FUN to listen to! I am a major Bruno Mars fan. He is unique when most artists today all sound the same.
B0095P29EG|4.0|It's not the best of the individual character films in MCU Phase I, but it's definitely worth a watch and gives you tons of necessary back story for the Avengers.<br /><br />Some of the special effects especially for the bifrost and the Asgard rainbow bridge are a bit over the top and some of the o<br /><br />Stellan Skarsgard is great.  Thor is a bad ass and it's always fun to see some monsters get pounded.
B002CNOA6S|5.0|This movie was great! Great acting from both leads. I would definitely watch this movie again! It also gave a pretty accurate portrayal of a Savant during that time.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best Beatles album as a whole. Vinyl makes the listening experience much more enjoyable and the music on this album can't be beat.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love everything about it. The only part that's a pain is the sign in and password, but that's life.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|For Emma, Forever Ago is a fantastic album, and vinyl makes it that much better. Bon Iver has a way with music
0345529057|5.0|I haven't actually read the paperbacks, I listen to them on audible while I'm working.<br />They really are amazing. The detail is perfect.<br />He makes it feel so real and lived in. If I could give it more than five stars, I would. Definitely a must read.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|When I downloaded the paid version, it locked after the first level in Egypt. At first I thought I needed to get more stars, so I kept playing England and France, but finally I realized that there was a problem with my game. So I downloaded it again, and it worked perfectly. After reading others' reviews, I think this has happened to other people as well. It is a fun game that I sometimes find quite challenging!
1476733953|5.0|I've been reading Science Fiction for years and WOOL ranks on the top part of my scale. I don't usually do reviews--in fact, this is the first formal review I've ever done, but was so impressed with this book, I wanted to do a review. Without going into specific details since that has been done by numerous people, I'll just review what I think sets it apart: superb character and story line development. Much of Science Fiction depends upon on the \\"wow\\" factor of \\"futuristic\\" fantasy to pull the book and the reader along--more of an \\"event\\" development and flow. Howey does employ superb fantasy development, but of even more interest to me is how he makes the people in the book/story come alive for me. They become real people--not some kind of a shallow figure as I often see in Science Fiction. By the same token he develops several story lines--with all of these characters and story lines intertwined. I think he does this through the believable and thorough detail with which he writes. I find myself caught up in the detail so much so that I feel as though I'm in the story. And I love that it is a series. I especially enjoy the anticipation of that next book coming out. Thank you, Hugh Howey for one of my most enjoyable reads in a long time.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey represents a character that has been lost in today's fignt against terriorism. Can't wait until his next adventure.
B005IGZW0Y|5.0|Loved this book, as it also gave some background to the series on TV, as well as photos.  If you are not a Downton addict, this book is probably not for you..
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It is no wonder that Mr. Clancy is a advisor to our military authorities. They would do well to listen more carefully.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|This has very good range and strong signal as my portable devices only get one or two bars, and it is very easy to install on mac and pc as I tried them both. One thing I was not aware of is that it needed two USB ports, thank goodness I had them or I would be buying a hub. There is one quark on my mac when I disconnect my iphone the Alfa shuts off, however you just go in utility click the off button and push on button after it shuts off and it works just fine. not sure about windows as I do not dock any portable device to them.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|Hey, who doesn't love bunnies and chicks, not to mention a hot looking guy?  In this economy, anyone can identify with a guy looking for a meaningful job, too - the rabbit, i mean.  Hey.  He's a drummer.  He should be drumming.  And if a scruffy human wants to be the Easter Bunny, well i say equality for everyone.  I found myself wanting to be a Pink Beret!  Runaway Wabbits and revolting Chicks - it's a movie that has just about everything in it.  It appealed to the kid in me, and if i get to feel like a kid again for an hour or so, that's a good thing.  And it's a funny movie  - one the kids will like for the story and the adults will appreciate for the humor.  I highly recommend this movie.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|I mean, it's the Shawshank Redemption...what's not to love? It's amazing and I need 9 more words for this thing.
B000I9YLWG|4.0|The new movie &#34;Hitchcock&#34; tells a lot of the inside story of how this movie came to be. The shower scene is certainly among the most scary ever put on film and Janet Leigh (36-21-36) was every young man's dream. (Until she is killed of course). A bit long in the tooth at the end but overall a captivating story well told.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A great insi<br />ght into a secret life of these warriors that sacrifice for the greater good of us all.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is so much fun. Be careful it can become addive. An excellent pastime. Very fast paced. Good for the whole family!
0307120007|5.0|I am not sure why, but every baby I have shown this book to is absolutely fascinated by it.  Despite the illustrations resembling something you would have seen in the 1950s, the book has universal appeal, down the the plastic binding on the side.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|For months this book kept popping up on my “must buy” list, but I couldn’t justify the price for it.  When I finally saw it get to an affordable price, I was embarrassed I hadn’t gotten it sooner.  Travis is definitely a sweetheart …I find myself comparing him to Kellan Kyle (SC Stephens - Thoughtless trilogy).  Travis is ever so patient in some areas while others he just wants it.  I’m not sure how or why he ended up putting up with so much yo-yo stuff but he stuck it out!
B008393Q2O|5.0|Fast, practical and intuitive. I use it on my phone, but I plan to upload it to my tablet also.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game. Ever since I downloaded it onto my kindle, I haven't been able to stop playing it.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|This would be good for a completely inexperienced person.  The notes should say that.<br />All books have their good points.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Not a closure in any of the story lines. These are hours invested that I'll never get back. I feel like I've been flim-flammed.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|So much more information than I ever learned in school!  Saw part of the TV series & really wanted to know more...this book was exactly what I was looking for!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I love this CD. When I got it, in came in brand new still sealed and everything. I love the music. Such a great band.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Addictive and amazing. It so good I hardly can do anything else but read. I could not see the difference between the hardcover and the kindle version, only the price.
B005K17RU0|5.0|When I need a weather report, it is right at my fingertips.  Very easy to use and very informative.  I would recommend this to any one who travels and needs weather reports.  I really appreciate this app.

B0007939NO|4.0|Fun old time movie great for the folks how enjoy the older musicals. Easy to sit back and just enjoy a simplier life.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Couldnt stop reading! It was too good to put down one of the best series ever! Cant wait tostart the next one.
B0053O89IS|4.0|Thankfully the discs don't seem to have any issues and I'm glad I found for such a low price; but I was not happy it was not true to the listing.<br />I don't thiiiink I was wrong to assume that \\"New\\" meant unopened. But then again you know what they say about assuming...
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game plays it for hours and hours, builds and gets very excited when playing the game
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I didn't think I would like these, but I started watching them and now I can't wait for the next Season to come out!!!
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|The book itself was very good and worthwhile reading.It makes you realize the value of time and how important little things are in life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!!!! I think it is a lot better than temple run!!!! Everybody should really buy this game,and it is really fun to play!!
B0051UH6W4|3.0|The story was very well written but the end was quite disappointing. The characters were very well developed with an interesting story line..
0345803485|5.0|the book is in very good conditions it looks just like new i love it, and it didn't take as long as i thought it would take to arrive
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Great way to start a brilliant series!!!  I think its about the future, right??? And we are the rusties, and its about the future... verry interesting... lol :)
B00AZM7IQC|4.0|It was an excellent summary of all the cirque du soleil shows.  It moved along nicely. You will not be disappointed.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I have to admit I was very surprised by the quality of this book- it was really solid on a number of different levels: plotting, characterization, pacing, tone, and depth.  So many of the kindle books I buy have good ideas but desperately need an editor- this one is highly polished.  It's also a great value (it's about double the length of a typical novel, but it's still a page turner that's hard to put down). Really an excellent overall effort.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like all of the puzzles on the game. They are easy to work.  They have good color in them.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|An awesome book that pulls you under and makes you contemplate many things.  A very honest look at dying young.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|when ever I hit download or installed all it does is tell me error please download again over and over what do I do I already paid for this app.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just couldn't wait to have season 2. This is a series worth keeping. Such great characters and such a great story theme.
0691080976|4.0|If you have a young up and comer this is a must buy to involve a youngsters intellect and curiosity. Never know when something will send a mind into orbit
B000UVT3OI|5.0|What can I say about Garth that has not all ready been said?  This is a good CD, for driving or just relaxing.
1476733953|5.0|WOOL is a fascinating story. I originally read WOOL as it came out, catching the first instalment almost two years ago. After buying each of the eBook novellas, I purchased this hard-copy for my wife and daughter to read, both of whom have also enjoyed this well paced, character-driven story.<br /><br />For me, it was the tempo that worked so well. The story continued to expand with each chapter, exploring new areas, not only new areas within the silo and the lives of its inhabitants, but new areas in terms of social issues. And I think it's that depth that separates WOOL from other scifi stories. There's no laser beams, no spaceships or aliens, it's about good verses evil, about honesty verses deception, about freedom verses oppression. And its set in a environment that is chilling for its potential to happen.<br /><br />Don't buy this book if you're looking for a roller-coaster ride, don't buy this book if you're looking for blood and gore, buy this book if you're looking for well-worked suspense, brooding tension and intrigue.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|wonderfully done its the godfather collection so what else are you expecting why do you need to type so many words??
B00AREIAI8|3.0|it was fun at first but then it got boring so I deleted it so I was going to download it again then I was like no.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it's better than temple run.  My grand and great grand children are always trying to beat each other.  As for me I have a lot of practicing to do to even compete, but its fun playing.
1611761565|5.0|This audio book gave detail how our military take care of the country they love like we do and how they elimated one of the worst terrorist in the world.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting. I just can't put it down. Subway surfed is like Mario on speed. U speed up as u go along. Need good reflexes.
B004DMIIVO|4.0|Summer Wars is a visual delight. The story is straight forward: an online portal used by the modern world for shopping, and lot many other things is taken over by artificial intelligence virus program hacking accounts and then planning the catastrophe on earth which is then challenged by it's teenage creator and friends. It's a typical Japanese movie that would engage you till end.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Any movie with Denzel is great. You could picture him as being a real pilot. It also had a Good ending. I would have believed this may have been based on a true story somewhere.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A fantastic book for late elementary/ middle school students.  It embodies empathy without preaching.  Humorous and moving.  Great read aloud for teachers.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|my 6 year old really likes this art game.  it is very easy for her to figure out the different settings, and she really likes all of the different shape and color options available.
B005LAIIFS|4.0|At just seeing the commercials for this movie I didn't think that I'd like it; however, my son and I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a cute little action thriller and the story line is a good one.
B0086AYAQ6|5.0|Each work was surprising and exciting. Her playing can be fast but clear .. none of the recordings were disappointing.  It is a joy that her persistence to be heard resulted in this new recording.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun and Adam Sandler was wonderful as the voice of Dracula.  My son and I have watched this movie over 20 times already.  It is a keeper.
B0094LZY2A|4.0|This movie is a lot of fun for the kids,  a classic really.  It actually holds my three year old son's attention pretty well.  Although there are a few parts that can be borderline scary for children so make sure your watching it too,  that way you can use the old hands over the eyes trick like I do with my son while saying \\"Oh no,  spooky, spooky\\". But seriously is fun for all ages to watch.
B00947N6UG|4.0|It's a cartoon. It's funny.  These area's for responce need to have some basic controls. Like overwrite and Stop requireing a minimum number of words.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I like this book up until the ending.  Along the way you found out more details about the characters in this book but I felt that the ending was a let down.
B00993G41S|5.0|The cast is first class, the story funny and imaginative. If you like the cast members you'll like the movie. To me it is extemely funny. Again all things are the taste of the viewer.
0930289234|3.0|One can admire Watchmen greatly. The writing, characterization and plotting are all exemplary. The art, clean and imaginative.<br /><br />But what a dark and cynical vision of humanity this is!<br /><br />For here is a world with no heroes. The Watchmen are masked vigilantes without any real opponents. The one 'super-villain' is old and dying. The Watchmen swagger about, a law unto themselves. Among their number are violent psychopaths (i.e. most of them), several murderers (one Stalin-level) and at least one rapist. One could imagine that a Nixon banning such beings would be acting with great public support.<br /><br />Now it could be argued that this is Moore's purpose. No doubt his message is: don't trust those who seek power for themselves. After all, the constant refrain here is 'who watches the watchmen?' Is Nixon right, then, to ban them? This would undermine Moore's apparent view that great power is inevitably corrupting since the government's action has probably saved the country from the Watchmen's even greater abuses. Perhaps Moore's point is: Government power is good, but individual power is bad?<br /><br />Whatever the case, the rightness or wrongness of the Nixon government's banning of costumed 'superheroes' is not much pursued beyond merely being stated. But it does weaken the question 'who watches the watchmen?' since the answer to that is \\"why the government, of course!\\" and the government is never held up to scrutiny in the same way.<br /><br />One is left with the impression that Moore wants us to think that the Watchmen are authoritarian for behaving the way they do but that bogey-man Nixon is also authoritarian for banning them. This is not entirely well thought out.<br /><br />But a greater failing of this work, in my view, is a lack of a credible character who offers, even cursorily, a happier view of humanity. There are no good characters in Watchmen, merely differing levels of cynicism. This is a superhero version of King Lear, a world of darkness, cynicism and nihilism. Yet even Shakespeare's darkest play allows some hope and goodness in. In Watchmen, there is not one genuine hero, super or otherwise, period. Everyone in a costume is in it basically for themselves, either because of they are psychopaths, control freaks or thrill-seekers. This ultimately fails to convince me because it contains no one to challenge the over-arching cynicism of the narrative, No Fool or Cordelia or Gloucester to balance out the endless Edmunds, Gonereils and Regans.<br /><br />Such a cynical world view was greeted ecstatically by critics and Watchmen, along with the contemporaneous Dark Knight Returns, ushered in the Dark Age of Comics where such world weariness and nihilism became the norm. One cannot blame Moore because his dark vision was taken up by hacks, but there is something ugly and untruthful even in this Ur-text.<br /><br />The truth is that we see real acts of heroism every day, firemen who enter burning buildings at their own risk or people who volunteer their time to help others. This is the basic notion of the superhero, an altruistic being who will risk life and limb simply to save another. The superhero has no ulterior motive. He is not a psychopath or thrill-seeker but a person of the highest moral integrity. The subverting of this concept, which took place during this era, is not to my mind, a truthful vision but rather cynicism masquerading as sophistication.<br /><br />Moore is suggesting that there is no goodness in the world, that heroism cannot exist except as a form of mental illness, that selfishness is the only real motivation. it is not a vision I can share for all the excellent qualities of this work.
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|IF you like action movies, this is a very good movie.  Gina Carano is great.  She is a very good actress in this kind of role.  She is very believable as a private covert intelligence operative.  I was thoroughly involved in the movie from beginning to end.  Definitely worth watching if you enjoy this type of movie.  I was very surprised it didn't do to well in the theaters.
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|Are there plenty of &#34;flaws&#34; as far as realism goes? Yes, indeed there are. But when I put my judgment aside and simply experience the story and what ever world it happens to be in, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|What else would you expect from Adobe other than another reader for another environment. This is what they do and it's free!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|4 stars for this season, simply because on several occasions the story fell short by too easily providing the solutions for major problems. Things that should have taken time and struggle to resolve, were resolved in the space of one episode. It wasn't that the solution was inappropriate, just that it conveniently showed up so quickly. This happened with several issues. Overall a wonderful, enjoyable, entertaining series.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Creo que es de las mejores pelis de acción de los últimos años, y no sólo eso, sino que está muy bien hecha.<br />A quien le guste este tipo de pelis, se la recomiendo sin ningún lugar a dudas.<br />Las cinco estrellas son más que merecidas, por ser la mejor peli de acción en años, por estar bien dirigida e interpretada, sin tener interpretaciones artificiales ni nada por el estilo.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I have used a space mouse for many years and in various CAD programs. This one works just as well as the higher priced units, just doesn't have the extra buttons that I would not use anyway.<br /><br />The only problem, and it is minor, is with drift when manipulating very large 3D models. Re-calibrating does not solve this, it's just inherent in the design, as it was with older similar space mouse models. A slight tap or bump to the knob will usually stop the drift.<br /><br />The SpaceNavigator makes manipulating 3D models so easy that I don't like working without one.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|i bought this for my kindle HD to be able  to watch my home videos but id didnt work at all...will not recommend

B000FCKGPC|3.0|After finishing the first 3 books in the series, A Feast for Crows is quite a downgrade. Martin spends the majority of the book developing relatively boring characters or neglecting the characters with the most potential. The book is still entertaining, but I can't help but feel that Martin either doesn't know where he wants to take the series, or he is having a tough time trimming the fat.<br /><br />Overall, the book is still enjoyable, and I still advise avid fans of the series to read it. Hopefully Winds of Winter will pick back up with A Storm of Swords' fast-paced and thrilling pace and content.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I LOVED this book. I honestly could not put  it down. It was a thrill a minute. I became so entranced with the characters.
0345529057|5.0|This is a great starter to the series and a very good read.  The books are imagenative and well wrtitten.

B001EC2J1G|5.0|Love the movie and the actor's. The soundtrack in this movie is AWESOME!! Sound's great on my stereo. I would definately recommend it.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|This downloaded perfect and conveniently to my Kindle... love this CD!  Would recommend it to friends and family.  You get it &#34;on the spot&#34;!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|No question about it.  Been using this since it had only 3 themes. Tried others but always come back to this.
B0056TYT66|5.0|my 2 yr old computer had no usb 3.0 nor sata3, so this card worked perfectly.<br />Plug & play on win8, what else could I say.<br />The instruction is funny, no English. Have all other language but no English?<br /><br />Thx for the other comments that put the card to my pcie 2.0 slot.<br />So far the only card I've seen that does USB and Sata threes together.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  John Grishams' stories and characters are so believable and the book moves at a fast and eally interesting pace.  Highly recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book was recommended by friends.  I had not heard of it before.  Very erotic and not overly done.  Great read.
B003PVPXOE|5.0|its good. it says there are more words required so i'll write this sentence with a few extra words. It's good.
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|She is a very funny writer, at the end of the book I was none the wiser of how to be a woman,which in my view is the point of the book,  and the journey through the book was very enjoyable. Had a few good laughs.
B005HSL626|5.0|my children and husband love playing fruit ninja.  they could probably spend hours playing the game if I would let them.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Easy to get hooked on if you're at all interested in history.  I was around for the Viet Nam and the '60s. I was born just after WW II and saw how it and Korea accelerated social change in the '50s.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vice Flynn is a great story-teller.  I have enjoyed the entire series of Mitch Rapp adventures.  This one was the cherry on top of an ice cream sundae.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|My daughter loved this series so much that we ordered the books.  She is only 10 but she echoed what millions of book readers have said for years. The movie was good but the books are better.  I watched this movie with her and though I do not have time for books anymore, I will watch this movie again.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I will be brief: Buy This Album!!!! I heard 'Suit and Tie' the lead single from JT's new album 'The 20/20 Experience' and I liked it a lot but I had not idea what was to follow. I just purchased the album today because everyone was buzzing about how good it was! And they would be right! I love the album from start to finish, it truly is like you're experiencing a journey: non other than Justin Timberlake style lol. I can't say I like one track over the other, they all bring some form of uniqueness! Big up's to JT for coming back extra hard with this hit! Get ready for the Grammy's! Shouts out to Mr. Timothy Mosley aka Timbaland for hooking up the sick beats for every track on this album. Truly a classic blend of Pop, Hip-Hop, Soul, R&B, and much more! Thanks JT, this one is for everyone: Congratulations on your growth since 'N Sync and all of your current and future successes!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The dvd was a better quality than seeing it in the movies.  I have an inexpensive house brand 1080P 60hrz 55&#34; HDMI television and an inexpensive blu ray player that I purchased 4 years ago and I was amazed at the picture and soound quality reproduced by this blu ray disc!  I saw this in the theater when it came out but the reproduction on the disc was much better than the theaters production.  I have purchased several blu rays from amazon and by far they all have better picture quality than the theaters.  The studios should really consider releasing them on blu ray at the same time as they are released to the theaters because I am not going to a theater again, I am waiting for the blu ray.  I would pay extra for that previlage.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice calculator app to use for your everyday calculations with great user interface. Everyone needs a calculator and this is the one to get.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I couldn't stop reading it. I have loved all of his books and this was no different. My husband grew up in NC and I like reading about the area.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I didn't give it 5 stars because it was a great movie. It was ok. I gave it five stars because of Amazon customer service. My Internet went down halfway through the movie and wasn't back on until the rental expired. I called customer service and they gave me another 48hour rental for free because of it. Again I say Amazon is my store of choice once they do groceries I will then order everything from them. Amazon Prime for LIFE!!!! I just wish I could pay for a lifetime membership. I at least order 2-3 things a week from them. It's great but can cause me to spend a little bit more money than I would like. I see stuff that is a bit cheaper (usually better price on Amazon) but I still will order from them there service is 2nd to none, and with my Prime account it's even better than having to drive to Walmart. I hate Walmart they kill towns. Amazon for lifE!!!!!
0425252868|5.0|I enjoy WWII stories and have never read one from this perspective.  It was very interesting but also a great read.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read, so I think every body should have read this before.
B00004RJ71|5.0|It was an awesome buy!  DVD was brand new and received it sooner than anticipated!  I would definitely purchase from this vendor again!
B0095P31L6|5.0|Johnny Depp did a great job with Rango, breathing life into the reptile.  The writing is very witty, with a lot of adult jokes hidden in the dialogue.  Although I watched this on a brand new 65\\" plasma, I was wishing I was in the theater, the animation was SO incredible.  My 7 and 9 year old boys loved the action, and my wife and I had a lot of fun.<br /><br />I can see why it won best animated feature in 2011.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I read some of the one-star reviews.  Most of them complain about the movie not being for kids. Yeah, most of the witty dialogue and historical Western references will be lost on them.  But to me, those made the movie interesting.  The jokes don't bash you on the head like a kids' movie, you actually have to put some thought into them.  The verbal and visual details in the film are brilliant.  I guess if you like ultra-simple comedies, this is not your film.
B00947N6D8|5.0|There is a lesson in values that the little ones, and even older generation, can grasp from this story.  Finding his core is Jack Frost's goal in proving why he was chosen to be a guardian.  He finds the purpose of his existence as he is challenged to support the other established guardians to fight the evil boogey man, who is attempting to destroy the innocence little children are made of, sweet dreams and belief in Santa Claus.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was little and love to have copies of them on hand.<br /><br />Awesome performance by Val Kilmer. :)
B000FA675C|5.0|Excellent thinking story line. Characters felt real as did the subject matter. Mixing history with fiction gave it that extra punch to keep me reading and question it's many possibilities. A keeper to read over and over.
0425170349|5.0|This story kept me on the edge the entire way.  It was more exciting than any action flick, and I couldn't put it down.  As the first Clancy book I read, I couldn't wait to read another.  Without Remorse was next, and was great as well.  Vengeance stories are definitely my style.<br /><br />The last Clancy book I read was Teeth of the Tiger.  I was significantly less impressed by it.  The story ended as soon as the plot developed.  I felt like 10 chapters had been left out of the middle.<br /><br />Anyway, check it out.  Definitely a good read.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We watched it as many times as we could in the time allotted.  We laughed and laughed.  The children are quoting lines from it as they go about everyday life.  It's funny to hear someone start singing O-Ree--O as they do their chores.
072325804X|5.0|Granddaughter is loving this book.  New story every night.  Unbelievable that these stories are over 100 years old, still able to capture the attention of 5 year old.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This book will change your life, thinking and outlook.<br />It's just amazing what Frankl endured and came out of it with such wisdom and no bitterness.<br />A book that everyone should read.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I download the free software and I had to get the full story. I have trouble putting the game down because it keeps you engrossed in the story line. I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys playing a variety of different types of games.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I just love NKOTB and this is one of my favorite albums that they have put out! Cant wait to see them in concert
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I love this game its just kinds gets boring after awhile I :think you should be able to do some more stuff like no buying extra things it costs to much
1476733953|5.0|Well written,novel story idea. Passed it on to friends. Makes you think about our future. Look forward to the movie and Howey's next book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It takes just a couple min to check and compare weather conditions in locations I am most concerned about. Details for each are a touch away from your home page.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This is a good HO game. I got a little frustrated in a few spots but finally got it !! Worth the price!!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Best heart wrenching romance with beautiful people! Great quality; I have no complaints whatsoever! Be sure to have reliable internet connection so you may enjoy the entire movie without interruptions. Enjoy!
B008X8P8A8|5.0|Challenging, fun, easy to master and pretty good graphics. I wish they made ROME version! Loved that game and am craving the new PC release...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game great time killer and so fun especially for kids. Recommend this game so much. Take my advice get this game.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Children appropriate. Thinking included. Ages 5 and up. 3 stars. What do you think?<br />My name is Sally Adventure and this is my report.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show has been great from the very first episode until the finale of season 3.  Great characters, and great premise.  I'm not even that into zombies.  Its just like a Stephen King book, or the show &#34;LOST&#34;.  Love it!
0316069434|5.0|I have read most , if not all of Michael Connelly books  up to The Black Box and I very much enjoy them
1476733953|5.0|Excellent read. This was a word-of-mouth recommendation, so I grabbed the first part on my Kindle. Within 5 minutes I was hooked!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Wao! I am highly impressed by this product! I recommend it FOR ALL! I stayed glued all night to this film! Highly recommended!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this all the time to help me remember things I want do, movies I want to see, serial numbers for products I've bought.  It just replacement paper notes.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My children who are 6 and 3 love this game. In this game you are able to cut,style,color and wash the avatars hair. There are 5 or 6 to choose from they have both male and female. After styling them up you can add accessories and take their picture which is saved to your android device. If the avatars do not like the style that you are giving them they make funny sounds or faces and if they do like it they also have expressions. It is a very creative game that is very age appropriate
B005K17RU0|5.0|Before I get out of bed, I check the weather and find this to be very accurate.  Plus it has nice maps if you like those visuals.
B0037AGASG|5.0|muy bueno lo recomiendo suena bien bien y el traslado fue el dia que  indicaron y seguro lo recomiendo 100%
1432794426|5.0|This book showed a side of MJ that I have never read about before.  It shows the real MJ and not just the celebrity information we are used to reading about.  By the end of the book, my total outlook was changed on MJ and our current news/media process.  Read this if you want to know about the real MJ as a person.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|its pretty fun something to pass the time I'm not gonna sit here and say YOU BETER GET THIS NOW THIS IS THE BEST! because its not the levels are pretty easy but it can be to pass the time
B005IQZB14|5.0|Her journey makes you believe you can do anything! I also loved how she perfectly describes the relationship with her mother and how that loss truly left her empty. I cried!
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Very nice workout plan. Offers variety and various levels. You can adjust your daily workout according to your needs and level of energy. Great to have as an app. It will dictate your workout, so you don't have to get up and look at the screen, just follow the directions and get in shape.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|It's a nice little controller. It fits in the hand nicely and is easy to play with. The only thing I don't like about it is that it only works for like 5 games! Come on gamloft 50 dollars is a rip off for only 5 games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best mobile games. WAY BETTER THAN TEMPLE RUN! YOU WILL LOVE IT! It has a Daily challenge to earn extra coins. I'm trying to unlock a character, and the challenge is great for reaching my goal.
0061784788|4.0|The Devil Colony is the seventh book in the Sigma Force series and my first exposure to it. I haven't read any other book in this series but felt confident enough to go in as the series seemed to be standalones with common characters. In this story, Sigma Force gets involved in a case of the death of a research team member in a cave in Utah. Painter Crowe is put in charge of the case and is under pressure for earliest possible closure. He also realizes that his niece is somehow involved as she was last seen leaving the cave as the explosion took place. It is also apparent that two groups called, The Guild and True Bloodlines are involved in this case.<br /><br />The author takes his time to introduce his repeat cast which made it really easy for a first timer like me. I especially loved Seichan's character since it's the most complicated and difficult to predict. Gray Pierce can hold his own too and is the perfect partner for Seichan. Painter Crowe is also an interesting character to get introduced to. It seemed that he was back on the field after a long time, yet he warmed up to me immediately.<br /><br />The plot is in the line of something that I haven't read in a long time. It weaves together history and fiction along with science, suspense and action in a way that in the end it is much more than just a historical fiction. Usually with these kinds of books (with scientific concepts) I often have to go back and look up the initial explanations/introductions. But the author has spread out and explained his concepts slowly and really well making things easy enough for everyone to understand. What was most interesting to read was the chain of events depicted in the book... a cave explosion in Utah could very well result in the geological meltdown of the western half of United States.<br /><br />As for my part, I will be sure to catch up on the previous installments of the series as soon as possible.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|my grandkids love playing this game.  There are a lot of giggles while playing it.  They are always asking to play the piggy game.
B005K2XNGG|5.0|I love this product.  It keeps my kindle safe. It is also wide enough to fit my kindle with the protection cover on it.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|People have complained that Mad Men plots are too slow, too meandering, too full of style over substance. That may have been the case for previous seasons, but Season 5 manages to maintain the impeccable style of previous seasons while improving on the pacing and storylines. I won't spoil any of the plot lines here, but suffice it to say you must watch it! Best season of Mad Men by far.
B0045HCJFS|5.0|Kurt Russell is probably one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. Love him in this great thriller! Buy and enjoy!
B001EGFQNU|5.0|Didn't know they had so many videos! Had been wanting to get this for a while. Must have for any OMD fan! Don't miss out!
B000I9W08I|5.0|This is an outstandingly entertaining film with Streisand at her best. When younger I was taken to this show by my mother- a true aficionado of great movies! Buy and enjoy with confidence!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have become a huge Hugh Howey fan. All of his books are fantastic. Be prepared to read all the Wool books because once you read this first one, you will be hooked!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|It is so great that they filmed the movie with the actors singing real time.  It added more emotion to the delivery.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love the graphics. A little different than other venues of minecraft but definately fun fun fun! Worth the little bit of money for wqhat you get.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a great remake of Les Miserables.  I loved the actors and even the singing.  Even though Russell Crowe talk/sings I still loved his portrayal of Javert.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is one of my favorites. I recommend it. if you love horses but can have on this is the next best option
B00AU15HPC|4.0|As a long-time fan of both the Moody Blues and Justin Hayward, as a solo artist, I can recommend this CD as a must-have for any serious Justin Hayward fan.  The entire CD is the typical, great non-Moody Blue type music Justin Hayward has made his trademark.  I enjoyed the entire CD with the exception of the last track, the Paul Rincon Remix of \\"Out There Somewhere.\\"  This track should never have been included on the CD as it detracts from the overall presentation of a great CD.
0307960471|4.0|I enjoyed the writing and humor, and the surprise ending.  The book was hard to put down.  I recommend this book!
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|This book, in less than a week of thought and implementation has made more of a difference for me than any other in my collection of over 300 on personal and business development.  It is a life resource, invaluable in today's information and option overload and will be a game-changer for young adults.  The material should be offered to high school seniors everywhere.
030758836X|4.0|I enjoyed the suspense and the surprise ending.  The book was hard to put down and I recommend the book!
0439023521|5.0|I like the hunger games movie so I had to get the book! But I didn't want to spend 9 dollars or more so I knew that Amazon would have it for a great price!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Was curious about Lee Child's series of his character Jack Reacher. Saw the movie with Tom Cruise and that is what piqued my interest. Must admit, the book had me right from the start and thoroughly enjoyed it. So much so, I bought and read &#34;Die Trying&#34; and am currently reading &#34;Tripwire&#34;. Nicely written and easy to read this genre of books.... Looking forward to spending my summer taking in all the Jack Reacher books.
B0081X40HW|5.0|This album is the best! I had got it for a steal! I was gonna go on itunes but it was way more cheaper on amazon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the movie but the book brings more depth to the story. If you liked the movie read this. If you haven't seen it yet read the book.
B0050DZN4K|2.0|This app has so much promise, but since the last update it's become so buggy that it's hardly worth opening. For instance, what prompted me to write this review: no matter how many times I try to open a new post, it keeps opening the last one I read. I'm sure I'll find a work around, or it'll suddenly start working correctly again, but I'm getting tired of these bugs. Also, in the middle of reading something, it'll suddenly require me to log in again, losing what I was reading in the process. Wtf? I can't imagine it would be of much value if you found yourself offline and mistakenly assumed you could read your content offline, much as I do on other readers. Because, you know, I can't login to google reader when I'm offline, and this stupid app won't let me read anything until I've logged in again. And this happens several times a day, at a minimum. Again, wtf?
B000002NC4|5.0|Granted, Built to Spill is probably my favorite band in the world, so pretty much every album of theirs is going to get 5 stars. This album differs from their other albums and live shows because it seems the songs are 'reeled back in' at some point to keep it from going off into musical wonderland... Which, if you have seen them live, you know is just habitual for Doug and the gang. So it feels as if this album is somewhat curtailed, compared to what the band is really capable of. Anyways, if they come to your town, do yourself a favor and go see them live!
0374105235|5.0|Excellent book. Very interesting. The book was in good condition. I couldn't put the book down one I started reading it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great little alarm clock. I love that you can set multiple alarms and multiple ways (music from playlist or artist, various alarm sounds) to be awakened. Also love that you can set the amount of time for each time you hit snooze.  It's never let me down on my Kindle Fire.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great fiction mixed with history. Takes the reader throughout Europe on a mysterious trail to find the secret of the Templars.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was amazing. While there were times that I just felt too disturbed to continue and needed something lighter to read, I am so glad that I pressed on. The author did a fabulous job (in my unexperienced opinion) of detailing the horrors of an abusive relationship and the trauma that comes with that. The writing was similar to what I have come to expect from British authors, slightly clipped with dialogue that sometimes feels a bit chopped. She is also not as concerned with descriptive writing as I tend to be. No matter, this book passed one of my tests for a great book. As soon as I finished it, I flipped to the beginning to relive my favorite parts!
B007ZXK08C|1.0|An oft used adage is if you are not captivated in the first 45 pages then forget it. 90 pages on I was still very bored with the back and forth opinions of trivia,and this is noted as a thriller?
1932100660|1.0|i pay for the book in spanish and you sended in english, i cant readed was in my closet slways disappointed with your service
B007REV4T8|3.0|Was not to bad but not like any other James Bond movie if it had not been for the James Bond music it eAs just like any other movie/
B000002LEM|3.0|I'm not a huge Van Halen fan, but I do own all of their albums and I can easily say that this is not a great VH record. There are a few good tunes, and Sammy sounds great as usual but the album as a whole just feels weak. It has that early 90's vibe that now feels very dated. If you like Van Halen or are a fan Sammy, I would say pick this up (especially for $4.99). If you are looking for an album full of hits, then you might want to just pick one of their greatest hits albums.<br /><br />Standout Tracks<br />Cabo Wabo<br />Source of Infection<br />Finish What You Started<br />Black and Blue<br />When It's Love
0783225849|4.0|Exelent. I first saw Psyhco when I was in Hong Kong some 50 years ago and brought back some good memories
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Not quite as humerous as I thought it would be.  Overall a good read.  Eagles fans will love it.  Good insight on normal dysfunctional families during football season.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|Not to bad, enjoyed whatching it.Nice to see all the old Movie stars once again, disn't raelise it was a series though
B007EECSFA|5.0|I GUESSED THE MYSTERY COMPLETELY wrong, which is a good thing; Morton was able to surprise me!  I cried too!  I highly recommend this WWII story
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Exelent is about all that one can say about Downton Abbey, it was a masterpiece in it's self, we now have all of the series of Downton Abbey.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Another slam dunk for one my favorite country singers!  This one has the outlaw swagger for which Blake is known so well.  Excellent choice and just a fun listen all around!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really loved it!<br /><br />  I like animal stories, especially dog stories  My daughter recommended this book to me and she was right.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I got the game off of amazon.com and it took 2 hours to load but wouldn't work. what a waste of money! ugh tried 3times already
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey! It is very addicting. You have to start from the beginning and watch all the episodes.I would watch it every night:)
B005LAII80|5.0|one of the better 3d effect movies i have.<br /><br />it's a great rendition of a graphic novel.  if you're expecting a fantastic story line, go elsewhere.  but, if you're expecting a relatively good movie interpretation of a graphic novel, this works well.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I haven't heard music this good in a long time.  Almost every track has depth to it.  I would highly recommend!
B00867GKIK|5.0|the reviews are right.  not only is this a fantastic movie, but it looks fantastic on a 3d tv.  i'd recommend it to anyone.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is one of those movies that you can enjoy watching over & over, such interesting characters and rich story line.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|i don't have the same longing for this game from yesteryear that others have, so i am not as skewed.  but, the 3d is there.  the HD conversion is not as fantastic as i would have hoped (i.e., don't expect ps3 quality on this.  i don't know what the ps2 version looked like, but this is just barely a step up, imho).<br /><br />for 20 bucks, it's definitely worth it.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|While parts of the book was funny, it was just an okay read.  So glad I purchased it when the price had dropped by 1/2; and even then not sure it was worth the price.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|i saw this movie on imax and real3d in theaters, and the tv 3d version compares well to the imax version.  i was VERY impressed with the 3d quality on this.<br /><br />i'd still recommend this to anyone with a 3d tv, top of the list.  the story is silly, but for exhibition of 3d effect, you gotta have it.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Purchased as a Christmas gift for a friend.  She loved it and we listen to it together in the car.
0634022296|5.0|194 songs of Beatle talent. My younger brother recently passed away and took all his Beatle knowledge with him. I bought the book to honor him by learning the songs he  would sing.  He sang a million Beatle tunes a million times, but those were the ones everyone wanted to hear most. Just leafing through it brought back memories of a long gone era. Our little group is trying to keep it alive and this little gem will help us. It's actually written for guitar, not piano, like a lot of books are. Some of the of the chords are simplified or you are given alternates which may be easier to play.  Very easy to read font to help in the cheat book vocals.  Can't wait to get started.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|A great bedtime game to unwind from a long day. I look forward to the next one to be released
B003L77G2Y|5.0|One of the greatest sci fi serials EVER. I really love this story but you need to get on board at season one.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Only took 2 days to read! In some places this book is not super well written, but the story is very compelling and kept me interested.<br />Overall, a good read!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Historical, beautiful scenes and settings, compelling storylines, superior acting. If you are sick of fake reality, faux celebs, and here today gone tomorrow network shows, you will love Downton Abbey.
B008VZD12K|2.0|Boring rewrite of history.  Should have stayed with the actual history, not rewrite from a liberal viewpoint.  Very poorly edited
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I find it confusing to try to use.  I was trying to get Google Earth for my Samsung Galaxy S III and somehow this was downloaded.  I don't use it.
B003OUXECE|5.0|Played the game LONG before I read this book, but still found it interesting and informative. Filled in a lot of blanks about Rapture. Altogether a good read for Bioshock fans.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Satisfactory overall.  I quickly started playing at the 5 level.  I find it tends to \\"even the playing field\\" on occasion; i.e., making a series of rolls, both for me and my \\"opponent,\\" that keeps the game \\"competitive.\\"  That is to say, on those occasions it doesn't feel natural in how a game progresses.  By way of background, my wife and I have been playing for over 30 years now.  We have separate backgammon sets in our home, in each of our cars, and on our boat.  By latest calculation, she is ahead by approximately 13,500 to 11,250.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Adobe reader is one of those essential tools I tend to take for granted because I use it all the time. This is my preferred method of sharing documents.
B009R659L8|1.0|This was so disappointing! The content was missing on almost every other page and I tried to get through it but couldn't. Will order again if I hear the problem has been addressed.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My Alarm clock is a very useful and practical app with a lot of extra decorations and settings. There are different clock faces and tunes to wake up to, making it more suited to your lifestyle. It has additional weather information and the date. I have absolutely no complaint with this program.
B007B5EDEG|4.0|Fantastic story, great insights into the strengths and weaknesses of humans but a little average in the style of writing. This book has a lot of plots running simultaneously so you have to have your wits about you keeping up with all the characters but its a grand adventure for the poor old Stark Family and few others. I'd especially recommend reading it if you have been  / are watching the TV adaptation because the background helps understand why some event or person is really significant later on. As I said the writing style seems, to me at any rate, a little flaky but it isn't a big deal. I think its well worth the cash
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was my book club pick for April.Well written great historical novel.It felt like you were on the southern plantation.
B009MFKO3M|4.0|Far Out! this album has some really great moments on it. Occasionally though I find the band relies  on the drenched guitar sounds  and effects too often
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Jewels games are my favorite. This game is not too difficult but it is addictive and fun. I like the little fish and the meteor shower.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is just an entertaining movie that we thoroughly enjoyed. Judi Dench was wonderful as always. Would recommend to anyone that want to view a movie that is great!
6304712499|4.0|Good have been looking for this movie sense I was in middle school. Was in great condition and brought many memories.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|My friends seemed to be crazy over the series by E L James.  However, I barely made it through the first book in the series.  It just didn't appeal to me as a woman of middle age, and the whole bondage thing was a turn off to me.
0380730405|5.0|I am an avid reader, a couple of books a week.  I am not sure how many times I have read Rebecca, and I can still read it again.  I think it is probably one of the best written books ever, the content, the writing, the tension, the characters - just superb.  It is the complete package.  Some contemporary writers could learn a lot by reading Daphne du Maurier's works.  Not to undermine contemporary writers because a lot of them are terrific.  She also wrote one of my favourite short stories, \\"The Old Man.\\"  If you have not read it, do so and let your mouth fall open at the conclusion!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought this would be a depressing book, however, I found it to be inspiring.  It is a beautiful love story.
B004RC8NXI|4.0|Funny romantic comedy, good for couples, friends, basically anybody who wants a laugh. I’ve had issues with the BluRay since day one. I put the disc in my BluRay player & it doesn’t do anything, it looks like it’s loading but never does. I checked the disc, it's not scratched, I immediately tried other BluRay discs in my player & they worked, I even tried playing it on another BluRay player to no avail; clearly it's this one particular BluRay disc. The good news - it comes with both DVD & BluRay, so at least I’m not hooped, however, I would've preferred to watch the BluRay, obviously.<br />The Movie: I enjoyed it, it was funny, clever & the chemistry between Natalie Portman & Ashton Kutcher was great. I much preferred this to “Friends with Benefits” for many different reasons, one being the comedy factor but mainly because I didn’t see the chemistry between Justin Timberlake & Mila Kunis, whereas I did see chemistry in “No Strings Attached”, maybe it’s just me.<br />Overall: Besides the issues with the BluRay copy I received it’s good, I just won’t watch it in HD, at least it’s not some major flick with all sorts of great cinematography.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Now here's another book I read in one day..wonderful story..nice change from the other types I read...Will check out the movie but, as usual, the book is better!
B001992NW4|5.0|I saw this movie at a young age & was immediately intrigued, I began doing all sorts of research about exorcisms. I’ve seen the entire Exorcist series & in my opinion, the first one is the best.<br />The BluRay Disc: It’s fantastic that they finally released both versions of the movie on BluRay all in one package, I’m even happier that I waited to buy it so I was able to get this edition. The quality is great, the sound, the picture, everything is awesome. Any true fan of “The Exorcist” should have this in their collection. The Special Features are good, this is one of the few movies that I’ve actually watched features for. I loved seeing the Behind the Scenes footage with Linda Blair, also, the interviews with the cast, director & writer are well done.<br />Overall: I’m so glad they finally put everything altogether in one great collectors edition! The package is great, the quality is awesome. I found the cheapest price to be on Amazon, I had done some research before buying it, I’m grateful I bought it right away because the price has skyrocketed! If I remember correctly I paid between $15-$18 for this BluRay Special Edition & now it’s $60 - yikes!
B009X01C64|4.0|i like but make sure its snapped in right. it will fall out. i dont like the back strap. maybe it should be a little smaller
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The book had exciting action, romance & had many plots with different people going on thru out the book.<br /><br />I know this book was planned to be for teen age readers, but I think adults will find it very entertaining, also.  I did.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like being able to access my Facebook on the move.  Works fine.  Of course not as easy as Facebook on the computer, but still works.
B000J10ER4|1.0|The fact that Jara Media tried to make it look like the movie I bought was brand new, was a laughing matter. It was clearly resealed. It didn't work as soon as I put it in the player. I would not recommend buying there products because you are not insured a new or working product.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|Does pretty much what I was looking for, but certain features don't work on my Kindle Fire HD.  Also not real easy to figure things out.  Spent alot of time trying to get my questions answered.  But does provide the security I was looking for.
B00969GFFU|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the story of the Berglunds. The lives of Walter and Patty Berglund and what they go through as they reach their 40s and 50s are narrated so well that you feel part of their family. Their marriage, their teenage children and their professional lives give shape to a real life portrait that, combined with each character's personal history, raise the question of whether freedom is the ultimate goal or a heavy burden to endure. From a philosophical point of view you may relate this novel to Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom.<br />But, in spite of its great psychological implications, don't think that this book is an essay on personal liberties. It is, above all, a great story of human relationships and emotions within the 'zeitgeist' of each particular moment of America and the world.
B0024O0VVS|4.0|cinema paradiso is a minor classic.  worth viewing regularly.  acting great; music fantastic.  i mistakenly got a copy with spanish subtitles.  so, watch closely.  the italian was fine.<br />i was taken by the &#34;looseness&#34; of the director's cut.  there were scenes that were unnecessary to the story, and some explanations that weakened the tale.<br />but it holds up after all these years.  i strongly recommend it to anyone.
B0036T1RMM|3.0|Someone whom I highly respect and appreciate made me promise to see this so I did. He said it was his favorite movie of all time. My sense is that this movie is an acquired taste. It is steeped in irony and dark humor. I sense that the more times one sees it the more they will appreciate it. It is a complex blend of irony, dark humor, and even optimism beneath a superficial layer of chaos. Someone who has the patience and temperament to absorb it can see the artistry that went into it.
B00BF11STU|3.0|The movie started slow but gradually but gradually intensify, the acting was great ,I will recommend I will recommend this movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I very much enjoyed the twists and turns as the story went along. I'd recommend it to any Grisham fan.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is an awesome case. It not only keeps my Bluetooth charged it's a carrying case while in my purse. I love it. Highly recommend.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I love the way Brandon Sanderson writes.  I love the character development, the plots, the twists.  I love the epic nature of his work.  Even his short stories are written as though they could be part of a larger whole.  If you like epic fantasy, you will love this book too!
B009UNH0EM|5.0|Love having an extra USB cable charger. We have several cars so I can leave one in each. Recommend! Perfect
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones is always good. Very interesting  movie with many twists and turns.<br />Not sure why so many words are required, may just skip ratings next time.
B006UHZ7OQ|5.0|I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 4 years ago (Lupus a month ago) and carrying my camera around my neck was making photography less than enjoyable. Enter Cotton Carrier Vest System....<br /><br />Comfort: Once you get the vest adjusted for you will hardly know that you have it on. When walking I don't have the camera bouncing against my body like I did with usual camera straps. The velcro from the side holster can be annoying. I prefer to leave it on even if I'm not carrying a second camera so I don't misplace the halter.<br /><br />Ease of Use: The side holster is a little difficult to use at first but once you become familiar with removing and replacing your camera becomes second nature.<br /><br />Looks: I've gotten use to the curious looks from people. My feeling is if you don't like it than don't look. It makes life easier for me and that's all that matters.<br /><br />Other activities: If able I remove in order to eat so I don't end up with anything on my camera.
B000002J6F|5.0|Kind of forgot about this album but after hearing a few songs, I just had to get it on a CD. This is really good music and a good mix of styles!
0062068423|3.0|I am a reading fanatic, especially of who dunnits or mysteries with a good story line.  Somewhere I read a positive review of Nesbo's writing and thought a new author had come into my life.  Wrong.  Boring, disjointed, no story, etc.  Not a fan.
B0001I562I|5.0|A great movie with lots of laughs!  My grandchildren recently saw the movie, Flight of the Navigator, on TV and loved it so much that I took a chance and found it online.  So happy with it... It's entertained the kids many times over.  Thanks!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Vocally he is maturing nicely and I love listening to him as I grow old and he grows up!  It's the typical Groban music, which means a variety of mixed language smooth songs, well presented.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Awesome book captures your imagination. Makes you feel like you are actually living the events in the book. Can't wait to start next book.
0739378198|3.0|This book was worse than &#34;The Redbreast,&#34; if that is possible.  I don't like Nesbo's style of writing or story lines.  Emails to my mother are better written.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|My wife and I were thoroughly entertained. We would recommend this movie to all our friends and family. A+ for sure.
B005D63ICI|4.0|It is going in a weird direction because somebody had to leave the cast, not because they would have created it this way.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Wonderful 2 disc set. Excellent quality, great price, and something for my grandchildren to treasure. (Their parents are already permanent fans of the original, and rightly so. One of the greatest movies of all time.)
B0000TB014|5.0|I still have this product and since I am a huge Michael Jackson fan, this was well worth the purchase.
B00425S1H8|5.0|As a lot of technical people out there know by now - none of our 5-6 year old USB-to-SERIAL dongles work under Windows 8. None of those chipsets will be supported. The reason is purely marketing and in this case we can not blame Microsoft. It is up to the vendor to submit the code. Those dongles are dirt cheap and mine never failed, so I understand the need of companies (Like prolific) to make us by products. I had to get this as an emergency. Worked like a charm out of the box on Windows 8/2012 hosts. A nice upgrade. Rather cheap and look very solid.
0345529057|4.0|I absolutely loved the book series prior to the HBO show coming out. This particular collection is made of great quality paper (Great job printing house). I might repurchase this for my friend soon. Oh yeah, Amazon shipped it to me faster than I expected.
0316067598|5.0|This is an excellent book that takes the reader on the doomed mission with the Seals.  The reader is right there each step of the way and feels like he/she is one of the boots on the ground.  The story is so engaging that I truly could not put the book down.  I love reading about the Seals and this is the best book I have read on the subject.  I would highly recommend this book to all who would learn about the mission.
B000005AYL|3.0|I LOVED this album when it came out so I ordered the vinyl. My only complaint is that They sent me a COPY of the album and not the original. It didn't even come with the cover art (which is why I honestly wanted it). Erykah is amazing so I can't be too upset!
0307474259|5.0|The author writes in a way that even a non-medical person can understand.  I found the information both interesting and useful.  I would recommend this book to anyone seeking to get fit and healthy.
B00338CMTI|5.0|I bought it used, expecting it to be worn out & ugly (i didn't care as long as i could read the book), but it was in perfect conditions :)
0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle takes you on a wild ride as he recounts the missions he completed as he became the most lethal sniper in US history.  The reader has a front row seat and feels like he/she is there with Mr. Kyle.  The US lost a true hero when Mr. Kyle was killed.  RIP Chris Kyle.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I Love this app!!!!<br />I grew up always having to use a dictionary to look up spelling of words and find their meanings. I still do it, and enjoy what I learn and find in the dictionary.<br />For me... spelling correctly and saying words and knowing their true meanings is all sorts of fun when you are out with friends.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|I love this movie, but it's something of a guilty pleasure. It's definitely worth a view. Give it a look.
B005HSL626|5.0|Love It!!!<br />For when I'm in the mood to be all Ninja Style!!! You get so into the game that you don't even realize that you have been playing for at least an hour!!!<br />This Rocks!!!! and Very Addicting!!!!!
B000FC1AGG|4.0|This is a great book. A real page turner. I kept wanting to know what would happen next. Great read!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Love the challenge good hand and eye exercise.  Tiles are easy to see and colors are vivid.  I love this game!
B005LAIGQ4|3.0|I purchased a new movie and I could tell that it was not new.  the package was not original and there was a small chip out of the plastic box.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|The tempo of this huge work does not always meet the needs of this film<br />That failing,however is way upset by the absolutey gorgeous cinematography and that lovely ,appropriate and haunting music score all tied in with a powerful subject matter and many marvelous scenes.<br />With its faults, it still stands out as an accomplished work!
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|Wrong edition but the basic story lines were there. Without the sex scenes the erotic nature of the film is lost.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This was the best purchase I've made so far I love it to no end. I never write reviews but this one deserves all the best ones. It works flawless with my kindle and computer. I can even play runescape!! I seriously love this app get it and you won't regret it!
B005P3NPXG|4.0|A great CD and i love listening to the sound of Seal.  He is a terrific, soulful singer.  Love him.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game!  Yes, it's mindless fun but what a great way to wind down.  I don't spend hours playing it because it's just not that type of game but I do play everyday and enjoy every minute of it!  Try it, you just might like it!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved it and when I read the author was an actress it put the whole book together.  The story is a play and someone should stage it.  It would also be a good movie but I think a play is ndthye correcr medium for maximum effect.  I loved it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Children learn about problem solving and strategies with this game. May choices to try and try again We love it!!!!
B00A83075M|3.0|The movie is good but for the price I paid for at amazon i could of gotten the blue ray combo at target instead of the regular DVD at amazon.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Co-worker recommended this game to me.  Pretty amazing and relaxing I must say, but sometimes a bit challenging but it's still fun!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The book was excellent and I expeced the movie to be less than so. I was wrong. The movie was just as good as the book. The actors were great and It was very true to the book content.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a great book even for non-war-story lovers, like myself. The story will make you understand the purpose of the Navy Seals and for sure will increase the respect for these over the top human beings.  It also explains a lot about the functionality of the soldiers within Afgan lands. At the end of the book you will be able to understand why the USA's commanders just don't blow the hell up the intire conflict area.
0307730697|5.0|This book is a must read! What a man, husband, son, friend and brother! This book should be a must read for all high school students. Adam Brown is a legacy and should be remembered that way.....<br />What an amazing journey, life and family he had.  I cannot say enough about this book... READ IT!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I LOVE the Hunger Games!! Very emotional yet you still just can't put the book down! I usually hate to re-read books but I couldn't help it with the Hunger Games! 5 stars without a doubt :)
B002NT3B52|4.0|This book has so much information it is difficult to difficult to wade through.  There is really good and amazing facts that I could not have found without reading research.  This book put it all in one place in a readable format.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|Useful as a graduate student. Accurate, simple to use. Like that I can use different text colors and widths. Love the export functions: email as pdf, jpg, etc.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Very interesting experience.  Not sure of the adherence to actual fact.  not sure if one could really continue to walk with feet in such bad shape.  Everyone knows to break in a pair of shoes before a long walk.
B0076UXKDG|5.0|I had trouble using 3rd party grips (Meike) with my D800E.  My camera will show both batteries being discharge on the top LCD if I placed two OEM Nikon fully charged batteries (1 in camera and 1 inside the grip).  Meike will work if I only use one battery inside the battery grip.<br /><br />I ordered the Nikon MB-D12 and my camera works as designed.  Some are lucky with 3rd party grips but after trying the second generic grip, it was time to get the original product which works very well.  I no longer have any issues with the Nikon brand. The battery tray including the AA battery tray fits much better. Overall construction is much better compared to the cheaper and mostly plastic 3rd party battery grip.<br /><br />I'll post some pictures comparing the Meike vs Nikon MB-D12 just to give you an idea.  Most people asks is it worth it? My answer will be hell YES!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is a very pretty, scary, fun game.  I am enjoying playing it. The only problem I have with it is that sometimes the items are too small to see.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Loved it. So funny and so easy to relate to with having a kids and being married. Would recommend to everyone
0393327345|5.0|bought this for a friend, he is loving it.  first book he has read in a long time.  glad to help him get back into books :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The relationship between the characters is so igniting that I could not put this book down. Every girl that reads this will want to be Anastasia Steel and not for the obvious physical relationship between her and Christian Grey, but because of the opulent life style that is offered to her. I definitely want to read more!
1400069807|4.0|I took the time to read the book \\"Salt Sugar Fat\\" by Michael Moss during my spring break.  I was underwhelmed by the news that the giant food companies all over the world spend millions and billions of dollars to formulate the right mix of salt, sugar and fat to entice us to overeat their products.  I already figured this out, which is one reason I've gone back to school and severely limited my use of commercial media.<br /><br />The book is thoroughly researched and well-written.  It doesn't sensationalize the news as others have.  I hope that the truth that is available here can be read by millions.  It's time to give up our Hershey's Bliss dark chocolate and wake up, America.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|\\"Wow. How did we get here?\\" This book was not how I expected this trilogy to end. Frankly, I do not know how I expected it to end, but I was hoping the trilogy would end on a lighter tone. Although \\"happily ever after\\" is assumed at the end, so much was lost to get there. I will not say any more because I do not want to give away too many details. If you have read the first two books I highly recommend you read this one because it definitely brings closure to The (in)famous Hunger Games...
B008OOYALE|5.0|das süchtig macht... Wenn man einmal anfängt, fällt es schwer, eine \\"Pause\\" einzulegen, um arbeiten zu gehen.  ;-) Absolute Kaufempfehlung, jedoch hoher Suchtfaktor!
B00338QENI|4.0|This was a good historical/scientific read. Definitely a story worth getting out. The jumps, however, from author, to clinical information, to family situations did not feel smooth. Although I have a clinical background, I found the the scientific descriptions lengthy and probably difficult for a non-clinical person to wade through. Still and important book.
B008JFUNYG|4.0|Bloody!<br /><br />Disgusting!<br /><br />Horrific!<br /><br />Would you expect anything less from a horror movie named \\"Evil Dead\\"?<br /><br />I went to see this movie with a LOT of reservations.  Like so many people my age (I am a late \\"thirty-somethings\\" guy),  I grew up with Sam Raimi's original Evil Dead, and its campy, but incredibly fun sequels \\"Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn\\" and \\"Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness\\", so I had expectations as to what I was walking into.  Bruce Campbells portrayal of Ash in those films was part comicbook, part over-the-top horror, but was always in good, campy fun.<br /><br />In this re-telling of the Evil Dead story, I had heard that the move was wooden, that it exploited the fans of the original to make a quick buck, that it was just plain bad and that audiences were setting themselves up for disappointment.  There were so many overwhelmingly BAD reviews, that I really thought to myself - I'll pass and maybe give it a look on DVD (if I ever got around to it.)  However, I found myself with an afternoon off, a couple hours to kill, and an overwhelming urge to go watch a movie...and so I went, with absolutely ZERO expectations, to see the Evil Dead.<br /><br />All-in-all, I am glad I went.  Would I say I enjoyed the movie?  That's a hard question to answer.  CAN you truly ENJOY a horror movie?  I dunno...I guess anyone who truly enjoys horror might have a few screws loose upstairs.  However, I will say that I was not, in any way, disappointed with the movie.  In fact, I was rather impressed with how well the move played in its 92 minute window.  It had all the main characteristics of a good horror film: monsters (demons more specifically), blood, gore, cutting, tearing, and all sorts of other shocking horrors.  It was NOT subtle in any way.  We were given a front row seat to (spoilers ahead) people cutting out parts of their face, their arms, their hands.  We saw nail guns, razor blades, shotguns and chainsaws all being put to very good use...on other people.  If bloody-disgusting is your thing, you will LOVE this movie.<br /><br />But here's what I liked most about the movie.  I thought that the actors played off of each other quite well.  I cannot imagine how difficult it must be to make a movie like this.  I was fortunate enough to hear an interview with Jane Levy (who plays Mia in \\"Evil Dead\\") discussing how she and her fellow actors were coached by director Fede Alvarez during filming.  In one instance she said that he would have them go out and run through the woods before filming a scene to get their heart rates up - just as they would be if they were going toe to toe with the Prince of Darkness himself.  In another scene, Levy explained how she was literally buried alive during one of the takes - her terror translates quite well to the screen as a result.  We see genuinely well played victims because the performance was coached - and in a horror movie, it says a lot about the caliber of the film when the director knows how to pull that performance out of someone - especially when they are supposed to be facing off against the dead, or maybe better put, the possessed \\"undead.\\"<br /><br />Folks, lets be honest, this is not an Oscar contender, but does every movie that Hollywood pumps out really need to be?  Instead, this is a fun, campy, very gory (R rating is well earned here!) horror movie that pays a fitting homage to the original, while still being its own unique vision of Campbell's classic.  I am glad I went - and I think I might even consider taking my teenage son back to the theater to see it again.  I was about his age the first time I saw the original \\"Evil Dead\\" and, while this one is far more gruesome than its predecessor, its an Evil Dead for a far more desensitized audience than the ones that went to see Raimi's original.<br /><br />Go see it, preferably with a date, and go have fun...being scared, shocked, and a little grossed out can actually be quite, um, entertaining, when viewed with the right partner.  I liked this installment of Evil Dead and, personally, if this group decides to try a sequel, I will go back for more!
B0089LOKHG|4.0|The last in the trilogy ended the way I hoped it would. The books stayed true and interesting throughout. A good read.

B007TNS6JI|5.0|i love this game. the best game i've played on the kindle fire yet. they should make a fourth game like this.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are among the best headphones I've used- very comfortable, good at noise isolation and virtually indestructible.  My current set was picked up used after 5+ years of hard use at a school- I replaced the earcups and cleaned them up a bit and they're still working just fine after 5 more years.<br /><br />For the people complaining about the low bass response, that's the entire idea.  Most modern headphones vastly accentuate the bass- the Beats headphones are especially bad at this.  The 7506's response curve is pretty close to flat from 40-10k Hz, which is what you want if you're doing any kind of production or monitoring.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game, I only started to play it just to get my gems on fashion story. But now it's a game I can't delete im addicted. At first it took me a long time to get coins the trick is keep breeding dragons!!I like breeding the dragons to see if I get a new one. Only down fall I don't like some dragons take a long time to Breed or evolve. And I want to know if I can move my habitats to different parts of the island? Overall I would give it the 5 star rating.

B007ZXK08C|2.0|I read this book because it was up to win a prize against Hilary Mantel- a writer whom I admire very much. I also like mysteries and murders. 'Gone Girl' is a fast, frightening ride and the prose style is clever, witty and original. It appeals to female anxieties on many levels so has compelling themes to drive the plot. Because the story is told from the opposing points of the two protagonists and some of these are later revealed to be fictional constructs, it has more twists and turns than an edge of your seat thriller. I wanted to like this... I really did, but could not empathise with the main characters who were narcissistic, childish and cruel. The reasons for their weaknesses were not adequately backed up in the story and the ending was unsatisfying. Why is it that we want to believe that underneath every pretty girl lurks a bunny boiler?  I think Flynn is a talent and I am happy for her success... let's hope she has the opportunity to use her powers for good. This isn't.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Holy fudge cake Mc.nuggets I have been waiting for this game forever and I can't believe it came for android. This game is a fifteen to thirty dollar game somehow de-creased to a 2 dollar game. Same features, unlimited creativity thinking,  and just plain out awesome. Any level can be sandbox yet they added a sandbox which is awesome and you can create anything you want. A giant unicorn with a cowboy alien with a rocket launcher fighting God with sunglasses wearing a football helmet and a baseball hat and holding a machine gun riding an giant ape holding a rocktlauncher or just a butterfly :I. You imagination is the limit, as said in the description. In the original version you can only have so many things out at once yet in this version you can have as many things as you want out. This is for creative thinkers and is just amazing. I'm a random guy and I love this what can I say. I don't know about that other dude but I think it's really easy to pick things up, but I'm a 14 year old so don't listen to me, hint hint. I really recommend this to everybody. I'll give it a five all the way. Thanks for reading this and I really hope you buy the app for you sake it really is my most favorite game/app ever.
B0080M3OGW|5.0|at first I wasn't sure if I would like the way it was going but it turned out to be a great ending.  I really like Myrle Streep.<br />I was glad they stuck to their standards .  It was a quick moving movie with great acting
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Walking Dead Seaon 3 was a great change in pace from Season 2.  We went from what felt like a season of arguing about how to survive zombies that rarely showed up to having both zombie and human threats almost constantly.  I enjoyed the series greatly, but the writing fell into a bit of a trend in TV that I don't enjoy, separate storylines that caused us to focus completely on one person or area for an entire episode, sometimes only having a few main characters in it.  While this allows a writer to focus entirely on the subject at hand, it can confuse the timeline.  Having one location get an entire episode that takes place in less than a day while the next episode shows another location over a three-day period.  Then the next episode shows them interacting.  We missed two days in the first location.<br /><br />The other issue that seemed to be problematic was trying to tell the underlying story of how people and society is changed and must survive in this new world while presenting a very present conflict right now.  At one point an entire episode was focused on two men ultimately debating philosophy in the zombie apocalypse disguised as an attempted truce negotiation.<br /><br />None of this is to say that the story itself is bad.  Are we violent killers who must be led by force or are we civilized people who must all have a say in our destiny?  Can we show compassion, or does that just lead to our own deaths?  And is the greater danger walkers or men?  These are all things that need to be a part of the story, but setting aside a potential war to discuss it feels a bit odd.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you want your zombies with a mix of real world philosophy and principiled idealism, then this is a great show.  And if you want to be sure that your zombies splat in a a beautifully disgusting way, or that there is no room for a weak stomach in seeing a human eaten alive you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The fact is that I recommend this to anyone who likes a tale of horror that takes itself serious and doesn't just turn into a bloodfest for the sake of blood.  Nothing feels gratuitous and every moment that you feel there is a break is shadowed by the knowledge that the next immediate threat could show up in an instant.
030758836X|2.0|I have read all 3 of Ms. Flynn's books. I don't enjoy her characters. The story lines are interesting. I don't want to read her story- so I skip to the end. I really don't think I missed anything. If she does write another book... I am not reading it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Fascinating and candid story.  Amazing that they both survived, reconnected and shared their lives so long after the end of the war.
0978545095|5.0|Betcha hers didn't have through the lens metering?  A great improvement and the latest Rolleiflex 2.8 and FW. Do you know how much it costs to buy develop and print Black and White 120 film these days? If a Rollei Twin took 220, it would be a little cheaper. Last of our kind.
B0031RSA24|2.0|I found the book quite frustrating.  It often feels like Dawkins is addressing straw men in his arguments.  He also doesn't seem to distinguish between science and history, instead viewing science as superior discipline for gaining all types of knowledge.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I'm not sure whether its me being worn out by the series, or the lack of something in the Hobbit, I own the Lord of the Rings set and have played them over numerous times The Hobbit  is lacking something
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the most action packed books you'll get. I chose my rating because I literally stayed up till ten o'clock at night to read. I'm going on to the second and third book. I can't wait till the movie of “catching fire\\" the movie. If anyone reads this book because of the review I hope you like it as much as I did!!!!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't have tv service where I live so I use DVDs etc. to cherry pick the good stuff off the tube. Thus I had never heard of this series when it appeared on Amazon.<br /><br />I was puzzled why a whole new tv series was available for $20 bucks , so at first I ignored the offering assuming that it must be junk.<br /><br />But then I read the reviews , which were great, and ordered it anyway.<br /><br />This is a great series, Sci-fi like it used to be , without magic wands or heavy handed special effects used to solve every problem that people encounter.<br /><br />Buy this DVD you'll love it.
B0016Q6CQI|5.0|I love the Buffy series so of course i had to have this sound track. Its awsome ! If you are a Buffy series fan its a must have.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|hard to read, best viewed as a movie, the book was just too wordy for my taste, but worth trying
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Allows you shop Amazon anywhere you are. So convenient and practical. Leave your PC at home and be free. Just needs a WiFi connection. Easy enough.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This novel was a painful but beautiful surprise !!!  I was entranced in anguished memories, and  happy anticipation...never expecting the delightfully  hopeful ending which was more accurately a new beginning for all concerned!!!  A poignantly beautiful story!!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|love getting books on the ipad its fast and easy to get. to light to carry around, and was a great book. you will love this book
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am a girl brony and I love this app! some stuff is very expensive, but keep playing to get bits and gems! one of my favorite features is... wait for it...  DERPY HOOVES!!!!! OH MAH CELESTIA!!!! Unfortunately she only stays for a while. :,(  play flim and flam's balloon pop to win prizes like houses, elements of harmony, and ponies (like Dr. whooves!) overall it's a fun game and the only problem is you need to spend a lot of money or play for a long time and not pay at all. anyway, hope this helped!<br /><br />Star Bloom out!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|love getting books on the ipad its fast and easy to get. to light to carry around, and was a great book. you will love this book
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I love this...I will buy again from this store.  Was shipped to me asap and when i received it it was beautiful.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a scientifically minded person, I believe the notion that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  This book provides both.  Touching and inspirational.  Good reading for the open mind.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Easy to read, great ideas, not too preachy. I really enjoyed it and felt inspired.<br /><br />I recommend anyone considering downsizing to read this - today
B00B49L7JY|5.0|If there can be such a thing as a well-acted documentary, this is it.  A gripping story with great music.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|A thoughtful, powerful, beautiful, engrossing action packed movie. Cannot recommend highly enough. What all science fiction cinema should aspire to; instantly believable, gritty while still retaining a deeper discussion.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|My wife and I loved this film.  Very well crafted, written and directed.  Should have seen the end coming, but that's what good films do...they make you miss what's right in front of you.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Now i can see the real Facebook, or a scaled down one. Good to have a choice between a little info and a lot.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|5 Stars--my new favorite.  Law and Order all over again. How did I miss this when it was on TV?  Love watching the entire season.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use.  Very handy having it on my Kindle.  Like being able to see calculations as you are performing them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn's style of writing is enthralling.  The transitions between characters are natural and easy to follow.  The plot keeps thickening and I didn't want to put the book down.  As soon as I finished I had to read her first novel, Dark Places - excellent.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Does an excellent job, if you learn how to use it properly.  Carbide and ceramic blade sharpeners, and a tapered diamond rod all serve individual purposes.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|This book was really well written...and it was a quick read.  Although I do like dogs, I do not own one so I feel as though some of the relationship understanding was not as meaningful as it probably was with many readers who have dogs.
B000003337|4.0|This CD shows what Randy's could do before Ozzy Osbourne Band. It's good to hear the original Quiet Riot too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|good game for kids. was a good game to keep kids busy<br />there where plenty of levels to keep them busy.
B007PFDJH4|1.0|I hate it, its all I can say ! Dry, no action, no passion, nothing to talk about. I will think again before buying another book by this writer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|absolutely great!  I could not wait to read the next book and felt the cliff habger of an ending terrific.  Now I can't wait for the movie either.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|I was interested and curious about this gadget, however it proved to be operational but not much help. The text message I get regarding my connection is good enough, this adds naught
098555780X|5.0|I tried following JD's video's on YouTube.  The book is great and offers excellent directions.  Hopefully he comes out with another edition with more knots
B004SBS8LA|4.0|can't beat ad-free and the price is great. go for it and see what I mean blah, blah, blah blah
0143118757|5.0|I do not care what your  negotiations are about this book will help you learn how to get the most from the process
0743201140|5.0|I saw Marcus Buckingham in person; he is extremely helpful in understanding what it means to work toward your strengths and the happiness gained therin...this book and the personal StrengthsFinder assessment is TOPS!!!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter is so happy with her Legos. She has been playing non stop since they came. I am so happy I ordered them for her!!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I like this game a lot. It's really fun but I'm starting to think they copied temple run. You can see a lot of the similarities between the two game. But I still like it a lot.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I have to say, even though every episode wraps up thinks very neatly and predictably, which I would normally pan a show for, the acting and chemistry among the actors makes this an engaging show. Julianna Margulies clearly carries the show, but the supporting cast is also very good. I'm very entertained by the show and love watching it on my iPad in bed before going to sleep.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Enjoyed it a lot.  Will look for other Reacher books since I have gone through all of the John Corey and Mitch Rapp.  Wish those authors would get busy!
0812993357|5.0|For those who follow fashion, 60s-70s culture, or all things Brit, here's your book. No literary masterpiece, but packed with dishy stories, names, and events from the past. Looks good on a coffee table too.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Brought the Tron Legacy Movie sound track by Daft Punk.<br /><br />One of the best Science Fiction movies to come out in 10 years, and the sound track was great.<br />Each score from the movie makes you feel every moment you watched in the movie.<br />Daft Punk does excellent job of creating balance between parts  of the movie.<br />Had a tough time finding the Audio CD version of the  movie but Amazon had the soundtrack ready to order<br />on their web site.
B000002QWD|5.0|What is there to say. A slice of fruitcake, a jug of eggnog, and the comforting croon of Mr. Crosby. A holiday must-have.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This was a book chosen by my book club and I was not looking forward to reading it.  What a wonderful surprise.  It was beautifully written, and had great meaning to me.  It is one of my all time favorites.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|The game has great graphics I mean hey get creative right swords and axes<br />Also I like the very accurate detail about the blood
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Excellent game it reminds me of the original Diablo .... good job on making this game<br />And it's free to top it all off good graphics smooth play but I do enjoy playing it more on my iPad4 4 rather Kindle fire but it runs great on both systems I just like the bigger<br />Screen
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I expect big things in the future for Emili. Great production coupled with heartfelt lyrics equals music the way it's supposed to be!
B002SJIO4A|4.0|Actually an interesting movie.  An action movie, with social issues (e.g., immigration and abortion), how interesting.  Too bad it has so many &#34;F&#34; bombs in it.
1439181780|5.0|For  me, this was one of those &#34;can't put it down&#34; books!  I bought one for my physician, siblings, and a couple of friends.  The information was positive and - for me - a great &#34;reminder&#34; of things I know to be true but sometimes loose sight of.  I am not planning on giving this book away.  I have highlighted it and written in the margins for future review!!  It is easy to read and makes a lot of sense to me.  It's hard to find these kinds of books, anymore.  I hope other authors will concentrate on positive thoughts and insights that people can read about and think about and use to improve their lives as well as those around them.
B004GYY714|5.0|Love this app, can listen to all my progressive news on the go. Great job, keep up the good work.
B00AQMQBKK|2.0|I was hoping this was a strategy game, but instead it's mostly just dumb luck. This game is akin to flipping a coin ten times and needed it to come up heads every time to win. I suppose there could possibly be some strategy to it once you start to get more items, but that is assuming you can tolerate the frustration of failing missions over and over and over again because you can't get the random symbols you need. Not sure which describes this game best; poorly designed mechanics that make it nigh impossible to win, or designed TO be nigh impossible to win. Either way, I wouldn't call it fun. Finally, it might be more fun with multiple players. At least that way you can share the misery.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Finally sat down and watched this movie with my two grand-daughters, this past weekend.  What a great film.  Awesome graphics, plotline, and continuation of motion.  Kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole film.  The characters were excellent, and easily lent themselves to empathy from the viewer.  Part of great films is drawing the viewer in, and allowing them to feel.  This movie does this &#34;par excellance&#34;.  If I could give it six stars, I would
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|There are too many non English language songs on a CD released in the US.  Find some contemporary music for contemporary listeners.  Some classics are great, but in balance.
B00AGMTA62|5.0|It was a joy to watch this video, especially Franz Welser Most, the conductor. I felt that I was there with the hundreds who attended watching every move and enjoying each note. Many of my favorites were played, the best of them &#34;Radetzky Marshe&#34; by Johann Strauss. I also have the videos from the two previous years which I watch over and over.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|The arrangements and choice of songs were very average.  Not an upswing for this talented artist.  He needs a producer who sees his potential and also needs some songs which can be &#34;sing along&#34; for listeners.  Doesn't have to be corny.  Look what Celine Dion does with contemporary sing along songs.  He has the same potential.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|The movie was in better shape than advertised and arrived sooner than I hoped.<br /><br />Thanks for being so timely and efficient.
B004BBDHEK|3.0|Yanni has stretched the borders a little, but  not nearly enough.  Arrangements are childish in some songs and exciting in others.  He needs exciting arrangements since most of his &#34;melody lines&#34; are very simple.  Keep trying Yanni and find a good produce who can work with  your concepts of arrangements to start and then augment them.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Volbeat keep reinventing themselves. cant go wrong with buying this record. Every track is solid. Biggest surprise is probably their cover of my body
B0002Y69NG|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time and I LOVE this set.  I bought it used and the only problem was that the case shown above was slightly worn.  Not a problem at all for me.  I did buy it used after all and couldn't be happier.  This set is a must have for any Matrix fan.
B003G94BZC|5.0|I've been trying to look into Doctor Who for quite some time but never seemed to find the time.  It was worth the wait!  Matt Smith is excellent, and all in all this is just a great show!  Do yourself a favor and watch!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is so convenient when taking notes! I use the app on my HTC Amaze 4G as well. I think I'm in love with this app!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Well written and gripping.  I wan't excited about reading, but picked it up due to a freind's recommendation.  Once I started to read, was lost in the story of these two men.
B0091REZMW|3.0|this game is like most hidden object games... I don't know if I will continue to play or take it off my device.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very easy to play... if u like temple run... you will love this gm... one of the best gm i ever played.... hands down very fun an exciting
B001GCUER0|4.0|Mad Men Season 2 continues the excellent story-telling and acting from Season 1. However, a few episodes in the middle of the season seemed to drag or weren't as tightly written as Season 1's episode. The show manages to pick itself back up in the last few episodes for a very bombastic and fitting finish.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The book gives you some more insight to the family that has occupied Highclere Castle.  Almina was an extraordinary force, who was selfless in her nurturing care of her family and many wounded WWI soldiers.
B0000261RJ|5.0|just as good as i remember it. i used to have this on album that i got from meijer when it was in dicount for 3.97
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|There are many cases on the market so I was at a loss which to purchase - I found this sturdy - light - functional - great value.
B00881VLCE|5.0|fun to play, you can make it as challenging as you want, lots of puzzles to choose from, love it
B004HD61KE|2.0|Tying Americas historical cultures to nannotechnology is a real stretch!  Although I read the book, the pieces never came together.  I think this is the weakest of Rollin's history- scientific facts premise approach to fiction.  Normally, I appreciate that and look forward to reading the author's explanations at the back of the book.  Not this time.
0812548094|5.0|Every book Terry Goodkind has written is exceptionally thorough in giving the reader a feeling of time and circumstance for the characters.  The reader is drawn in and is not disappointed!
B000TDGGRY|3.0|This series is getting more and more predictable.  However, it is a good read and light entertainment.  Just don't think there will be a lot of suspense.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I love this new CD. I am so glad that I decided to get it. I have always loved Blake and this CD does not disappoint!
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|I expected to like this since I generally like these kinds of things.  But I was ever so happy that &#34;it was a rental&#34;.  I &#34;speed watched&#34; most of it.  The scenery was pretty.  The costumes were outstanding.  But it was too over the top.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is my go-to solitaire. This is the first game I ordered after getting my Kindle pad and the video is bright and sharp. Playing it on a larger screen is great.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|Bruce Willis has guts.  This is not your handsome-guy-gets-the girl movie.  It is an entertaining story about kids living through early puberty and adults still having trouble figuring themselves out.  A good family movie
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|He loves this movie. I can't even count on my hands the number of times he has watched this movie and I must admit that I have watched it a time or two.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Josh Brolin hits the nail on the head in his portrayal of a young Agent Jay; but he's really doing a young Tommy Lee Jones - fantastic and hilarious.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I loved this book.  It gave me hope as I finish my masters degree and time in the military. Great advice for any businessman or future businessman.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|OK.  I'm old and I wish we could go back to Sean Connery.  But, I have to say that this is the first Daniel Craig rendition that I have truly enjoyed.
B001KVAMM4|5.0|Mutter is one of a kind. Especially piano trio with Previn and Lynn, I could listen all day. I strongly recommend!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season two is every bit as engaging as season one.  I am not sure what the difference is between the UK version and the American version.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|When this book first came out I was bound and determined not to read it. But now that I've read her story I'm glad I did. She has opened my eyes and the way I look at life. So with that said Thank You Jaycee Dugard
B009UZLRJE|5.0|We received the package on time and were able to watch all of the discs without any issues!  Great purchase for the price.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|For a family that doesn't have cable...and who got hooked on this show through netflix...this was the perfect solution!  Now I don't have to try to keep my kids from scratching a disc!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I like this type of game fast paced, and thinking fast. I would like more of this type of game
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't like gore, I don't like end of the world stuff, etc. but this honestly is the BEST show I have ever seen!  Try to get past the many &#34;dispatches&#34; and enjoy the best storyline you've ever seen.  There are surprises around every corner.<br />We wait and record several shows at once so we can get our fix two or three shows at a time, waiting for the next week is TORTURE!<br />Happy Viewing!<br />Sharon C.
B009X01GJ2|2.0|I returmed the cover because it did not fit the Kindle Fire I had , it was supposed to fit but I could not get it on.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I really enjoyed this, but my joy turned to disappointment when I learned that they made the one book Hobbit into a 3-movie trilogy!  We have to wait until December 2013 for Part 2 and July 2014 for Part 3 and that’s when it hits the theaters! I hope I live long enough to own the DVD's :-)
B009G41CG2|5.0|I play Mahjong in a group of friends with tiles.  This is different but enjoy the challenge of matching the symbols. I would recommend this game to anyone
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Entertaining, much better than I expected! I enjoyed the tie-in and connection with the elder Stark. Classic second millenia Marvel!
B007REV4T8|5.0|love the action the story and the actors. seen it in the movie screen and couldn't wait for it to come out!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It tell so much about it is just like the paper back one. It is a great book to read.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|One word to describe this movie is fabulous! the details, storyline, graphics (they look so real-life), and wonderful charachters...and I am an adult!! We have watched this movie numerous times and enjoyed it more each one!
B0051XQI84|5.0|Movie for the entire family. It has both comedy and action teamed with an uplifting story. Would recommend to anyone.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|The storyline is fairly vague and the effects are not as realistic as competitors; but I enjoy the hunting for objects to solve each screen. I do use the &#34;spoiler&#34; hints sometimes since there are over 40 different screens to search - it can be very frustrating if you get one move out of place! Overall - I would say it is entertaining for $ .99!!
B001XV3LSS|4.0|This movie is one heck of a ride.  It will leave you guessing until the end, all the performances are really well done.  The special effects are still holding up but are showing their age, but all in all it's a very good story and isn't that what makes a good movie?
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I loved this book more than the first and that is saying something. James Dashner is a awesome writer I will read all his books
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I absolutely love this product.  I use it often because I use my Kindle Fire much like a laptop computer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I would give it 1000 stars if I could. I highly recommend this game. Love the characters and also the boards.
B004742Y68|4.0|the movie itself is great, but I was expecting it to be in hd. perhaps I have a poor connection, but I don't have the same problems with other video services on the Wii U.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|If you like Boz you'll probably like this CD.  I have been listening to Boz aka. William Royce Scaggs, since he was with the Steve Miller Band in the 60's.  While my favorite CD is probably Silk Degrees, this is a worthy effort and I would certainly recommend it to a fan or anyone just discovering his sound.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Why is it so hard to move around in the game.  I feel like a slug when playing.<br /><br />I don't know how to play this game.  Can someone tell me?
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|After almost 43 years I still think Jimi is the best guitar player that ever lived.  I was privileged to see him live and snapped at the chance to own 12 previously unreleased songs.  Break out the *****, black lights and turn the stereo up ~ If this doesn't take you back...you weren't there.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Keeps you mind and finger active.  The graphics are good and really keeps your attention.  I really enjoyed the game.
B009KEN87O|5.0|The game is simple and simply fun.  Combines the old game with some new challenges.  Using Kindle fire HD.  I would recommend this game to old and new players of this genre.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|There are lots of survival stories these days, especially within the indie genre. The majority have to do with zombies or end-of-the-world scenarios. But Weir offers a survival tale with a twist fit for Hollywood.<br /><br />Not that being stranded on Mars hasn't been done before. It has, many-a-time. But never have I read a book (much less seen a movie) that has done it with respect to both science and realism. Overall, the solutions that main character Watney comes up with are plausible and interesting, and well-researched. It's a lot of fun to see what the Red Planet throws at him, and how he scrambles to get out of the situation.<br /><br />In fact, the descriptions of survival get so detailed that I started to scan toward the end of the book, when the plot started racing toward its final conclusion. Just when you think it's getting too easy for Watney, something crazy happens...and you get to have the fun of watching him rack his brain for a way out.<br /><br />If there is one critique of this story, it's that the main character Watney seems to be almost superhuman. He avoids death so many times, and can figure his way out of anything, that it flirts with being too incredible. What's weird is that even though he's the main character, Watney seems to be the least developed of the bunch. Whenever Watney journals, it's always about how to survive. We never get much of a look into his personal life - something that happens with many of the secondary characters. It's a minor gripe - the main focus of the book is not Watney per se, but how he survives on Mars.<br /><br />Starting around chapter 5 or so, be ready for constant point of view changes. It irked me at first, but I learned to roll with it. Indeed, it becomes integral to the story, and cannot imagine how it could have been written without it.<br /><br />The Martian is a fast-paced, easy read, with lots of humor thrown in for good measure. It makes a nice counterbalance to all the techy stuff, and gives Watney some much-needed humanity. This is easily the best $.99 book I've bought in a while, and I would not have minded playing five times more. I could easily see this becoming a movie.<br /><br />The verdict: this is one of the best survival stories I've read. The main attraction is seeing how Watney uses limited resources to survive being stranded on the Red Planet, and later into the story, a good plot begins to develop. Recommended of fans of survival stories, especially ones that have a unique twist.y some much-needed humanity.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Reader friendly. Easy to navigate. Great devotionals. I am able to take my Bible everywhere,  only problem is that it must always be used on line.
0061990477|4.0|This book was more of a thing in my parents' generation - that said, I really did enjoy it. I don't usually read the family saga genre. At near 700 pages The Thorn Birds was slow-going at times, but the writing was rich and the characters memorable. McCullough has very good description, though it might be too much for some people. The dialogue is rather proper, even when children are speaking, but I learned to just go with it without too much of a fuss. The characters (and there are many) take a while to develop. It's not necessarily a happy book, and it feels very much like real life.
B000WC4AJI|3.0|It has some very good recordings, and music selection was decent overall. Certainly some good sound demos to be had.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Our family really enjoyed this movie. The graphics, sound-track, and story-line are excellent! It might be a tad scary in some places for toddler-4 aged kiddos, mostly during the fighting or scenes with the bad owls.<br /><br />We really love Amazon's customer service, also! We experienced some buffering times during the show, and they refunded our rental price- excellent!
B008CWR7MC|3.0|It has some very good recordings, and music selection was decent overall. Certainly some good sound demos to be had.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Absolutely loving the dvd series 1 - 4 i bought as a gift<br />Has all the episodes from the first show onward.<br />Can't wait for the rest of the seasons as well

1451613512|5.0|If you've got a spare week for sustained reading, you'll learn more about modern US history in the book than you likely ever did in school. 500+ pages of small print does take some time, but it's worth it. Starting with WWI and President Wilson's devious maneuvering and ending with 2012 and Obama's devious maneuvering, we get an idea of how politics and the economy are really managed. It ain't pretty, but then this isn't a sanitized highschool text. The authors don't draw any explicit conclusions; instead, they let the facts speak for themselves. If the presentation seems one-sided, it's because we've all heard the cosmetic side that's peddled daily by word, picture and broadcast dial. Now, it's time for what gets left out because it just doesn't fit either popular myth or deliberate half-truth. Looks to me like Stone learned the lessons of Vietnam well and put them to good use for the benefit of us all.

B000SEIK2S|5.0|I like a book that draws me away from life and into the universe of this story, providing a thrill along the way. This book does that well, at least, it did it for me. Enjoy.

B009AMANBA|5.0|This movie is fantastic, amazing, you will not be disappointed in the least, if you are a history buff this movie is dynamite . And if your not, it's what we learned in history class , get it for the collection !
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I had high expectations for this book, since the other 2 set the bar fairly high. The ending was so unresolved and disappointing that it pretty much ruined the entire series for me.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe is one of the best TV series I've seen in a long time. It's better than 24, Alias, and JAG.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games is great but at times it freezes and the character will stick..but over all there ain't much negativity I can about it..this game is great..I love when the inspector tries to catch me it be funny..
B0001I561E|5.0|Bought Aladdin off this site and it took me back to my childhood. What a magic carpet ride that was! Great purchase!
030758836X|3.0|I disliked both main characters (I think I was supposed to), but I had to admire the author's subtle way of presenting a really dangerous type of psychopathic personality which made me continue to read the book to the end.  I suppose that is a compliment for the author's writing.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|This game is amazing! It is like skyrim. It is very open world realistic combat. I could not beliece there is a game this good for kindle
0891419195|5.0|A great book.<br />After I saw the Pacific mini series I researched the books and stories from the characters and found this book one of the best.<br />Eugene Sledge did an amazing thing to keep alive and keep his dignity in situations most could never comprehend.<br />Highly recommended.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Couldn't stop playing for weeks(especially after finding out about the waves). The currency is easy enough to get, but if you want to buy the glu credits then you'll have to pay a little something. You could always just do the little offers (to get some \\"free\\") though.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was very similar to fifty shades but had its own twist that I liked. I couldn't put it day for this be my first book I read by Sylvia Day I look forward to reading more from her.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Loved the episode! Get the app Amazon video! It is a free app. It's easy and fun! I recommend this app!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|The movie was good but it was constantly having issues with audio streaming and video. Mostly the audio would just go out on me about every 15 mins or so. Then take 5 mins to come back. It's the last time I rent from Amazon.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Love the whole franchise of Fast and the furious...This one did not disappoint!!! The Rock is a great match up to Vin Diesel's character! Still has some racing, but mostly fights and guns...For an action movie,,,,it was great!
B001WCN232|5.0|I just want to tell folks that the censored version of \\"Star Star\\" is only on the first pressings of the 2009 UMe reissue. Later pressings have the overdub removed so you can clearly hear the line \\"bet you keep yer p**sy clean.\\" However, the later pressings of the 2009 UMe cd still have the echo effect over the John Wayne part in the line \\"I'm taking bets that you gonna get John Wayne before he dies!\\" This was originally done by the album's engineer Andy Johns when John Wayne refused permission to use his name in the song. Andy Johns added the effect over the line and convinced Atlantic that the name was unrecognizable, which it actually is recognizable if you know the words. Atlantic also put distortion over the p-word line only in American pressings of the original LP.<br /><br /> If you want an edition that has no distortion over both the p-word and John Wayne line, get a copy of the 1994 Virgin remaster. For some reason they left it off entirely for this edition. Also, the 1994 sounds great, it's not as loud as the 2009 remaster. The 1994 remaster has better dynamics, especially on Dancing With Mr. D. I heard backing vocals and other instruments more clearly listening to the 1994 cd. I can now hear them on the 2009, but not as clearly as on the 1994 since the loud volume of the 2009 buries some of the other instruments and vocals.

B0016OOS16|5.0|I work with Autodesk Inventor 2012/13.<br />I tried one of these about a year ago and it took me about a week to get used to it.<br />I CANNOT work without it now - it is totally natural and comfortable to use and boosts your productivity tremendously.<br /><br />I just bought a second one simply as a backup in case the first one breaks whilst I'm travelling.<br />(I've travelled with the other one extensively and it is still 100% OK).<br /><br />Only glitch: the driver sometimes drops. At worst I restart Inventor and all is OK.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever beat me mates OMG i mean me mates are poo I mean I'm 4th cool or wot get the app now on Appstore
B00AU15HPC|5.0|If you like the Moody Blues, I'd recommend this and all of Justins solo albums to everyone. It was shipped promptly, which is always a plus.
0451418441|5.0|Set 150 some years later than Pillars of the Earth, in the same town of Kingsbridge, the plot begins as the children Merthin and Ralph, sons of a minor knight, Gwenda, the daughter of a disreputable landless laborer, and Caris, the daughter of the most successful wooler in town witness a skirmish in the forest between a knight and some royal henchman.  The other three flee, but Merthin stays and makes a vow to the knight to never reveal what he has seen. Ken Follett drops the reader into a well researched time warp of life in 1300's at the beginning of Edward III's reign.  Follett's well-developed characters play the survival game through the political machinations, the power struggle between the church and town, the black death, the weakening of the feudal system, the development of modern hospitals, the structural repairs of cathedrals and bridges, and of course, the everyday lives and romance of the people of the time. Although the book is long, I dreaded coming to the end.  I really enjoy when an author successfully blends fiction into history, and his characters become people you come to love or hate. This is a great read: informative, dramatic, exciting, and fun.
B005I7G3EM|5.0|We love this movie. We could not get it on Netflix.  The picture was great on an HD tv.  We like watching some older classic films, and we were very happy to find it on Amazon Prime.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Of all of the versions of Temple Run, this one is my favorite. The challenges are great, as are the dynamic environments. Love it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Through this book, I came to understand what motivated some of the things my otherwise modern, forward-looking, working mother said to me in the early 1970's. Sheryl also made me see how some women take ourselves out of the game. Although I think this book is important for women, I think it's even more important that men read it.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I own the soundtrack from the Broadway show and the movie voices don't compare.  I probably would be happier with just some of the best songs recorded by well known singers
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My son added it to my Kindle and he plays it a lot. He said that it was a cool game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It is to good to dislike!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />It is an awesome book to read and to learn more words!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I hope other people like it too!!!!!

0634049011|5.0|I have been using MI teaching books and the The Guitar Grimoire books and this combo are very good. Buy this and it'll help in developing your chord based leads. Barrett Tagliarino is a very good teacher and you'd be safe getting anything by him.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Loved the quirky characters and the way in which the story unfolds. It keeps you guessing right til the end. I picked this book because I enjoyed Gone Girl so much. Gillian Flynn is my new favorite author.
B009A9EYUO|5.0|You can find a review of how amazing this album is just about anywhere.  Definitely their finest hour.  Crazy basslines, inspired lyrics and the best pre-game locker album of the last 20 years.  But the vinyl?  Oh yes.  It delivers.  Recorded on a Neve console, the drums are amazing and the bass cuts through.  But, because of the method of recording?  So smooth and warm.  A tasty, tasty album.
B0087ZG7J8|5.0|I chose this rating as I am very very please, have no complaints, and would recommend this  to someone else :)
B00004WX4X|5.0|And a very good vinyl version.  Clean, warm and clear.  Hip hop sounds awesome on a good record player, and this album delivers.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|Love this album!  Love Bon Jovi, great music.  Worth every penny I spent!  Recommend it to all Bon Jovi fans!
B00007BKVC|5.0|Great movie.  My Girl friend and myself have been traveling together.  Loving it.  So we got the name Thelma and Louise.  So we had to order the movie because neither one of us had seen it.  GREAT MOVIE...
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|If you love Indiana Jones, this set is a must.  I bought it as a gift for my daughter in law.  She just loved it as she has been a fan for years.
B0099114WO|5.0|Great adult comedy, subject matter isn't for children.  My husband and I laughed through the movie.  Makes you stop and appreciate the one you are in love with.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Keeps you mild busy, without too much concentration.<br />Makes along day sitting still go faster.<br />Easy to handle while hooked to IV.<br />Easy to start and stop.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enoyed the suspense of the novel.  Each chapter brought a surprise.  Enjoyed the book, glad I read the book before seeing the movie.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This alarm is just fantastic. I've had it for over a year now and don't have any complaints.<br />I love that you can choose your own music by artist or just by song and that I can change the settings so that I have to do more math problems to snooze than there are minutes that I would gain from doing so... It's an effective motivator..
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My son is all about MineCraft so I got this as a gift. It was way smaller than expected for the price. smaller than the usual legos.
B0053KWDES|4.0|Unless you have a set of cans that require a hefty amp to power, the E11 is fantastic.  But the battery life leaves much to be desired.  You get about 10 hours on a full charge and you can't charge while you're listening.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Diamond dash is easy and fun.  (and a little addictive).  Not much thinking required which is great when you are just wanting something to vedge.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Was a great movie.  Made me really miss Santa Cruz!!  Was a very good portrayal of Santa Cruz in general.  From the characters to the houses.  Houses really do look like that.  Story was very very uplifting and sad at the same time but its just a reminder to live each day to the fullest.  Never take anything for granted!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|READ READ READ READ READ READ READ READ READ *PLEASE READ* this book is just amazing, Green couldn't of done a better job. Just read it dammit.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I love this album.  Every song has great lyrics that you can relate to.  The story of his life in music.  FANTASTIC!
B0095P33IW|5.0|The movie was great and Amazon Instant Video works really well on a PS3. It looks great! We for got we were streaming. There were zero hiccups. Definitely worth it!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|His songs have such great meaning and touch your heart.  I was brought up in Detroit and I could relate to his words.  Loved it!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Although this book is depressing I read it in it's entirety....I couldn't put it down.  It's nothing like I thought it would be. It is not a \\"feel good all over\\"  book.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|The set is really cool, and the wall is highly detailed, but the best part about the set is the minifigures.  It comes with six, four Uruk-hai and two soldiers of Rohan.  The accessories are listed below:<br /><br />***Good Guys***<br /><br />There are two helmets, Eomer's helmet is highly decorated, with gold leaf and horse designs, and the other soldiers is just plain light grey.  There is a brown horse that can rear and balance on its hind legs, even with a person on top.  It comes with a special type of LEGO spear, with a rubber (though very durable) tip, a sword, a bow and quiver, a highly decorated shield, and a green cape. Eomers legs are also slightly more decorated then the other soldiers.  I would say the only problem with the good guys is that when Eomer is riding the horse, the cape may rip.  However, that is a maybe, so it is still really cool. Both of the soldiers have double-sided faces, with one side being calm and the other angry.<br /><br />***Bad Guys***<br /><br />There are four Uruk-hai, who are sort of like a super-powered orc.  The set comes with two pieces of chest armor for them, three helmets, two orc swords, and two shields.  It also comes with two large axes, and one orc has a piece of hair instead of a helmet.  All of their bodies and legs are the same, as are their heads.  One thing none of the other reviews mentioned, though, was that the Uruk-hai have double-sided faces, too. One side is with a white hand print on their heads, and the other is just their face.<br /><br />The wall is pretty cool, if slightly small.  The top has a catapult to launch stones, and there is an arrow-slit in the bottom of the wall.  There is a set of stairs in the back. The ballista is pretty skeletal, because there just isn't a good body for it.  However, it is still pretty well built. It does not shoot very far, though. And while it is slightly pricey, it is still a really good set, perfect for people just wanting to expand their Lord of the Rings world.
B00C32TPZE|5.0|Volbeat's newest album hits the nail on the head just like their previous albums.  While it is not quite as heavy as their previous albums, it has its own unique rock/western sound that is not comparable to anything else I've ever heard (of course I'm only a musically naive 20 year old).  The best description of this album is that it sounds like something I would listen to if I were riding out on the frontier on my trusty stallion and happened to have an ipod with me...<br /><br />Anyone familiar with Volbeat's sound will surely appreciate these songs, and while it is lighter than their older stuff, it's still just so good to listen regardless of what you're doing.  This is one of those rare albums that I can listen to all the way through without having to skip the &#34;bad&#34; song or the songs that are just not hitting me right.<br /><br />My only gripe with this album is that it lacks the two bonus tracks found on the deluxe album (&#34;Ecotone&#34; and &#34;Evelyn (live from Wacken 2012)&#34;).  Although I have not yet listened to &#34;Evelyn&#34;, I have heard &#34;Ecotone&#34;, and I personally really like it.  It's just a shame it didn't get put on this version of the album.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase, and can't wait to see these guys live at Rock on the Range!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|end was great, good quality picture and one click buying was really easy to watch the show, 3 more words
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Absolutely adore each and every second of this series.  The characters are fabulous, the sets are gorgeous, and the costumes are beautiful beyond belief!  I watched the entire three seasons back to back over a three day period.  What a treat!!!Can't wait for season 4.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Lived the book!  Can't wait til I read the rest of the series! I wonder how all the characters are going to bloom
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Cant get enough of Downton Abbey.  Its a feast for the senses. The sets, the costumes, and then the characters... a must see!
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book was average, I don't quite know why they were entered in the hunger games again. They could've broke out in a war and president snow could've sent the creatures in the district's to kill off people. I was somewhat disappointed but I liked the last chapter. The first few chapters were a bit sleepy.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|The story line was pretty good but the style of the characters was grotesque in the extreme.  Basically, a lot of attention went into creating some really ugly characters and they overpowered the story line.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is great for a zombie show. I do really like it.<br /><br />It didn't get 5 stars because I wish it was focused a bit less on the drama.

B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I was really anticipating the release of the 2nd season of American Horror Story. I'm a HUGE horror film fan, and this TV show makes way for a new genre of TV. I thought the 1st season was brilliant, so I ordered the 2nd season through Amazon.<br /><br />At points in the series, the plot seems to drag on. There are some great twists and turns around every corner, and the last episode was also fantastic! I just don't feel that it measured up to the 1st season. I was a little disappointed by that, but I still really like the show.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|this is an amazing book for the accuracy and depth of the information released on tactics etc.I really enjoyed this book but was shocked that so much was given out so soon.It must have been the strong desire on the US government to highlight the success of the mission that allowed it to be released. This should be read before seeing the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The novel could not have had a more effective ending.  The response he had for her was absolutely true karma.
B009S33I68|4.0|great book and very good for history buffs.Obviously Hal Moore has a strong respect and love for his men and they were lucky to have such a serious warrior as their boss. I understand why he always says where each man came from but it was annoying for the reader.
B000000ORE|5.0|My first two albums as a kid were Metallica's \\"Ride The Lightning\\" and Tesla's \\"Great Radio Controversy\\". The albums of my youth bring a metal/hard rock tear to my eye. \\"Hang Tough\\" (the anthem of all bad asses) starts this classic off with an interesting build up with the bass. The riffs make this song SO catchy. Nothing too technical with the drumming it keeps pace through the whole song. The solo is great. And the chorus is done in typical 80s fashion. \\"Lady Luck\\" another catchy riff will drag you in. The lyrics are great and catchy as well. \\"Heaven's Trail, No Way Out\\" One of my favorite songs from the whole album. I used to get pumped to this before I would wrestle. The bass and guitar work is HEAVY. \\"Be A Man\\" uplifting track and that's about it. The chorus is catchy but doesn't have the same power or punch as the previous tracks. \\"Lazy Days\\" 80s rock combined with blues. Good track from a line of greats. Really catchy, and Jeff Keith has a great performance vocally here. \\"Did It For The Money\\" The intro builds up to a mid pace rocker. You'll headbang to this one folks. Strong blues influence can be felt here at the mid point of the track. \\"Yesterdaze Gone\\" One of the fastest tracks on the whole album. Riffs are simple but the drumming keeps pace. Not too big on this track, it has energy but it is missing the magic from the first tracks. \\"Making Magic\\" Catchy heavy metal riffs lead the way!! The title is self explanatory about what the song is about. \\"The Way It Is\\" We come back to the blues hard rock with 80s influence again. A semi-ballad that paves the way for the best known ballad of Tesla's after the next track. \\"Flight To Nowhere\\" Piano meets 80s riffs and solos. This track has one of the heaviest riffs from any rock band from the 80s. \\"Love Song\\" One of their better known tracks. Personally, I'm not a fan of ballads they are all the same one way or another. If you like ballads you'll love this track. To me ballads are a personal taste. \\"Paradise\\" Melodic solo opens the track to some piano work and Jeff Keith's vocals guide you through the whole track. One of their most underrated in my opinion. \\"Party's Over\\" Unfortunately it is after this track. The riff is so catchy it will be stuck in your head for years. The rhythm can not be compared to any other hard rock track in the 80s.<br /><br />This is a must buy for 80s lovers!! Anyone that likes hard rock you will love this I assure you.c solo opens the track to some piano work and Jeff Keith's vocals guide you through the whole track.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie. would highly recommend it.  makes you realize that human beings are  capable of so much ....I like to think of the movie as being just they way we saw it not the possible alternate ending
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This one of the berst albums I've bought in a long time. The chemistry between Timbaland & J.T. really shines on this project.

B0018RC7QE|4.0|I felt a certain guilty pleasure in watching two people of conscience struggle with the urge to find their primary attachment outside their nuclear family.  DeNiro and Streep are both terrific.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|It seems we have waited forever for a Les Mis movie.  I thought it could have been done better.  Musically, I found it disappointing.  Hugh Jackman's signing was not up to par.  Russell Crowe could neither sing nor act. The students, however, including Marius were all very good.  The girls have minor roles, but I was not as impressed with Ann Hathaway as some people were.  On the whole, the acting was better than the singing.  They played around with the music, words, etc., but if you are a Les Mis fan, this is still worth owning.
B0053O89IS|5.0|my kids and I watched it in 1 weekend and would tell anyone who asked it the best so far of the show
B002QRWJA4|4.0|I had heard this was not a very good movie, but I thought it was well done.  Gerard Butler was not the best phantom they could have chosen, but the rest of the cast were fine.
B008393Q2O|3.0|This app is user friendly. It has a lot of competition and other apps do as good a job. Saying that, I would still recommend it to store small notes and reminders.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|Ralph Fiennes is great as usual.  The filming was well done.  Some of the shots of the scenery were breathtaking.  This is definitely a movie to watch more than once.
0739366408|3.0|The content that was there was great, but the audio book leaves out a good deal of the book. I can only assume this was an artistic choice, but some of my favorite vignettes were missing, many of which I felt left gaping holes in the plot.
B0026ISUUQ|5.0|The cast is fabulous.  This is a must see for anyone who admires Ralph Fiennes' acting talent.  The director did a great job of getting this filmed well.
0061992860|5.0|Great advice, full color photos, simple layout, and a compact lightweight format that's small enough to slip in your pack. The one critique I have is that the CPR segment is out of date. I'd love if the author did an update with the 2010 AHA guidelines. But you gotta love the British advice that reminds you not to leave home without the tea. Grab one for your favorite irresponsible backpacker.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Have'nt finished it yet.  But, it keeeps you interest right from Page 1.. Love it so far! Hope it's this good to the end.
B008EKOO46|4.0|This is an outstanding book that uses contemporary tribal cultures, much like those in which much of human evolution occurred, to offer insights into current personal, social, and medical problems in the modern world.  It's well-research, interesting, and readable, and although I thought I knew a great deal about this topic, I learned a great deal.  The only downside is that the book is 25% longer than it needed to be for the nonspecialist reader.  Many topics were covered with far greater depth and detail than many readers will want.  But, still, skimming over some of the longer digressions was a small price to pay for the information and insights that this book provides.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The depth of the characters is the first thing I notice when I read this book again and again. After reading the book you feel connected to an like you truly know these characters.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Love the weight and feel of this watch. If you have a large wrist, this is probably not the watch for you though. For a 21 jeweled Seiko automatic, you can't beat the price!
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|The comic book really come to life.  This is a must have for Batman fans.  May not be appropriate for young children.
B009PU2KIQ|3.0|Gary is fantastic, though as in the past, it will not download to my Ipod.....?  What might be the problem?
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I was not particularly a fan of the original comic, but I absolutely loved the story as an animated film.<br /><br />You should also pick up Part 2 for the complete story.  Very dark and may not be appropriate for young children.  It is fine for pre-teen and teen.
B00493E1GI|3.0|After reading the book and watching the movie, the movie feels short on portraying Liz's emotional distress.<br /><br />I know movies based on books are never the same, and how hard is to make the movie a mirror of the book but I was expecting more out of this one.  I think I was looking forward to see how they would portray her emotional imbalance.<br /><br />I did like the ending with Felipe!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a great series to read. I saw the movie so that is why I choose to read the book and they did not disappoint. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an action novel with a love aspect also.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Simply put - it is just fun to watch - cannot help but laughing out loud - chacters are very endearing.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Very good suspenseful must read I love Grover and Annabeth please please read awesome book you will love it guaranteed
B00355L2TU|1.0|I am a person who has always been reasonably fit, and never had any knee problems what so ever.  While working out I am very careful about using correct form. After doing this workout for three weeks, I have a torn miniscus in my left knee, requiring surgery.  I just wanted to give a heads up that you should be aware of a potential undesirable side effect.  Not worth it!!!!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The eBay Android App, makes it easy to monitor and follow ones eBay account while away from home, I now can follow my bids, and be more competitive in the Bidding process.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I am a big Lincoln buff and a big Spielberg fan... so why did I think that this film was just good and not great.  Clearly the subject matter is compelling and the writing and acting is as good as it gets.  Daniel Day-Lewis once again proves that he is a master actor and Sally Fields reminds us why she has twice won the Academy Award.  But there is somehow a lack of passion in this film.  I never connected with it viscerally, it had no emotional impact.  I had the same experience with War Horse, a film that should have provoked tears just left me flat.  Anyway Lincoln is beautifully photographed and flush with great character actors performing at their best.  Don't miss it.  I just hope that it hits you harder than it did me.
B000FA675C|4.0|This is Dan Brown's best novel - fast paced, well written - will keep the reader engaged If you only want to read one book written by this author - this is definitely the one
B006FPFTMS|5.0|More functions and faster than big names. No vile security bugs and Big brother way of managing my use of the program. For anyone who don't trust Adobe, Foxit is a good place to to find peace of mind.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I didn't really know what I was getting in to with this book, but I ended up loving it! I'm actually excited that there are 9 more to go!
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Love the series, just wish I didn't have to wait a year avoiding spoilers before I could get my hands on it. Especially with the ease of torrents nowadays.  My only motivation to wait is the thought of seeing it in HD with surround sound.  Now I get to start waiting till next spring for season 3.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is thoroughly  invested with richly portrayed characters and faithful renderings of the life and times of one British upper class family and their servants, relatives and neighbors..  It follows the characters of this household  going through the vicissitudes of country life following the economic woes of  post-WWI England, and the social changes that begin to slowly blur the lines between the landed gentry and the servant class.  Also it touches on the Irish &#34;troubles&#34;, women's rights, and the re-structuring of the tenant farmers' contributions to the estate of Downton Abbey,  We watch as each class of persons reacts to the social, economic, and moral changes brought on by the  aftermath of a world war..<br />I highly recommend everyone to watch this series....even those who have difficulty understanding the King's English.  The brogue is easily understood in Downton Abbey and should be a comfortable, but soul-satisfying introduction the glory of  BBC productions.
B0002BO05S|5.0|Fast and very reliable! Would buy here again. A a a a a a a a a a a a good bargain!
B000069HZP|4.0|I personally don't put much stock in other peoples review of movies.  It's just too subjective.  I like most Michael Douglas movies, and I like this one.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I do like this movie and it kept my interest through out the whole movie. I like every part and I was glad when it went on sale for the price that I paid for it. I rented it when it first came out I waited a while before buying it and I am glad  it is mine.
B00632HWOG|5.0|When I am not at my computer, I am now able to check my email more frequently and respond immediately instead of hours later.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|I liked this movie. I already have the first one and before I bought the 2nd one I rented it first to make sure that it was as good as the first one. It is a great action movie, and I now own it and it was for a good price.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This and more reviews available at [...]<br /><br />At one point I had to pause and wanted to hide my book in the linen closet.  I knew what was going to happen next.  John Green novels don't let on that things are going to end with the lovely couple running through a field of posies, into the sunset.  If you've read \\"Looking for Alaska\\", you know what you're in for; the emotional roller coaster of life and death... reality. We all know our existence will be extinguished, however, the majority of us don't know how, unless, you have some kind of kick-ass fortuneteller.  Still, is it something you want to know?  How your life is going to end.  \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" (or TFIOS as the kids are calling it) faces this unknown, final chapter head on.  Hard enough for adults, John Green's novel depicts a teen's perspective in facing terminal illness.  The illness however takes a backseat to the living.  How does one live the life they are dealt, even if it sucks?<br /><br />Great One-liners/Quotes:<br />\\"I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you.\\"<br />Augustus Waters<br /><br />\\"After I finished, there was quite a long period of silence as I watched a smile spread all the way across Augustus's face - not the little crooked smile of the boy trying to be sexy while he stared at me, but this real smile, too big for his face. \\"Goddamn,\\" Augustus said quietly.  \\"Aren't you something else.\\"<br />Hazel Grace Lancaster (really Gus)<br />After it was over, Peter Van Houten looked at us expectantly, his little eyes as wide as they could get.  \\"Yeah?\\" he asked.  \\"Yeah?\\"<br />Peter Van Houten<br /><br />I said, \\"I'm sorry, sir, but we don't speak Swedish.\\"<br />\\"Well, of course you don't.  Neither do I.  Who the hell speaks Swedish?  The important thing is not whatever nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling.  Surely you know that there are only two emotions, love and fear...\\"y, sir, but we don't speak Swedish.\\"<br />\\"Well, of course you don't.  Neither do I.  Who the hell speaks Swedish?  The important thing is not whatever nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling.  Surely you know that there are only two emotions, love and fear...\\"

B001ANSS5K|5.0|This and more reviews at [...]<br /><br />Review: Top Shelf; I AM ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, 100% IN LOVE WITH IS BOOK!<br /><br />Either an insanely brilliant mind(s) created this story or they are really undercover `Indiana Jones' types who have actually lived out these adventures.  It just kept getting better.  I was so consumed with the \\"clues\\" that Margo left for Quentin and his crew of pseudo-misfits.  Margo, Quentin \\"Q\\", Ben, Radar, even Lacey are exactly the people I wish I hung out with in High School.  The fact that they don't try to fit in what is considered `norm' and make life an adventure without limits was inspiring.<br /><br />(when Radar is forced to wear a gas station souvenir T-shirt over his ill-prepared road trip graduation robe)<br /><br />\\"I hope I get pulled over,\\" he says. \\"I'd like to see how the cop responds to a black man wearing a Confederate T-shirt over a black dress.\\"<br />Green, John (2008-10-04). Paper Towns (p. 256). Penguin Group US. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />The kinship between friends is hilarious (laughed out loud multiple times); always trying to one-up the other can go on forever.  The dynamic between these intelligent boys and their need to find their romantic match is lovely.  Quentin & Margo have to be destined for each other; a shared, childhood experience with death is a binding force.  Quentin imagines Margo to be this beautiful idol on a pedestal and is too timid to join her outrageous antics, as he has a mapped out future to secure.<br /><br />(Q and Margo attempt to `enter' Sea World by wading through a Florida moat and Margo is bitten by a snake)<br /><br />After looking at the bite and seeing that the bleeding had already stopped, she asked, \\"How was making out with my leg?\\" \\"Pretty good,\\" I said, which was true. She leaned her body into mine a little and I could feel her upper arm against my ribs. \\"I shaved this morning for precisely that reason. I was like, `Well, you never know when someone is going to clamp down on your calf and try to suck out the snake poison.'\\"<br />Green, John (2008-10-04). Paper Towns (p. 75). Penguin Group US. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />\\"Paper Towns\\", like \\"Looking for Alaska\\" and \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\", examines the human existence and the destiny of the characters as they contemplate what it's all about.  Of course, deconstruction of being is not  easily done, but Quentin's persistence and dissection of Whitman's \\"Leaves of Grass\\" and Margo's view of her two-dimensional world is thought provoking.  I never felt lost while reading this book.  The writing, as always, is poetic and jarring.  The words flow off my mental tongue smoothly and I had to finish the book as soon as I got halfway though Part One.<br /><br />(The detective put on Margo's `missing adult' case expresses his feelings to Q)<br /><br />\\"Listen, kid. This is what happens: somebody-- girl usually-- got a free spirit, doesn't get on too good with her parents. These kids, they're like tied-down helium balloons. They strain against the string and strain against it, and then something happens, and that string gets cut, and they just float away. And maybe you never see the balloon again. It lands in Canada or somethin', gets work at a restaurant, and before the balloon even notices, it's been pouring coffee in that same diner to the same sad bastards for thirty years. Or maybe three or four years from now, or three or four days from now, the prevailing winds take the balloon back home, because it needs money, or it sobered up, or it misses its kid brother. But listen, kid, that string gets cut all the time.\\"<br />\\"Yeah, bu--\\"<br />\\"I'm not finished, kid. The thing about these balloons is that there are so goddamned many of them. The sky is choked full of them, rubbing up against one another as they float to here or from there, and every one of those damned balloons ends up on my desk one way or another, and after a while a man can get discouraged. Everywhere the balloons, and each of them with a mother or a father, or God forbid both, and after a while, you can't even see 'em individually. You look up at all the balloons in the sky and you can see all of the balloons, but you cannot see any one balloon.\\"<br />He paused then, and inhaled sharply, as if he was realizing something. \\"But then every now and again you talk to some big-eyed kid with too much hair for his head and you want to lie to him because he seems like a good kid. And you feel bad for this kid, because the only thing worse than the skyful of balloons you see is what he sees: a clear blue day interrupted by just the one balloon. But once that string gets cut, kid, you can't uncut it. Do you get what I'm saying?\\"<br />Green, John (2008-10-04). Paper Towns (p. 104-105). Penguin Group US. Kindle Edition.<br />\\"...at some point, you gotta stop looking up at the sky, or one of these days you'll look back down and see that you floated away, too.\\"<br />Green, John (2008-10-04). Paper Towns (p. 151). Penguin Group US. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />Q's examination of Margo's quest touches every emotion, and you feel deep down (especially if you've read \\"Looking For Alaska\\") that something's wrong.

I needed to know that he and his friends were going to find their way through the tunnel and back into the light.<br /><br />(Q, Radar & Ben search an abandoned minimall, following a clue from Margo, fearing they may have found her too late)<br /><br />This fear bears no analogy to any fear I knew before. This is the basest of all possible emotions, the feeling that was with us before we existed, before this building existed, before the earth existed.

B000002LFZ|5.0|loved it - had the cd or album, not sure years ago and lost it<br /><br />when i found this on sale online - quickly bought it - brought back great memories - still love this music
B00683JK9K|3.0|Good game to play for downtime. I can sit and play it all day. I enjoy the  different levels so that kids and adults can play.
145210655X|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my cousin, whose son was just born, and he absolutely loves it. I almost didn't want to give it away it was so well done and funny :) Excellent gift.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love taken pictures but they don't always love me so this app is a lifesaver. It allows me to make my skin look flawless and fix any imperfections that I don't like. I spend hours taking pictures and editing them with this app. It was worth the buy.
0439023491|4.0|My colleague informed me that Catching Fire was better than the Hunger Games, but I didn't believe him.  However, now that I've read the book myself, I strongly agree.  This second book had me enthralled as much as the first book; however, it focuses more on the relationship between Katniss & Peeta, and less on the Games.  The end of the book leaves the reader yearning to begin to last book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it, loved it & love it. We watched it as a family night. We started watching walking dead this year and court up to season 3. It was non-stop excitement.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|A great mix of Science, tech and History. With Battles to contest Robbert Ludlum and Tom Clancy. I dont want this series to end ever!!!
B000FA675C|4.0|I'd read it before, downloaded this when e-copy was available free. Dan Brown is exciting and a good read, although his suspense method puffery sometimes gets a bit overblown and hokey rather than building suspense.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Great knife for a lot of different applications, you will not be disappointed. This knife will proboly out last me, at that time a will leave it to my son.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Quick enjoyable read, some interesting insights. I do network consulting, and a lot of this potentially carries over to managing staff time on projects there as well.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Great graphics,but the game bangs up and bugs a lot.  You cannot play much without purchasing peanuts, which is a big  negative.  The graphics are 5 star.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I had a great time reading this book.  I thought the characters were well developed, especially the main character.  The story kept me engaged the entire time.  Very exciting, but believable.  A previous reviewer called this \\"science-fact\\" instead of science fiction - a very accurate description.  Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|So, this is an awesome series, and I have really enjoyed watching it, but if I had known in advance where the story ended in the finale, I definitely wouldn't have bought it early.  I know that the writers cannot control their actors choices, but I was absolutely blown away by the two successive deaths of two major characters.  As much as I love the series and ALL of the actors, I have to say that the loss of these two characters materially changes the integrity of the story.  Shame, shame, shame on both actors for their hasty grab at fame brought by the exposure from the show!
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|It was nice to see Kristin Stewart in a role that was totally opposite of Bella Swan.  And Charlize Theron was top of the chart evil.  The special effects for the witch's costumes and appearances was totally awesome.  I enjoyed the modern take on a very old fairytale--makes Snow White a little more proactive in her destiny.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|If you are a LOTR's lover, then you've probably already purchased this; but if not, it's a must-have.  I'm only sorry it will be so long before the next installment.
B002BWP49M|5.0|The wedding and honeymoon were glorious as was Jacob's and Edward's emotions about the &#34;pregnancy.&#34;  The movie really followed the storyline from the book.  Cannot wait to see Part 2.
B008602KQI|4.0|We originally rented this from Redbox and watched it with our daugther.  I had never read the books, but was prompted to do so, because the storylien was compelling.<br /><br />The movie does follow the book, although not nearly as accurately as, say, the LOTR movies; but still, the story has merit.  I look forward to the sequels.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Pacing was good, never slow or dull. More gritty than Stallone version, good character development. My girlfriend even enjoyed it!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What I like most about this book is that it opened my eyes to horrors of war.  I read and listened to this book about an hour each day.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Absolutely required viewing for anyone seriously interested in film. Fasten your seatbelt and get ready to have your mind bent. Lynch's overriding obsession is identity. Most characters appear twice, reappearing as different characters. You need to open your mind and not expect everything to make conventional sense. Is all or part of it a dream? You decide. Or don't decide, just enjoy the ride. A seductive and stunning work of sound and vision.
B001HN6922|4.0|I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GREAT GRANDSON HE ABSOLUTELY LOVES THE MOVIE.PRICE I PAID FOR IT WAS FANTASTIC. HE WILL GET SEVERAL YEARS FROM THIS MOVIE. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND BUYING.
B004LZFWJO|3.0|I absolutely love it I would have given it five stars except there is no save feature. Add the save feature and I will give it five stars.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|[[ASIN:B00B2JSRAS E-Squared: Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments That Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality (Hay House Insights)]], was sent to me as a free e-book from Hay House Publishing for review purposes.  The opinions expressed in this review are my own, and are based solely on my experience.  After reading the description of the book--which made the bold claim that one could test universal spiritual principles and receive dependable, consistent results within 48 hours--I was hooked.<br /><br />Pam Grout, the author of [[ASIN:B00B2JSRAS E-Squared: Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments That Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality (Hay House Insights)]], is brilliant at breaking down the mechanics of working with the universal energies and helping the reader to master them one bite-sized chunk at a time.  For those like me, who have their doubts due to less-than-impressive manifesting results in years past, the author has some news for you:<br /><br />\\"If you've read The Secret or been in metaphysical, spiritual circles for any time at all, you already know your thoughts create your reality...and that you and you alone design your own life. Unfortunately, there's still this tiny little problem, this one itty-bitty catch. You don't really believe it. Not fully.\\"<br /><br />The book consists of 9 experiments, with a chapter dedicated to explaining the premise of each one, as well as the method that will be used, and anecdotal evidence from real-life cases of famous and not so famous \\"participants.\\"  The end of every chapter features a nifty lab report sheet that can be copied so that the user can keep track of their progress.  I love the way the lab report sheets are designed to engage the user and give them the sense that they are conducting authentic scientific experiments.  Some of the things the user will be invited to document are research notes, a hypothesis, a theory, and the amount of time required.  My results with a few of these experiments were off the charts fantastic once I trained my mind to accept that they were possible.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this fun and humorous book that was more like an entertaining do-it-yourself manual for those in need of a refresher course on what the author calls the infinite field of potentiality, or the F.P. for short.  It's a great way to discover what you're made of, and prove to yourself once and for all, that you are one powerful, energy-wielding creator of your experiences.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Function and style are great. Would be better if I could read my twitter feed the same way. It is getting much better though.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|I went to see this movie with my husband, a big Tarantino fan. Honestly, I had never seen a Tarantino film all the way through and I fully expected to dislike Django.  I'm  not a fan of guns, violence, racism, or obscene language (all present in this film) and assumed I was going to hate it. Wrong! It was funny, sad, exciting,  and satisfying. I LOVED Christopher Waltz.  Django's journey from slave to bounty hunter was quite the trip. I would watch it again and enjoy it again.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Visually Stunning, emotionally entrenching, jarring storey line...over all, just a really excellent movie!<br />I would highly recommend this movie...plan on purchasing and watching again
B008B37CB8|5.0|Gotta love Zappa!  Takes me back to my teen years.  Great times back in college enjoying the easy  no estasblishment.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Hope they keep cranking them out - love the upbeat sound and harmony.  Jealous my son will see them live this year.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've been watching since season one and not a band wagon jumper like most of you.  Can't wait for season 4.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I ordered this and took a chance as I did not know the group very well but it is now one of my favorites.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|There were funny parts and I think Anthony Hopkins did a great job as A.H.  Love Helen Murrin in anything she does.  Jessica Biel and Scarlet Johannsen - gorgeous as always.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|This was the second time I read this book.  It is super.  I love reading about WWII and the english view point.  We reviewed this for our book club and I made food that was referenced in the book as an English AfternoonTea.  I served the creme tea, ribbon cake, Bird's Eye Custard with fruit and everyone loved the history that I added to the presentation.

B00C4QWDYY|2.0|I love Amazon and have Amazon Prime and I try to buy as much stuff as possible through Amazon. I also love The Walking Dead and paid to watch season 3. But for this season specifically the streaming seemed to suck and be slow and stop and just generally p*ss me off. I have great wireless connection and watched lots of other shows on from the streaming service with no problems, but this time it literally took me over and hour and a half to watch the season finale. Seriously. I mean, come on.
B00CBXV96I|5.0|I must be crazy to enjoy this kind of thing.  Um, don't go there.<br /><br />OKay, let's take a look at why I enjoyed it.<br /><br />One: It's a familiar tale.  Hannibal Lector is an old \\"evil mind\\" and a beloved monster from past movies.  A deeply detailed and rich character whose evil is fascinating to watch unfold in a train wreck kind of way.  And this Hannibal has all the charisma and intricacies of a truly great bad guy.  The actor brings new life to him and in such a way that he feels entirely new and frightening.<br /><br />Two: The series features excellent actors and special effects worthy of a movie set.  It's direction and style is gripping and tense.  It does not matter that we know Lector, Jack and Will already, in this series they look and feel brand new and I am on the edge of my seat waiting to see more of their relationships develop.<br /><br />Three: The case of the week is also just as gripping and different as the perspective of the series offers us.<br /><br />It's a thriller.  A ride.  And even when he uses the oldest cannibal joke in the book, \\"I'd love to have you and your wife for dinner,\\" Hannibal feels appropriately creepy and alluring.<br /><br />A pleasure to watch and wait for each week.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was very good story with lots of twists that you don't expect . This book kept me reading well into the night and will not disappoint Sparks fans!
0743200799|5.0|This is less of a page-turner than my last book on space flight (viz, Lost Moon), but it is well-written.  It reads like a history, but includes the personal dimension as well.  America's early days--prior to satellite communication and modern computers--are the initial setting. It's an amazing account of Kranz and his teammates' successes and failures, as they seek to put a man on the moon.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, intense young love at its best.  The story was well written with unexpected twists. Good page turner
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|These days, anything Dave Grohl touches, it turns to solid gold rock. Love his attitude about how music SHOULD be made. Too many so called &#34;artist&#34; have lost their love and passion for rock music and let the machines do it. Very sad. Long live, DAVE GROHL.
B00BQ1DAHC|2.0|Set up preorder on this album b/c we love Volbeat, love the style, seen them in concert a few times but this was a huge letdown. Not one song we liked or cared to listen to twice.
B009GED3HS|4.0|I hate that this is basically the only way to catch up on this series; it isn't available via hulu or Netflix. The series itself is awesome, as usual, and streams well from this site.

0525953728|5.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" is a good book and I recommend it to everyone. It is a very easy and very quick read. Check it out. There are war narratives or soldiers' stories which are better, but the inclusion of the killing of UBL makes the book worthy of a read. There is a scene in the book which is quite startling. Once in the UBL house and heading upstairs, one of the Seals calls out to UBL's son in a whisper, \\"Khalid.\\" And sadly, Khalid opened his door. He is dead a moment later. It is starling, but we are at war. And it was not a kill order...the Seals were told by a government lawyer, \\"We are not telling you how to do your job, but if he is nude and his hands are up, don't shoot.\\" I guess it is a good thing UBL did not sleep in the buff. Enjoy.<br /><br />Timothy E. Kennelly

B00005ASOC|5.0|It's about a young student Jamal Wallace who loves to write. One day while playing basketball his friends dared him to go up to \\"The window\\" which was rumored to be haunted and strange sounds go on inside the apartment. He intrudes by climbing through the window intending to steal something to bring back to his friends to prove he went up there. While stealing he meets a disturbed Forrester,a famous hermit author, and he quickly leaps out of the window and left his backpack full of his journals. After realizing this he goes back to the apartment and apologizes for what he have done. Forrester throws his bookbag  out with his journals full of corrections and was told sarcasticly him to write an 5,000 essay on why he should stay out of his home.Jamal ends up doing the essay and brings it back to him to say that he really mean to apologize and Forrester let's him in to his apartment.He teaches Jamal to write, that whatever they write it will stay there and that he doesn't tell anyone about Forrester. and with this he improved and ended up upgrading to a private school. With basketball skills and his writing skills combined he makes new friends and even able to take the new team to the championships. Though one day a rival of Forrester who is also Jamal's English teacher, Mr.Crawford catches up with Jamal and thinks he didn't write everything himself. So later he asked all the students to write a writing piece to hand in to enter a contest. So Jamal takes one of the forbidden stories he was never to take out of the building that was remade from one of Forrester's stories. and entered the contest and everyone was astounded by his work so when he was taken down to Crawford's office to see an nearly identical story by no other than Forrester himself and was pressed for plagerism charges if he didn't cite or was given Forrester's approval. Also, if he didn't admit it and didn't win the championship his academics will go down the drain. So after Forrester notices that Jamalsneeked the essay out he was very angry. After they two came to an arguement, Before he leaves Jamal tells him he kept his promise that he did not tell anyone the it was Forrester who help him with his essay. After his older brother came to meet forrester and tells him about all the written work Jamal did for him out of care. After Forrester realized this he goes up to Jamal's school to make a guest appearance and to read an essay in Jamal's English class. After Mr.Crawford saying how it was an honor for them to hear his words it was then revealed it was one of Jamal's written works. So after this everything turned to normal and Jamal gotten letter's from Forrester after her moved to Scotland. It was then replied that he recently died from cancer and he was given keys to his apartment with a thank you letter and a novel which was expected for Jamal to finish for him. The film finishes with Jamal playing some hoops with his old friends.<br /><br />This film was very inspiring and touching. It teaches the lesson in friendship and trust. The film focuses around writing and did a good jobin teaching the actor and audience more about writing. There were also tons of writing references. This movie is a great watch. I watch this in high school with other students and everyone loved it.

0765348276|2.0|I am 90 percent through this book, but I am struggling to finish.  The writing--sentence structure, word choice, grammar--is fine.  But there is no effective realization of a believable future here.  The reader is told that the CDF is way ahead of the Earth technologically, that emigrants to colonial worlds are mainly from Islamic India (though presumably with some groups from other less developed locales), and one surmises that the main source of the CDF's infantry forces is mainly North America.  Why?  The reader is never told.  The colonies appear to have considerable stake in the CDF being successful, but it is unclear what sort of economy binds them to the CDF and to Earth, because there is no discussion of interplanetary trade, just interplantary war.  There is no explanation of how the CDF amasses its apparently vast resources to engage in research and development and to wage constant war of attrition.  The bodies into which elderly (mainly) Americans--who have to sign off multiple times on contracts before joining the CDF--are transplanted have trademarked components.  Whom does the CDF worry is going to sue them over contract infringement, and whom does the CDF worry about having to sue over trademark violations?  More broadly, exactly what sort of economic system keeps the human side of this universe going?  Without a believable superstructure, it is hard to get very excited about the individual incentives of the characters, whom by the 90-percent point I have reached seem only to be motivated by spur-of-the-moment attachments to one another without any regard for their future lives.  They discount the future almost 100 percent.  People just do not think this way, and even people who have already lived 75 years would not think this way once they have youthful bodies again, hence the title of my review.  At the 90-percent point, this novel has all the depth and nuance of a videogame.  Even if there finally turns out to be some interesting development by theend, the coming 10 percent (if I can bring myself to read it) could at best bring the book up to the level of a B movie.  Yet this book and others by this author have won science fiction awards, and I have read that the author is among the best younger science fiction writers.  Unfortunately, I suspect that is true.  I mean no disrespect to the author.  Undoubtedly he is responded rationally to economic incentives that he faces.  The bigger issue is how science fiction reached this point.  I am just about ready to give on on the genre.  I keep searching for something as good as the 1950s-1970s had to offer.  Even the 1980s-early 1990s period was better than today, and overall (with a few exceptions--Vernor Vinge and Connie Willis at their best, for instance) it was fairly weak.  My conclusion is that this really is among the best of modern science fiction books, but it is still only a two-star book.  That beats the one star that I have given the past several I've reviewed.  But it may be among the last I'll review.  I've spent a significant amount of my book budget searching for the best I can find in science fiction, and two stars sums up the results of that search.  Every other genre I've read has delivered three-star-level books or above.  It appears that the best writers--those who can write well and who take the trouble carefully to craft interesting backgrounds, plots, characters, and link them together into a well realized and nicely written whole--are not opting to write science fiction.  Or perhaps publishers are not constraining these other writers to either videogame stories or to explore the usually socialist vistas that now dominate science fiction.  (Old Man's War may or may not be a socialist vista; the reader has not a clue.)  As I have searched Amazon's site, I'm seeing that some of the most highly reviewed science fiction is now written by people who seek to inject free market ideas into their stories or to question rule by authority, with most ofthese novels and stories bypassing traditional publishers altogether and sold only for use on Kindles; the traditional publishers may have been unwilling to touch such (to them) radioactive ideas as free markets and freedom from collective control, but many of us readers would like to escape from today's world into universes in which personal freedom is valued.  I spend so much time in front of the screens of digital devices that I prefer to read novels and stories on paper (often in bed) instead of on yet another screen.  Until that preference changes, I think this will be the last review of a science fiction novel that I shall write for quite a while.

B003Y5D776|3.0|If you just need something to get the job done quick and dirty, this is fine. But if you're looking for great quality and latency reduction, look elsewhere. Trying to record guitar in sync with a beat proved difficult for me with this thing. It wasn't terrible, but definitely noticeable.
B00B69UQEO|2.0|So, first of all, I must say I've been a fan of Depeche since 1990.  Violator, Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Ultra are all fabulous albums, with<br />so many favorites, and so many memories attached to them that they are personal classics.<br /><br />I must say I've been more and more disappointed with each release since Exciter, with the exception of Playing the Angel, which had the memorable<br />\\"Macro\\" and the gorgeously stunning, \\"The Darkest Star,\\" arguably the best track in many years.  I found Sounds of the Universe really thin.  Yes,<br />there's some delight to \\"Little Soul,\\"  \\"Peace,\\" and \\"Wrong.\\"  Compare them to \\"Enjoy the Silence,\\" \\"Never Let Me Down Again,\\" and \\"Little 15\\" and you<br />know where I'm coming from--they all sound like b-sides in comparison.<br /><br />The bulk of Delta Machine sounds as if Depeche is struggling and foundering.  The sounds themselves are muscular, but the songs are mostly flat.<br />\\"Heaven\\" isn't bad, \\"Broken\\" and \\"Child Inside\\" are okay.  Perhaps the most interesting work is found on the bonus disc, with \\"Long Time Lie\\" and<br />\\"All That's Mine\\" being two truly enjoyable tracks.  So, of the 17 tracks on the two discs, I only listen to five.<br /><br />I have listened to the album multiple times.  I really want to like it, but I think Depeche have lost their touch.

B0000E6XH3|5.0|I recommend this film to any music lover. People who may not have liked the album fall in love with it once they see this story.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|This book reminded me of Desperate Housewives a little. Women fighting over their deceased friends husband shortly after her death, also things going on in their neighbors lives and homes. I love a story with a hit man and wonderful locales. I think the storyline was good, but the characters were great, you could almost see what they were thinking.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I could not keep my interest in thr movie. The plot seemed pointless and it was sometimes hard to undetstand what the characters were saying. It was a long and dull movie.

B0094OLFUW|3.0|I loved Coexist the first time I heard it (for free on their website).  I'd never heard The xx before.  It was melancholy and light, for those days where you need atmosphere music.  The main problem is that every song sounds the same.  It feels like one song.  It's a very good song, hence 3 stars, but it's one sad, slow song.  Good for setting atmosphere, but not something you'll ever bump in your car and sing along to.

B00AB6LHJQ|5.0|If I start to rave about this book I will spoil the ending (s).<br />The story unwinds in several directions and levels, the intermittent stories of individual lower case gods, are just enough to make you wonder.<br />The representations of  essence of the older gods as present time entities, is intriguing,  and seeing  how they are woven into the overall fabric of the story is nothing less than artwork.<br />I really can't say enough about the book without giving away, things you need to find out for your self.<br />I would suggest you read the teaser (esp if you are a Kindle reader)<br /> I am looking for an affordable hard cover version, it's a keeper

B00000AF95|4.0|This is Kiss' 1984 studio album.  I want to offer my opinions & my review of each song as follows:  1.  &#34;I've Had Enough (Out Of The Cold & Into The Fire)&#34;...This song is a powerful introduction to this 1984 album.  I like this song quite well.  2.  &#34;Heaven's On Fire&#34;...I can remember when this song was a hit.  I love the beat, music & the words very much. This is one of my TOP favorites on this album, that TIES w/ &#34;Thrills In The Night&#34;.  3.  &#34;Burn Bitch Burn&#34;...This is this album's LONGEST song & it had to grow on me, because I wasn't too crazy about these words @ first.  However, I do like the FASTER  beat & I think that this music is EXCELLENT.  4.  &#34;Get All You Can Take&#34;...This isn't too bad.... I do like it.  5.  &#34;Lonely Is The Hunter&#34;...This song ISN'T too good @ all.  Definitely, NOT a favorite song from this album.  6.  &#34;Under The Gun&#34;...This song has a real FAST pace to it, but it's also pretty good.  7.  &#34;Thrills In The Night&#34;...I love this song & it's also one of my TOP favorites, that TIES w/ &#34;Heaven's On Fire&#34;.  I also remember how this song was a hit.  8.  &#34;While The City Sleeps&#34;...This song is ALSO one of the album's BETTER cuts.  I love this song ALMOST as much as &#34;Heavens On Fire&#34; & &#34;Thrills In The Night&#34;.  It has a rather MYSTERIOUS feel to it, which I always enjoy.  I could actually imagine THIS song being recorded on 1982's &#34;Creatures Of The Night&#34; album, because of the similar NIGHT meaning..  9.  &#34;Murder In High Heels&#34;...This song is okay.  I bought this CD (used) from a record shop, in the Summer of 2010 & it may be time for me to order another (new) CD from Amazon.com.  The CD has had it's better day & the jewel case is badly cracked.  This album is recommended.  P.S.  The Certain CHANGES Were Made, On THIS Review,  On Friday, February 19, 2016.
0062014536|3.0|I understand that not every novel will have a complete happy ending. Just like life, there is no happily ever after. But I would like a bit more summation. I wanted an actual ending. The story, the characters, the love triangle. None of these were very well developed. It was disappointing at best.
0062014536|3.0|No!!! Please, no! That it so not the end of this series!<br /><br />Golly, come to think of it, I've more or less started all my reviews from Lauren Oliver's Delirium series with a \\"no\\" (see Delirium and Pandemonium reviews). I'm starting to think whether this is because I have an arguable explanation for saying so or it's just my refusal to accept what's at hand every time the books reach their endings... yeah, both.<br /><br />[Be warned, this will contain spoilers from the first two books...and a bit from book three too. Okay maybe a lot. Sorry. I have to vent out some things.]<br /><br />Let's do a little recap... (I'll make it quick, don't worry)<br /><br />We follow Lena's story first through Delirium, where she is set on getting the cure for deliria, but then she meets a boy named Alex who shows her what love feels like. Falling in love with Alex made Lena decide not to take the cure anymore and instead run away with Alex into the Wilds, which first she thought was dangerous. In their attempt to flee Portland, Alex ends up being shot and left behind while Lena escapes into the Wilds.<br /><br />This then follows on to Pandemonium where Lena is now living in the Wilds along with other un-cureds/Invalids. She thinks that Alex is dead. On the effort of trying to move on with her life, she takes on a mission for the movement against the DFA. Through her mission, she meets Julian, the role model of young individuals of the society, typically telling all the people that being cured is the right - and only - choice. So Lena, although grieving over Alex's supposed death, manages to fall in love with Julian, which then leads to them running off to the Wilds together, that is after Lena rescues Julian and all that. I know... vague details. You'll all get it once you read both books (if you haven't yet that is). So anyway, although Lena is now happy having Julian with her, surprise, surprise - Alex is alive and has found his way back to her... and so here is where Requiem takes the lead...<br /><br />Those who oppose the \\"Deliria-Free America\\" law of the domineering government continue on with their goal - to give people the freedom to act without the need of the cure. Lena, Julian and Alex are all part of this group, which isn't exactly comfortable for any of them. Lena is determined to stand by her decision but Alex's presence makes things complicated.<br /><br />Compared to the first two books, Requiem has a faster pace. Although most of it involved Lena travelling with her companions to seek other rebels and finally fight against the DFA, and watching Hana prepare for her upcoming wedding to Fred, whom I'd like calling the \\"ultimate villain\\" of this story.<br /><br />In Pandemonium, we got alternating views of the \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" of Lena's life in the Wilds, here in Requiem, we get alternating points-of-view of Lena and - wait for it... Hana! Yeah. If you've read the ebook entitled Hana, her side of story showed that she betrayed Lena which led to the misfortune that happened in Delirium. So imagine reading from her now that she's cured... but guilt seems to be eating her up inside. I was so excited to see how she and Lena would eventually come face to face here.<br /><br />Majority of the book revolved around the love story between Lena, Julian and Alex. To be honest, this love triangle was rather stressful.  You see, I find Lena a bit annoying here for the whole \\"torn between two lovers\\" bit. But I admire her for trying to stand firm on what she has chosen.<br /><br />I was heartbroken to see my dear, dear Alex come back as someone I don't know anymore. *sob* The Crypts sure have done a hell of a job on him. I'm still no fan of Julian even though he's done nothing but his best to fit into Lena's world. I do love the brawling scene between these two. Probably one the most entertaining parts of this book. LOL. Sorry. *sheepish grin*<br /><br />Still, I really feel that this is just too exhausting. It feels like one of those Tucker-Christian (from Cynthia Hand's Unearthly series) slash Adam-Warner (from Tahereh Mafi's Shatter Me series) moments. Seriously, are these authors talking and plotting against their readers? *glares*<br /><br />Now let's get to the part where my \\"no\\", at the beginning of this review, fits in. I hate the ending. Let me explain... Have you watched the movie, Inception? You know the part at the ending where Leonardo DiCaprio spinned his totem on a table to see if that part was a dream or not (if it's not a dream the totem stops, if it is then the totem keeps spinning), so when he walks away it just keeps spinning until it agonizingly slows down (and just barely even) then - boom! Screen goes blank then the credits roll. And you sit there stunned thinking: \\"did it stop spinning or not?\\" and no one gives you the answers... that's how Requiem's ending was. Damn it!<br /><br />I refuse to believe that \\"bringing down the walls\\" scene was the only goal of this Resistance. There has got to be more than that. And the whole Lena-Julian-Alex mess? No way did that get settled as simple as that! And frankly I don't think Lena should get off the hook that easily.<br /><br />So I have to ask... there is going to be a spin off or something right? Because that CANNOT be the ending. It's not fair!ucker-Christian (from Cynthia Hand's Unearthly series) slash Adam-Warner (from Tahereh Mafi's Shatter Me series) moments.

B0091REZMW|4.0|good game<br />I only wish I could enlarge the screen at times as with old age it gets tough to see such small images
B0091REZMW|4.0|I thought this would be just another one of those simple puzzle and missing piece finding game but I was very pleased to start playing and find out this game is complicated and quite challenging.  nothing like I've played before. only thing is more directions or instruction is needed.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|We saw Alabama Shakes first on Austin City Limits and then on Saturday Night Live. I like that the lead female singer not only has a unique vocal style, she plays a mean guitar too. She puts it all out there and her passion for her music shines through. I also like that the band has been playing gigs for a while and sound like they want to play together. Good music to listen too on the road and at home.
0061673730|4.0|This is one of those \\"share experience\\" books for us baby boomers, but I wish it would make a comeback with Gen Y.  No, it's not life changing, but there are a few passages that just make one slow down (from all the instant media) and think about the here and now.  Get a used copy and pass it along to a youngster!

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|What a good movie.  Now I can't wait for the next one.  This was a fun adventure and was definitely true to the book, which i always appreciate and visually it was a gift.
B009IF7V2S|5.0|I am a huge Will Ferrell fan.  This movie never fails to make me laugh.  It's been years since I've seen it so I decided to watch it again and I laughed so hard just like it was the first time watching it.  I recommend this movie to all Will Ferrell fans.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I loved the musical and it left me with a fun and happy feeling.  I think that was what it's supposed to do.  It made me wish I could sing and dance like all of them.  Since I'm not talented, I'll just watch the movie amd feel all the fun.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it was a page turner. I did speed read some of the more descriptive paragraphs (it's a long book) but the story was great and I was always waiting to see what would happen next. You are constantly expecting to see a major change for the main character ....<br /><br />The ending had me slightly miffed at first, but 10 seconds later it all came together.<br /><br />I can't think of anything more to tell you about this book without giving it all away. My regular fare is murder mysteries (Patterson, Baldacci, Lee Child, CJ Lyons) and this book is simply a great mystery without the murder.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Ever since I first got this game, I played it everyday. I love the variety of the dragons, and the compositions.  Hopefully they'll add more, and I'll spend a little less gems!!

B005CRQ4OW|2.0|Perfection that is all I can say amazing book to me and my hole class has been reading the books diary of a wimpy kid.
B00B2TUKI0|1.0|We were very disappointed with this album.  In the past we enjoyed Madeleine's beautiful voice.  This album, as seems to have become the music industries, the music overwhelms her marvelous voice.  I would enjoy hearing Ms. Peyroux's voice without any orchestration whatsoever.
B005KELW26|5.0|I love this item.  I would be worried about my Kindle without this case.  I love the color and the material with which it is made.  It protects my Kindle's screen and is so nice to hold on to when packing for a trip or just visiting a friend.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|It's a really good show with great character development. The acting is really well done as well. Worth giving it a shot.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I didn't quite like a writing style of this novel. Author seems to use these short clipped sentences all the time and the humor is sometimes way too similar to \\"computer nerd\\" stereotype.<br /><br />Why give this book 5 stars then? Because it is still an excellent deal for 99 cents! Despite mentioned drawbacks this book is entertaining, has original plot and I truly enjoyed all scientific and technical details. I am not a scientist but it seemed an author really knew what he was talking about as far as technical details go.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|A really good movie for when you want to watch some action. I don't know that I like it as much as the previous two though.
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|With \\"House of Gold and Bones I & 2\\" Stone Sour has crafted the best set of modern rock songs I've ever heard. The songs are unabashedly melodic, unashamedly heavy (when needed), and breathtakingly epic in scope. I understand that this review won't be perceived as objective.... I am a fan, and I'm more than happy to say that... but I would encourage any skeptic to give this album a good listen.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I will always love books before movies, but just as it is with LoTR - this movie does the book justice.
B003M6FGTE|1.0|To much sexual content especially for the targeted age group.  Would not recommend this to anyone who has an ounce of any moral standards.
B008393Q2O|4.0|This Is A Good Way To Write Notes . Especially for Class . It's A Good Tool to have. I Would Recommend it .
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is visually appealing and fun to play it's also cool how I interactive it is two thumbs up
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is great because it can keep me busy all day and on it you can build what ever you want to build.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|While the movie itself was good, midway through the stream, the picture quality dropped off significantly. It was like watching an old VHS tape. Not happy with that at all.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like it but number two it better you should get temple run 2 but I still like it and I believe that you should get 1and 2
B00005K3LW|5.0|I love this movie and I didn't have to wait long for it.<br /><br />I bought this gift for someone who loves it just as much as I do.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie becasue it is one of the best that Bruce Willis has done.
160309007X|4.0|It starts out a little slow, but the plot twists and ending make it well worth the read.  Especially, the ending.  Very funny and messed up.
B001HN6918|5.0|Great sequel to the 1st one.  MOre action and drama.  LOts of color and visual effects.  Hope to see more .

0670026557|5.0|Revolutionary in its implications, this book has the capacity to profoundly and positively transform the way we interact in business and our personal lives. It may become one of the most influential business books in this age, and powerful in its ripple effects. This book demonstrates, in clear and simple language, that one style of interaction creates lasting success not only for yourself, but expands success to include others.<br /><br />If you have heard the expression \\"nice guys finish last\\", it turns out they do. However, that's not the whole story, and the rest of the story is riveting. Author-researcher-professor Adam Grant has spent ten years researching who does finish first and why. In this revolutionary book - which I can't praise highly enough - Grant explains that folks are divided into givers, takers and matchers.<br /><br /> \\"But evidence shows that at work, the vast majority of people develop a primary reciprocity style, which captures how they approach most of the people most of the time,\\" says Grant. \\"And this primary style can play as much of a role in our success as hard work, talent and luck.\\"  Grant finds that we have a preferred style in which we either prefer to 'give' without concern about \\"what's in it for me\\", or we 'take' and put our own interests first, or we 'match' in a quid pro quo fashion, trying to equalize giving and taking.<br /><br />So, if givers are the LEAST successful in business, according to Grant, then who is the MOST successful?  Turns out it's the givers again! Grant says there's a caveat on giving: you have to be intelligent and strategic about it, so you don't get taken advantage of by takers. Grant describes why giving is even more successful in this age of increased transparency, technology, teams, acceleration, social media and an 80% service economy.<br /><br />\\"According to conventional wisdom, highly successful people have three things in common: motivation, ability and opportunity.\\"  But there's a fourth ingredient, suggests Grant, \\"...one that's critical but often neglected:  success depends heavily on how we approach our interactions with other people.  Every time we interact with another person at work, we have a choice to make: do we try to claim as much value as we can, or contribute value without worrying about what we receive in return?\\"<br /><br />Grant describes how he first became fascinated by this dynamic through personal experiences as a diving champ and in business. \\"...I decided to spend the rest of my career teaching other givers what I had discovered about overcoming the doormat effect.  In this book, I want to persuade you that we underestimate the success of givers.... Although we often stereotype givers as chumps and doormats, they turn out to be surprisingly successful.  To figure out why givers dominate the top of the success ladder, we'll examine startling studies and stories that illuminate how giving can be more powerful - and less dangerous - than most people believe.\\" He also includes hard statistics - in a study of opticians, the givers brought in 30% more revenue than matchers, and 68% more than takers.<br /><br />Examining what strategies separate the champs from the chumps, Grant offers ideas so you don't function as a doormat for the takers to exploit or experience giver burnout. His third aim, he says, is to show that when givers succeed, something distinctive occurs: the giving spreads and cascades.  \\"Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them.  You'll see that the difference lies in how giver success creates value, instead of just claiming it.\\"<br /><br />He describes how successful givers have unique approaches in four key domains: networking, collaborating, evaluating and influencing.  Giving influenced the success of Twitter, Craig's List, the band Green Day, and Adam Rifkin, the individual with the largest network on LinkedIn (who has a review here you should read.)  One giver ina group can increase everyone's giving. You may be fascinated with the potential of \\"reciprocity rings,\\" which Adam uses in his classes at Wharton, in which each student makes a request to the class, and the class tries to use their knowledge, resources and connections to fulfill the request.<br /><br />This isn't just theory, or feel good stories, that you read and forget.  Grant includes \\"actions for impact\\" at the end of the book for you to act upon. However, he cautions, if you give with the thought primarily of getting, you won't be successful. \\"... if you do it only to succeed, it probably won't work.\\"<br /><br />\\"By shifting ever so slightly in the giver direction, we might find our waking hours marked by greater success, richer meaning and more lasting impact,\\" Grant suggests.  This book should have a lasting impact in business and create a cascade in giving which will make our environments at work, and outside of work, a joy to be in.  It is the best book I've read in ages because of its transformative implications regarding expanding success and authentic joy. It should become a classic.a group can increase everyone's giving.

B008OURHPY|5.0|Man I was blown away by her voice and her lyrics. She reminds me of Lauryn Hill a little. You definitely won't regret buying her album. Pure talent!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Engaging and interesting well written book - characters easy to identify with. Although it stays generally within familiar tropes the story is worth reading because it is so well told.
1451668945|2.0|I think the author is feeling her age. I have read every one of her books, and this one was the only disappointment. Way too many characters, very disjointed story, and totally unbelievable coincidences. She has always written in a very simple minded manor, but usually the plot was enough to overcome it. Not this time. At least wait til the price drops. Better yet, don't bother to read it at all.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is the same thing as the first but with more roads and objectives that make too actually try in order to level up and play it is free so try it out!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I first started reading this series it was a bit depressing, but you get caught up in the characters and you're hooked.  The only criticism I would have is that it takes place in the future and there are certain aspects of life that would have progressed beyond say helicopters or conventional guns - and there were no airplanes only fancy trains.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Really loved this movie and love Denzel.  I don't order a lot of movies to keep in my library but this one was good enough for it.

B0058YPL66|5.0|I had to order this one for the library.  Has to be one of the best series made in a long time.  The 2nd season isn't quite as good as the first so far but it's not over so we'll have to wait and see if it's worthy for the library.

B00005JKLZ|4.0|I really enjoy futuristic movies and this one didn't disappoint.  I liked the original and this one followed most of Orsen Wells storyline so it was a good one for the library.
B00ALYY6ZA|2.0|It seems like this was put together to get to market quickly. The concept is easy to understand and I am giving it a go. The focus of the book was on what to do with your fasting days, and very little about what you need to do on your non fasting days. The reader is lead to believe anything goes. While I may be wrong, I would think that for those of us whose main goal is weight loss, that concern free calorie consumption could significantly impact the results. I think there could be a whole section dedicated to optimizing the non fasting days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a 10/5 book. I couldn't put this book down for one minute. I was also very shocked when Katniss and Peeta had to go back in the games.

B005HJAOLY|5.0|This was vintage King at his best. I have been a fan for a long time and have seen his best and not so best. His writing style has changed over the years and he hasn't written anything like this for ages. It builds like his stuff of old. You start out with everday people with everyday outlooks and go to a most unusual places and situations. Somehow KIng makes it all seem quite possible and has a way of putting you in the story and this was no exception. Loved it.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|How can one believe the story of a survivor? Hundreds of days, longer, alone at sea. This story is told in a fantastical way, giving in to the sense of awe and courage needed to survive.<br /><br />If there is one person for whom this story is written, it is for you. Each day you survive. How?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this down! I have heard so much about \\"fifty shades\\" and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read. I felt as tho  I was Ana myself.

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Complex characters, great writing, and acting make the shield one of the best Cop Dramas made. It keeps getting better!
B0083V2W6I|4.0|A bit disappointed with Criterion's release as the features were not as expansive as they could have been as I've seen many other featurettes on the film they could have included.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Worked great on my Kindle Fire HD. Engaging story, good length, good puzzles and HO ... just an all-around excellent quality game. Thank you!!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I wanted to try this game based on the number of people that had already downloaded it. The kids and I enjoyed the game in its original format however. once I downloaded the Sydney update the game sucked. It continued to ask for $ over and over at the end of each run. I tried to delete the Sydney update and get back to the original version. No dice. The game after the update sucks. I ended up having to delete. it and move on. If you have the game and like it, unless you like wasting $,  take my advice... don't update the game...ever.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Good quality on my Kindle Fire HD. No performance issues at all. Some repetition in the games but overall challenging and fun! I was looking for something that had games but didn't have any HO and this was definitely a good pick!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I realize that advertising is what supports these games but, give me a break! I finally get to the point where I wouldn't play their lame game if they had a $10 bill attatched to it. Way over the top with asking me to play another game. If I was interested in playing some other game, I would have downloaded it in the first place d.a..
B006H5120E|5.0|This was a great movie in the original format. In 3D it is even more breath taking. It is worth the investment.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I couldnt watch this. I ended up downloading the HD version. It was MUCH better. I NEED A REFUND ASAP!!!
B0000C9ZBW|4.0|The [[ASIN:B0000C9ZBW Skagen Men's 233LTMB Black Titanium Mesh Bracelet Watch]] is a very slim and good looking watch. If you're looking for a big, rugged-looking watch then this is not what you want. The watch is a lot smaller than I expected it to be, despite all the pictures and videos that I've seen on it.<br /><br />If you're looking for something light, slim and just minimal then this watch is perfect. I've had it for a year and a half now and it still looks and works like new. Note that you MAY get a watch that does not look the same as the picture. Mine has the word Titanium on the very bottom instead of in the middle like the picture shows.<br /><br />Watch description:<br />- No second-hand, only minute and hour.<br />- No date or any other modes.<br />- No back light, although it does have a lume...but that doesn't last very long.<br />- No numbers, just dashes to represent where the numbers are.<br />- Stainless steel, adjustable mesh band. May I add that it looks and feels very nice.<br /><br />The clasp is very easy to open and close; once it's on, it stays on. I have never once had the clasp open up on its own. I have no clue as to why some reviewers think that it's difficult to work with. I can literally put the watch on without looking at it. The entire process actually takes me about 6 seconds and I've never used a watch with a similar clasp mechanism before.<br /><br />The band IS adjustable, however I was unfamiliar with how to adjust it so I looked up a youtube video to make sure I wasn't going to break anything. It's a simple process that should take no more than 30 seconds to do once you know it.<br /><br />I gave this watch 4 stars because it really is a bit small...if it was only a bit bigger it would've been perfect for me. Then again, this is based solely on my opinion.<br /><br />NOTE: This watch is water RESISTANT, meaning that if you accidentally spilled drinks on it or if you somehow get caught in the rain, it will be fine. The watch is however not claimed to be water PROOF, which means that you should probably not take showers, jump in the pool or swim in the ocean with it on.
B008ER9QLK|3.0|The singing and music are wonderful.  Debra Voight especially is outstanding.  If you play the ring and don't look at it you will enjoy it but the production leaves lots to be desired in my opinion.  I don't understand why they have to use a score exactly as written by the composer but can murder the production.  I believe Wagner would turn over in his grave if he saw those big panels moving up and down.  The old version of the Mets ring is far superior in production.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Even my husband watched this movie and I with him again. I've watched it over and over with my nephews (who love it) and enjoy it each time.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I didn't watch the first season of Game of Thrones when my friends did. I watched it as they were RE-WATCHING it before season 2 started. After 2 episodes I was hooked and have been ever since. It is very well written, acted, and seriously just addictive. You have heroes, anti-heroes, enemies, and even worse than enemies, Joffrey! I'm not sure what the budget is for each episode but it is all on the screen. Beautiful show. I admit sometimes the nudity is gratuitous perhaps but it is also suits the shows raw look at a fantasy pseudo-dark ages. The violence, sex and language are unfiltered for the most part and it gives it this perfect rough edge that make the show that much much better. The dialogue and acting is very well done with few weak points. There are lulls and some story arcs that maybe aren't as good as the others, I won't lie, but it is never like I am looking at the clock for something to be over. Highly recommend.<br /><br />ALSO, for what it is worth, I also downloaded the Kindle 4 book pack and just finished the first book. The series stays remarkably close to the book in Season 1.<br /><br />I passed on it early but I was very mistaken. Don't make the same mistake and get to it!
1603429999|5.0|I find knitting in the round very difficult. This book offers the detail and instruction I need to learn and practice this knitting technique.
B00004TS0E|5.0|The best Christmas movie ever. Richard Attenborough is the best Santa Clause in all the Christmas movies that I have watched. He is so original and so life looking. What a great family movie.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|The film is well done by all concerned. Since much of the action was &#34;Classified&#34; some of it may have been created by the screen writer and director, but that didn't affect the quality of the entire product. Well done.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|So I thought I would read the book and, as usual, the book was so much better than the movie.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have seen both versions of this movie, and guess I can enjoy either regular or BlueRay. Why was it necessary for the world to create something that seem to these old eyes superfluous?
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I wonder how he keeps writing such good stories and I keep waiting for the &#34;next one&#34; not to deliver but they always do ... enjoy!!!
0399160450|4.0|It was a pleasure to reunite with characters from the previous Jack Ryan, John Clark books. I do wish that Tom Clancy could see his way clear to dividing his 900 page books into at least 450 page ones. Just a thought, not a criticism.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Very different from most books I read but this was so well-written (translated?) that I couldn't resist the whole series as well as the movie. I am looking into renting the foreign film versions as well as the story lines should make for exciting movies!!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm pretty impressed. This is the third, self-published author I have read. The first two books from the other authors had something or, rather, lacked something and you could tell they were self-published. This book isn't missing anything: go<br />od story, good character development, good pacing.<br /><br />This is better than many \\"professional\\" authors.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more from this author.
0691143692|5.0|Herrin takes a subject so complex and hard to understand that it lends its name to a synonym for \\"complex and hard to understand,\\" and makes it engaging, accessible, and compelling. The Byzantines are perhaps the most underrated empire the world has ever known, and she explains why beautifully.<br /><br />If you want to know about emperors and wars, stick to Wikipedia. If you want to learn about a magnificent culture, this is THE definitive book on the subject.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I think this is a fun game and you should get it. If you can get your friend to play with you, you can invade them. O and join the destroyers guild.
B004NOH9LW|3.0|I was disappointed with the movie. Matt Damon is a great actor, but the movie was too slowly paced and didn't really keep me interested in what was happening. When Matt's character used his  psychic powers, the movie had it's best moments. But there just wasn't enough of that shown in the movie.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Breathtakingly beautiful and true to the journey of the novel. A Highly recommended and entertaining movie. A must see experience.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a LONG time. It tells a great sory without all of the sex and violence seen in so many movies today. I LOVE it.

1455527475|3.0|It does shed some light on the culture at Goldman. Whether it is just sour grapes of really true is up to the reader to decide.<br />One thing to note is that the author has completely faded away since his fifteen minutes of fame ended.
B0083YD6Y2|5.0|This movie is very different and that's why I like it.  I think the hand held camera movie theme is interesting.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Catchy, deep songs.  Authentic lyricism.  I can listen to this album over and over again.  You are in for a real treat.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|This book was so lovely written that it could have been music or poetry instead of a novel. It flowed so beautiful that I could not stand for it to end. I can not give it enough praise.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Ok so it is a little boring at the end but the finally is amazing so over all this book is a four
1400034205|5.0|Remember that 1950s song \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\"?  \\"The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot....\\"<br />  Maugham's five star novel doesn't really have much of a plot either, but on the contrary, it's a great book.  It must be up there with a few others as the greatest of 20th century British literature.  If you happen to know \\"Moon and Sixpence\\", I think you'll find that this one is much better.  Maugham himself is the narrator, writing the long tale of two men in the first third of the century.  One is a rich American who adores the European aristocracy and has deftly inserted himself in their (meaningless) social whirl.  He has become an unbearable snob concerned only with `proper' style and behavior, meeting only `the right' people.  Though kind to his friends and relatives, the reader will probably dislike him intensely so strong a portrait is it.  The second main character is a rather elusive, mysterious American, a young veteran of World War I air battles, who comes back to Chicago but can't fit into the gung-ho business scene of the day.  He eventually heads back to Europe where he studies, works at odd jobs, and winds up spending years in India seeking enlightenment before his return to America.  His life and loves, appearances and disappearances, and spiritual growth are the main subject of the book.  There is no plot as such, just a rich tapestry of several people's lives intertwined that that of Maugham, the narrator.  Psychologically deep, full of philosophy and views of life, great description of the period in Chicago, London, Paris (the lower depths especially) and the Riviera, and a style that keeps your interest up to the end.  What a great novel !!
B000000Y2R|1.0|BUD POWELL DANCES ALL OVER THE KEYBOARD IN THE SECOND DISC, IT'S JUST AS ESSENTIAL AS THE FIRST DISC. WHERE'S THE SECOND DISC?

B008OHV5W8|5.0|This has become one of my favorites for my yoga classes. I now have three of the Putumayo records. Really great.
B004UPAIDK|5.0|I recently watched the new evil dead remake and while it was ok it was no where near as good as the original. This is one series that just got better with each installment. This was a follow up to the first but not a sequel while the third was a sequel to the second. Follow me yet?  Just check it out for yourself. Is is horror movie, a comedy or a send up of both? Decide for yourself.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|I like this movie as I really like the dark scenes and camera work. The story is good and this compares to Bram Stoker's Dracula with the type of movie and directing. I highly recommend this movie if you like these type of movies.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|This review didn't show up the first time.  I feel strongly enough about this that I am submitting it again.  This game is a waste of time because it doesn't work. Oh sure, it downloads, but after that, nothing works well. Or, doesn't work at all.  If you think you can run and jump like in Mario Bros., forget it.  It pauses in the middle of a jump...then drops you on top of the thing you were jumping over.  You can't jump and go forward at the same time either. Even my 9 yr old granddaughter said she won't play it. I would have paid for this game just to see if it would work if I paid for it, but there isn't an option to do that.  Also, while I expect ads with free games, it shouldn't be accompanied by a game that doesn't work.  I'm deleting it.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|the all sounds great but it wont download onto my kindle!!!! I tried so many times to download it but it wont. I'm really not happy with the service.  &gt;:/
B00B9366VO|5.0|This movie made me remember all the good music we are missing now. Thank you Dave for continuing to make great rock music.
B0000669JL|5.0|Was recently down to the Virgin Islands and began to experience Reggae Style music.  Watch Bob Marley documentary and decided to get one of his album's.  The delivery and album were great!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I'm often sitting idle waiting on my son to complete a sports practice or event and this is the perfect game to distract me from my boredom.  I keep going and going and before I know it the time has passed and its time to go.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|The quality of the product and amount of extra features are excellent, however, the packaging is rather cheap and insubstantial.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun kid game although I'm an adult and I'm addicted to it. My husband may be wise than me though. The graphics are amazing as well.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I think feedly is actually better than Google reader. I like the app for my Kindle and flipping through blogs is so enjoyable.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|This is a great movie for teens and older people alike especially if you like mythology. Would recommend this as a fun movie for a teen get together.
0385349947|5.0|Lovely, lightweight reading, inspirational!!! Sheryl is sharing with us her unique career advices (sized on women, but really useul also for men) that brought her to be one of the most influential women on earth! I love this book.
B00969PR18|4.0|So far this app has been great. However, it can't find me using Kindle 's GPS. Not a huge prob right now while I'm sitting in my recliner. Just don't know how it's gonna work elsewhere. Kind of a bummer having to type in everything.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I enjoyed this novel very much. I liked the characterisations and the theme. As someone who is not like others, it was nice to see diversity of personalities treated with humour and empathy.
1426308469|5.0|National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Dinosaurs was just the thing for my 7yr old nephew...he lit up like a christmas tree when he found out he could read it!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoy the character of Jack Reacher. His unusual lifestyle, but strength of character make him an inviting bedtime read.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD very much the quality and sound were terrific.I'm very interested to see the next in this series
B000PXUA5W|5.0|Great for the kids.  They love it.  Easy to change band and wear.  Good time keeping and water resistant.  Great watches.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am having so much fun with my two horses and plan to get more:)I could play this game for hours on end<br /><br />This is like the best game ever and I wish I could play it all day:)
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The Amazon Kindle Micro USB Cable works great for charging the second generation Kindle. I was afraid I had lost everything that was on my Kindle.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I have grand kids and all of them love playing with it. I am very pleased with this item and I will recommend it
030758836X|3.0|I thought this book was ok, but with all of the hype this book was getting, I expected it to be better. It was a little disappointing.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen about American History.  Glad I purchased it for my husband.  He loves it!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Amazing! A friend of mine got me watching it.<br />Especially when I can watch them without the commercials!<br />I love it because it is a great medieval show without unrealistic magic in every other scene,<br />which is most often found in other medieval movies/shows.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|I love this kind of series.  Kept my interest the whole time.  Couldn't stop watching and I WANT MORE!!!!  Wish there were more series like this one.  Happy!!!  :o)
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is totally awesome it blows my mind and awesome well done graphics and cool weapons and easy to play I recomend this game
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I really loved the first two books in the series but felt  this one didn't really end right.  Lack of follow through on the story.  I was truly disappointed that it didn't end with a bigger bang.
B00867GJYK|4.0|This movie has a good story but the way they present it is not the best. From the very beginning has a kind a violence that is difficult to think to show to a little kid.  Is good but I think is for the young people not kids.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have found that facebook is easier to read and reply to on a regular computer.  Nothing I do on facebook is urgent enough to do away from home.
B001UHOWW4|5.0|See a lot of time. She is a wonderful actress. I love all Audrey Hepburn movies, is something different from others and she made that happens.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|Performed at once with delicacy, surgical precision, and spiritual abandon.  Lisitsa is the musician of the millenium: inspiring, energizing, comforting.  She is fearless and as such she lifts the listener to courageous heights of enjoyment.<br />Valentina...ah Valentina!  Mahalo (Hawaiian for thank you)
B00782O7NE|5.0|Even though it has no words ,is very good and funny. I love the dog. Is vey long ,is takes me several days to see it complete. Is nice, because I have to work my own words.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|This is the second in the series and the second that I've read. I must confess: Both are better than I anticipated. I guess something about a fictitious author led me to believe they would be less than quality, but that isn't true. They both have been excellent with well-paced plots. I also confess to being a fan of the television show, and I hear the voices of the actors in my head when I read the dialogue. I don't think that being a fan of the TV show is necessary, though, to enjoy the books. The books do, however, have the same witty dialogue that makes the show so fun to watch. The books are a little grittier than the television show in my opinion. I look forward to reading the next installment.
B0059XTUEK|3.0|I don,t know what I was expecting about this movie but is not the one that I want to see several times. I see just  one time  is good but not one that I want to keep. Is silly.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This album shows how awesome Lindsey Stirling is. There are few who can play the violin with such raw emotion and keep it going throughout the entire song. And she does this twelve times! This music is so uplifting and full of energy, it can bring anyone to a great and uplifting mood. This is by far the best album I have and will be looking forward to her next album with great anticipation.
B002RSDW8A|5.0|Both scene are very nice. Is very simple movie that when is over you said , very refreshing , nice and good. I love the job did by both women .
B008HK3XU4|2.0|upside down design for fire hd or it needs an opening for the charger so the cover can be shut while charging<br />BUT that is the only flaw in it but it is a big inconvenience
B005JZBP8W|5.0|I love this movie, I use to see every time.  I love the songs they sang all over the movie. The work doing is e spectacular. Is like you are in  Broadway , but in your home.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This came brand new as listed and the movie itself is just a classic. I am very happy with this order.
B00133KHCY|5.0|I love every character in this movie. Is refreshing ,simple, and the music in it is  very good. Is a lovely movie.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|What a strange movie, but I really enjoyed it. I've watched it several times. It takes a minute to figure out exactly what's going on, but it was worth it in the end. Well done, Vincent Gallo!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Love this show, love the quality of video playback through Amazon. Perfect for the Breaking Bad addict, would highly recommend!
B0030B621W|5.0|This is a true sci-fi movie.  Not in the sense of \\"hard\\" sci-fi, but instead the fictional technology and the future isn't just an environment for horror or action, instead is intrinsic to the story.  Also, despite having one actor, this film is NOT slow.<br />It is quiet, but moves at a steady pace and never gets boring.  Heck... I may watch it again right now!  lol
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I think this guy is the best, he has been around a long time.  He is honest about everything he does in this business.  He is funny and just the best to me.  I will read his other books.
B00B2166BS|4.0|I have no complaints other than the cable is too short. For the price, they should have at least made the cable a bit longer
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I bought this game on sale to pass time at an appointment. I can't stop playing it now. I am about 12 levels into the game and am looking forward to playing more.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Though at times Patnwould make me very angry. It was a good book and I would definitely recommend it.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|Both Mel Gilson and Sam Elliott are out standing in this movie!!!!!!!!! I have to give it 2 Thumbs up
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I used this cover for a long time.<br /><br />It flips into the propped up stance VERY quickly and it stays there pretty well.  It will fall if knocked hard enough, but I never really had any issues with that.<br /><br />It holds the Kindle very securely.<br /><br />I really like this cover.  My only wish was for it to be leather, however that wouldn't affect the function of the cover - just the aesthetics.
0425252868|5.0|YEP GREAT. CAME WHEN THEY SAID IT WOULD. LOVE IT. YEAH BABY. OHH YEAH!!! LOVE IT!!! SO GOOD. A PLUS
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|If you enjoyed Big Fish, Life of Pi is another great movie about a legendary story with amazingly colorful scenes and visualizations
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game to play for when you are bored. very good detail and a graleat game to get for kids.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is pretty fun. NOW DON'T BUG ME ABOUT WRITING A STINKIN REVIEW ANYMORE. GOT IT? IF ANOTHER REVIEW IS EVER ASKED TO BE WRITTEN ILL CRY.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Unfortunately I still suck at it, but just love playing it. Hopefully, I will improve which will only make me love it that much more!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|If you like Downton Abbey, you'll love this.  It has a similar flavor and is well written.  You really get into the characters and keep reading to see how it all turns out.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|But now I play on my Kindle Fire. Have always loved the game. And needless to say,  I Love my Kindle Fire!
0385394233|5.0|A great audio book - I'm already listening to it for a second time and have purchased it for other women in my life.  Inspiring!  Sheryl addresses so many women's issues, adds great perspectives to many topics that get swept under the rug...even in today's world.  ANY woman will benefit from this book!!!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I will admit that I first got this because it had Tom Hiddleston in it and I thought that it would be an okay movie. But as I watched it I found myself falling in love with it. The acting, the writing, everything about this movie is done amazingly in my eyes.
B0057MFQMI|3.0|i bought other B-GRIP items which are expensive but worth, this travel kit is not worth its price, Vertical strap mount is ok. Security tether is not necessary and it is commutable, raincoat is poor quality.  $10 will be sweet, $20 is not good
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much u should really get it if u don't  I will literally scream at the top of .lungs so get it please
B000ICXQXI|4.0|What can you say about one of hollywoods most recognizable and classic horror films. Arguably Hitckcocks best work. It seems a bit dated and rather innocent by today's horror standards, but was a truly groundbreaking movie at its time. Anthony Perkins performance as Norman Bates is still brilliant
1616550414|5.0|This is truly the bible to own if you are a huge Zelda fan. It has artwork, characters, the story and so much more. It is a beautifully presented as well. Top notch. Definitely recommend.
B000005RUV|4.0|Aside from missing a couple great cuts, this is a very good representation of the group's music before George broke off & had a monster career of his own!
B00005UWP1|5.0|More and more people are becoming less homophobic and more accepting. That being said, maybe this movie can finally get the recognition it deserves. This is one of my favorite musicals of all time. It's got good jams, a good story and was played out I think rather well. I highly recommend this movie if you like musicals and want to dive into something not usually explored.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I was glad that I didn't see this at the theater because I totally needed the closed caption help through most of this movie. I did enjoy it though.
B003B02OQ4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Client, it is a real page-turner.  This is actually my first John Grisham book, and I now know why he is such a celebrated author.  It has all the elements of a good story:  action, suspense, mystery, humor, and endearing characters.
B0040I09RM|5.0|The First season definitely draws you in. Once I started, I was hooked & that's not easily done. By far this is my favorite show.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Wonderful movie!  It's one I wanted to keep in my DVD library to watch again and again.  Makes you wonder if the drugs and booze are truly a part of the flight staff and their lives.  Part was well-played by Washington.  I didn't think the totally nude woman walking back and forth in front of the camera was necessary in the beginning.  Leave some things to our imagination please!
B009X010RU|4.0|easy to install, works well, nice color, protects the kindle well. price very reasonable. would like it better if it had a handle on back.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Must see!  It will hook you into wanting to see more of this series.  You wonder at the end where they will take the story line next.  Can't wait to get the 2nd season and continue to follow it.  Story of a returning war vet with some serious issues, considered a hero, but is he really?  Where does his loyalty lie?  Who really understands him and what he's about now?  What's the reality in his relationship to the CIA agent?  I did wonder, though, how a CIA agent could pass her background check with bipolar issues.  That's an interesting twist I don't find believable.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Highly stylized but a joy to watch, in my opinion the best Anderson movie since Rushmore.  Perfectly captured that restless generation of baby boomers in early 60's before the entered the stage of iconoclastic revolution.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|It means so much more to me knowing it is a true story!  It's one of those feel good movies and the acting was excellent and was well cast.
0060776757|5.0|oh my goodness! this is a MUST BUY....i love it love it love it. i purchased the hardcover, its big (huge) heavy but soooo worth it! lots of pictures, perfect true finally real stories! i got a used one, but its soo  worth it, this is a MUST HAVE book if you love u2. wish i would have bought it sooner.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I've never had a customer service rep work on something so quick and know exactly what my problem was. I like that it charges fast and I can plug it into a wall outlet or a USB port. i play my kindle for long periods of time and now i can watch my movies while it is charging.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Love it!!<br /><br />This version of the classic musical is simply phenomenal. The actors were well chosen. Everyone gave 110% to their part. I loved that there was even a new song written for Hugh Jackman.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Everyone enjoys this game! We have fun seeing who can win the most coins every day! From kids to adults I recommend this app. No problems on my Kindle Fire at all.
B00A77II0U|3.0|It was so easy and short that I finished it in hour and a half! Not worth the money at all. It's more like a .99&cent; game! That would of been a fair price. Don't get this game else you never play one before then it would good for you. This is a beginner's game. I was happy with this at all.
B008393Q2O|4.0|Slimmed down version of the many notepad utilities out there.  Easy to use, just enough options to make it flexible.  If you're looking for a note taking app, give this one a try. (I have used Evernote, Penultimate, Notes Plus, Notability, Noteshelf, Journals, TopNotes, aNote, Sticky Notes and a few others; this compares favorably and is a bit easier to use than some of those listed).
0345529057|4.0|Excellent fantasy. The depth of the story is impressive. The TV series is also very good. I recommend it to all fantasy lovers!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I usually don't like things from this era, but this was a good read. It is well written and weaves and binds the lives of the characters.  It kept the story moving and most other historic novels can be a tough read. I did not realize that slavery was so well entrenched this many years prior to the Civil War. I could easily see a sequel to this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All that I really didn't like about this delectable novel is that I didn't get nearly enough answers to the questions I have concerning Mr. Gray. Besides that, however all anyone can really say is hot hot HOT!!! I enjoyed the humor as well, especially in the email subject lines & Christian's signature at end of his emails. This book reminded me of how it feels to have that special chemistry with another person, and how only certain people can create that chemistry-it doesn't happen between every person of the opposite sex you come across. I wanted to savor the book,  and considering I could've finished it in 1 sitting, I think I accomplished it by drawing it out over 3 days. Am buying part 2 now, hopefully I'll get to know some of the 50 shades.
6305922756|4.0|Cute movie.  You just have to remember that its a fictitional band.  Great actors are in this movie.  Worth seeing if you like this type of movie
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It may cheat u but it's a fun game to play on the roads, at home mostly anywhere. The characters on subway surfers awesome but the boards have special powers well most of them do but in conclusion u should totally download this game :)
B000FA675C|5.0|Watched the movie, saw that the book was offered for free, what a good read! Would definately buy the next book in the series!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks did not let me down. Another wonderful book by one of my favorite authors. His gift of romantic novels is appreciated.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|It's worth watching just for the scenery but I really liked the movie as well. I plan on watching again with my grandkids.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Good game. I like a lot of its features. Just started playing I feel like l will be playing for a while.
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|I enjoy all Star Trek Movies. It's fun to sit back and watch them and see how they have improved over the years. I own all of the series...Star Trek, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise. I started from the beginning and watched the series and movies in order as they came out. I think any Star Trek fan should do this at least once as it shows you how it has evolved over the years and how they all come together.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best that I have ever played I will show all my friends<br />so they can enjoy it to
B008N1LL42|4.0|A lot of action going on and special effects. Not the best I've seen but kept me interested to the end so I guess that's what a movie is all about :)
1439153663|3.0|As I read this book, two words kept coming to me over and over again - cliched and naive.  It did not completely capture me and it was predictable.  I found the characters to be not very believable.  There is no way the character Lavinia could possibly be that stupid.  I know she was young but she had lived through some hard times at an early age so she should/would have been a more intelligent character.<br /><br />For a first time author, this was a good attempt.  I am not sure if I would read this author again.
B0063S3FSW|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. Not one I would normally watch but my granddaughter wanted to see it and she really liked it. j
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Ms. Parker writes a fascinating memoir about growing up with her movie star mother, Shirley MacLaine.  Throughout the book is ultimately a story of a girl who tries desperately to get the unconditional love and attention she deserves, but is never able to attain due to her parent's huge egos.  Her story is interesting and how she survived it and became the caring mother and person she is today is a miracle.  I could not put this book down.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|Not only is the movie beautiful, but I was able to get it &#34;pre-viewed.&#34;  The DVD was of a very high quality, shipping was timely and the price was certainly right.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I read about a character murmuring, muttering, whispering or mumbling one more time, I may throw my Kindle out the window. The writing is terrible in this book and is extremely distracting from the poorly executed plot. What most disturbs me, is the fact so many people gave this book rave reviews and there is a movie deal in the works. I am bitterly disappointed in the public, if it were not for their rave reviews, my $9.99 would be in my bank account.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fair in depth application simulating caring for a horse. My young daughter wanted to try this application, so we did. Definitely not something she can play on her own,but an application we can play together.
1451695195|5.0|When I read the three major things that God wants us to understand; 1. He loves us dearly and unconditionally, 2.There is nothing to fear and 3. We can do no wrong, I knew at that moment that Dr. Alexander's NDE was legitimate. When I say that the Gospel is being preached despite the 'church', I mean it in more than one way. The least offensive reason is that there are many people who either have had a bad experience with 'religion' (I use this term in a negative sense) or have had no 'church' experience, or just do not trust anything that the 'church' says. How do we reach these people with the Gospel? Through men such as Dr. Alexander and Paul Young. These men, especially Dr. Alexander, have tremendous 'credibility' with their, peers, scientists and those who do not trust the 'church.' This man's experience and what he was told to bring back to the world does not contradict Jesus Christ's message. Daniel was told to close the book that God was inspiring him to write until the 'end-time.' It would be then that people would understand. The Apostle Paul was taken up into heaven and was told that he could not reveal what he saw. I believe we are in the times and what God hid from us in the past, for whatever reason, He is now revealing. And He is indeed doing it despite 'religion.' The Gospel will go out to all the world for a witness!
B005LAIII0|4.0|Very enjoyable experience.  Visually exciting and an entertaining story.  I would recommend this bluray to everyone who enjoys a visually exciting tale.
B001AT4Y84|3.0|No sure if it's the plot or lack of the original cast, but it was a bit disappointing.  Good for teen boys for a low price.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Excellent story line and graphics. Just enough dialogue to keep it interesting. Liked that the puzzles were all different and challenging.
0547848412|5.0|I bought the book after watching the movie and found the book to be much more engaging than the movie.  In the book, I could follow the story in ways and with more sense than I could with the movie that I found sort of disjointed.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|An exceptional film. MALIK is a master filmmaker. The complicated movie is worth viewing multiple times, just alone for its beauty.  This is Brad Pitt's best performance sine A River Runs through It. Jessica Chastain is remarkable and the three boys are exceptionable.
B005ERYEGU|5.0|I am still reading through it but the author makes some very good and valid points.  I wish I would have gotten this book a few years back when I was putting together a sales team:)<br /><br />The main issue is that it sounds like a big marketing book for Salesforce.com and related services.  Understanding there are other CRMs out there will help put the points in perspective and that they are applicable to other systems as well.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|These women are fantantic.I also have a dvd of their's and it is about as good a show as you could possibly see

0802473156|5.0|Great book for couples. Should be required before getting married or even getting a roommate. It givers you insight into why others respond in the way they do and also brings self-awareness.
B001CQONKY|1.0|DEAD DOLL furthers the precedent BODIES IN MOTION started where the SEASON PREMIERE does not get commentary. It was irrelevant to the producers that this was the first season premiere to come off a cliffhanger with the team circumnavigating the entire state of Nevada in search of Sara, that Grissom was in a frantic search for the woman he loved & the fact that such a bomb was detonated on the remaining team, that we have Grissom ready to murder Natalie Davis, it never got commentary. The shell-shock left from being kidnapped & nearly dying first in the car Davis stole from the Clark County Junkyard & later in the desert, none of it was properly addressed. Be in in A LA CART, GO TO HELL or THE CHICK CHOP FLICK SHOP, Sara's mental burnout was an untouched storyline.<br /><br />It was in Season 8 that the remainder of the Jerry Bruckheimer television universe became fully solvent in the crossover event with WITHOUT A TRACE. WHO & WHAT? on C.S.I. & WHERE & WHY on WITHOUT A TRACE(Season 6) had Grissom joining forces with New York's Jack Malone played by Anthony LaPaglia to work a murder in Las Vegas with criminal antecedents in New York. This was THE November 2007 Sweeps event & no commentary from William Peterson, LaPaglia or the guest stars from both episodes, Nathan Gamble, John Hawkes & Sarah Danielle Madison. Not even a Special Feature & this was a major milestone & they producers did dick on the DVD. Not even a Play Both option so you could watch it seemlessly but I will get to how big a piss-off it is that after 30 DVDs, we still have yet to get a PLAY ALL option.<br /><br />In that crossover, Sara was dealing still with her burnout which reached fever pitch in GOODBYE & GOOD LUCK. Sara has to face down 2 blasts from her past, the West siblings, Hanna & Marlon. Sara also works a case of domestic violence where again her troubled past rears Its head. We know how the producers have done dick on that storyline. Marlon West is in college, Hanna West is none too happywith her brother living his own life. Hanna West has gotten more sociopathic since THE UNUSUAL SUSPECT back in Season 6. She kills her brother's girlfriend & frames him for it because she cannot accept him living without her. Marlon West kills himself in jail, Hanna West has a full-on nervous breakdown & Sara finally resigns. No commentary from JorJa Fox, Juliette Goglia & Douglas Smith to discuss THEIR return appearances. A great sequel episode that resolved the season's first story arc & we get nothing on the DVD.<br /><br />The episodes directly affected by the 2007-8 Writers Strike, BULL & GRISSOM'S DIVINE COMEDY were ignored. The former was the last to air, the ep they finished before they ran out of scripts, the latter was the first ep after they got back to work. The strike got a passing reference from Peterson but really nothing as to how it neutered the season at all. BULL also had BIG names, singer-songwriter Jewel & her husband Ty Murray. Jewel sings THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER, Murray plays a rodeo clown nothing was noted here.<br /><br />Drops returned in DROPS OUT, again Method man neither interviewed nor did he offer commentary & like P0PPIN TAGS(6) & BIG SHOTS(7), Dustin lee Abraham wrote the episode & there was no commentary from him. Jamie Hyneman & Adam Savage, the hosts of MYTHBUSTERS were the surprise Special Guest Stars in THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. This episode was full of so many scientific references, urban legends, Hyneman & Savage working in the lab.<br /><br />The mob career of Lou Gedda got a little attention in the Special Feature regarding William Freidkin's direction of COCKROACHES, but the ensuing storyline of Warrick going after Gedda, the corruption of Under-Sheriff Jeffrey McKeen, Gedda being murdered & Warrick framed for it & the most heartbreaking-WARRICK'S MURDER BY MCKEEN. When Tim Speedle was murdered in Miami by kidnapping jewel thieves-we saw it coming. When Aiden Burn was beaten to death by D.J. Pratt in New York-we saw it coming. Here we have a teammember murdered by somebody he was supposed to trust, who WE were supposed to trust. Warrick, the team & us the viewers were ambushed. We even saw how diabolical McKeen was when he threatened to murder Grissom If Warrick ID'd him. These events played out in the Season 8 finale FOR GEDDA & the Season 9 premiere FOR WARRICK. What happened in COCKROACHES, LYING DOWN WITH DOGS, FOR GEDDA & FOR WARRICK assaulted us all as fans & the DVD covered none of this. We lost Sara & got nothing, we lost Warrick & got nothing.<br /><br />Another sign of common senselessness & mindlessness was how the DVD not even a glance to the writers swap between C.S.I. & 2 & A HALF MEN. 2&HM creators Lee Aronson & Chuck Lorre wanted to write a C.S.I. & Carol Mendolsohn approved as long as some of her writers got to pen a 2 & A HALF MEN. Mendolsohn told Aronson & Lorre that to write for C.S.I., they had to do what all new writers do, witness an actual autopsy. They agreed & got to work penning 2 & A HALF DEATHS for C.S.I. In return, Mendolsohn with C.S.I. staff writers Evan Dunsky, Sarah Goldfinger & Naren Shankar wrote FISH IN A DRAWER for Season 5 of 2 & A HALF MEN. Jon Cryer, Angus Jones & Charlie Sheen filmed cameos for C.S.I. & George Eads guested on the other show. Lorre based the murder victim Annabelle on Roseanne Barr because Lorre was a writer on that series. References to television's past are paid when Grissom & Brass go to LA to further their investigation. which is where the cameos of Cryer, Jones & Sheen were seen. The Special Features on the Season 8 DVD f()<ked up & THIS television event got ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!! You know who did give this television event the notice it warranted? 2 & HALF MEN! 0n their Season 5 DVD, a Special Feature all about the writers swap, a detailed, consistent, vivid insiders look into it, they also included 2 & A HALF DEATHS as a bonus episode. Season 8 of C.S.I. had only 17, they needed all of the episodes they could get & theproducers could piecemeal enough brain cells to put FISH IN A DRAWER on THAT DVD as a THEIR bonus episode.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Watched it at the theatre and thought it was &#34;just ok&#34;.  Watched it again last night and thought it was a bit better.  Thought it should have been ONE movie rather than two.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it in the theater. Great romantic comedy. Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline are great together.
B002P79KAC|5.0|What can you say? It's a Great Series! I bought them all! Love the story and characters! The actors have great chemistry!!!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It has so many unexpected twist and turns. Definitely keeps you on your toes. I found myself never wanting to set this book down, to interested in what was going to happen next.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|The good: It was a lot darker in comparison to the first Dredd movie with Stallone.  If you like action there was a lot of it. Constant explosions and graphic violence. The special effects were great and much better than the first movie.<br /><br />The bad: The story line, plot, and script was lame. The majority of the movie takes place in one location which was a city sized apartment building. Also, unlike the first movie this one had very little in the way of comic relief that the first movie had.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 is due to the improved special effects and the actors did what they could do with a poorly written script.  For a scifi buff it's okay.  For a regular movie goer it stunk pretty bad.
0345803493|4.0|We continue the journey of Ana and Christian. More becomes clear as to why Christian is like he is and Ana learns what she can handle and what she can't. Ana starts her new job and works to loosen Christian's iron grip on her life. Christian attempts to learn to trust. I won't spoil it for you, but things come to a head with \\"Mrs. Robinson\\"! Charlie Tango (the helicopter) features heavily in the ending of this installment. Again, the end will leave you wanting to read the final book! I can't wait to start it myself. Worth the time, a bit more mystery in this one.
B000002GVO|5.0|This is a great CD. This music was wonderful when it first came out and it is still great. It's one of my all time favorites.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I waited awhile to read this book because Of all the frenzy surrounding this trilogy.<br /><br />That being said, I really liked the format of the book (I listened to it as an audio Book) My Favorite character is Ana's Subconscious. That got your attention, huh? For those of you who like hard core novels..this is not the series for you. Yes there is sex, somewhat graphic, definitely not for kids, but not the whips and chains that it was hyped to be. Mild B + D only. This is actually a love story between a young virgin college girl, and a multibillionaire Business owner. It has lots of twists and turns that keep your attention. So if a little soft kinks interest you, this is a fun read, and well worth the time. I wouldn't read it if you don't plan to read the whole series, the end will leave you dying to start the second book!
B008AT71WI|5.0|The picture and sound quality are excellent and I am so glad to finally see the original ending!  It's much better than the Hollywood Happy Ending they changed after test audiences.  Awesome Blu-Ray!
B005RDF2RG|5.0|It was fun to watch it. We all sat as a family to watch Shreck. Funny even for adults. Cool songs
B00ANW33CM|4.0|I have played this since I got it everyday . I wish there was a way to reset the scores to start over,<br /> but it keeps me busy all the same. I like the 3-D to it makes it more chalinging
B0045XICB2|5.0|Great!<br />I have watched all of the Twilight Sagas and this is by far the best:-)!  Would love to see more
B002EXGQXQ|4.0|Nice movie interesting story line.abit confuseing to start but quickly connects the dots between the charactors but extra love interest not nessary
B002VPE1WK|1.0|This was a wonderful bag until it fell apart at the seams (literally) which left me very disappointed. Other than that, it was an amazing bag at an amazing deal. Unfortunately not any of that matter if it can't even hold itself together.
B005PK553C|5.0|This movie is awesome! !! I'm ready for season 2 , being a prime member is the best way to go it is worth it! !!! Get to watch show and movies for free and free is good ..
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The world of the hunger games show us what we as humans are capable of...<br />Good and evil exist in us all.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We borrowed the first two series, but wanted to catch up on the third season, so this was well worth the money we paid for it. Thanks for quick service and excellent packaging.
1616614609|5.0|I won't repeat what other have already written, but rather explain some of the doubts I had before buying the game.<br /><br />The game comes with several prearranged decks ready to play, you can take all the time in the world to create your own decks, but it's not required to enjoy the game straight out of the box.<br />This game as is, without expansions, has plenty of opportunities and strategies to develop different decks.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is  like Mario and I like how the ads don't appear. Its really cool because now you can play something like Mario on the go
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|this book is pretty good in my opinion so this is definitely a book that i would recommend to one of my friends
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is  very addictive and fun . The first time I played it I didn't  know what to do. I loved it and I just kept playing and playing! By the time I got to level 7 I was a pro!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's so fun especially when you get double coins too boy this game is fun make more games kiloo
B00BGI086Q|5.0|While it is very true that some super hero shows end up wasting air time and/or fading out soon after (Mantis, The Flash, Super Boy, Super Girl), I don't think this one will. I am a super hero fan! Aside from Arrow being well built and handsome as heck, the character is smart, serious, no non-sense, but has a sensitive side (when it calls for it. Lol). I like how his \\"sidekicks\\" have to call him to reason sometimes, putting him in check. So, sometimes he's humble.<br /><br />I enjoy the tidbit flashbacks to the Island he was on. You get to slowly see and understand how he becomes the person he is. The show doesn't choke you with a flood of information, but allows you to digest and enjoy the plot and action week by week.<br /><br />I'll be following this show, as long as it doesn't turn into a soap opera or become ridiculous like some of the last few seasons of Smallville.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I loved this book. From the very beginning it caught me and wouldn't let go. Hadn't ran into a good one in a while. This book had enough mystery to keep me guessing y err t unraveled perfectly to where I wouldn't be ahead. Definetly a must read.
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|I like the characters and the story. Very believable setting. Wonder how they are going to adjust the story next season.
B000FA675C|5.0|All time favorite read. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for his new book coming out in May. I read the excerpt and I'm hooked!
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|This was my first movie purchase through Amazon on the cloud.  I generally like to have a physical copy but was amazed at the quality of the picture when I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire HD.  I used an HDMI cord to connect it to my television.  My whole family enjoyed the crisp sound, sharp graphics, and yes the story itself.  Yes, even my husband and sixteen year old son sat down to join us for the entire movie and enjoyed it.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|SO EXCITED THE MOVIE IS COMING! VERONICA MARS IS ONE OF THE MORE WITTY AND ENTERTAINING SHOWS OF ALL TIME!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Shipped within the week. No skips on any of the CDs everything included. Great way to own one of my favorite shows.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Lexy Baker has everything going for her a great house, a new dream bakery, the ability to eat whatever and not gain weight.  When Lexy's ex-boyfriend ends up murdered and Lexy is a suspect it's up to her and her nana's group of elderly crime busters to clear Lexy's name.<br /><br />This was a cute mystery novella where you meet Lexy and all her friends and find out that even in perfect worlds murder does occur.  Definitely a quick mystery if your looking for a break between more bigger books!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Mom loves it I love it, and even more, Mom loves it I love it,  secondly, Mom loves it I love it, plus Mom loves it I love it, in addition, Mom loves it I love it, and lastly, Mom loves it I love it.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|It was good . Good for addiction. THe movie is a good example of how addiction can play out in someones life..

B005DJREGQ|5.0|This is the story of Jenna Hamilton. She is an average American teenager to whom anyone who has ever attended high school can relate. Her struggles in defining herself, both to herself and to the outer world are charming and sarcastic/ yet truthful. As her relationships evolve the audience is introduce to conflicts and resolution that are realistic and yet still true to its MTV roots. Needless to day, whether its dealing with the bitchy head cheerleader or making eyes at the popular guy who likes you but can't be seen with you or finding better in an unexpected place, everyone can find themselves laughing and loving and learning. Because no matter how you slice it, just because you survived it, doesn't mean it wasn't awkward.
8866131377|5.0|I love Moleskin products and this one has not disppointed me this year, either.  Lots of writing space.  Moleskin does it again!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|its a really fun game, fast paced and keeps you on your toes. considering its a free game I was quite impressed!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Dr. Suess does it again!  I found this for a GREAT deal on Cyper Monday and my son and I enjoy watching it and it made a great present for a Mother-to-Be at Christmas as well.  It is just a fun movie!
B001NKI60W|4.0|If you like musicals, you'll like Mamma Mia. The acting & singing are both good. It has an easy to follow plot with touches of humor. It's a light-hearted see and leaves you smiling.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Her life is about as awkward as it could possibly get. Highly entertaining to watch though! A laugh a minute
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My daughter-in-law got me started watching Downton Abbey and both of us are hooked! Can't wait to see the next episodes!
0345803493|5.0|i have read and re-read entire troligy, fun journey igniting our burning desire of conquring the bad boy and changing him as well as ourselves. More sex and more Christian, Anastasia grows up too. Must have!
B002CVQAX6|4.0|i have this movie as vhs ,so i wanted it in blue-ray;it's an interesting horror movie with good actors and a good storyline.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Love soundcloud,  its an easy way to keep up with your favorite artist. Listen to their new songs before anyone else.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|As a closet Trekie I have wanted this series for some time. The price though has always been to high. This one was just right and I have now viewed all the discs. Very good.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Such a great read, it had me thinking about the story for many days after I've read it. Definitely recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book is so good. Connolly just gets better and better. I recommend,not just for readers of thrillers/police procedurals but everyone who loves good writing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a nice app.  If you love to play Solitaire, then you will like this app. I recommend getting it.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|I don't have any of the musical sophistication of some of the expert reviewers here.  I don't have clear defined standards nor the ability to compare one soundtrack from another and draw conclusions about whether an artist has made some fundamental statement or whatever.  I just like what I can feel.  This is one of the finest soundtracks I've ever heard and what the music conveys to me is a sense of the melancholy and the inner strength that was so much a part of Mr. Lincoln.  I also enjoyed the added dimension of \\"Getting Out the Vote\\" and the inspiration of \\"Call the Muster and the Battle Cry of Freedom\\".<br /><br />All in all this is some of the very best music I have in my collection. Sonically, the recording does this soundtrack justice with a clear and well-defined soundstage that, at least with my equipment, puts me about in the 3 or 4th row of a concert hall.  The sound isn't harsh or immersive.  The volume of this recording is just about right for this kind of music.<br /><br />As the 5 stars I gave this recording indicate, I highly recommend this soundtrack.  Frankly, I think John Williams is a national treasure.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|great movie would recommend to anybody i loved it thrilling movie that keeps u on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Have not finished it yet.  But so far it is great!  I do not have the insatiable desire to continue to read the novel like I had with Hunger Games.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Addicting in a good way... hard to stop playing... simple for beginning gamers but challenging enough for experienced puzzlers... a hit in this house and will continue to play daily!!

B005GFPZYK|5.0|awesome look into the world of an American hero. Brutally honest about war. Very funny at times too. I gave it 5 stars.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Had this not been a true story i would not have watched the entire thing. I found it an interesting story, but it could have been told in 30-45 minutes. But it dragged on and on and I found I was very bored.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|i saw this group in concert in a pouring rain.  they were great and the CD is as good as the concert but i stayed dry
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A well done British TV series. Full of serious, funny, loveable and quirky characters. If you like the Masterpiece Theater type of British shows, I think you will enjoy this.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Reminds me of the games on the boardwalk in Wildwood. Just like there you run out of coins to quick.
B00A77II0U|5.0|A \\"find the hidden thingy\\" adventure that makes sense and is VERY engaging.  There is an actual, and rather good, story that keeps pulling you along.  The \\"find\\" games actually have some relevance to the story, and the puzzles are pretty straight forward -- if perhaps a tad overly easy.  Excellent creation of atmosphere, at least in the first half.  The second \\"half\\" of the story, while still quite good, seems to rush ahead with just a little less attention to maintaining the atmosphere created in the beginning.  Fortunately, such a good job is done setting the stage that it carries the feeling through adequately.  Over all, an excellent game, though not one I would recommend for children under 7 or 8.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I don't like the bloody details.  I was expecting it to reveal more beauty in the tiger and nature.  The affection of the tiger was very subtle but obviously there.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Have enjoyed every single episode of this wonderful show. Can't wait for next Season to begin. It is just amazing!1
B005K0HDGE|4.0|An entertaining read that includes elements of nostalgia.  We tend to glorify the past but this is a more realistic view of a time people today call, &#34;Camelot&#34;.  I'm not sure that red velvet cupcakes existed in the late 50's.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Amazing movie on every count. Story, images, acting, direction, colors, music emotions, all. One of the best movies ever. Should have received the Oscar instead of Argo which was good but not great movie.<br />The 3D at home works very well. Do not miss!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Exciting, fast-paced, and fun. Can't wait to read the next one. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys science fiction books.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I bought this CD as a gift to my daughter, and she simply loved it. She already knew by heart all the songs.
B00005JKED|5.0|Received as ordered. Haven't tested. Seems to be okay. I have to keep adding words. I don't know what else to say.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|This was exciting but it ended rather abruptly. This was clearly a leadin for a sequel. film. More 3D movies needed.
B001TODCII|5.0|Received as ordered. Haven't tested. Seems to be okay. I have to keep adding words. I don't know what else to say.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Very well paced, interesting story line and great characters.  Looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy. Lisbeth Salander!
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Okay, so first off, I do not do reviews. I have been an amazon customer for over two years, placing orders on nearly a bi-weekly basis and this is my first review. I just felt that this album deserved it. This album is different from what we expect from Paramore but that is to be expected. With all they have gone through change is due, with losing the Farro Brothers, I'm surprised they managed to remain as true as they did to what we are used to.<br /><br />In this album, we hear a much more optimistic band. With nearly four years since their last album, this album shows paramore taking risks, and emerging from their comfort zone. They are developing their range, and quite frankly I think that's amazing. In this album, many people suggest that the band is more &#34;pop&#34;, but I don't think these people have listened to the full album. There are some songs up here that are unique to say the least, but you can hear the old paramore we all fell in love with throughout the album. The highlights of this album are Part II, which incorporates lyrics from &#34;Let the flames begin&#34; from Riot. This is too awesome to me being able to hear those lyrics revived and relived. Last hope takes us back to the softer paramore, such as the only exception, breath, and many songs from the first album. There are a few other slow songs up here as well, like future and hate to see your heart break. While slow, they show the purity of Hayley's voice. Other highlights include Still into you, and despite having a pop like verse, the chorus takes us back to that alternative band. You find that a lot in this album, verses incorporate things that are totally different from what we are used to, but the choruses often times stay the same, which we see in Still into you, now, Proof, and Ani't it fun. This album shows a funner paramore, in songs like crazy girls, and fast in my car.<br /><br />While it is true they have matured, we see in this album a reborn Paramore. This album is by no means as great as All we know is falling, which in my opinion was their greatest work, but it is still an album that magnifys one of the greatest bands ever. Haley shows us a different side of her, and in the lyrics, we see a band that is so incredibly happy, and optimistic. It is different, and many scruitenize this album because of that, but once you listen to the entire album once, your hooked. You hear the old paramore still in there, alongside a new paramore that is just trying to show how much they have grown in the past four years. Wonderful album, I have listed to it cover to over about eight times, which translates into about nine hours in two days. It is well worth it, and with 17 tracks, you can't go wrong. One note is there are two bonus tracks, which are not included on the physical album but can be listened to on rido for free. These are escape route, which is the old Paramore one hundred percent. I highly recommend you listen to this, because this is by far the best song for this album, and seems like many of the songs on the third album. The other bonus track is &#34;native tongue&#34; which is decent, but not the cream of the crop.<br /><br />All in all this album does not disappoint. The cream of the crop lays in Last hope (my personal favorite), Part II, Ain't it fun, crazy girls, proof<br /> and the best is escape route, but unfourtantly it's not on the physical album
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the suspense and the romance.  Well written look into the mind of an abuser.  He was a scarey creep.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this when the hype was at is biggest, right before the movie came out. I knew the basic plot: kids get put into an arena to fight to the death, and found the story predictable past that point. While it did not end the way I expected (the second book did however), there were not any big surprises. That said, the book was very well written and I connected to the characters immediately. I came for the plot, and I stayed for the characterization.<br /><br />It's a good, fast read and definitely worth it. I actually liked the sequels better, which most people don't agree with.
B000VHXD7O|5.0|Based on historical fact and most realistic visual effects of combat that I have seen. Comparible with &#34;We were soldiers&#34;
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Excruciatingly awful to read, completely unbelievable characters. I couldn't finish it it was too terrible..... From the other reviews I'm glad I didn't waste any more time reading this.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Challenging &amp; entertaining, after you start playing it becomes addictive to see what else will come up in the game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was very good, kept me on the edge the whole time. I am looking forward to reading other books by Howey
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|B movie all the way. Just cheese riding the back of the original Dredd. I'm getting sick of all the bad remakes.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|We like to travel to distant places and this is a useful tool to find out about many places.  I like the photos to assess a resort or hotel and find the reviews to be mostly accurate - one needs to filter out the chronic complainers from the genuine reviews.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|It was a good start but I didn't like cinematography as much as  I did in the Lord of the Rings.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and challenging. I love match games and this is my favorite now. there are plenty of levels to keep the entertainment going for a long time.
B00BESNKB8|3.0|Needless gore. Adding blood and guts for shock was not needed in this movie. It would have been a good movie except for  the gore. So its just above a cheese b movie.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|i loved the movie, i love sushi and i love Japan. I will watch over and over, really interesting info too
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game.  I tried it one time and became addicted to the game.  It can keep me entertained for hours at a time.
B008HI7BMW|5.0|and an effective and awesome soundtrack..it would be great if there was a concert with an orchestra playing this music. It would be fun to watch. Hans Zimmer does it again....enough said!
B00368PSN2|4.0|When I went to see this movie at the theater when it came out, I thought it might be a B movie. It turn out to be better then I thought . I waited to buy it until it came out on blue ray. It was had to find in the retail stores.
B001QKSWOE|4.0|Plum Spooky was good, but between the numbers (I've read all 4) aren't quite as good as the Plum series itself. I'm a huge fan of the first 19 with #20 coming in November!
B000FA675C|5.0|When I read Dan Brown's &#34;DaVinci Code&#34; several years ago, I was unable to stop reading until I had completed it. I thought it to be an excellent page-turner. This response on my part was unrelated to the speculatively-factual (contridictory?) nature of the premise underlying the implied with respect to any of the history. The book is just written in a manner which conveyed excitement. That excitement never came across in the subsequent movie - too sad.
B007STXHTM|3.0|I bought this Dive Housing only because I'm an avid diver and want to start recording my dives with video. let me first start off by saying that the improved Lens on this Housing is FANTASTIC! So why the 3 stars? Well for starters, i went on a 40ft dive and water started to leak into the housing. Condensation also started to form as well. Luckily, i caught this in time or my gopro would've been on the fritz as well. After i dried it off, i tested it again on a snorkeling trip and again, water patches went into the housing. I think my housing had a defect with the o-ring thats suppose to keep the water out. I ordered a replacement to test again, hopefully it becomes a 5 star rating and not a 3 star rating.<br /><br />I would recommend this product if in fact mine was just a defect.
B000FA675C|5.0|also loved Angels and Demons and can't wait to read the next in the series.  Hope its just as exciting.
1400052181|5.0|This book reads like a novel, but is actually a true story.  I like the way the author switched back and forth from the technical information on cell lines to the story of the Lacks family.  She actually made the medical information understandable. You get a good sense of how the family's knowledge of what was going on slowly evolved and how they struggled to deal with the way that Henrietta's cell's were handled.  I learned a lot about the role of cell cultures in research, but also how the ethics of medical research has evolved.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Excellent Book that caugths you, and don't leave till its ended. Recommend reading the first book: Fall of Giants, to enjoy the second one better. Ken Follett is an excellent writer of History of the World in a Novel, but after all life by itself is a Novel.
B0026NBZDU|2.0|Great homage to Dickens with a homo-erotic twist.  Little Dorrit and company just doesn't do it for me,though. If you like Dickens, I'd venture to say this would be a fun read.
B0061P2L5U|5.0|A compelling link is made between the gut and the greater immune system. The research in this book is cutting edge, much of it from 2005 and later, and it is presented in a &#34;digestible&#34; way.<br /><br />If you suffer, or know someone who suffers from allergies, asthma, IBS, MS, or the other multitude of immune system disorders, this should be required reading for you.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Michael Lewis writes about people who buck the system.  He reveals the naked emperor. This book may seem to be about baseball and statistics. It's really about people who believed s in themselves when everyone else says they are wrong.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy bingo and the kindle version gives me the opportunity to play without spending any money. It is a good game.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was excited to see that my phone came with swipe installed.  I found out that it sucked.  I just started using SwiftKey and it is great.  Works very good.  Does not have all of the mistakes that the factory one has.  Works good with one hand typing with my thumb.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I enjoyed the scenes and mysteries. The map was extremely helpful. Loved the story line. Can't wait to play the sequel.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is an excellent knife of great  construction. It feels really heavy on the hand which something I wanted in this type of knife and has that overall great construction you can feel. The sheath is really good the knife definitely won't fall off however the part of the sheath that attaches to your belt I personally didn't like. Nothing you can't fix yourself .
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Love love love the new album!! Keep them coming NKOTB!! I will be a Blockhead for life!!!  Can't wait to see ya in Dallas in June!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book wrapped me up for countless hours just trying to finish it. Lena truly makes me feel special and teaches me that you can't always run away from your future.
0307279189|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I've given it as gifts and recommended it to tons of people, including many of my massage clients. Mr McDougall tells an incredibly compelling story, wrapping his personal quest for pain-free running in a series of evermore gripping adventures and races. And it's all true! It was crazy that I even picked up a book on running in the first place, but once I picked it up, I was hooked. He even makes research exciting. Wow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was intriguing and very interesting. You almost feel like your katniss everdeen and your in the hunger games not her. And the details just add to the effect. I couldn't put the book down, this is my 2nd time reading the book. I can't wait to read interesting the seris over again!!!
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I've been wanting to watch Jurassic Park again but didn't have the DVD movies. I looked online to Amazon and they had a deal where if I bought the triliogy I could get a FREE Fandago Movie Pass for one to see the 3D version of the first Jurassic Park movie at a participating Fandango theater. So I purchased it. A regular price for an adult 3D movie ticket at the cinema near us is $13.  The FREE ticket is valued at $8 so I would have to pay the difference of $5. If you go on the website for Fandango to obtain the ticket, they make you pay a $1.25 service fee, as if the price of the ticket wasn't already high enough! So now this FREE ticket is costing me $6.25, plus $13 for my husband to go with me. Not such a great deal when you are expecting something for FREE.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|Can't load viber app on my kindle fire HD, any help Would be appreciated...if it is possible to even download it
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I'm on a Galaxy Nexus, using CM nightlies (4/12).<br /><br />It has only crashed a few times, and sometimes the keyboard will refuse to pop-up when trying to input a word or two.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a pretty fun game!  For only a dollar this was an irresistable BUY, and the gameplay is well worth it.<br /><br />Now for my imagination, however, I can only seem to add adjectives like &#34;giant&#34;, &#34;flaming&#34;, &#34;rainbow&#34; or &#34;awesome&#34; because I'm pretty stupid when it comes to creativity.  But my creativity aside, this game is great.
B006UUK612|5.0|I love this movie and so do my kids. It's a very sweet story and totally appropriate for children. I have a 3, 6 and 9 year old.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was an interesting read.  It was easy to follow.  I enjoyed reading it.  I would like to see the movie.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|The first few episodes left me in touch with my inner Viking. There was a grandiose sense of adventure that I think is intrinsic in everyone. The scenery was beautiful, the characters were well developed, the plot was suspenseful, the fights scenes were epic. Every character played an important, and that is great too. I really liked the different types of social behavior, the clear personalities, and how that is really the driving force in a savage world, the conflict of powerful personalities and the oppression of individuals in power, and the way they react to opposition. A classic.
B0059R3AGK|4.0|music with a lot of soul. This version of seven nation army my favorite, it has a lot more character
0071762345|4.0|This book gave me some great ideas and new ways to think about social media. The section on \\"Eight Cool Things You Can Do With Facebook Ads\\"  is a great example of Dave's insight and will have you re-thinking what you are doing with social media.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I'm 65 (in case you think seniors don't play games), and this is one of my favorite games for my Kindle Fire. I showed it to  my daughter, and a co-worker (half my age) who plays it better on his smart phone than I do. If you like Angry Birds, Stupid Zombies, Plants Vs. Zombies (Favorite), type games, you should love this.<br />Ray
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Going in I knew the premise of the movie was farfetched and I was hoping for something light and funny.  I think this movie might be funny to a teenager but it would have been better to make a PG version for younger kids. As an adult, the story is boring and its basically the same jokes over and over.  Maybe you have to be in an altered state to enjoy it.
B00BVVA138|5.0|The outcome of this long awaited return of Jesse Leach, the original vocalist, is absolutely landmark! This has become one of my all-time favorite albums; the sheer intensity of the instrumentality: brutal then melodic then soaring and to top it all is the astounding vocal work. Lyrically, the album is superb and ultimately inspiring. Worth every bit and I cant wait for the tour to come through Illinois!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very simple gameplay, with sufficient challenge to make it very addictive!<br /><br />Certainly keeps you coming back for more with upgrades changing the location.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Our book club had a good discussion and everyone enjoyed reading it.<br />I did not find it difficult to follow the storyline with the author rotating back and forth<br />between the past and present.  The ending was a little &#34;far-fetched&#34; but it did not<br />deter me from liking the novel.  All the members said they would recommend it as<br />an easy read to others.  The distinction of the various meaning of flowers was<br />interesting.  Our host purchased many varieties of flowers, putting them in vases<br />and labeling the meanings.  We ended our gathering, each with a small vase of<br />flowers, which was such a lovely idea and hostess gesture.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great Movie what more can you say about this movie & service which is always great kinda makes not want to write reviews when you need to fill in enough words, Hun??????
B004V45YBG|5.0|Barnes has found his subject and Flaubert has found his biographer. This non-fiction work is an intellectual thriller as Barnes takes unconventional routes through his subject's history, a  &#34;Tour&#34; de force. From letters to landscapes we become grounded in the places that Flaubert lived, worked and travelled. The story is not told in chronological order because Barnes has many more interesting ways to present the material to the reader, including some scathing, precisely reasoned criticism of another Flaubert biographer, an academic. The writing is never remote observation. Instead, Barnes brings the reader in direct contact with Flaubert and with himself.
0385349947|5.0|I'd highly recommend this book without reservation for men and women. It's real. It's authentic.It makes you pause, think and even reconsider things you thought you had figured out. I give kudos to Sheryl for taking this risk to speak out and share her point of view. I was impressed by the readability and the abundance of credible research referenced. It is a thought-provoking read for anyone -- no matter where they'd put themselves on the feminist spectrum.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it it is so fun I play this everyday it is very realistic I highly recommend it I hope others enjoy.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|se fosse finito prima della solita scontata fine avrebbe meritato di più. Un buon action movie comunque. Avvincente. Lo consiglio
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a very good book i would recommend it to anyone who likes to read about novels, very suspenseful
B006WPWH4E|2.0|Would like more features on screen that help move the game along.  And the size is a bit swall for old eyes.
B00009R6H2|5.0|Great replacement! I needed a second adapter so I could interchange my cameras without having to remove the one I already had from another camera.  This works perfectly fine and it's an authentic manfrotto replcaement part.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the hunger games series it was awesome<br />I loved it I will look forward to more book awesome
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I find the game - just okay and that really sums it up. If each game lasted longer than one minute it would make the game more interesting.
0385535147|2.0|I felt this story was very weak. The main character, Malcolm, sets out to pull off a very intricate plan. There is never any suspense because the plan goes along perfectly, without ever facing any challenges or obstacles, even though some of the major pieces to the plan are beyond Malcolm's control. There is never any climax and the end is boring. There are no good twists and you easily figure out what's going on before you get there. I never found myself caring about any of the characters and actually started hoping Malcolm would fail.
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|This is a great CD - not only is it loaded with all the songs Elvis did on the original show but the sound is like you are sitting  there in the audience. I would gladly promote this CD to everyone who likes Elvis - it's one of a kind.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I've enjoyed this song since the first time I heard it. During my first year as an expat in The Hague, I started hearing this everywhere, and a friend finally showed me the Anton Corbijn-inspired music video. I go back to that first summer here whenever I hear this song, and get a huge kick out of the music video (nice to be able to show folks my town and the dunes here).
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Love Dune, got this collectors extended for 9.98 used and couldnt pass that up.  The extended scenes make my nerd bone tickle
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|Beautifully filmed, with some absolutely gorgeous shots of sushi. This story about the most famous sushi chef in the world takes you on a short tour of Jiro's life and family. The trip to the fish market is eye-opening, and the demonstrated attention to detail is humbling. Don't expect a fast-paced DVD with a killer soundtrack - this is a lovely, well-paced film.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|We've loved this movie since it first came out years ago.  When we saw it on Amazon we purchased it to be added to our video collection.  We've watched it several times since and have enjoyed it each time.  The story is wonderful and the music is so enjoyable.  It's a light-hearted story about friendships and love.  This movie can't help to put a smile on your face when watching it!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|...I lost my original copy in a move, and after a few years decided to purchase it again. The first book was well-loved - with rounded corners and paper softened by countless readings - and I expect the second copy to wind up with the same fate by the time all is said and done. Revisiting this book now is like seeing a dear friend from ages past. This book will remain in my library as one of my all-time childhood favorites.
B000MR1V22|5.0|I was required to watch this movie for class and do a family assessment on it..I really enjoyed it!! I would suggest this movie to anyone.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|You feel you are in conversation with the author.<br />He addresses an important set of issues without being &#34;preachy&#34;<br />Thought provoking.
0316224588|5.0|I love Rebus, and have missed him. This story shows he's still got the goods, but has to measure his moves a bit more carefully as a civilian. And I love his musical choices. May I have more, please?
B008GOG98Y|5.0|I remembered seeing this movie when it originally came out and I was in high school.  Sometimes movies don't hold up over time, but this one has heart, a great plot, and nuanced acting performances, so I enjoyed it again though now from a parent's perspective. It's a rare movie that is laugh-out-loud funny and touching too.  This would be a good movie for a family night with older teenagers.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|A great book, that had me thinking about it even after a few days had past. A novel I wouldn't feel guilty for suggesting it to my friends or co-workers.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I found it impossilble for me to watch the entire collection in a continous showing. So far, the DVD's watched are very good.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Saw the movie, but still love the book....<br />Just sad people miss so much by not reading the book.<br />So read the book, and enjoy the movie even more!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Full of suspense and surprises diffinitely a must see TV series, so sad that season 2 is coming to an end. Waiting in great anticipation of what happens next.
0718157834|5.0|This book really makers you see both sides to a paraplegic life.  You understand more the struggles their life has to offer.
