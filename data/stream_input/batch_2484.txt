0393057658|5.0|Great if you are a baseball fan, but great even if you are not.  It delves into the business side of the game in a way none other has.  It is very interesting, and informative.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|Great premise and actors are fairly good but the script makes them idiots.  There are 300 million firearms in the US and 99% of the people are dead, yet these people can't find any guns.  They drive the same crappy RV, always on the verge of breaking down, past entire highways and towns full of better vehicles.  The zombies are slow, yet somehow outrun the living, they can't cross even simple fences, yet are always able to sneak up to people ostensibly trying to save their own life.  It beggars belief that these people would ever survive anything more taxing than a riot, much less a zombie apocalypse.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love Big Bang Theory, I watch it every week. Own most seasons can't wait for season six to come out on DVD.
B005LAJ22Q|1.0|They drive broken down vehicles through highways filled with abandoned, newer vehicles.  They can't find firearms, medicine, clothing, food, water, etc, but pass by homes and through intact towns completely abandoned.  They don't even try to find a place in which to settle down to survive, instead wander aimlessly, halfheartedly defending themselves in increasingly more incompetent ways.  Instead of clearing out an area of walkers and setting up defenses, they flee, on foot, with the cliche falling down and breaking of legs.  They've been doing this for about a year, but some of them still don't know how to shoot!  I can't watch any more.  These people are too silly to care about and I simply cannot suspend disbelief long enough to try any longer.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Revenge is a great show, but I have a question, what on earth you need Martial arts for? To beat those people she want revenge on and have no fighting training whatsoever!!
B006M4F67A|2.0|There aren't enough colors to distinguish the tiles,<br />there's a washed out effect to it.<br />Had to constantly hit an off tile to highlight the edge<br />tiles. Love & have lots of Mahjong games, this one<br />needs a color tweek.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This was a good game. I enjoyed the graphics. sometimes it was difficult to find some of the items due to the graphics being to dark. Overall good value for the money
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|It would be easy for someone to pay real money in this game,<br />not my idea of fun if my niece accidentally did that.
0198534469|5.0|As a teacher I feel that the main objective of teaching is to communicate the beauty of a subject. We find very few Mathematics books that communicate the inherent beauty of the subject. Needham succeeds remarkably well in bringing out the beauty of Complex analysis. The pictures are great and insightful. He makes the learning fun. Needham also exhibits very beautiful geometrical thinking. The book should be read by all Mathematics students.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|I like it and I don't care if anyone else does. As I am sure that nobody really care what I think
0375508414|5.0|Love comes in all colors and sexes and different forms and family can be more than blood related.  A wonderful story for all and so many lessons offered to be learned.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is just a simple calculator but does the job I need it to do. its not fancy but works great.
B008BL57KS|5.0|I sent it to my daughter.  She loved it.  I hope it will always be a reminder of how I feel for  her.
0307454568|5.0|This book is the 3rd of Stieg Larsson trilogy and continues on as if you never left the story.  Incredibly written, kept me wanting more and I highly recommend it as a great read.  I'm now wanting more and wish there was another book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|LOVED IT STARTED LAST MONTH WITH SEASON 1 AND AM JUST ABOUT FINISHED WITH SEASON 03. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK LOOKING FORWARD TO SEASON 4.
B00821OX98|4.0|I don't typically watch TNT shows, but someone insisted I give this a watch.  They were right!  Seasons 1 and 2 were great.  The actors, even the young ones, do an awesome job and the human interactions and reactions are believable.  Looking forward to season 3!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|As a fan of the Eagles since the 1970's, I have many happy memories.  I can still remember \\"Take It To The Limit,\\" broadcast over the loud speakers while skiing in the High School Ski Club at Afton Alps.  Randy Meisner's voice, \\"You know I've always been a dreamer,\\" resonated through the airwaves, as the chair lift zipped us upward.<br /><br />That's the great thing about music, a couple of chords and you're back in time.<br /><br />It was pure joy to watch \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" the other night.  I played it through several times.  Don Felder, in particular, stood out to me.  His flamenco style guitar on Hotel California was amazing.<br /><br />The music of this band is timeless.  It only takes seconds and I'm young again (reaching for the Coppertone.)
B00AB7HESI|3.0|It's not as creative as some of the console versions of Scribblenauts, but I guess it's a cell phone version so what should I have expected.  It got boring and repetitive pretty quickly, but it was fun for a little while.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Hotel Translyvania is a fun movie. We loved every part. The bat makes the sweetest face when she wants to fly to the viilage. It is fun how they show another side to Monster's. my daughter has watched this movie a hundred times already.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really good app!! it has a lot of games to chose from and works well. it is also difficult to win the levels.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|I watched the pilot episode knowing very little about the character Green Arrow. I was pleasantly surprised by the action in each episode. I rarely watched Smallville because I felt that it was more for teens. This show however is for all audiences. You become attached to more than just the lead character which says something about the acting. If you loved the Nolan Dark Knight series you will love Arrow. Enjoy :-)
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Incredible story as seen from both sides of the front lines. Provides great insight into the German feelings and experiences of the war beginning with a solid foundation of pre-war Germany. Would be a great movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had heard of these books before but had no desire no read them. I watched the movie one night on amazon prime an  loved it! The boom is far better than the movie. The movie leaves out a lot of great details that add to the story. I cent said to star book two.
B000W1VTZ2|4.0|Classic rainbow. Always loved this album. Ritichie Blackmore ronnie james dio cozy powell. Whats not to like. If you like this sort of music you'll love this record. Even the production holds up well.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is hard to stop once you start playing. It does require your full attention as it is on a timer and you have to search for matches. Each level has a different playing design so make it very challenging to complete the level.
B00CL50LEC|1.0|totally not what i expected. if you like zombies this is for you. i give amazon a 5 star for resolving my issue and i don't like to rate a 1 but i don't want to mislead you. rent first and make sure this one is for you
B0091REZMW|2.0|This game starts out okay but then it seems to stall. Hard to figure out what is required to advance to other rooms. It becomes distracting to have bugs (?) crawling around the screen that you have to have points or something to destroy. I still haven't figured it all out and really don't care to since all I wanted was to find objects. I have cast this game aside.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I really enjoy this game. The animation is good and its fun to unlock new suits. I just got this game and I've already got the game down.
B007PVHANM|5.0|This was a wonderful movie! It really gives the viewer a great insight into the life of the legend. Bob Marley, great musician, philanthropist, and revolutionary.
B002WJI63A|3.0|I purchased Princess Peach at the same time as I purchased Mario, Bowser and Yoshi.  The quality of Princess Peach was poor compared to the others.
0800141660|5.0|I bought this to replace the VHS version that I have. It is a favorite movie of mine! It came shipped well and arrived quickly!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|The story was very well told.  Tom Cruise did a good job of creating the character but in my mind's eye Jack Reacher is much bigger.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|This is a great card battle game.  I'm having a lot of fun with it.  It's great that it is free for such a high quality game.  Only down sides are that it requires an Internet connection even for the campaign mode and that it gets challenging fast if you don't want to spend real money for better cards.
B004TI1WME|4.0|I liked the calculator but it was just a little large for just a home checking. You could use it for logging , banking, or even a small business.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Jiro's lifelong quest for perfect sushi is truly humbling - how a man can spend a lifetime, reach the pinnacle of his craft, and still yearn for improvement.  This is a great movie for anyone so arrogant as to thing they've &#34;mastered&#34; anything.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Love this book from beginning to end. It was well written and well paced - just when you think you have it figured out, you soon realize you don't. The movie is coming out soon and I hope it does the book justice.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This is one of our new favorite movies. Cruise was very good in it. Very unexpected dry humor and great acting. We watched in 2 days in a row. We would recommend it and have to everyone. The storyline was very easy to follow and there was a lot of action packed footage. We will be watching it again I am sure.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I enjoy playing Jewels Star.  I would have given five stars if I could find instructions on how it scores.
B0092DTA9S|5.0|It sounds great it was worth it. Plays really well Their are ticks and pops They dont really matter thank you
B000FC146C|5.0|How  does one critique a true work of art?  This book grabbed me by my fundament on the first page and didn't turn me loose until the last page.  The protagonists are vivid and valid. The scenery is described so thoroughly, you can close your eyes and you're there. It's hard to review perfection, words just don't fit. You will have to read a few lines yourself to understand my inability to do the book justice.  The players are memorable and tragic, uplifting and exhilerating. Thorn Birds has all the elements of an epic story to become a classic read forever.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Streaming video from amazon froze as usual and had to restart from beginning. This seems to happen everytime- no problem with my Internet connection or Roku.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cord works great. It seems to charge my 2nd generation Kindle much more quickly than the cord that came with it. That original cord died, but my 2nd Gen lives on thanks to this cord.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a really good app, you can access chapters in the bible quickly and it gives different biblical versions to choose from.  Also, if you are unable to read it yourself you can set it on audio.  This is awsome.
B00A83075M|3.0|After reading the positive reviews this movie didn't live up to my high expectations. It's okay, but I should've rented it first and then I would've known not to buy.
B001HN697M|4.0|However, I have not sat and watched this video, but I've brought all of Underworld movie that came out since the beginning and I'm sure I won't be disappointed.
B00BPA2PFM|5.0|I admit it: I double dipped on this title (so soon) and glad I did!! I watched the extended version (which I love) and felt the video looked decent enough (maybe because of the lower bit rate?) but the colors just didn't pop out like they should for a 2013 blu ray. Good enough, I guess. I took the chance on getting this &quot;newer&quot; version transferred from 4K source (down to 1080p for standard blu ray) and was blown away after seeing this newer version. The colors really shine on this version and the detail is amazing! Most reviewers in high end web sites have stated they couldn't see or hear the difference. I know I sure can!! The 4K version is at much higher bit rate (maxing out at 42mbps or higher!) whereas the two versions on the first edition are crammed (with some special features)onto disc one. First offering they should have put each version on separate discs to maximize the bit rate. This is not just a typical drama/comedy here. This is eye-candy deluxe! The wonderful looking sets look immaculate on the 4K version and looking less so on the first edition.<br />The sound seems to be amped up too in the surrounds on this 4K version. Disappointed they didn't take advantage and upgrade the soundtrack to 7.1 instead of typical Dolby True HD 5.1. The soundtrack is still only 48kz and not the higher 96/24 which would make it sound more alive and real. Hopefully with red ray 2160p in the horizon, Sony will up the ante on their so-so soundtracks.<br />It is sad that Sony makes us higher end fans double dip so soon with this new release. Why did they not just release this one mastered from 4K source in the first place? Hope all new releases will be from 4K source from Sony in the future.<br />If you are a fan of home theater, do yourself a favor and get this 4K version of Total Recall. Too bad its only the theatrical cut. But it sure looks and sound amazing.<br />By the way, this region free disc has NO special features whatsoever. Really shows off with the higher bit rate. But we get this version to show off our system anyway!<br />Crank it up!!<br />Revision 3/21/14: Watching this on a 4K television is the ONLY way to go with this version. It is beyond words the great looking video. Would love to see this in REAL 4K! Looks great upconverted (from 1080p to 4K) from Oppo BDP-103 blu ray player onto Samsung UN55F9000 UHD TV.her bit rate. But we get this version to show off our system anyway!<br />Crank it up!!<br />Revision 3/21/14: Watching this on a 4K television is the ONLY way to go with this version.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book kept me reading.  Just to know what was gonna happen next.  Made me laugh because i was a dallas fan sitting in a sea of green in the90's!!!  I know how serious it can be.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I liked the subject matter. Parts were hard to understand. Could be cult classic. Loved the make up it should win an award.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app it was fun in all getting my music for free but I downloaded an app killer that protects my kindle and it said it was bad and I kept it on and in like a month it started to make my kindle freeze and it ended up my music I can't change it or any thing save yourself from the trouble and don't download this app
B00008L3U1|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for someone who loves this movie. This is a cute to watch with the family. This tem was reasonably priced.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's a Great game and I love Nemo and I loved the movie and ya'll need too many words for this
B0063IH60K|4.0|Everything is just as expected.  Fast Shipping!  Happy with the purchase.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have always loved playing card games and Spider Solitaire is one of my favorites. That's it for this one
B00992CF6W|5.0|I played this and it was awesome! I Build a mansion. Get it its total the worth of $6.99<br /><br />This is so awesome I play it with my friends get it now
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is the best game ever. I say it is only 2nd to temple run only because of the amount of coins you get at a certain time. In temple run you get multiple coins that are really close together. In subway surfers you have coins spread out pretty far until you can get a good long run in, otherwise this game is the best
B00499QUK2|5.0|I had not seen the Pink Lady!  It is Breath taking.  I know people are gullible and like doing wierd things when they believe they are safe.  As a person that takes Taxis a lot,  It was an eye opener.<br /><br />As a Parent of a Soldier, the opening scenes are Dramatic and certainly make a Parent sit on the edge of their Seat.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|I like this game but it is kinda hard to drive.It is really fun but very stupid .Don't get it.
B008133MDK|5.0|All of the BBC Sherlock Holmes presentations have been very up to date and well done.<br />It took me awhile to accept Benedict.  I took to Watson right off the Bat!<br />The production does keep a lot of today's electronic gadgets and advance programming as a contribution to the<br />Brillance of Holmes and Watson.<br /><br /> If you like Sherlock Holmes this is a must see.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|One of my favorite films, and I recently watched it again. This is the 1940's in all it's glory. The film directed by Roman Polanski may be one of his best films. The photography is gorgeous, and brings us to the 1940's that we can believe.<br /><br />Thus is acting at its best, particularly by Jack Nicholson, who is one of the best actors of our generation.  He becomes the character of J.J. Gittes, PI like a second skin. We know what he’s thinking, so he doesn't have to tell us. His loyalty is obvious, but on several occasions, evidence turns up that seems to incriminate. And then he must pull back, because his code will not admit clients who lie to him.The woman in question is Faye Dunaway, looking pale and beautiful, and justifying Her trust. And then there are all the other characters, who are there to float a bond issue and build a dam to steal water from Los Angeles. It is drought time in LA, sound familiar? much of the film is about the comng apart of the plot.p this is film to beho'd. We don't see many films like this anymore.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-04-15<br /><br />And always at the center, there’s the Nicholson performance, given an eerie edge by the bandage he wears on his nose after it’s slit by a particularly slimy character played by Polanski himself. The bandage looks incongruous, we don't often see a bandaged nose on a movie private eye, but it’s the kind of incongruity that’s creepy and not funny. The film works similar ground: Drifting within sight of parody every so often, it saves itself by the seriousness of its character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My three year old grandson loves to play this game. I am surprised how qickly he picked up on how to play this game.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I have seen several Bond movies and they all are pretty good. This one was also pretty good. What can I say? Check it out!
0395389496|5.0|Love the book and my daughter loves laying down for naptime listening to the CD. I would recomend this holiday favorite
B009DA74ES|5.0|I love this series. It is so funny and open. I like all the uncomfortable topics that they cover. I cannot wait for season six.
B004PLWGVG|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. Every song is unique and she can sing so well! Great buy!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Ms Sandberg states clearly that she thinks of herself as belonging to the post-feminist generation.<br /><br />Although I was an early subscriber to MS, I too benefited from the &#34;great&#34; feminists. Those who first protested about equal pay for equal work come way after the suffragettes who got us the vote, the first doctor, the first lawyer and so on. My mother went back to school in her mid-30s so she could get paid for what had previously been volunteer work. My husband has had the working wife role while I have been a full-time career person for most of our married life.<br /><br />This book looks at what didn't happen -why girls and young women still don't have equality with men and what they can do to achieve it. That's important. She also has a light hand in her writing - the anecdotes make things very real. (I particularly like the two kindergarten kids who want to be astronauts, only the girl worries who will watch their children when they are in space.)<br /><br />But there is one classic flaw - this is a book for the elite, not for the person working on an assembly line, construction site or fast-food joint. It tells you how to become a successful leader (technologically or managerially), and doesn't really face the more mundane problem of just getting enough income to support your family.
B008N1V11U|5.0|It is just like the movie. There is the pit but some stuff is taken out but it  is great. It is worth that 99cents.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Love this movie, not as good as the non-directors cut film, but it explains more and the plot makes more sense
B000000WI4|5.0|John Lee and company are in fine, mostly rockin' form on this follow up to THE HEALER, the 1989 album that brought Hooker a whole new legion of fans.<br />The title track and This Is Hip are among The Hook's best records of the 1990's, and the guest list supporting this effort is a who's who of sidemen and superstars of blues/rock. Mr Lucky is NOT TO BE MISSED!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|i chose this rating because..it would be a 5 star,<br />but you have to buy bombs for letter deletion. you<br />shouldnt have to buy this to play the game. :(
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the series, the only problem I had was the movie kept starting and stopping.  Other than that it was great.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great! Can't wait for season2!! I watched it all in one weekend. The story is wonderfull. Hurry season 2. Must see!!
B002APU580|5.0|I first watched it on tv then I just had to buy it. to be honest I just started watching the movie so I'd have an excuse not to talk to my mom for two hours but I'm so glad I watched it!!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Walked away knowing that I can do it all but don't have to. Better at negotiating a partnerships home. Will lean in in whatever degree  that mean to me.  A little disappointed  than only comment about her sister who is  a doctor (other then the childhood stuff) is that she's a qualified babysitter. Pediatricians at  th  lowest paid and least respected within Medicine and likely because we  don't lean in.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a great game and it gets your mind working too! I love all the fire maple games but this one is most likely my favorite one yet!!!! You should totally buy it!! And if your smart and do buy it i bet you will enjoy it but not as much as i did!
B0017SWSCW|5.0|I loved the first two and the third does not disappoint. But - now we have to wait an entire year for the next book. I will have to re-read the first 3 to catch up when it comes out. I was a bit surprised that the book cover contains a clue to the 4th book, but is never mentioned in this one. A mistake? A clue? Only time will tell.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I want my kids to watch it and enjoy it as much as I did and still do! Have to own it!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This story is more than just a backpacking novel.  Cheryl unveils some of her greatest wounds, the steps (pun intended ;) ) that she took to heal, and the quirky moments that make the store uniquely her own, while lending a hand of familiarity to the reader.<br /><br />This book, while to the avid long distance backpacker may seem foolish, was actually an amazing book.  Well written and engaging I found myself looking forward to bed time so that I could find out what was going to happen next in Cheryl's adventure.  Reckless, beautifully vulnerable and somewhat goofy, Cheryl kept me intrigued.  As foolish as some of her choices were, her vulnerability was graceful, and her courage to push on has added the spark needed to further fuel my desire to do long distance backpacking sooner than later. Rather than beat her for her mistakes and somewhat curious decisions (like many critics have), I will take note and learn from them.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Amazing, should be required reading for any physician who takes care of cancer patients, and most cancer patients would enjoy it also.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Though this game is very close to the original, it adds challenge with the camera and minecart rides. Not bad. Nice job Imangi.
1932100660|5.0|I started to read it and couldnt put it down. I have started to put to use the information I aquired from the book. I have recommended the book it to others.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very great for the little ones on the car ride, or if you get bored. The only thing that is a small nuisance is the mesh of breaking blocks and looking around. The rest is all good news! Good job Mojang!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love the game but many issues buying tokens. Would love to be able to get tokens in tournament round as well.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Combining the very best of Apollo 13 and MacGiver with down to earth modern language, the story sweeps you along spellbound.<br />It never injects aliens, artifacts or ancient mysteries to muddy the astronauts full time job of staying alive in the face of overwhelming odds.<br /><br />I REALLY liked this story!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|the game is cute. their are many ponies you can get but many others you would have to pay for or play the game for hundreds of years. I never pay for in-game content with any app and still have fun playing :)
B008EKOIN8|5.0|One of the better books I've read this year, both in terms of writing style and content.  The author includes scientific/biological facts as well as philosophical/religious musings and interesting bits of cultural history.  Not only is it a highly entertaining read, but it has both inspired me to try new ways of cooking and caused me to rethink the food I serve to my family.  This is not a diatribe against the typical American diet, but rather an exploration of what cooking can be.<br /><br />This book is a nice complement to Salt, Sugar Fat (http://www.amazon.com/Salt-Sugar-Fat-Giants-Hooked/dp/1400069807).  Of the two, I enjoyed this one more, but I highly recommend both.  There is little (though some) overlap.  I suggest reading this one second.  Salt, Sugar Fat helped me understand why our diet looks like it does today, whereas Cooked inspired me (in a positive way) to make changes to how I eat.
0060849827|5.0|GREAT BOOK FOR ANY NATURE PERSON! A GREAT READ & KEEPER! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! GOOD TO KEEP IN GLOVE BOX FOR YOUR NEXT OUTDOOR ADVENTURE!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best series on television!  I started watching season 1 this year and then continued with the following 2 seasons.  I feel as if I really know these characters, and I can't wait for Season 4 in January 2014!  It is also really convenient to be able to watch the episodes right on the computer through the Amazon prime.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game but gets boring after a while and the updates r great but hard to keep up to date
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I watched Season 1 and couldn;t wait to see Season 2. Season 2 has less nudity and is a lot more dynamic than season 1.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great way to get your weather forecast.  I have used other forecast apps., but find this one to be very accurate and easy to understand.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Big fish has Great games, really kept me playing until I finished. So is the sequel out yet????  This game was a blast!
B004TI5N38|5.0|How did I miss this when it first came out?  I didn't learn about it until after I read The Forgotten.  Then I had to go back and read the first of the series with John Puller.  Love the character and the adventure!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best game I've played on my kindle ever.  Looking forward to more from fireproof games. Hopefully in the same genre for all us die hard adventure fans.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Like so many other accounts of these types of experiences, including my own.  they all are alike in so many ways, and also confirm my own profound (I think) dreams.  I like the messages when we &#34;get there&#34;, of &#34;you can do nothing wrong&#34;, &#34;you are loved&#34; etc.  It is so hopeful for our little fragile souls; we all need something wonderful to hope for for ourselves.  I liked all aspects of the story and his writing style, and I believe it having heard and read similar accounts from a few other people, and also the scientific accounting of these stories globally.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The story line and writing are so much better than 50 Shades. I am just sorry I have to wait a month for the 3rd installment. Read the first two in two days.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book grabbed me immediately, I couldnt stop reading it once  I started it.  It really made you think, and wonder how you would react if you were Jacob's parent.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I stopped it after 20 minutes.  Too frustrating to watch, ridiculous situations and language.  Maybe some adults will enjoy this.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Lots of action, intrigue and yes adventure.  Well written fight scenes and descriptive scenes.  You will enjoy this book and its story.

014312336X|5.0|Having lived in China for many years, an interest in history especially Chinese history, and an avid reader of mysteries, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Midnight in Peking.\\" The author tells the true story of the murder of a 19-year-old British woman in Beijing in 1937 and the incompetent police investigation of the murder and then more competent investigation by her father. French 's writing is very vivid. I felt that I was in 1937 Beijing while reading it. I hope that he writes more books like this. My only complaint is with the Kindle edition. The photographs should be at the beginning of the book and there should be a map included at the beginning so you can get a sense of where things are while you read. I did go to the website afterwards only because another reviewer had mentioned it in their review. The website has a map and a great audio tour of the key places in the book.

B003O86FMW|2.0|Despite my friends warnings I wanted to read what happens after the hunger games, since I loved the first book. The second book is a flop. Seems like the author just phoned it in. Take the same characters, send them back to the same games and add in more media and costuming fluff & voila you have the second book! Totally lame. Just because this book is for teens or categorized as &#34;young adult&#34; does not mean that it should be a watered down plot. Try harder Suzanne, you are a writer, are you not?

B0067QPVJ6|1.0|I have been a huge movie fan for over fifty-five years, and it seems to me that the more recent a film, the worse it will be.  The prequel to John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is a perfect example.  I'll start off by saying that I wasn't impressed with Carpenter's film.  Just another 'spam in a can' flick.  But this!  The dialogue is insulting to the cast.  The special effects have me convinced that nothing in this area has moved forward since 1982.  They looked exactly the same as those used in the Carpenter film. The entire cast was boring.  No emotions, nothing to like about them; I reached a point about thirty minutes in that the only reason I would stay with the film was to watch everyone die.  And because this story has already been done to death, there is absolutely NO suspense.  Nothing ever had me wondering what would happen next.  The film is sleep-inducing.  And why is everything so dark?  Most of the time it's impossible to tell what's happening because you can't see anything.  What was the director hiding in the dark?  Evidently not much.  And all of the subtitles were very distracting.  This is the type of film that is only hurt by subtitles, although at least white subtitles against a constantly black background are at least easy to read.  This movie bites.  I'll take the Howard Hawk's version every time.  103 minutes of your life you won't be getting back.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|WATCH THIS SHOW. JUST DO IT. NOW. Okay, now that that's out of the way: Hannibal is a brilliantly shot, gorgeously scripted, disturbingly intriguing, show. The lead actors are brilliant and delectable, as is the show.<br />How can a show about a cannibal be beautiful, you ask? Talent. Mads Mikkelsen is a convincing psychopath and a convincing therapist and a convincing friend. The show revolves around the relationship between Hannibal (Mikkelsen) and Will Graham (Hugh Dancy). Dancy makes an intriguing (and similarly convincing) socially inept empath, assisting the FBI in hunting down the Chesapeake Ripper (and other difficult criminals). Their relationship develops throughout the season.<br />In conclusion, THIS SHOW IS THE BEST. WATCH IT NOW.

0345803507|1.0|Oh my. I normally read a book or two a week. It took me over three months to read this series and that's three months of my life I'll never get back. I still don't know why I subjected myself to that kind of torture. Maybe I'll visit my Red Room of Pain/Pleasure and try to figure it out.<br /><br />Gasp. I have never hated two characters as much as Ana and Christian. I wanted them both to die. I got my hopes up but alas, it never happened. In fact, they were both in danger for about 2.3 seconds and then it was over. Nothing to see here, folks.<br /><br />I'm smiling shyly as I write this. And having a good stiff drink. Or three.
1451695195|5.0|This book gave an extremely detailed account of both sides of Dr. Alexander's near-death experience, his and his physicians/family.  For those who already believe in the hereafter, this will give you new things to think about as well as affirm the things you already believe.  For those who don't necessarily have any beliefs, you will find it interesting and possibly eye-opening.  This book doesn't shove religion down your throat at all, but simply describes the author's experience.  I think any person from any part of the world would find this book worth the read.<br /><br />From me to Dr. Alexander, thank you, sir, for this book.  It is as close to perfect as anything I have ever read on this subject--which, I believe, is the most important subject of all.

As one of the stops on her Farewell Tour, this was a great moment in time; she performs a wide range of her songs from the beginnings with Sonny to her latest releases and touches her entire career, including her movie performances (which also garnered her an Academy Award).  She looks amazing in the myriad of costumes that she uses, the dancers are excellent and her voice is as strong as ever.  It's a sad day to see her retire from live performances.

B00863DOL0|3.0|This is a nice Blackmore's Night concert DVD, but it is not great.  It mostly contains material from Secret Voyage and Autumn Sky, which is good.  However, it does not have the extra material that Castles & Dreams has.  It just has the concert and a brief video showing the city of York.  All of the songs are good, but they could have left off the last one: First of May.  It just is not up to the quality of the other songs and does not sound like a Blackmore's Night song.  There were also some times I had difficulty hearing what Candice was saying.  In addition, there is a visit by 'Lady Gaga' which is rather tacky.

B0002JP4L4|2.0|The volume on this edition is very low, unlike other editions I've heard.  The opening screen & the special features are loud, but not the movie itself.  But you will enjoy the special features.  The first two features, the commentaries are boring, but the following three commentaries are entertaining and informative.  I didn't know that neither Ren or Willard couldn't dance before making the movie--still find it hard to believe.  Didn't know that Ren's haircut cost $1,400 and his barber cut his hair with his eyes closed to give it a wild look.  I just wish the movie had the same quality as its features.

B007ME5BUG|2.0|I suppose an afficianado of strategy would be fascinated with this book, but It bored me. There is little of the human in this history, few of the stories that make history real. Instead it's a litany of which officer moved moved which troops where for what reason. On and on and on. It's history of strategy without the people.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|My husband and I are both fans of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, but I feared my husband would not want to see this video as he is not a Tom Cruise fan (why, I don't understand).  But he loved every minute of this movie, as much as I did.  Great plot and lots of action without being so action filled that it becomes trite.  Everyone I personally know who has seen this movie considers it  &#34;Don't Miss.&#34;<br /><br />Note:  Be sure to watch out for Lee Child himself, who makes a cameo appearance.  Despite being familiar with his face from the back covers of his books, we both missed it until we saw the credits rolling.  Once we back-scrolled and found him, we were amazed he didn't see him the first time; but sometimes we fail to see what we're not expecting to see.
B003XT603Q|3.0|I loved Haruki Murakami's book, 1Q84, for being a creative story with mystical and science fictional aspects.  Norwegian Wood was a pleasant book to read, but the events described were sort of ordinary and routine despite the many suicides.  Characters seemed to be sleepwalking through the book.  In Japan do they really just say, &#34;How about doing it with me&#34;?  That bit of dialogue just seemed off.

193700788X|3.0|Where to start? I guess I should say I didn't read the 11th book in the series. Not because I didn't want to, but I just completely missed it. I'd forgotten about it and when I had the urge to know what happened to my favorite waitress and vampire I found this one and assumed it was next in line.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't feel like I missed much. I was recapped nicely.<br /><br />And I expected so much more.<br /><br />I'm at a loss. I expected so much more from the characters I have loved for so long that reading this book made me wonder if I ever really knew them at all.<br /><br />There is a quaintness that Harris brings into these books that make me feel as if I were there with Sookie as she cooks, or hosts or goes by doing mundane things that keep her life moving. I actually enjoy those paragraphs. It brings the south alive. And to a west coast girl, it's nice to read of places I've never been to or people I've never met. But as I neared the half mark in the book and nothing had really happened, I wanted less mundane and more action.<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br /><br />First and foremost, what happened to ERIC??? Where is that beautiful, powerful Viking who loved Sookie with fierceness that was so radiant it burned my skin through the pages? The Eric I knew wouldn't give up so easily to slavery, no matter how advantageous the `marriage'. And maybe I missed this answer in the last book, but why does Queen whatever-her-name-is want Eric so badly? Wasn't Sookie's ability one of the main reason vampires were so interested in Bill and Eric? And now he gives her up so easily, so uncharacteristically. I honestly thought it was a ploy to keep us readers depressed, building up the grand finale when the valiant Viking would arrive and save the day, or find a loophole, or kill everyone but he would still be ERIC. Not a washed out, scared puppy who came when called. And now we find out that Eric, though a vampire who always said he loved Sookie as much as he was ableto, had his own agenda when helping her. And even at the very end, when he's helped her more than even Sam could, it was just to show Queen whatever-her-name-is that he's loyal. Not to show his undying love, not as forgiveness, not even as a goodbye. It made me angry to see him so reduced. It broke my heart.<br /><br />Sookie is not Sookie. She is a bitter, heartless blonde who considers sleeping with Bill as revenge. She's the girl who goes from loving a vampire with so much fervor it produced multiple books, to the girl who doesn't even cry when it's over. Because she wants to be a safe driver, tearless. Because when she arrives home she has to be a host, tearless. So many excuses for the lack of emotion. I wanted to feel her pain; wanted to feel the complete devastation one feels when a relationship is over. I wanted real, raw emotion and to hell with being safe, to hell with her visitors, to hell with everything because the one person you love has just left you. And even as you strain to see through your tears as you drive home you cry, you weep, you pour your soul from your eyes because you can't help it, can't control it. But all I got was nothing.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed with Sam in this one. He ignores her even though she risked everything to save his life. They've been friends forever, and I always knew Sam was in love with Sookie, but I never thought Sookie loved Sam. Then bam, she's newly single and she jumps on Sam like if she hadn't just broken up with the man--the vampire--she was in love with. I would've much preferred her with Quinn, or Alcide. After proper mourning time, of course.<br /><br />The cluviel dor saves Sam and brings them together. Erics' blood saved Sookie and also brought them together, yet she expressed doubt of her love towards him, thinking the blood could be the cause. With the cluviel dor, she decides not to dwell in the possibility of the effects it has on her, or her feelings for Sam. It's inconsistent and irrational.<br /><br />The whole Arlene/Copley/Claude/Newlin mystery was like a slap on the face. Just add magic and everything is possible. No need to follow rules or anything worth a challenge. I found out more about Alcee Beck than I ever cared to. To quote (loosely) another reviewer, why would Copley Carmichael wish for a wish with a wish? He didn't need the cluviel dor, he had a wish. A devil owed him. The whole mystery could've been completely avoided. Made no sense, but it did help to bring the whole gang of friends acquired throughout. And where were the vampires? We only saw Eric/Bill/Pam three times, if that.<br /><br />I truly could go on and on about my disappointment and heartache this book produced in me, but it would be futile. In the end it was always Harris' decision to make, her story to write, and though it hurt, I respect that. There were parts of the book I loved and many I hated, but I'm glad I read it for myself--even if it was just to find out the ending to a series I loved.

B00CTT9646|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! You have been warned!!!<br /><br />Others have detailed the plot specifics so I will go with my own perspective as a lifelong Star Trek fan who started watching TOS in syndicated rerun in the mid-70's. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is my favorite Star Trek movie by far and it is in my list of the Top 10 films of all-time. So I was a bit concerned when I read the rumors on the Internet that Cumberbatch was going to reprise this iconic Science Fiction role in Star Trek: Into Darkness. I felt that JJ & company needed to do something different since they had created an alternate timeline with the first movie. I think the writing team had given lots of thought of parallel universes and how certain points and people are fixed in time in all possible universes. The work they did on Fringe pushed them to do several seasons worth of story about an alternate universe. Peter was their fixed person in the Fringe universe who impacted both realities. The writers looked at Khan the same way. I had to think about the plot threads of terrorism, betrayal, security, revenge, optimism, family and trust that were weaved through Into Darkness after seeing it Wednesday night. I then read the novelization and the prequel graphic novel to gain a better perspective before I went and watched the movie again today.<br /><br />The main themes hit by this story are many such as Kirk being too young, impetuous, inexperienced, undisciplined, egotistical, etc., to command a starship effectively; Spock still suffering emotionally from the traumatic loss of his home-world and his mother while trying to connect with his erratic, emotional, impulsive Captain; Starfleet Command reacting badly to the devastating terror attack by Nero against Vulcan and Starfleet in the previous film causing Starfleet Command to turn to extraordinary extra-legal actions to bring security to the Federation despite undermining the very freedoms and ethics espoused by the Federation (Section 31); Scotty being the one crew member (besides Spock) willing to take a moral stand with Kirk over crossing the line of legality and ethics while Kirk & Starfleet are preoccupied with revenge against Khan.<br /><br />So to me this wasn't a rehash of Wrath of Khan because that story was about coming to terms with growing older and feeling that life had passed you by. Kirk's past comes back to haunt him and the Enterprise and Kirk finally had to face his own Kobyashi Maru test with Spock's sacrifice. Khan was motivated by his need for vengeance against Kirk over the loss of his wife and being left marooned on a doomed planet. This too was an issue from Khan's past he could not let go and it was his undoing. ST:ID is about surviving the viccitudes of youth and learning from your mistakes to mature into a better sentient being connected to your friends and society. Kirk had Pike to place his faith and trust in him even when Kirk had royally screwed up from the hubris of flagrantly violating the Prime Directive on Nibiru even as Kirk failed to recognize this error. It took Pike's death and the pursuit of Khan to bring Kirk to the realization that he had to change his worldview and behavior.<br /><br />Spock was struggling with his inner demons over the loss of Vulcan and his mother. He also made a personal journey of self-discovery in ST:ID especially after Kirk sacrificed himself to save the ship. Spock is filled with rage and pursues Khan with a fury never seen before. He helps save his friend Jim Kirk and he can now acknowledge this friendship and let it evolve.<br /><br />Starfleet Command reacted like the US did after 9/11. They undermined their own principles in the name of imagined security. Admiral Marcus had sent out ships looking for resources to help Starfleet defend the Federation and they found the Botany Bay. Admiral Marcus thought he could exploit Khan's genetically engineered superior intellect and his capacity for violence to give the clandestine Section 31 (think CIA/Homeland Security/Special Forces) an advantage in building a capacity to take on the biggest perceived threat to the Federation for Admiral Marcus... the Klingon Empire. Thus you get the top-secret special prototype photon torpedoes and the built for combat USS Vengeance along with who knows what else that didn't get mentioned. You get incidents manipulated to provoke a state of war with the Klingons. All justified in the name of security.<br /><br />Scotty was just awesome in this story. He was a moral compass while getting in on the action with the sabotage of the USS Vengeance. He also got some more great comedic scenes and lines. I was a bit disappointed that Bones didn't get more involved in this story but since it involved more technological issues I can see why Scotty was used rather than McCoy. Bones still got in some great metaphors and scenes and you know he can deliver Gorn babies in a crisis situation. Sulu gets a taste of the command chair and Checkov gets to flex his savant genius abilities as Scotty's replacement (temporarily) as Chief Engineer. Uhura has some issues with Spock, talks up some Klingons, battles some Klingons & makes some tough long distance calls. Getting a young Carol Marcus was cool and they didn't force her to be romantically involved with Kirk, She gets to join the crew and maybe they will hook up in the next installment. The Big E gets a refit to repair her battle damage and the crew of the USS Enterprise embark on the start of what should be an eventful, glorious and historic Five-Year Mission to Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before.<br /><br />So I give Into Darkness a 9.235 out of 10. My biggest issue was with how long it took to warp to Kronos and then back to Earth. Unless warp speed had improved by a factor of 100 over the old Star Trek this was a plot device that was just way out of step with the rest of the movie. So other than that I am cool with the rest of the film elements as they were explained by the prequel graphic novel and in the novelization book for the film. I look forward to Star Trek 3 to come out in May of 2016 to be a part of the celebration of the 50th Anniversary of Star Trek!!!<br /><br />**************DVD Release Addendum*************<br />I was really excited about the Blu-ray release of Into Darkness. I had read about the multitude of extras that JJ Abrams and his team shot for inclusion with the Blu-ray that would be exciting for the fans. Apparently the good folks in the marketing department at Paramount took a look at this treasure of bonus material and saw a way to extort the fans for even more profit. They struck deals to parcel out these bonus features to different retailers forcing fans to buy a plethora of copies to collect all of the bonus features. I didn't cancel my order because this isn't Amazon's fault and I do want the awesome phaser. I won't be buying these extra copies to line Paramount's pockets full of gold-pressed latinum. Actually, if Paramount had an ounce of integrity they would make a public apology for trying to screw over the fans of Star Trek who have made them profits that would make a Ferengi blush and offer a Blu-ray disc with the bonus material to make up for this error in judgement.<br /><br />The website Digital Bits is where I was alerted to this shameful avarice. It stated the following: \\"Yes... the seven featurettes listed in the press release are basically everything you get on the disc, aside from the usual DVD copy, Digital Copy, UltraViolet copy, Xerox copy and what not.

It's a terrible way to treat your consumers, who are sometimes spending $30 or more for a Blu-ray, expecting to get a little genuine value for their money.  And no, six different versions of the exact same movie isn't value.

B000HKYBXA|5.0|This is an excellent presentation of the play. Given how rich Shakespeare is with the dialog, it's easy to follow the action with or without the visuals.  Branagh knows this play inside and out, and his supporting cast does an excellent job. I also love the commentary between Branagh and Shakespeare expert Russel Jackson. It's insightful, funny, and informative. If you're taking a literature course at school, or if you're teaching one, get this one for your video library.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|Good reference book and am using it to brush up on my HTML<br />and getting into HTML5.  Great help this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Short and sweet. Can't wait for the next one! Good puzzles and fun interface, plus a very intriguing back story told through found clues.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Tgis series is by far the most suspenseful interesting and thick with plot........a must watch for anyone young or old
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Loved this book and the whole series forever and will be always my favorite of all other series always always.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Awesome book!  Even better than the mistborn trilogy. Sanderson is clearly a top notch writer, and this series is my favorite of all his books already.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I read Percy Jackson the Olympians and this series will be just as good. I also read the hunger games, and that series is like nothing compared to this!! It's definetly a must read!!!!
0345505387|2.0|I was disappointed with much of the Exile. The story had elements that were unfamiliar, and the characters didn't look the way I had imagined they would. Everyone has their own opinion, of course, and most of the reviews posted here are positive. To each his own. I've only read/looked at my copy once and haven't picked it up again. I love all of the Outlander books and have read each of them over and over. It was only the Exile that fell flat for me.
B000SZK41M|5.0|really like this one - had the VHS but no more VCR.  this whole series is good, even the newer ones.
B001HN69AY|2.0|One of the strangest, weirdest movies I've ever seen. How did the very fine actor Heath Ledger come to lend himself to this??? What a disappointment.
B002XBVQKW|4.0|I really enjoy this movie but could do without the music. it's a crazy story - Steve Martin as the dentist is just perfect.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I started playing after I downloaded several games to check out. I didn't even make it to the other games now that I found this little sleeper game from Europe. I guess they have no fear of sharks like we do in the States. Well, this bloak will stay out of the ocean if the shark had my fiendish taste for blood. The screaming! The blood! Swallowing divers whole. What is there to hare? Gotta run...I am up to the hammerhead and can't wait to terrorize the shores. Give it a swim, jolly fellow.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Julianna Margulies had an enticing character in ER for years, but her Alicia Florrick character in The Good Wife is her crowning jewel to date.  Her amazing presence on the camera is awe inspiring.  Just when you think you know what she will do, her character takes another turn and you believe.  Margulies also has a captivating ability to allow the other characters who work with her in her scenes to become part and parcel of her commanding character.  Strong actors and actresses such as Archie Panjabi as Kalina Sharma and Matt Czuchry as Cary Agos develop and add greater and greater credibility to the show by keenly participating in the belief system that drives The Good Wife.  The periodic characters are exceptional & solidify the show with a complete fabric of life.  When originally aired, my question was,&#34; What's the GOOD Wife?&#34;  Now I respond by, &#34;I believe The Good Wife.&#34;  Embarrassingly enough, I watch The Good Wife episodes over and over again.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Everyone in my family loves this game, including myself, my husband,  and two daughters that are seven and four years old.
B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|Modern science is proving that most of the world's religions have no more evidence supporting them than iron-age stupidstitions... I mean superstitions. This movie attempts to replace those stupidstitions with Tom Hanks' or Hollywood's version of a basis for morality. Hollywood knows that capitalistic Americans are too selfish to sacrifice themselves for the good of others, so they put forth this retarded blend of reincarnation and karma, and interconnectivity throughout the ages to suggest that if you make sacrifices now, your later lives may be better. This they summarize with the line \\"And by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future.\\"  Now this line may have a lot of truth to it, but the idiotic idea that our future extends into reincarnated lifetimes has no evidence behind it. It's just a hollywood fantasy. Just like it's a hollywood wet dream that a bunch of almost stone-age, tribal people living in huts will make their escape from a dying planet on the spaceships of a more advanced people. No, if we are ever going to escape our planet when it's dying, it will only be if we respect scientists, and learning, and knowledge above would-be pimp rap stars, and basketball players, child raping football heros, and or bible thumping televangelists. It will not be on the spaceships of a more advanced people. Why on earth would they want us along... except for the outside chance they are so genetically modified, they need wild-type genes to mix with their own to survive... but that hardly seems like a reliable escape plan.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|the game is excellent but the reviewers have sentence fragments and unreal words, such as Eva, I mean that one is a character from the movie wall-e oh and if you are wondering how this review managed to get posted, just look at the other reviews, they have little to no detail about the game
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This fad came and went so fast.  I prefer the Where's my Water app.  More thinking.  The best part is leaving a required number of words in the description, like an essay or something.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its a wonderful game but with so little levels (relatively speaking) that I issue you a challenge, beat all the levels first with your fingers, then restart the game and use your nose, after you win that use your feet to play, there is another way to do it, but if you have no case, licking your screen is a bad idea. there is my challenge to you! don't be discouraged I have beaten the game with my nose and am roughly halfway through with my feet (I also beat episode one with my tongue)
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Girls play it every now and again.  Other than that nothing special.  The best part is leaving a required number of words in the description, like an essay or something.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I kinda like this game and I kind of dont. I dont because the guy doesnt jump when I slide up, and he falls. And he wont turn when I flip my tablet to the side....
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Kids like this, but they need to be a bit older.  The best part is leaving a required number of words in the description, like an essay or something.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm 11 and olive this game it takes lots of fast movements to win totaly made my reflexes better so now when my sister triess to sneak attack me I'm ready! :)
B005HSL626|5.0|Kids and I love this.  We even played it at a local game restraunt.  More fun with two players, but my phone is way too small.  The best part is leaving a required number of words in the description, like an essay or something.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Absolutely love,love,love this movie....it is a wonderful story and has a beautiful ending.  Amazing that a young child can be so smart and the parents so clueless as to the well being of their own child.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|At the end ot &#34;The Forgotten&#34; were three chapters of &#34;The Hit&#34;. I purchased, but haven't yet read &#34;The Hit&#34; when I saw the previous novel &#34;The Innocent&#34;.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed it also and look forward to reading &#34;The Hit&#34;
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|it was preetty good but its just like every other game and I mean every single one it has the pearls every game like this has that same thing where u get farther into the game and to get past the quest u have to buy pearls same old thing and also a small child trap
B0058W74UY|1.0|I am very disappointed. This app will not work on my kindle fire. Some you tube videos require latest version.
B000JIHP88|5.0|It is so cute. My 2 month old grandson loves it. I have also purchased several more Rain Forest items. Very well pleased
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The show is very well done but it is extremely violent and graphic,  Acting is very good and Michael Chiklis is excellent.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|I have actually purchased this game and I had a good time playing it but once I exit the game I can never get back into it.  I have the kindle fire HD 7 and didn't think I would have a problem with it because usually it works with everything I download.  I have only got as far as the third chapter and because I end up going home to use my kindle for reading I can't get back into it unless I start a new profile.  DO not purchase unless you have the time to play the game from start to finish in one sitting.
B000HF6XKO|4.0|There's no mystery about how the world revolves around since the beginning of commerce. Money has different levels for each and every one of us, some people just want more, but that's not the end of line. Power ... is a different beast, the wildest, the men thinks he can tame that beast, that's just an illusion. This pictures, evokes what really happens when people tries to do something good, intentions most of the times are enough, sometimes you need an army behind you.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great script and great acting by all, especially tommy lee jones and Daniel day Lewis! I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00932A4XE|3.0|I would never rent it again, or buy it. It runs to long and didn't keep my interest but I watched till end.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|Definitely action packed movie. One of the best action movies I have see in the last 3 years. Would highly recommend!
1595828095|5.0|My first exposure to Bernie Wrightsons' phenomenal artwork was in Stephen Kings' \\"Cycle of the Werewolf\\" novel when I was a youngster. From that point on I was hooked.  The man is a bona fide master of the macabre & this book really showcases the versatility and the tremendous depth of his talent.  Nobody but Bernie Wrightson can make a rotting corpse \\"beautiful\\" or a slavering, gore-soaked werewolf \\"graceful\\". If you are a fan of old school comic book art or classic \\"Tales From The Crypt\\" type horror stories , you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this book. You get a wide variety of amazing Creepy stories complete with a cover illustration gallery and the whole nine yards.  The art is exquisite and will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that NOBODY ever has nor ever will be his equal in the realm of horror illustration. If the preceding recommendations haven't convinced you, then allow me to tell you that several years ago I actually had the honor of meeting Mr. Wrightson at a comic convention. He was one of the most gracious and humble professional artists that I've ever met and he earned a lifelong fan for taking the time to talk to and encourage a young fan and wannabe horror artist to keep on practicing and to never give up. I haven't made it big yet, but I haven't stopped practicing and I'll never give up. Thanks for being a class act Mr. Wrightson.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|I thought I loved this movie for the first hour. it was mesmerizing and horrific, but eventually the weak performances and ridiculous ending tanked the film.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Loved it,loved it,loved it.  Buy,buy,buy,buy it!  I listen to it everyday!  I am going to give it as a no particular reason gift to all my friends.
B008602KQI|4.0|It was a very good movie the directing was very well done the actors did a good job and the movie it's self was well done.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh always delivers on everyone of his albums. I listen to this album three times a week. He is truly gifted.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is very eye catching! My son enjoy it a lot. I like because it teaches proportions and calculus, and train the brain how to solve situations. Only thing I don't agree it has to do with destruction and pay back.
B006CHML4I|3.0|gains about twenty to thirty seconds a day, and the only drawback is not being able to stop the second hand when resetting the time.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I like to be in touch with the world. To know the headlines and its contents, it's essential to be informed and it will be a suitable way to practice my English from my table.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|Outstanding cast and even greater story line makes this a must see/have movie classic!!!  You are going to love every minute of this great one!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Taking out the aggression scenario, it is okay as an entertaining game. It keeps you alert and focused. Well adapted to my table.
B00COGY2P2|1.0|Horrible writing, not a lot of action. Some of the worst one liners ever. Huge fan of Mission Impossible and Tom Cruise, this definitely was a disappointment.
B005PK56TA|5.0|What a show!  With the twists and turns of a theme park ride this show hits them all.  Dante's Inferno touched many nerves, some we did not want to admit that we could possibly inhabit.  Well this AHS season has well surpassed the Inferno on every level,  I truly look forward to the coming seasons!  Will I be crazy?  Will I be a sexual addict?  Will I kill many victims?  Only the next season can answer these questions, I am eagerly waiting!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I always love Michael Connelly's novels.  They are well plotted page-turners.  The repeat characters make it easier to follow the story line for an old brain like mine.  I feel like they are real people.  I recommend Michael Connelly books for anyone.
0446580848|5.0|a page turner, gave it to my brother to read on his vacation and he liked it too; informative about Yemen and our CIA
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Smooth and fun puzzles. Each unique and can't wait to solve the next one. Great game. A favorite for sure.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Had a hard time putting the book down.  Characters are compelling. I keep  wanting more and wondering what will happen next.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Not looking for anything mor than to receive and send e-mail... Don't  canre about what s happening on FB or anyother media
1878424319|3.0|In my opinion this book was very strange... it was vague and said what people should do but no real ideas for how to actually do it. It was really religious for people that aren't. And it was just kind of ridiculous at times. Like when he said that if you tell someone they look like they have cancer they'll get cancer within the next year? I just couldn't take anything he said seriously after that. It had good ideas and i guess i understand the high reviews but i just disagree
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this calculator because the numbers are as big as the screen!!  That makes it easy to see and calculate.  And it was a free app.  I'm not using it for school but for basic everyday needs.  Great App!
B003WUYOQ6|3.0|Lots of information about dieting going back to 1898. Seem like he favors an Atkinson type diet with limited carbs/sugars instead of calorie counting or extreme exercise to lose weight.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really like playing this game online, so to have it as an app is great; the hotness is that you can play it quicker that online due to having the touch screen rather than clicking with the mouse.  Higher scores!!  Yippee.
B009IF8CH6|2.0|Same jokes over and over.  Feels like I've heard them all before.  Kind of like a greatest hits album, just feels tired.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Everytime I open this app it either completely locks up my kindle or it causes a force close to happen since the latest update.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|I liked it. It's very popular. I do get the new season on HBO. Everyone will love this! Another good job from HBO!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|An interesting approach to deliver a message 'never give up.' Somehow,some way the worst of times can be overcome through faith and love.
B0072OFM28|5.0|The show keeps you on the edge of your seat. I like Liam Mcintyre. But, I loved Andy Whitfield in the first season.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|its like a mix between Indiana Jones and Nancy drew... it was absolutely amazing and I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a good mystery
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|it's a shame that Hannibal isn't finding the audience that got duped by &#34;The Following&#34; on the rival Fox network because it is the show that actually delivers the goods. Better by far than all but a couple of the movies, this series is so disturbing that it's hard to believe that it's on network television. From the impeccable casting, to the overall quality, to the unsettling knowledge of what exactly the good doctor is feeding to his dinner guests, it respects its audience's intelligence, a rare thing on network tv. If you haven't tried it yet, give it a shot. you can thank me later.
B009GX6600|5.0|The writers took the winning cast of ncis and started to utilize longer story Lines. Th cast is still great. If you liked ncis before, then this will be very enjoyable  for you
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good very detailed and helped me learn a lot. Very well in teaching better vocabulary to any person of any age.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Great game i got on sale for 1 buck but if i had to pay full price i wouldnt like thay much but still a grewt game for a tablet i would recomend it to anyone who liked batman arkham city very similar in gameplay
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is a great mouse, had a G5 and like this one much better. Very accurate and feels great in my hand.Was hoping to get another G5 since mine had the cord puled but the prices and the fact that it was  discontinued forced me to look for a differnt mouse, glad I did. Great buy great service and price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|just like minecraft pc editon but back at 1.8 beta love it tottaly worth it and its on sale atm for only $3.99 so its great deal
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Arnold did a great job in this action movie as well as his co-stars. I love the chase scene with the Corvette and Camaro. Go Chevy! The fight scene at the end was really good and realistic. I have to add this to my collection!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie I and my family can watch over and over and it never gets old. We love it and highly recommend it to every family with small children.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Most enthusiasts have their own favorites of Miyazaki's work, but it seems that Nausicaa must be included among his best. The sheer creativity and imagination of this story is a delight. Although it can feel long in places, there's plenty of superb animation to keep you interested. Epic in scope, and employing a fascinating setting and cast of characters, the story is sure to entertain and take you on an enjoyable ride with Nausicaa through the winds.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I enjoy the easy graphics and the sound effects. Would actually like some soothing background music to accompany the soothing graphics, but really no complaints.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game. a bit boring in some spots but mostly good. I would definwtly reccomend this game for kids for sure
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love role playing games. Dungeon Hunter 4 is one of the best i have found. The graphics for the game are fantastic for the kindle fire. I just started to play it last night. So far it is fantastic.
B006LR0XLM|4.0|I like that I can store my pictures, make albums, share which<br />ones I want also that it is on all of my devices
B007J4T2G8|1.0|At the beginning of the book we are told that the extremely successful mega-industrialist tycoon CEO ... (forgotten his name already) ... is also a very busy man, so if the interview a colleger grad has arranged with him for the college newspaper then is missed (she is down with flu) it would be half a year or so that she could reschedule it. Her roommate agrees to take the interview and what follows henceforth is not a single page when Mr CEO does not perform sex on the roommate. He has recognized a soul-mate of sorts in her, you see. This novel seeks to overwhelm the reader with sex, showing no respect whatsoever to logic. Both the main characters are extremely annoying and there are way too many plot points in the book that are left unexplained. I read it till the end to understand why so many people bought it. Sex, it seems was the reason. Even with that (for me) the charm (?) was gone midway and I found myself jumping paragraphs.<br />Bad.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|this game is lots of fast fun. I would give it more then 5 stars if I could. I play this game all the time. it's worth downloading.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|This was one of the best films I've seen in a while. It started off with several unrelated events except for an interesting birth mark. All characters and relationships are tied nicely together as the movie progresses. It's a long movie that keeps your attention and leaving wishing for more. great work!
B004AM5QT4|4.0|I liked the plot,  it was quite believable, the characters were very well fleshed-out.  The love interest had an interesting twist.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This series is so well written that other books seem shallow. Rothfuss creates such a multiple layered world I am amazed every time it transitions from place to place and culture to culture. I really can't wait until his next book comes out.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|This was one of your favorite series but with the romance of the main characters has devolved with their sleeping together. This degrades family values and promote promiscuousness with teens and young adults.
B000ID1IYG|5.0|I just love this movie! It is so amazingly cheesy, but still manages to be funny and cute! It is very hard to find for a decent price tho
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Just got my CD today and there are NO missing tracks. Great album. I am very pleased with my purchase.
031237593X|4.0|I consider myself to be a bit of a student in the area of Richard III.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this story and honestly believe that what happened in this book could very well be what happened in the real life if this much maligned English monarch.<br /><br />On top of that, it was a wonderful action adventure romance!<br /><br />I've taken off one star simply because of the way the author wrote the dialogue.  It felt like every time someone was speaking the rhythm of each character was the same as another character.  It was hard to differentiate who was speaking because they all sounded the same. From the noblest king to the lowly minion. Also much of the dialogue had this strange overuse of the coma. Using a coma where the word \\"and\\" should be is all well and good but this was simply overused to the point of frustration.
B00127RAJY|5.0|OMGoodness.......i love love love these workouts.  I'm waiting for her to come out with a Hula Hoop and instructional video!!!
0062127241|5.0|Ok so, full disclosure; I love The Who.<br /><br />That said, I love this book. It gives a keen insight into the genius that is Pete Townshend.<br /><br />He comes across as honest and almost apologetic for his life of stardom and indulgence. His love of music and art. As well as his love, respect and frustrations of his fellow band members.<br /><br />I've heard many give comments on his thoughts on Mick Jagger however this has simply gotten too much press as being sensational. This book is so much more. It's charming and sophisticated.<br /><br />Even if your a casual fan of this genre you'll get something from this man's prospective.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|On the recommendation of friends, I watched Lark Rise to Candleford. I LOVE it. It is a beautifully filmed show with wonderful cast and sweet stories that touch my heart.<br />I watched Downton Abbey first and liked it very much but I think I love this even more. I especially like Brendon Coyle's role in Lark Rise more than his role as Mr. Bates.<br />I also really like Laura, Dorcas and Emma. And who could not like Twister, Queenie and Thomas Brown.....<br />I will be sad when I've watched all the seasons and it comes to an end but will most likely begin again. :)
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am sad that this series is over but I enjoyed reading the last book and am happy with outcome, it ended the way I expected it would.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've read ALOT of books by many different  authors . SOMETHING about this  one I loved . The way the author is able to describe the events and people so vividly it feels like you're really there. Other readers agreed you can't really explain this story to someone else without spoiling it for them to read. I will keep he  on my list of authors going forward. What a lovely surprise to find Gillian Flynn. Keep up the excellent work.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Lincoln did it...Michael Jordan did it...Mark Cuban did it...they all failed and ultimately proved everyone wrong.<br /><br />Great insight into the commitment to the business of business.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app is ok, but it's not as nice as the feel on a PC.  I have a kindle HD 8.9, and I know the look/feel can be better than it is, given the size of my device.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The costumes, intrique, scandalous court living....just amazing! This is my 3rd time watching the entire series from the beginning and I always learn something new each time. I couldn't wait to get home from work to watch it every week. Very well done!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son loves his monkey Wubbanub. Everyone comments about it, but mostly he can easily find it in his crib or diaper bag.  A great purchase.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Watched the first episode on an impulse and quickly became hooked!  It reminds me of 'A Little House on the Prairie' set in Victorian England.  Great interesting characters and beautiful scenery.
B00CTT9646|2.0|This review contains spoilers...<br /><br />I was not keen on the 'let's reboot Star Trek by rewriting the past', but a friend took me to see the reboot and I enjoyed it (despite the weak plot). However, Into Darkness was a huge disappointment.  Lots of people love it; I have to assume they have a 5 minute attention span.<br /><br />I saw this in 3D. Some of the 3D effects look more like sloppy camerawork, like the orange blur partly obscuring Kirk's face in the bar scene. But Abrams seems to think crappy camerawork is a 'style', like his abuse of lens flare that I'll mention later.<br /><br />We start with the Enterprise - a STAR ship - hiding in the sea, while Spock attempts to stop a volcano exploding and destroying the stone age native aliens. This is a case of sloppy writing, we need a quick way for Spock to face death which will be needed later in the movie - sort of. I would like to point out that the transporters won't work in this situation unless there is line of sight with Spock (the transporters regularly won't work in this movie, conveniently). The Enterprise should have been in orbit around the planet, but wasn't because it was important for Kirk to forego the Prime Directive to save Spock. We don't see the aliens again; they're a convenience for later in the movie.<br /><br />Kirk is then demoted for trying to save the aliens, ignoring the Prime Directive AND saving Spock, although I don't know why, as it won't be long before he's captain of the Enterprise again.<br /><br />There's then a long exposition of our bad guy. A member of Starfleet has a sick child that is dying. Our bad guy's blood can save her (I suppose blood types are irrelevant in the future). But in exchange for his daughter's life, this member of STARFLEET will kill himself and dozens of his fellow starfleet personnel. I might possibly go for an ordinary person doing this, but I can't believe a starfleet officer would kill his friends and colleagues and leave his child without a father to save his daughters life.  More sloppy writing to move the story along, and in case you missed something we will be shown again later.<br /><br />There's a meeting of the top brass that our bad guy manages to shoot up, killing admiral Pike and making Kirk captain again.<br /><br />Things do get better for a while as the Enterprise goes off to kill our bad guy, but Spock suggests revenge isn't a good thing. Our bad guy is in Klingon space...we meet the Klingons, capture the bad guy and discover that he's Khan (although regrettably not Ricardo Montalban) who tells us that some folk in Starfleet aren't good guys either.<br /><br />Peter Weller is a great addition to the cast as Admiral Marcus. It seems he wants to start a war with the Klingons. He isn't too pleased to find Kirk hasn't killed Khan and started a war with the Klingons, because he has conveniently built a big, fast, powerful evil looking attack starship. He's going to destroy the Enterprise instead (that had a convenient warp drive malfunction). But wait! The admiral's daughter is on the Enterprise! We have a little on screen exchange between father and daughter. This is where I want to tie up and torture Abrams. The man is positively fetishistic about lens flare. I wonder if it gives him erotic stimulation. The lens flare here is so overdone you can't even see actress Alice Eve's face; the lens flare fills the screen and threatens to blind the audience. The admiral has better transporters by the way.<br /><br />The big bad evil admiral's starship is so advanced it can follow the Enterprise and even fire on it travelling at warp. But Scottie - played by the truly annoying Simon Pegg - is in a convenient position to disable the admiral's ship (don't ask how, thats more embarassingly bad writing). The transporters aren't working again, so we are offered another action sequence as Kirk and Khan jump from ship to ship. Khan gets control of the big bad ship, I seem to recall that the transporters are then suddenly working again so our heroes can be beamed off, Enterprise is damaged in combat and with no engine power is going to burn up as it crashes towards earth. Kirk fixes the engines and dies of the radiation. I guess this is the point where Spock's earlier brush with death is supposed to have been meaningful as he watches Kirk through the glass, as in The Wrath of Khan.  Unfortunately, the homage to 'The Wrath of Khan' is so emotionally weak it's watered down to homeopathic dilution. You can't cook up the friendship Kirk and Spock had in the original series with a few convenient moments.  And unless you were half asleep, you know that Kirk isn't properly dead, because a little while earlier, McCoy had conveniently mentioned that he had injected Khan's blood into a DEAD tribble. It doesn't take an IQ of 200 to guess where this is going.<br /><br />Lots more excitement as the big evil starship crashes into San Francisco, but Khan survives. Oh no, those pesky Enterprie transporters are malfunctioning AGAIN!!!  We can't get a fix on Khan and beam him up, but hey, Spock, we can beam you down!  After a good old fashioned punch up and with the help of Uhura Khan is captured, his blood injected into Kirk, and the galaxy is safe once again.<br /><br />In case you missed it, the movie is supossed to be a message about terrorism. Sorry folks, this movie was BAD. I give it two stars because I've seen worse movies, Karl Urban is in it, and I didn't walk out.
B00CIOLBRW|5.0|One of the best, most complete character development series i have ever seen! The back story is excellent and for once, they got it right! Better story than the actual comic book, WHICH I READ! This is not a \\"comic turn series\\" opinion. I talking all tv period! This is an excellent show! And THANK YOU for including more than one Black character in the series!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Vivid characters that show us so much more than a cookie cutter story about a man and a woman coming to need each other.  Pat and Tiffany are both grieving when family tries to bring them together to heal one another.  This is the story through Pat' s eyes as he is released from a mental institute to the care of his loving mother and emotionally absent father.<br />A journey through mental disease you will not be able to put down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover, you are a clever little cookie! I loved this story. I must admit it was not at all what I thought it would be when I chose to read it though. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I did find it predictable at times, but that doesn't bother me when the story itself, whether predicable or not, is SOOOO GOOOD.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's good but it takes to long to unlock the other characters. But it is still a good game to pass the time.
B009EELBIS|4.0|At first it was transmitting intermittently, then it did freeze, on the third try it was working fine. The sound and picture were great and I hope I will not have any more problems in the future
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|All my friends and family have been playing this game for weeks on their phones. I have a kindle fire and couldn't ever find it in the app store. love this game highly addictive.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|To me it was boring, but again, many of my friends, loved it.. So do not judge the movie by my opinion, watch the trailer and make your own mind.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Really engaging smart drama with good actors. Only have watched 7 shows but really enjoying it. Watch it. You wont regret.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|My sons have the collection and I thought I'd add it to my own.  It takes me back to the days when the movies first came out.  Fun memories.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|The previews makes this seem more action packed than what it is. In some ways, there is a gritty realness to it that is pretty refreshing but that is not what I was expecting so it took me off guard. The storyline is interesting but nothing new. Tom Cruise played the character well. If you have some time to watch it like I did on a lazy Saturday then do so, but it's not going to jazz you up.
B000FC11A6|5.0|I read a lot and I read a lot of different genres. But this guy is so unique, so clever, so gripping, and so fun !!! that you cannot go wrong reading him. He's brilliant. I love him and I loved this book. Try Diamond Age too. The protagonists are women.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I heard part of an interview with the author on the radio a few weeks ago and decided to buy the book.  It is well-researched and makes for an interesting and informative read.  I expected the author to be critical of the food industry, but for the most part he maintains a reasonably balanced perspective.  There are many within the industry who are concerned about the health consequences of the foods they create and sell, but they face economic and consumer acceptance challenges in their efforts to make products healthier.  Well worth the time and effort to read.
B00CFQN12Q|1.0|Just too over the top.  Bruce Willis has that same silly smirk in every movie now.  Worst die-hard to date..
0307887448|5.0|It's the year 2044 and humanity is in trouble.  After using up available fossil fuels and other sources of power, there is now a severe lack of power, food, jobs, and everything else.  People are living in RVs stacked 20+ high with multiple families to a stack.  Most people are using OASIS as their escape, going into the incredibly complex computer world and living much of their lives there.<br /><br />Wade Watts is no different.  A high school senior with deceased parents and no home life to speak of, he has spent most of his life in OASIS so when Halliday, the creator of OASIS, dies a few years back and announces that since he has no heirs his fortune will go to whomever can win his game, Wade figures it's his chance at making it big.  Of course, so does everyone else.<br /><br />It's been 5yrs and many have given up.  Those who haven't are known as gunters and they study everything Halliday every said, did, or loved religiously in the hopes of finding the first key and moving on with the game.  Then there is IOI, the greedy company that has outspent everyone so that they can try to win the game first and control OASIS forever.  But now Wade has found the first key and gotten through the first gate and the game is heating up.  IOI will stop at nothing to win so how can Wade with nothing at his disposal stand a chance or will he just sell out to the big guys?<br /><br />The plot is nothing new.  It's a typical poor trailer trash kid with nothing trying to win the big prize against the big nasty hugely wealthy corporation.  BUT...<br /><br />This is so well done.  The entire book is an homage to the 80s and as a child in the 80s I found the whole thing hilarious.  I was actively laughing and smiling through more than half the book.  It was well-written, you find yourself routing for the good guys and really hating the bad guys, it's fast paced, it's fun, it's everything you want to see in a book like this.  Highly recommended!
0756686970|5.0|Bought this for grandsons on their birthday.  It is a fun book for the boys to look at the characters and compare them to the collection of Legos they have.  They share the interests with their fathers so this is a good bonding activity.
B00C2C637I|5.0|one of my all time favorites to read and read yet again on a dark and stormy night or any other night. turn the lights low (but not too low), curl up w/ a warm beverage and enjoy the carnival.
B0091WD4ZQ|1.0|Based on the high ratings, I expected to really like this, but it was like following two people around all day listening to their conversation. Nothing happened at all, except a lot of talking between two young people who meet on a train, talk a lot, get off the train and walk around Vienna talking a lot, and then go their separate ways. I suppose the dialogue is fairly clever, but I was not at all interested in the characters or what they were saying.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I absolutely hate this app. What seems like such a simple thing on an iPad or iPhone is simply worthless on the Kindle Fire HD. The font used is undersized, pictures are displayed oversized, and he layout in general is miserable. Searching for a friend doesn't give you their page, but hour shared messages. The news feed only shows the horribly determined top stories, and the little button that is supposed to let you change this to most recent doesn't work. The top stories are almost always several days old, and you have to scroll for what seems like forever to find more recent stories.<br /><br />This app has been deleted from my device and from the cloud.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|I have truly enjoyed following these characters for the entire series. The character development was awesome. Our hero, Fitzchivalry Farseer, is at times brave, at times a coward, sometimes wise, sometimes foolish. He has a heart of gold, loves deeply, tries to do the right thing and often ends up messing everything up. Wow, here's a hero I can totally &#34;get&#34;.<br />Dragons, sword fights, telepathic animals, magic, assassins, a love story, fiercely loyal friends...what more could you ask for?
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I AM A MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY LOVER ANYWAY SO ANY MOVIE THAT HE MAKES IS OK WITH ME.  ENTERTAINING WITHOUT TOO MUCH VIOLENCE.  THE KIND OF MOVIE I LIKE.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a great addition to prime time, an intelligent and suspenseful drama. The cast is perfect; the writing superb. It is a bright spot in an otherwise dim and insipid lineup of reality shows.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I am a long time Hardcore Star Trek fan from the Mid-70's. I have to say I loved the new Star Trek Movie 5 Stars. A Great Story, Great Acting, Great CGI. It felt like Star Trek. If you can see it on Imax. Going to see it again Next weekend.<br />Cant wait to dvd coms out.
0688014291|5.0|Worth a read and a reread. I use this in supervisor training and it always goes down well. A quick read but full of valuable insights and thought provoking concepts.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Excellent movie. Highly recommended. Best movie of the year. Don't miss it. Couldn't wait to see it. My daughter also loved it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I read the reviews prior to reading the novel and was surprised to read so many negative ones. Maybe they are a general reflection of the negativity in society but this novel read like all of the other ones: interesting characters, good setting descriptions, and a solid POV throughout. What I think naysayers didn't like is that Sookie didn't end up with Eric, Bill, or Alcide. The naysayers may have forgotten that throughout all the novels, what Sookie really wanted, since childhood, was a normal life. THAT was the point of this novel, that through all the paranormal madness, Sookie survived but suffered. Now, she doesn't need to. Sam is a shapeshifter but that isn't the same as a fairy or a vampire. Happy ending.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|DEFINITELY A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR EITHER YOUNG OR OLD.  TELLS TWO STORIES AT ONCE.  ONE FOR THE EYES AND ONE FOR THE SOUL.
B000AMUU94|5.0|We ordered this collection as a Christmas gift for my step-son's girlfriend.  It arrived on time and in the condition advertised.  She loved it.
B00BMCAM6M|3.0|This app is the same as every other music app. Pretty general solection of music. Looking for something slightly better.
1451635672|5.0|Author Nicholas Pileggi tells the true story of mob influence at the Stardust Hotel in the 1970 and early 1980's.  Readers follow Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal (portrayed by Robert DeNiro in the movie) as he goes from sports gambler to highly-successful casino boss.  Stardust owner (or front man) Alan Glick was clueless as to the mob stealing $7 million a year from his casino.  Also on hand was Teamster Union financing and mobster Tony Spilotro (Joe Peschi) providing a lot of muscle.  Readers see Lefty increase casino revenues, bring in lady dealers, increase slot machines, and begin a highly-successful sports book.  But he was not working as much for the casino as the mafia bosses from Chicago, Kansas City, and Milwaukee.  The whole thing came crashing down in the early 1980's, with several mobsters getting convicted or eliminated, and Lefty himself narrowly surviving a bomb planted in his Cadillac.  This bok tells the true story, as opposed to the solid but largely-fictional 1995 movie.  And credit the author with employing a remarkably easy-reading style.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I like this movie better than most of the 007 series.  I liked the Sean Connery versions, when I was younger, with all the super spy who is always in control and gadgetry.  But now that I'm older, I really appreciate the Daniel Craig version.  Less gadgetry and gimmicks, less special FX, more human action and interpretation.  Daniel Craig's acting is superb and of course, Judi Dench never fails to please.  Two thumbs up for script, plot, dialogue and acting.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love the cast and the plot twists. Revenge is a bit of a soap opera but that doesn't bother me in the least.
B00932A4XE|2.0|I like movies where there's different story lines and they link at the end. Not here. It just seemed too comedic. Too outrageous. Racing golf carts? C'mon. With the movie stars in this, I expected better.
B008I43DYU|2.0|this is going to be useful once I dwnload the kindle edition the calculator will besomething I will use ofter..cant remember if I paid for this
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|My 11 year old daughter and I enjoyed the trilogy. We both suggested different endings but it was entertaining. I would suggest that the book is not for anyone younger than 13 or mature 11-12 year olds.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|Awesome!  First heard Nick Waterhouse performing with Daryl Hall and had to find his music.  His versions of &#34;Some Place&#34; and &#34;Say I Wanna Know&#34; are worth the listen. His performance on &#34;Live at Daryl's&#34; shows what this artist is capable of and what to look forward to on &#34;Time's All Gone&#34;. Unique, refreshing, toe-tappin' experience.
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|I'm sure it's just me and I haven't put time into trying to figure it out, but I like things that are just intuitive and I can start playing immediately without a lot of study. For me things like this are to unwind from work, not to have to study.
B000W23KHQ|3.0|It's the same album I remember from the sixties. I also have it on CD, but wanted a digital version without having to try to upload the CD. Price was right for the digital version. Same acoustical flaws as the CD, so I guess that shouldn't be a distraction. Takes me back in time about 45 years. That's good. But, sound quality is not great. If you're an old hippie from the sixties, then buy it. BTW, my fave is Venus in Furs (kind of kinky, that's good too).
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Picked this up for $10 on the Amazon sale, This made the Girlfriend happy on her Birthday.  Likely will get the extended version of the film after its release.  But for now, it's good to have, and considering that a ticket for a single viewing was in this range, I'm happy with the value.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This movie is 100 times better than the one Stallone did. It has action and a real story to follow and keep you attention.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|If you are a baseball fan and know some history about the sport, you'll like this book.  If not, don't bother.  Very well written!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Even though they completely messed up Kalinda's character this season. But there were plenty of good storylines! And good characters
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed the twists and turns that came from this book.  An exceptional story of the human spirit. Loved it!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I have nothing to complain about....ever. Jaycee Dugard is an amazing, miraculous testament to the human spirit. Couldn't put this book down.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This. is an easy paced. strategy game. It seems to be an excellent brain exercise an I'm. sure I will have many hours of pleasant diversion.
B008602KQI|5.0|love this movie. watched it few times. waiting for the sequel. actors are very good. movie is done very well.
B005HED08I|4.0|Thanks to JJ and the new movies on a whim I started watching the TOS and became hooked now I read the books and the movies cause the stories have depth and meat that many stories since do not have.
B00A8Z6KN8|4.0|The Misty Mountains track is superb.  Beyond that, however, it doesn't quite live up to the soundtrack to the Lord of the Rings trilogy while in many ways feeling like it's trying to.
B001R10BM8|2.0|This is a pretty decent remake of Thunderball, if a bit unnecessary (Connery already made Thunderball once, and it's the best of the Bond fiilms, so why do it again?). As a curio for fans like me, it's sort of a must-have, but why would anyone pay what they're charging for this? A hundred dollars? NSNA has been rereleased in Britain for the equivalent of about $20 American dollars. I won't be shelling out $100 for this, especially since it is reportedly missing key footage from the original print.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The best.  It's a great movie and 3D only makes it better. I don't know how they did it. Magic.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've used this app as my sole alarm for many months. It has great features like picking a certain song or playlist instead of a ringtone. I also like the gradual volume &amp; snooze options. I have an anxiety disorder and alarms have always been a necessary evil. This app is excellent for people like me who need to be awakened or alerted gently rather than abruptly.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I finished the other virtual city games with much gusto, this one is a bit different and you have to wait for things like energy. It has other game building blocks but let's you be more creative an  no time limit. So far so good. It has more features and building types and I can't wait to use them.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is like the old dice game of d&amp;d the only thing is no way of getting more gems is to buy them and you cannot get the weapons needed but really love the game
B004DLPXAO|5.0|CANNOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS AVAILABLE ON A TABLET...DOWNLOADED A BOOK IN 2 SECONDS...I WILL BE ORDERING MORE BOOKS AND MAGAZINES...
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a fun game. Its hard to up grade. You have to hit some goals but the price to buy things r way to high.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Big ass ads make it slow to pick cards and to move, will look elsewhere for this game for free.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|So if you're as huge of nerds as my husband and I are, then this is pretty much your best friend. I know it's mine. Ours, anyway. I watch this show all the time, and having to DVR it was a constant crick in the neck. Totally worth it to get the box set. Especially ten times better than buying each individual season. Plus it's on BluRay. Really can't get any better than this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This a really fun game if you like horses!!!! You do compitions and feed and groom it I think it's fun and I think you would too!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|i love it it is soooooooooo fun. i think everyone should get this.If there was more than 5 stars a i would rate it the most possible. Download it now!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would strongly recommend this for believers and non-believers alike. To have an doctor describe his near death experience with a brain that was not capable of dreaming is truly remarkable. This is a must read!!!
B0080SW3CC|5.0|I read this book when I was in high school, but really enjoyed reading it again 40 years later.  The meaning of this book is very moving!  I would buy books from this place again....fast shipping!
B00005N6KG|5.0|The sound quality is amazing for this price - I've had other headphones 2-3 times the price which don't sound as good. That being said, they are obviously not premium headphones - they obviously are not in the same class as Etymotic, Shure and other premium offerings.<br /><br />I use them for the gym, for running and so on. They stay on your head and in your ears pretty well. I rinse them under the faucet - they are not supposed to be waterproof, but they have held up so far.<br /><br />Comparing them to other similar headphones I also own: they sound better than the Sony MDR-AS30G and fit my ears better.<br />They don't sound as good as the Sennheiser PMX 680i (which are 3 times the price), but I prefer the over-the-head style vs. the behind-the-head style of the Sennheiser.
B000LJ9ZWE|3.0|When I first saw Westworld it was on the big screen of a local theater. I really enjoyed it and particularly Benjamin (Portney's Complaint)<br /><br />I didn't know Michael Chrchton wrote the story until I read the invite to review this.<br /><br />Check out State of Fear.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|brings me back to the mid-2000s. A simpler time, good economy, road trips to Toronto on long weekends... Music is good, lyrics are good, fun driving CD
B00873GRU4|4.0|While a rather maudlin story, the characterisation is good enough that you want to keep reading to find out what happens to them. An original idea which makes some interesting political observations. I also like the prequel Shift.
B00821OX98|4.0|very good dialogue; good writing; good actors; multiple story arcs.<br /><br />definitely allows for a &#34;willing suspension of disbelief&#34;, so far.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Love the stars but was bored with story about 1/3 way through.  Had a great cast a shame it didn't work.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|It is the best game ever its even almost as good as minecraft itself it is the best game of the century
B00278U1WA|5.0|It's been the default music I've been using since I received it. Great Album, Great Artist, Great Songs. Totally Advised In Purchasing.
B0052FG8KO|5.0|I first heard of Work of Art as a Jeff Scott Soto fan as members of WOA are part of W.E.T. along with the band Eclipse. After ordering this CD I must have listened to it 2 dozen times in the last day & a half. They have that same \\"feel-good\\" sound to their music as bands such as Toto & Journey. Fantastic musicianship & one HECK of a lead singer. His range goes to the moon & back while never straining or screaming.<br /><br />Amazing feeling in every song & \\"One Step Away\\" is just absolutely Epic sounding.<br /><br />This is one of the rare bands that you can throw on the earbuds, shut the lights out & just get lost in the music.<br /><br />Thank you Work of Art for such amazing songwriting & musicianship!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love everything about this series from the writing, to the acting, to the sets, and the costumes.  I can't wait until the next season!
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My 3 year old son LOVES this movie.  It's also super cute for adults with a little humor thrown in without being inappropriate.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|Just looking at the cover and amazing cast of this movie should be enough to suggest how amazing this movie is. Extremely well acted and addicting story-line will keep anyone sucked in until the end. One of my favorite movies. Really to be considered a timeless classic. They don't make movies like these anymore; many of today's movies are just repeats of storylines with different actors. This is truly an excellent movie worth watching and appreciating.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I've read this book a dozens of times since my first read in college, yet this story never ceases to amaze. After having worn out copy after copy, I took the chance on a Kindle download. I almost thought I detected subtle changes in some text wording, but I could be wrong.
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|The Paleo Diet is a great book for anyone interested in learning more about this diet.  I provides lots of useful information and tips.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It's a good, strange story. I enjoyed it a lot. The plot twist kept me reading it. You should love this book.
B008IGANGO|5.0|I laughed and laughed...so well timed, well filmed...absolutely amazing movie.  One of the top fifty films ever made. Still in my top ten.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Tarantino blood spurting violence - but historical and contemporary, action packed and covert commentary on race relations to date. Good performances by all. Interesting sound track adds dimension.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I am completely addicted to this game!  Graphics are great and I love that is 3D.  I use this to kill time everywhere-doctor's office, on lunch at work, etc.  I've had this for a few months and it still hasn't gotten old.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|The whole album is great. I am familiar with Fallout Boy but this is my first album I have purchased. Really like the entire album.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This movie shows that even slavery doesn't make people powerless. Also enough action packed shooting to rule out any idea of boredom.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|This game is a great deal of fun even though I do not play it very often.  If you like trading card games than this is a great one.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This book has the dubious premise that in a post-apocalypse North America, various districts are required to annually send two young people (a boy and a girl) to fight to the death in a sort of high-tech coliseum.  The movie does celebrate such positive values as courage and compassion, and the hedonism that finds such a spectacle entertaining is shown as corruption.<br />Unfortunately, there is no concept of God shown, and no uplifting spiritual values are shown.  There is no hint that any of the participants believe in any sort of afterlife.  The heroine is showing as weeping inconsolably after the death of a young girl.  She cries as one that has no hope, because she apparently has no concept of a Higher Power.<br />But the film shows what a Godless society is capable of, and thus gives us an important warning to us.  This is what we as a nation can become if we reject faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I can't get past the first set of levels. I'm wondering if its just me or if its the game, otherwise its good.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Watched for the first time since Patrick died. Was bitter sweet.  This shall always be one of my favorites. I remember buying shoes that looked like \\"Baby's\\"  back when the movie came out.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Walk Off The Earth has a sound all of there own. Inertwining 3 amazing voices and each song stands on its own!!! Love Love Love this album!!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|'The Name of the Wind' set the bar pretty high, but 'The Wise Man's Fear' does a pretty good job keeping up with its predecessor. I can't quite give it 5 stars because I felt the story lagged a little in the middle chapters, but in spite of that it was still a very enjoyable read. About the only negative thing I can say about this series is that it isn't done yet... the quality of the first two books is so high it leaves you wanting more.  I can't wait for Doors of Stone!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Yes, it has quite a few preset tunes for an alarm but two of the nice features include a dimmer for the screen display and the ability to use a song from your own collection to wake up to :)
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|I needed to make a presentation about my belief system and the spiritual source for my life. Being an atheist, it was difficult to sort through an explanation about how I reverence life but do not do so through a religious or god-based belief system.  I have been in the medical field for 35 years and have always been completely in awe of my biology and microbiology courses.  They amazed me when I started my studies and still do today. The inter-relatedness; the micro- macro-system interconnection and inter-dependence reflect my connection with life at all levels.  It was a perfect analogy for me to base the talk on.  Afterward someone mentioned that I might be interested in reading this book.  I wished fervently that I had read it beforehand as it would have made the presentation much more pointed and dynamic.<br /><br />I loved the author's presentation of biology in a vernacular that is comfortable for any reader interested even lightly in the beauty of cells and science. Launching into a JAMA article does not generally encourage the sustained interest of the average reader  Lipton kept the evolution of his studies clear and simple but always grounded in fact and data.  Scientific perspective shifts are difficult to make because the demand for data support and methodical process is very exacting.  The shift in perspective in this book is solidly grounded in research methods and the logical progression to the author's conclusions are justified - and for me, just perfect.<br /><br />The expansion of scientific thought and research into energy and the ability to apply it on a realistic, meaningful daily basis is dependent on perspectives like this.  The gap between science and energy (spiritual energy specifically) is still a chasmic one.  He has taken it on with credible intellectual investigation and good humor at the same time.  I will always respect someone who creates an analogy with a butter sandwich!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a fun game. It isn't too hard or too easy, it's just right. I have gotten stuck but only for a few minutes. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys using their brain to complete puzzles.
B001KWN6ZS|4.0|His reinvention of &#34;Layla&#34; is the main revelation on this recording. Slowing the tempo and taking away the electric guitars emphasized the longing in the lyrics. &#34;San Francisco Bay Blues&#34; and &#34;Tears in Heaven&#34; are just as great, and &#34;Running on Faith&#34;, &#34;Before You Accuse Me&#34;, and &#34;Old Love&#34; off his &#34;Journeyman&#34; album also stand out.
0452295548|5.0|Ms. Taylor tells her story with passion and humor, making a potentially dry medical event fascinating, relatively easy to follow because she doesn't bog the reader down with medical jargon, and most of all inspiring. A fascinating read taking us a step closer to understanding what happens when we have a stroke - at least of the kind she had.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This may be my favorite modern fantasy book, it has everything you could ask for. Kvothe is a truly interesting character and the story is so engrossing, it will leave you wanting more by the time you are done. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre.

Has shades of their 80's Architecture and Morality with bits of Kraftwerk ingenuity with an added dash of 21st century sensibilities.

B008NQYWC0|4.0|Master of writing he is, this is a page turner up to a point.  That point is bogging the reader down just a bit in the exhaustive research done on Lee Harvey Oswald's daily life and the tacked on explanation (string theory?) of the time travel at the end.  I think about 50 of the 849 pages could have been cut without too much damage to an intricate, fascinating story.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Iron Maiden released their fourteenth studio album entitled A Matter of Life and Death in September of 2006.<br />I, having been a Maiden fan since the release of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son in 1988, have been looking forward to anything new the band releases (be it studio and/or live). Although 1990's No Prayer for the Dying and 1992's Fear of the Dark had their moments (guitarist Adrian Smith had left in 1990 and was sorely missed) the albums suffered from the departure of guitarist Adrian Smith. However, the two Blaze Bayley albums, 1995's The X-Factor and 1998's Virtual XI were down right despicable. Blaze sounded to me like Bruce Dickinson come David Lee Roth on a bad acid trip. I was relieved when Dickinson and Smith rejoined in 1999 and have since released four killer studio efforts (Brave New World, Dance of Death, A Matter of Life and Death and 2010's classic The Final Frontier) and four superb live efforts as well (Rock in Rio, Death On the Road, Flight 666 and En Vivo).<br />A Matter of Life and Death once again features bass player Steve Harris, guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers, drummer Nicko McBrain and the Air Raid Siren himself lead singer Bruce Dickinson. Also, the band reunites with co-producer Kevin Shirley who co-produced the album with Harris.<br />A Matter of Life and Death I liked right off the bat (like much of the catalog with Dickinson and also the first two albums) and immediately caught on to the songs and go away air drumming to them. The album has its war theme through out and the guys really have caught the emotions and feel of being in one I think.<br />The opening Harris/Smith penned rocker &#34;Different World&#34; is just smokin' hot and Smith can still play leads and Bruce wails like the singer he is. Next is the piece &#34;These Colours Don't Run&#34; and is just a stellar epic. &#34;Brighter Than a Thousand Suns&#34; is next and is a powerful and well written epic length rocker (these two previously aforementioned rockers were penned by Harris/Smith/Dickinson). &#34;The Pilgrim&#34; follows, Gers co-wrote this track with Harris and this song is pretty weak. &#34;The Longest Day&#34; is next and is a superb rocker penned by Smith/Harris/Dickinson with an opening you want to hear over and over again.<br />&#34;Out of the Shadows&#34;, penned by Dickinson/Harris, is next and is as close to a ballad that Maiden will ever get although it is still heavy. The album's first single &#34;The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg&#34; (penned by Murray/Harris) is a killer track and the reason why I got the album which had a beat that reminds me of something AC/DC would do, only heavier. &#34;For the Greater Good of God&#34;, penned by Harris himself, follows and is another great rocker which just flat out rocks. Next is &#34;Lord of Light&#34;, penned by Smith/Harris/Dickinson, which is another great song and fans will love this off the bat. The closing nine plus minute epic &#34;The Legacy&#34; which was penned by Gers/Harris. The epic is a masterwork and doesn't bore you at all. The song will be another Iron Maiden fan favorite!<br />A Matter of Life and Death was another UK Top 10 and was the band's first US Top 10 album in their then 26 plus year career when it debuted at #9 shortly after its release despite little to no promotion (Sony had Beyonce (whom is despicable) and Audioslave as their top priorities at the time). Nine years on (as of 2015), it is a good album and one song brought the album down from its original five star but will listen over the drivel out today.<br />RECOMMENDED!enned by Harris/Smith/Dickinson). &#34;The Pilgrim&#34; follows, Gers co-wrote this track with Harris and this song is pretty weak. &#34;The Longest Day&#34; is next and is a superb rocker penned by Smith/Harris/Dickinson with an opening you want to hear over and over again. &#34;Out of the Shadows&#34;, penned by Dickinson/Harris, is next and is as close to a ballad that Maiden will ever get although it is still heavy.

B009YN2M7S|4.0|I really am always weary of reading Nicholas Sparks books bc they normally depress me because the love the characters experience is an un achievable love (see The Notebook) or a character I've really come to care about is killed off (see The Best of Me) but this book was awesome!!!! Every character got what they deserved in the end!:-)
B005S9EJ14|5.0|How can a film starring Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson and a cast of other superb British and Indian actors fail to be less than entertaining.  I must warn the would be viewer, however, that the movie title fails to live up to its name.  The hotel is far from the best and is only exotic in the sense it takes place in a dusty, small town in India.  The hotel also appears to be on the verge of financial collapse.  The young manager, played by the charming Dev Patel, does his utmost to keep up the appearances of this seemingly fourth rate business.<br /><br />The would be guests complain about the hotel right from the very start.  Maggie Smith's character, who decides to stay at the hotel beause it is near a hospital that performs cheap and prompt hip replacement surgery, insists that only a British doctor may touch her.  Several of the others plan to use the Marigold hotel as a retirement home.  Tom Wilkinson hopes to find a former Indian lover there from whom there was an unfortunate break up.  Another couple decides to put an end to a 40 year marriage that apparently has lasted 35 years too long.<br /><br />One of best aspects of Marigold Hotel is its gentle humor, much of which is related to the foibles of each of the guests.  One particularly funny scene concerns some items that one of the women desires to purchase from a street vendor.  One of the male guests gives some advice to the would be purchaser to prevent her from being cheated.  His advice fails badly.  There are also several lovely romantic moments in the film.  One of the joys of \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" is that virtually everyone, by at the end of the film, unexpectedly finds what he or she was searching for.
193700788X|1.0|This has got to be the first book I've read where the author fails to take me the reader with them to the end of the story. This in effect destroys the whole series to me.<br /><br />The biggest plot in this 13 book series, spanned over 3 books was in the end left unresolved, the heroine back right where she started just with more scars and less compassion.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />1603 Maker 2013-06-07 09:08<br />Love does not conquer all.<br />Love is NOT all you need.<br />You can't live on love.<br />I believe that in addition to love, a really successful relationship is one where there are common goals, common world views, and shared attitudes as to big issues like religion (or lack thereof), raising children, and handling money.<br />And love.<br />Charlaine Harris

I would not recommend this flick to anyone very bad movie!

0446547646|4.0|By now I've read enough Nicholas Sparks to know going in that I'm not always going to be guaranteed a HEA. In fact half of the suspense for me in reading his stuff now is that I'm not sure who he's going to kill off. Sure it's also frustrating as hell, because I always forget and then just when I'm all invested in the characters and wrapped up in their budding romance, blam. Tragedy strikes. Yeah, more than once I've thrown one of his books across the room in disgust but I still keep coming back for more. Damn you Sparks.<br /><br />This was another good NS book which (as always) sucked me right in. I'll be honest though there's nothing particularly new here and even if Sparks' name weren't splashed all over the cover, there'd still be no mistaking who wrote it. The Best Of Me reads like bits and pieces of all his other books with; unrequited love, reunited lovers, Notebook-esque flashbacks with an older couple, moral dilemmas, a bit of spirituality, a tortured hero, unscrupulous bad guys and a predictable yet nail-biting ending while you await the outcome of (in this case) a shooting. Yet somehow all that's ok because when something works for you and the reader why change it?<br /><br />Amanda Collier and Dawson Cole were teenage sweethearts in 1984 small town North Carolina; from opposite sides of the tracks, their intense and beautiful romance didn't really stand a chance. You see the Coles are hard drinking, woman beating, law breaking, drug dealing, bad boys and Amanda's folks are church going, stand up citizens. Despite the odds, or maybe because of they manage to find each other and fall in love, spending considerable time at old man Tuck's garage where Dawson works. I really enjoyed their teenage romance which is told here through flashbacks from both sides of the pair who are now in their forties.<br /><br />Dawson is another quiet, somewhat tortured hero of Sparks' who you can't help but fall for. (I'm hoping to see Channing Tatum in the probable movie version) He works on the oil rigs, has spent time in prison and almost his entire life running from his messed up family and their reputation. Oh and he's also never gotten over his one true love Amanda.<br /><br />When their old friend and mentor Tuck dies the pair are reunited in their hometown for the funeral. The grumpy yet crafty old man has left explicit instructions as to how his final wishes are to be carried out, including a trip to his cabin and some personal letters. As expected the years apart haven't diminished what Dawson and Amanda feel for each other despite the fact that Amanda now has a husband and children. Throughout their reunion we have some bad guys gunning for Dawson, a ghostly/angel figure following him and adding intrigue as we don't learn the whys for a long time, and a bad marriage that may or may not be worth saving.<br /><br />There are actually are quite a few characters involved here and Sparks has again written this using multiple POV's which as the suspense factor increases get shorter and shorter, so that towards the end you're only getting about a paragraph from each character. I found that this increased the tension level while he wove all the storylines together and left the reader on pins guessing the outcome.

B008BU75IQ|5.0|Love this series!  I re-read the first two books again then followed with the third so not a nuance was missed!
B009NY43NY|5.0|The twists and turns of this plot were very enjoyable. I would have enjoyed a little more direct interactions between Sookie and Eric. It seemed he let her go too easily. Plus would have lengthen the book, they are always too short! However it was refreshing to see some other loose ends tied up.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|I did enjoy this overall as a movie but was a bit disappointed in it as a Quentin Tarantino film. It does have it's moments but overall it just seems too campy in places. My least favorite Tarantino film is Death Proof, this one would rank above that but far below The Kill Bill films, Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars but I'll give it 4, it is better than a 3.

B00A8MGLAI|4.0|A moving and inspiring cinematic achievement worthy of Mitchell's prose.  Rich in narrative depth and complex story telling, this film is more robust than the fare usually served to modern movie goers.  While so reviewers lament the conceit of multiple characters played by a single actor, it is much more effective than the computer generated and formulaic contrivances that plagues modern studio films.<br />Cloud Atlas is original, emotional and an entertaining film that will only grow more poignant with time.

B001L5VYFI|5.0|I'm at that age where many of my purchases help to fill out my music collection. I liked this album when it first came out but never acquired it for my own. This album is a great live anthology of one of the signature groups of the 60's and 70's, each artist an icon in his own right. I particularly enjoy Graham Nash's &#34;Chicago&#34; and Neil Young's &#34;Cowgirl In The Sand.&#34; It also features two of the great studio musicians of the time, Dallas Taylor and Fuzzy Samuels. It's still a must have for old rocker such as myself.

B0068MNNOE|5.0|Is true?, I don't know but think in that is amazing. Shakespeare a fraud? wow, the story is nice (with some loose ends but its ok), the actors made a good work, and the &#34;stages&#34;,  are really good.

A good addition to my spiritual growth books collection.

The songs are so catchy I wake up with them stuck in my head! &#34;My Blood&#34;, &#34;Only You&#34;, and &#34;Ritual&#34; are my favorite songs on the album, but there's not one song that I don't like. Ellie shows she has such a good range in the songs, and you can tell she poured her whole soul into these songs. If you dont check this album out, youre missing out on a very talented artist and some of the best songs written:)
1481207474|5.0|This was the first book I had read by Courtney Milan and it won't be the last. The Duchess War was a very engaging read. The story is very well written by an author who has a talent with words and story flow. I did not feel as if I was being talked down to in terms of plot or vocabulary. Nothing is simplified or over-explained. No character acts as \\"Captain Obvious\\" or \\"Exposition Man\\". I was rather pleased at the feeling that I was being treated like an intelligent adult. This was not a book that felt like it was being written around sex, and that sex only, or the attraction of the characters to each other, was the only element of any importance to the story.<br /><br />Minnie, the heroine, is strong of mind and character. She has flaws, but human flaws, and given the circumstances of her upbringing, one is not surprised by them. She jumps to conclusions, she is too eager to sacrifice her own happiness for the sake of others, she does not even dare to hope. She is not an ineffable saint. She is a woman with a secret, but thankfully for once, it's not that she's a disgraced duke's daughter hiding out as a governess or a nurse.<br /><br />Robert, the hero, was used by his parents as a weapon against each other, he received so little affection in his life that he is rendered emotionally fragile by the mere presence of it. Despite that he is not a character that feels as if he needs to be saved by the heroine. He is strong on his own. He also has a secret, but it is heroic rather than dark. Both of them are emotionally damaged, but drawn to each other by the positive effects that are brought out whenever the other is near. What a nice change of pace! Their attraction is believable and well developed.<br /><br />Secondary characters are also well developed, perhaps with the exception of the main antagonist. I'm not sure if this will be expanded on in later books, but I felt perhaps a prelude to his underhandedness and greed would have been beneficial. As it is he enters the story immediately at odds with the heroine, and serious odds at that. A more subtle threat might have served him better. He is a little too overbearing. It is not unbelievable, I just feel in the thread of the story, and especially his position in society, he could have been used as less heavy handed, and thus, a more sinister threat. Working behind the scenes would have enhanced his character. He is removed off screen and quickly, which makes him seem easily dismissed.<br /><br />On the whole this is a book I would highly recommend to fans of the romance genre. The Duchess War is the first book in the Brothers Sinister series, the second of which I will begin shortly. I look forward to reading more about these characters!the story immediately at odds with the heroine, and serious odds at that. A more subtle threat might have served him better.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This season was somewhat of a roller coaster.  But, if you're a true Supernatural fan, and have watched since day one as I have, you will not be disappointed.  If you've never seen it before, my advice would be to start at the beginning.  This entire series is a story that has unfolded over the last eight years and watched the boys grow and mature.  Family is the most important thing to them.  This is a fantastic series and well worth a watch from the beginning.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I found it tedious and boring.  I stopped watching after about an hour.  Tried to pick it up later but could not get into it.  Strictly for the history buffs but nothing exciting as a movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you are a lover of good literature...<br />DO NOT READ THIS!!!<br />I wish I could reclaim the period of my life before I fell into the hype of this ridiculous excuse for literature and purchased this book. Whatever your friends are saying, it's lies! This is the worst book ever written. The plot is lagging and the sex scenes are so off the wall that I found myself skipping over them multiple times. All in all... HORRIBLE!!!!! I haven't even read the other two because I have no desire to subject myself to this crud again.

B0036TGSIK|5.0|Emma Stone is quickly becoming my favorite current actress. Her range in her movies is most impressive, but her ability with her comedic character of Olive is priceless. &#34;I want my life to be like a John Hughes movie...&#34; she laments at one point alluding to some of the great movies I love from the 1980s! This movie is funny and perky. Olive's easy relationship with her mother (Patricia Clarkson) and her father (Stanley Tucci). The friction created between her character and that of her arch nemesis played beautifully by Amanda Bynes gives the comedy an easy pitch that seamlessly falls into place.<br /><br />My daughter often recommends movies to me and I am often surprised when I fall in love with them, but this is another I can say I am glad that she did!

B003B02O14|5.0|I loved the book, and while reading it, I thought it was the Best Grisham book I've read so far, but I was really disappointed in the ending.  The ending was really let me down, and I couldn't stop thinking about it and was mad for days!  There needs to be a sequel to this one!!
B008LZHA3G|2.0|I don't find this to be a representative Dylan album. Then again what is a typical album from Mr. Bob. i would rather spend the money on Time out of Mind..
B000QCTNIW|5.0|An excellent summary of the findings in the field of neuroplasticity. I would recommend this book to every practitioner of meditation, especially those who have trained in Vipassana and the Silva Method, since they have known that it works but could never explain why. Norman Doige is an MD and that lends authority and authenticity to this book. Besides, it is very readable and it is neither a cult book nor New Age stuff.
014241493X|4.0|Paper Towns was a fun little read. Part one captured my interest, part two slowed down a bit too much at parts for me, but part three was just as engrossing as part one.
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|Kingston may have hit one out of the park with this device. I've not had it for more than a week, but with some tweeks, there is some potential game changing here. The ios app that you download has some limitations. For starters, you can only read and copy files from the MobileLite using the MobileLite app. The exception to that rule seems to be for photos, which can be imported and written to a USB flash drive or SD card from the photo library. Kingston clearly does not want this device to be used as an NAS device. As the Amazon description states &#34;Wireless Flash Reader&#34;.<br /><br />I have gotten around this limitation by using an ios app called &#34;FileExplorer&#34;, which will let me use the Mobilelite as an NAS when I enter in an IP address (get the IP address from the Mobilelite app). FileExplorer will let you write and store files on the Mobilelite and use it as an NAS device, which is what I wanted in the first place. I've moved a lot of files to a spare 32gb SD card and now used the Mobilelite as a wireless backup for my iPhone. I have even tried a USB hard drive and the Mobilelite will see that as well (Beware: MobileLite has a hard time with directories on a hard drive, so this is not a recommended use). Using flash drives and SD cards this gadget works fine.<br /><br />You cannot access the MobileLite device from a PC, or at least as far as I have tried this. As I stated earlier, Kingston only intended that as a flash memory reader for an Android or IOS device and Not an NAS. Too bad.<br /><br />Another nice feature is the ability to access the internet and use the MobilLite at the same time. AirStash and a number of other wireless storage devices will not let you do this. Kingston did a home run here. The only reason, they get 4 stars instead of 5, is the limited amount of time I have had the Mobilelite. Oh yea, you can use the MobileLite as a external battery, but the included documentation does not give proper instructions on how to do this. This is clearly a product where the hardware was finished before they could get proper instructions written. The MobileLite team needs to do a little more work where documentation is concerned.<br /><br />For $70 with free shipping, the Mobilelite will give AirStash and related devices a run for their money.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|This is the final book in the Kurt Wallander series.  As always, it is Mankell's wonderful combination of deep though and feeling on Wallander's part, combined with an intricate plot of murder and espionage by countries with questionable motives.  I had to start reading one of the earlier Wallander books right away to keep this policeman alive. The writing is excellent and Wallander is a terrific character.
B0074QGGK6|1.0|I feel that purchasing this book was one of the biggest wastes of my money of all time. This book has absolutely no value at all, and is pure, unadulterated crap.
B000YDI9UG|5.0|This boot is high quality, light and comfortable. After my first pair started suffering from wear from hiking and motorcycle-riding I got a new one. My main enthusiasm comes from the lightness which I particularly appreciate when hiking (which it isn't made for but works great), and the fact that I don't sweat in them. The only thing I would have wanted improved is the thickness of the sole. In order to improve this I got an insert-sole and now they're perfect.
B001N44BW0|4.0|This movie does a good job of capturing the essence of the book. Of course, the book was much better but the movie is very well done.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I think its kind of difficult to compare it to her last album, Unbroken, because she didn't cooperate with the writing process of many of the songs. I think she did amazing with this album because of the songs and the vocals. Her voice never disappoints aside from anything in her personal life. Definitely worth the buy!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|This is my second USB cable.  As with the first one, it started off great.  But as time goes on, I have to fidget with it in order to get it to charge. ONce it starts charging, the slightest nudge stops the charging.  This is VERY frustrating because I cannot use my Kindle while it is charging because the very movement of picking up the Kindle stops the charge.  Could it be my Kindle and not the charger?
B008764ZQ4|5.0|I did not think I would like this movie but I was wrong.  The music is well done and brings back memories of days gone by.  The sound track is great to get you mind and body moving.  The track features many current music stars perfoming outside of their normal genre with great success and who knew Tom Cruise could sing?
B004D2GMR6|3.0|To begin,I am a big Bon Jovi fan and wanted a live dvd of there concert.I was a lttle disappointed in the intensity of the music and the crowd involvement.I was expected a high energy concert and it seemed more like a pop concert.The music seemed to lack something and Jon Bonjovi's singing sounded kind of mellow compared to what I'm used to hearing in their live music.There are alot of good songs on this dvd if you don't mind a more pop Bon Jovi.I have seen some footage from their older concerts and they used to be a harder rocking high energy group.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I think it is a very well done CCG tablet game best I've played so far on the Kindle and it has a fair amount of challenge in the fights.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|Anything with Edward Norton pretty much has to be good. This was a very well done, entertaining and intriguing movie.
B005HSL626|1.0|I don't hate the game, but with all the advertising and the delay on my kindle, I just don't think its worth the time.  I highly recommend cutting real fruit for your family.
B001XJEKGC|3.0|The content is what you think it is. The sound quality lacks. To bad. The camera work is good. I wish the sound was better that's all.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|it is exactly what it is. it tells me the weather and i can expect it to be what it is. 4 stars. thank you.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I did not have high expectations for this show, but I was pleasantly surprised! The quality of the writing, acting, and cinematography is fantastic and now I'm hooked.
B00CRR5YA0|4.0|Michael Giochino clearly felt Star Trek's pulse when he composed the cues for the second of the rebooted franchise.  Giocchino has solid command of instrumentation, and taps easily into the momentum of the film, pushing it to exciting heights when necessary.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|i've been using this for several days now to implement the tools i already have for fixing smartphones and tablets (i work at a buisness where we do this every day) and this was a great addition for the price.  i can use it for most any device i've come across to date.
B00992CF6W|5.0|They love the game, and I love the creativity!  Great for long trips, and it doesn't take too much space on my kindle.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is simply amazing.  The graphics are stunning and the puzzles are challenging and interesting.  I sometimes shy away from puzzle games since they can leave you angry and frustrated.  Not here.  The hints are subtle without simply giving the answer away.  Great work and I look forward to more from these creators.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This series has always been a fantastic read.  This book was better than all the others and I cannot believe how it ended.  Archer has been a great accidental find for me and I have never been disappointed by any of his books.  I read this one in one day.  Ugh..  I wish I wasn't done reading it.  Enjoy-
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I like Tommy Lee Jones so thought the movie was very entertaining.  I would recommend it. It was very suspenseful.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This film provides a glimpse of how a person can remain true to one's convictions, in spite of what the world throws in their direction.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Ok, not really, but this movie is at least interesting to watch with my girlfriend because it has Werewolves and Vampires.  I would watch this twice if it were either that or the Notebook.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Bowie is a true freak of the age. A triple fluke. Looks, voice, mind. His looks made him a media sensation. His voice sold millions of albums. But it's his mind that gives it all lasting meaning. Only Lennon had a comparable depth of vision. This album has most of the elements I love about Bowie. No single album has all. But this one may bring more of them together than any other.
B00CTIGSBQ|4.0|As a stand alone program this is a good one. However, as a representation of the characters created by Thomas Harris I think they have gone off the rails a bit. In the book Red Dragon, and the two film adaptations of that novel (Manhunter and Red Dragon), the Will Graham character has a gift, is troubled, but certainlly has the ability to function normally in society. Harris' character is married, has a child,and with a few exceptions has the ability to live a normal life. The Will Graham portrayed in this treatment seems fragile, off balance, and one step away from a full mental breakdown at any point in time. Brilliant at profiling but socially incapable of functioning normally in society. As a supposed \\"prequel\\" to the events in Red Dragon, I just don't see how this Will Graham becomes the Will Graham of the novel.<br />They've also really missed the mark on Jack Crawford. The hard ass character that Fishburne is portraying is again, inconsistent with the Crawford of Red Dragon and SOTL. All that having been said, still an intriuging show to watch.
B008220C38|5.0|Although many people are familiar with the tragic story of Anna Karenina (I have seen three previous movie versions, all of them good), this one has the advantage of a very creative mise-en-scène.  The transition from theater presentation to movie is impeccable and the scene of the first ball where Anna and Count Vronsky dance a waltz is choreographed and photographed in a magnificent way. Totally and highly recommendable!!!
B009CF3MEK|3.0|I liked the ending better on the original movie with Robert Redford, than I did the ending of the remake. I would recommend seeing it .
B000ION79Y|1.0|I always liked Steven Seagal but this has to be one of the worst movies of all time, hard to follow plot only made worst by the voice dub overs,it doesn't even sound like Seagal, No matter it's a bad movie, save your money!!!!
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|This cd totally rocked my world.  So great that I could pre-order it.  My girlfriend was very pleased with her gift.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This is a good show about a seriously blended family.  It is a sitcom however so the relationships aren't complex and you don't need to have seen the last 5 episodes to enjoy a good laugh.
B005LAII12|5.0|This is a very funny movie. I really reamend this movie, I think it's the funniest movie ever. I knew Mark Wahlberg had it in him. He's a good actor for this type of thing. People need to make more movies like this one. It good laugfter.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Although this is an Ang Lee movie, which in itself is a type of guarantee, I wasn’t too sure about watching this movie – a boy and a tiger on a boat??? But it turned out to be a must-see experience!!! The photography is magical!!!  The story itself is full of symbolism and impossible events – and the end, who cares which version is the real one? By that time you have already been part of a surreal fantasy that has hopefully enriched you.  Do not miss this movie!!!!
0812993845|2.0|I always look forward to Kinsella's novels, so I jumped at once and bought this book (even though it was a hardcover... and more expensive).<br />I just finished a phenomenal book that I couldn't put down and I figured this would serve as a nice and easy follow up that would offer romance and some laughs.<br />Well firstly, I didn't like how there were two narrators, Lottie the sister who is really impulsive and flighty, and Lissie the divorced older sister who is way too overprotective but makes her own mistakes along the way.<br /><br />I really wanted to like the novel. I read until page 170 and I still just felt that reading it was a chore. I recommend all of Kinsella's other novels (Especially \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\") but I simply cannot give this book a good review.<br />It is to the point where finishing it seems unfulfilling, a waste of time, not to mention a waste of money... so yes for the first time in my life ( as a lover and collector of all things books) I will be returning this book.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful, and truly understand I am not a \\"hater\\" I always enjoy Kinsella's work, this one just falls too short... I guess its allowed in every writers career :)<br /><br />Hopefully her next book will be better!!
B000BTC5LW|1.0|I had this on a computer that broke. I bought this as a replacement, and the quality of the picture/video is terrible. You can download it off youtube in HD quality.  Save your money.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have never had anything but Yahoo, so cannot compare, very satisfied, Have not read this book yet, my Kindle fire just give to me for Mothers Day, It was purchased at Best Buy and the Geek Squad  (Nashua NH) most helpful in getting me startedl
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|I never tire of listening to the Piano Guys. Love to shuffle 1 and 2 and play them while I read.  Outstanding versions of long known songs that make them all new again.  Their music can transplant ones mind and soul to far away places.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It started as a small box, and then more i really enjoyed it i hope there are a lot more  best game I've played so far. Keep up the good work!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|get this game for the kindle. its awesome and you can easily lose hours to it. buy it. have fun.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Like so many others, I hate the update. The screen is cluttered and it's just giving too much information. Before the update it was my go to site, but not now.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It's a great classic. Good story and entertainment. This is a must read for everyone. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game. Fun to play if your bored and like horses. Would be better if the horses energy did not take so long to  refresh or didn't cost so much.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Grand kids love to play this game.  I like the levels and challanges it offers to the players.  Great game.
B005VPXR3Q|4.0|This is one of the better book to movie adaptations I have seen.  It can be a tedious with its suspense sometimes but all and all it is decidedly freaky.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I guess it is meant to be the first of another trilogy, so hopefully the others will get better. It plodded along, had its moments, and it looks like some parts were edited out that would have helped tie things together for those of us not into the books and the whole LoTR experience. Glad I didn't see it the theater.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing and my son is learning too! He's getting the hang of it quickly! I love teaching him and this version make  it easy.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Loved this series, One of the best books I've read this year and one that I'm going to reread again. 5 Star
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Love the game. But they use something called peanuts to buy most of the animals. 1100 peanuts is $49.99 and it takes almost 900peanuts for one animal. I love the game  but the prices are ridiculous. Not worth it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I play this game with the grand kids when ever I get the chance.  I recommend this game to anyone.
B004VOBIE8|4.0|Great app that lets you find where files you downloaded went when you think they are lost in the web
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Why is it so hard to find more intelligent writers in this and similar genres? Long live Le carre.  Brilliant
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Impressed that the dialogue was very witty and felt real. Will read other books of this author has written. Would recommend.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The situation with the toupee was one of the funniest chapters I've ever read and an unexpected ending.  Loved it!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Great album, totally recomended for the old school Deftones fans and new people too. Its experimental and fresh so im really excited and this complete my discography
B004SBX112|5.0|Grand kids love it.  This game keeps your interest and fun to play.  You have levels that must be completed.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|i love this game it is probably  the best car free car game out there and it is so addicting i was so excited when it came to the app store
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Love it keep up the good work Gameloft. Best hero game ive played in years IRON MAN 3 Best movie and Best game of the year!
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Boring, boring boring.  Plot was minimal.  Acting ws mediocre.Overall very sub par.  Very disappointing for a Bond film.  Do not recommend it.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|My son downloaded right after we saw the movie...played it and promptly uninstalled it. &#34;Just wasn't what I thought it should be&#34;
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|Very informative; precise and to the point.  Topics stay current, and are well written.  Easy to pick points of interest.
B001JV5BIA|5.0|Once again I leave feedback only to have this item STILL in items awaiting feedback. It's a great movie, I got it super fast - what the heck else can I say?!?!?!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Within 2 days I got the nether reactor core and attempted to go to the nether.  My only complaint is that it teleported the nether to me instead and destroyed the top 2 layers of blocks to my house.  Other than that, it is great to have minecraft on my kindle.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I love Wreck-it Ralph! It's one of the best, most adorable animated films of the past five years. This is a lovely movie for today's children and for the children of the '80s, a decade the gave us so many of the classic video games that are sent up in this movie. The movie is also surprisingly moving, and spends enough time developing the characters and the relationships between them that it's not just a sequence of action events (as so many of today's animated films are) but instead an actual story worth caring about. Great movie.
0307387178|5.0|Great product, fast delivery it was everything I expected.<br />It was well worth the price.<br />Bought it for school, but wound up being a great read
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Albeit I enjoyed reading the final book, it seemed slow going then rushed at the end.  As if the author just wanted to get it over and done with.
B007HC3LHS|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, but it was way too repetitive.... how many times does the reader need to know that she checks and re-checks her doors??  This could have been alot shorter.  That's time spent I'll never get back!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Such a classic movie - my daughter is going to love it! Carol Burnette is just awesome in this movie. Looking forward to watching it on family movie night!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an enthralling book! The characters were very well developed and the storyline had a lot of things to keep you Puzzling over. I enjoyed how it unraveled bit by bit, slowly telling the secrets. Cannot wait to read more!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love this game ain't nothin better than it the graphics could be better but the game play cover that
0385344333|2.0|I, too, have enjoyed the Jack Reacher series and was sorry to write this review. There were so many places in this book that could have been so much shorter rather than drawn out. The repetition made the story itself appear boring and I could hardly wait for it to end.<br /><br />I am definitely NOT giving up on Jack, but in this book I feel the author should have had second thoughts about Jack and his fans.<br /><br />Don't bother reading this sad excuse for a Jack Reacher book. It's not worth the time or trouble.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|This really is a joy to read.  Well written, imaginative, and with strange characters which actually come to life.  A complicated, though simple, plot.  Although quite long it never gets boring.  Recommended!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Helps me relax. Don't be in a hurry. I'm at level 11 and its getting a little faster.  I would never spend real money tho!
0446343129|5.0|i Just didn't expect it to be that small , It's the book i was waiting 4 & it's Just so annoying the Mail was only 1st class Speedy mail the mail cost me more  than the book itself
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Great game for kids and adults. Graphics and colors keep my toddler entertained. This game is definitely worth downloading! Fun for the whole family.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I really love the app it is like mods but it is cool if your a hard core survival player this is not for you
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|GREAT MOVIE STARTS FAST THEN SLOW THEN PICK UP AND GOES ALL THE WAY TILL A GREAT ENDING M IS THE ONE
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Game was entertaining and engrossing. Mini games could've been a bit more challenging, but the twists, turns and interweave of hidden objects more than made up for that!
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Facebook Pages Manager gives me better control over my pages.<br /><br />I can directly organize quicker saving time and money.<br /><br />This is a handy tool.
B000062YB1|5.0|I've always felt this main song talks about sex with a virgin there after murdering her. This is coming from a guy that was Convince to have sex with a girl in a cemetery.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great show! Highly recommend to anyone who likes drama and history. Lets get season 3 on play instantly.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My daughter plays thus all the time. Talks about all the things you can do. Well I had to try it. OMG, I am working on thus all the time now.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I have seen the stage play several times; it was great to read the detailed story.  This story of unconditional redemption is a personal favorite.
B0063GORYU|4.0|using the video game is interesting and also challenging that can be played any time a person has a few extra minutes
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|husband and I both enjoy! Our niece got us started on playing this on her ipad. Glad we can play now too.
B000X2H8G4|3.0|For my deafness, it serves my purpose because I am just trying to locate sound direction. To hear something clearly, the volume button is so sensitive that it has to be set just below the interference buzz (extremely loud, high frequency scream). That's because the receiver interferes with the included headphones! Sonic does give user directions for this situation but the interference would be hard on anyone's ears. If you buy this & get the screaming buzz, maybe try different headphones or increase distance between the reciever & your hearing method (earphones, mini-speakers,...) Hey! It aint bad for me cause I can hear the screaming buzz without wearing the headphones when the reciever is pointed at the direction of sound. Even my service dog wont point out a flock of birds. And it may be a fab security device. Certain to drive away intruders if receiver-headphones located together.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Works well, easy to understand, graphics are solid, and you can make progress without ever spending any actual money. Well done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great additive fun game it is as good minecraft pc! There's everything,mobs creepers you can do what ever you want you can mine for gold and dimonds and more!! Or you can play on creative mode and  build a mansion or whatever! Best game ever must get this game!

Enjoy it!! Must get!
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I don't know if it is my device or the game but I find it hard to move the shark and see where he is going at the same time.
B00A757EFW|4.0|a delightful game because of the memories it brings me but it is also fun and entertaining.  a wonderful video game
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great show. I didn't think I would like it, and it turned out I wa very wrong. I love watching the show. I love seeing how both the upstairs and down below live and interact.
B005K17RU0|4.0|We live in a mountainous area on NM and this app often gives better forecasts than the news weather people out of Albuquerque.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I bought the audiobook, just to say I had heard one.  And because I'm a Prime Amazon member, it was FREE!  It was the original book and went well beyond the witches melting, which surprized me.  Very good story for children who are just beginning to read.  The words in the book highlight as the reader is reading.  Gives kids a good sample of meter and how different voices can be used with the characters.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|You want this game because it well worth the 1.99 and its fun and full of curiosity and puzzle solving. The Room will have you begging for more which is why I wish it'd be a little more longer
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]sometimes its tuff but its sssooooo addicting!!!!!!plus im a master!!!!!!!!anyway its an amazing game and i love it so much!!!!!!!!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Excellent series. It's a little goofy at times, but also gets very serious in others. I just enjoy the acting involved as well; there's nobody that I really recognize besides Kristen, but they all play off each other very well.
1451624468|5.0|The best book ever. It's inspiring and it made me love even more sciencie.<br />I'm also amazed how fast the book arrived to my home. :)
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|I stayed away fron this flick at first because I have been reactive to Clooney hype. I liked it just OK the first time I watched it. Now I've found myself going back to see it several tines, I''m not entirely sure why. Because I miss Hawaii? For the music?<br />Some poor reviews here seem to be due to having been promised a comedy. I wasn't promised a comedy and it wasn't a comedy. Neither was it 'sad'. A commenter complains that Clooney is not accurately cast as a father figure. But he is exactly cast as a father and husband who has been putting all of his attention on business, flying to different islands as a lawyer, and barely knowing his children. By the end he and his children have been through a real and painful life's adventure with each other and settle into a connective balance together which shows each one has changed and grown.<br />The story, of a man sleuthing out the man with whom he learns his wife has been having an affair is one we haven't seen before. He does it with the help of his 16-year old daughter, the one who knew her mother had been having an affair and had written her off because of it. The father and daughter flying to another island to find and maybe confront the adulterous man while the mother is in a coma is new and raw. Yet, all of it unfolds satisfyingly and evenly, with no melodrama orr sentiment or more or less than real feelings.<br />The one brief scene which marred the reality that had been set was when Clooney goes at night to spy on the man and pops his head up and down behind a hedge. This slapstick effect didn't fit.<br />Everything else came across as real and all the actors were superb.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Any place I go with my Kindle HD 8.9&#34; that will download .pdf files are now readable to me.  Brochures, letters, some books (non-Amazon) can be doownloaded and read at my leisure.  Thanks Adobe for thinking of the Kindle!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I like the author's systematic walk through the process.  It helped me believe the unbelievable.  also the precise way he is describing the circumstances ( who witnessed what, etc.  The fact that he is a Neurosurgeon gives the book credibility. .
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|I wanted to like this movie, but it was really full of cliches, out of focus - headache inducing action, boring/trite and predictible dialog, and a mediocre plot with a ton of plot holes.  There really was little surprise and what there was, was minor.  I wondered if we were digesting an appetiser for a bigger meal but that wasn't the case.  I left hungry.  Even the supervillain was.. well... whatever.  Sad that it was so dissapointing.  Oh, and I went 3D.  Not worth the money. Wish I saw it in 2D.<br /><br />Sorry, JJ.  You might rake in the money from the curious, but beside your bank account succeeding, you failed in putting together a great film.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book is great if you have read White Fang.  It is almost a sequel to White Fang.  This book is not very long and I was sad when I finished the book
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I really enjoyed the book from beginning to end, it was easy to read and I enjoyed travelling through England with them
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Coooooooool. you get to get rewards and stuff I like it.You also get to see your score above your friends.
B009X01D9U|4.0|I bought the orange cover, and found I like it better than my original choice.  It does it all, and in some cases better!  It rotates, it protects, while leaving acess to necessary charging plugs and buttons.  It also has a hand hold strap, I thought I'd never use and I use it all the time.  The price thru Amazon, wasn't bad either.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is the best game ive probably gotten in a long time.The<br />game was totally worth the money well done creators well done.....
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just when the book starts to lull, you turn the page and you're hooked again. I didn't know what to expect when I bought this book, but it's worth reading and the characters stay with you. While its not believable in the sense that the best psychological thrillers make you wonder if it could happen in real life, it is haunting and leaves you thinking: could someone really do this?
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have followed sookie for many years.  I am very sad to see this is the last of her story.  This is a great book.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|somewhat gruesome but a really great show keeps you at the edge of your seat! Watched 7 episodes in one day!
B0094K1PW4|3.0|Typical kid movie, the main character is everywhere the action is, with guards all around.  Still don't understand how he lived to the end. Damn government.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is a very easy to play. and good to pass the time when every I am bord.its very fun.
B008W02OSQ|5.0|If &#34;Descent&#34; and &#34;Alien&#34; had a baby it would be Pandorum.  Alternating creepy and tense with blast action, and a nice twisty end, great flick.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|A good classic movie , which I'm be watching again and again,great actors,great sence and a good look into our pass
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game. wish they had more games just like this one. it was long and had good puzzles though I wish there were more puzzles
B0079IJ0R0|5.0|Could there possibly be a better Carmen than Elina Garanca? I simply love her contribution here (and I remember seeing Rise Stevens perform this opera on numerous occasions)!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This was, I think, the sixth time I have read this book.  The twists and turns and the insight into the medieval Japanese mind is positively eerie.  You should read the entire James Clavell series in order if you are a historical fiction fan.  Mr. Clavell has passed away if you didn't know and these wonderful books are all we'll ever have of him.
B00CDFWJIG|3.0|If you are over the age of 12, rent (or wait for it to hit Prime) and don't buy.  This from someone who loves Harry Potter and Narnia. This movie is a let down for what it could have been.
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|Rediscovered this one after checking out the latest release of Star Trek:Into Darkness.  The story was better than I remembered.  Quality of the stream from Amazon was very good.  No issues.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think the worlds are a bit small.. not to mention a few things missing, but other than that its a fun game.  would like to see more weather etc..
B005HEDI3K|5.0|The original series has always been my favorite.  The remastering process used has raised the quality of viewing to a level that I wouldn't have expected. Excellent job!!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I loved seeing this movie on TV  and wished to show this movie to other people as it is a true story
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Mikkelsen and Dancy are always interesting. Together they are mesmerizing. Mikkelsen moves with the grace of a dancer, which is how his career began. Dancy, as always, establishes a nuanced character. And Mikkelsen's cheekbones alone are worth watching.
B000VTNLBU|5.0|I resuced this pre-viewed DVD when Blockbuster took a dump.  The first viewing was kind of confusing because of the interleaved political intrigue on top of more technological and moral issues.  Things become crystal clear on subsequent viewings. The soundtrack music is fantastic, as is the foley artistry. It asks some interesting questions about the definition of life so early in the infancy of the internet.<br /><br />One strange feature of the film I still don't understand: thermoptic camoflauge.  I can imagine a trenchcoat that bends light around the person using it.  In fact, they chase a hacker through the streets with one on.  Now when it got pegged with bullets, it failed, and it looked like a tyvek body suit/trenchcoat combination.  He rips the thing off and wanders into a wet street fully clothed.  Now when Togusa wears it, (our lady agent in the film), she goes topless, frontless, and underwearless, yet retains boot/leggings and a gun holster strapped to her naked body.  OK--she's totally hot, but this film has a lot of boob in it.  Does the boob have purpose or is it just eye candy?  Maybe a fearless reader can fill me in...  And of course in Japanese style, they always mess around with gender for kicks--in this case project 2501 voiced by a male gets to inhabit a female cyborg body with--you guessed it--a nice rack (boobs!!!)  There's a famous scene where it (2501) is on the table in the lab getting powered up.  It gets all jiggly and the boobs--well you just have to see it for yourself.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I only got 9 minutes into the movie and I just couldn't take it anymore. Just about every camera, sound and continuity of film theory was broken in the first 9 minutes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is great! You won't regret getting it!  Just buy the thing! I'm not a little kid btw. You should purchase the game.seriously. stop staring at the screen and click get app. Honestly.I'm not kidding. Do it. NOW. STOP IT. GO NOW. CLICKY CLICKY. COME ON
B001BWYZWA|3.0|Not sure I like voice printed at bottom of picture, purchased for church teen & community vewing , but may work with hearing impaired....
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Miller establishes his character's quirkiness from the start. It's nice to see Lucy Liu with an actual character to develop. And the always watchable Aidan Quinn gives us a subtle  New York accent. Not bad for a Chicago boy, an underrated talent.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I know people take pot shots at some of these films, but they are part of my history and I love each of them for different reasons.  My favorite part of Wrath of Khan is Checkov saying \\"Botany Bay\\" like 100 times when they find Khan's shipping carge container.  And those ear slugs---EEEEW.  Favorite line: \\"where are the nuclear wessels\\" and the strange looks from the 20th century citizens in San Francisco.  These movies are really great and watchable multiple times.  I highly recommend purchasing this set.  They have some nice extras too.  Note that Piccard is only in Captain's Summit with Riker--that was rather interesting.  Unfortunately they did not bundle any of the next generation Piccard bridge films or TNG films.  It would have been even cooler had they bundled the whole thing.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|This album is great! It was well worth the wait and i am so happy the hiatus is over. Every song on the album is constantly good.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|This is Deep Purple's strongest effort since Steve Morse replaced Ritchie Blackmore. Don Airey's keyboards are particularly strong here, reminding me of the best of Jon Lord. The efforts of the other members show that they are all still at the top of their game. I love the song &#34;Vincent Price&#34; which reminds me a little like a heavy metal version of the 50's song &#34;Monster Mash&#34; & can't stop singing &#34;All the Time In the World&#34; to myself.<br />  For any fan of Deep Purple I give this 5 stars.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Love this game but twice I have gone to nearly the end with all tiles exposed and no matches left and it would not give the message that there were no matches, thus game over.  Not a big deal, really, but I would give it 5 stars otherwise.  Also, not discounting the possibility that it could be the operating system version on my Android causing this issue.  I wonder consider this the best Mahjong out there though.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Possibly my favorite of the TinkerBell movies. My daughter loves the movie- and loves TinkerBell. I hope they make more TinkerBell movies.
B002WY65VU|5.0|had to have this movie for my collection. definitely worth watching every so often. great characters, laughs, entertaining couple of hours
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Being an 80's kid means having a healthy dose of Nintendo, and Mario in particular in this case. In adulthood, amidst all the Wiis and Xboxes and the new age of gaming, my insatiable thirst and addiction to Mario remained unsatisfied, till i stumbled upon Lep's World 2.<br /><br />It is infact comparable to the old age Mario in so many ways, and gives the same satisfaction in making run the Lep around, squishing monsters and throwing acorns<br /><br />Fun game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this was honestly the best series of books this world has ever had. Thank you Suzanne Collins for completing my life
B000FCKC4C|5.0|this book has so many lessons in its &#62;200 pages. taught me a lot about perspective and  is daring me not to read it again lol. i love it. five stars.
B0088W6LGY|5.0|This was a great addition to the Stargate family. The Stargate team finally finds Atlantis and sends a new cast through the gate for a possible one way trip. A whole new breed of enemies more ruthless and nastier then ever. This show had a few years left and shouldn't have been canceld. I loved this show.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It is easy to see why Daniel Day- Lewis won Best Actor Oscar for his role in this movie. A must see...well written and excellence in acting from cast!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have it on my phone, I've got it on my Kindle, this app keeps me entertained wherever I go!
B005529EI2|5.0|My family and I really enjoy the extended versions. The extra content allows for a better understanding of events and is just plain fun. They can get a little long for some people, but I'll take the length for the extra story. For example; who doesn't like to see what happened to cause Treebeard to say &#34;The filth of Saruman is washing away.&#34;? or what happens to Worm Tongue and so on.
B009H5IS1W|4.0|Just sayin, if you are a paranoid person you might not want to watch this show. Don't get me wrong, this is a great series, it's just that after watching several episodes you start to think that there are a zillion serial killers out there. on the other hand, there are way more than you would think and there is nothing wrong with being cautious/vigilant...........better than being a victim!  OK, maybe I am watching too much Criminal Minds:) It's still a great show
B00AB7HESI|5.0|well I first got it on the D's then I got it on my kindle so fun great for all ages 6 to 100
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|The whole family loved it!  They used a lot of the standard tropes of video games plus a multitude of character cameos to make a very fun story.  Qbert rocks!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am always instantly invested and involved with the characters in Nicholas Sparks books.  This book was no exception to the development of character and story.  This one had an interesting character unlike I have seen before in his books, but I have not read all of them yet.  Definitely recommend.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love sci- fi, especially the kind that embellishes the truth just enough to make you think, &#34;What if&#34;.<br />Fringe does that for me.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is not a good one on Kindle Fire.  I have to remove it and redownload it many times a day.  It also constantly says I do not have internet connection.  Wrong....I do.  It also does not have a lot of the features that other versions have.  Any time I have tried to communicate with the team lava people, I get a run around.<br /><br />I keep getting dozens of the same dragons instead of new ones.  I have been trying for weeks to breed a Diamond with no luck.  There are many I don't have, but no combination will produce them.  Selling the duplicates for 100 coins doesn't pay for my time since it takes hours and hours to breed them and then the same amount of time for them to hatch!  All but 2 of my 33 dragons are now epic and I have almost 2,000,000 coins right now, but no place to spend them.  Most things cost gold and you have to pay for that!<br /><br />I am on the verge of quitting.  It isn't fun anymore.
B0097K21YW|3.0|Really sort of like angry birds but its a dino destroying everything.  It's ok, but I sure am glad I got it for free.
B000FBJFSC|2.0|I'm sorry. I was geared up to read a heartwarming story and this just didn't have it. Too much space was taken with thing's that I dont' feel needed to be added to the story. I had a rough time finishing it but I did. Don't feel I'd buy another book by this author.
B000000H57|5.0|It is said that writing about music is like dancing about architecture -- and that seems especially to apply here. But I'm going to do it anyway:<br /><br />October Rust = beauty + humor + morbid images + lost love.<br /><br />Catchy, yet discordant. Well-loved, yet rarely on the radio. Creative, yet a tribute.<br />October Rust = metal + pop + classic rock + goth + sound effects + spoken word.<br /><br />Soaring, yet pounding. Wailing, yet whispering. Lusty, yet romantic. Angry, yet wistful.<br />October Rust = independence + musicianship + fearlessness + immaturity + genius.<br /><br />Ten bucks, yet priceless. R.I.P. Pete, yet the music lives forever.<br />October Rust = A legacy for the band to be proud of.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|everything was just the way i liked it but the granite color coating which a week after using it started to wear off
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|This is a great box set and I can't tell the difference between this and the old vinyls that I had. Very good remastering job...<br /><br />This was the beginning for Morrissey and Marr and it's obvious that they are young and enjoying what they are doing. They were learning about life and laying it down and really connected with their audience. I always liked the \\"English\\" sound of the Smiths. The steady beat and the chiming and ringing guitars and unique Morrissey vocals that was their signature still sounds great and wears well. In other words it's not boring. Love to see Marr and Morrissey get back at it but it's not gonna happen. They've grown up and grown apart.<br /><br /> We have this set....it will have to do.<br /><br />....also, got this for half price last year through Amazon by ordering it new from the UK....($41..plus shipping) that price still stands. (actually less now) Over and out....
B006ZNRD06|5.0|After trying couple of players this one worked perfect for AVI files... this is your choice if you have trouble paying avi movies.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is awesome. You can unlock and build new suits, but you have to have a Facebook account to get 1000 credits and play with your friends.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a tense, engrossing movie.  It actually had me  on the edge of my seat.  Well acted  and describes the  Americans  escape from the Canadian embassy
B007SGM084|3.0|Loved the plot. The writing was a bit repetitive and the use of some words were as if the writer was using a thesaurus to come up with words that were beyond her usual speech. All in all the book kept my interest.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think everyone likes to play solitaire no matter what age. This is a great game to play to pass the time
B00821OX98|4.0|Aliens devastate our world and want us to be the slave labor force! Not on our watch! Strong individual performances blend into an emotional stand against the evil of the galaxy.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love this game your not only matching but your working toward building something and love the extras you earn
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The kids love it! Graphics are great. Just like the movie. Does not require you to spend money. Great for a rainy day.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great Flynn story.  Another page turner where one looses track of time while reading it.  I find the fast pace of Flynn and Baldacci reminesence or the original Robert Ludlum books.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I'm not a Tom Cruise fan but I did enjoy this movie. Great way to lose yourself and forget your troubles for a couple of hours.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|Season two moves at a brisk pace. There is constant action. Well worth watching. If you want to keep up with the action don't allow to much time to elapse between episodes. If you do you might find yourself lost
B00B7IJDMA|4.0|It was as if I was reliving every intense ending of the show as I listened to the music.  Great songs and artists!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there are only 8 tracks, wish there were more songs.  Maybe the next soundtrack will be longer.  Buy it! Enjoy it! :)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A friend of mine raved about the movie, so I decided to read the boy. Excellent choice! Finished in 4 sittings. The story opens slowly like a flower, revealing a little at a time. Very nice pacing. Highly recommend.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Great Clancy with lots of twists but predictable outcome.  I thought it brought home the cyber big brother threar  quite well
B004GYY714|4.0|I downloaded Tunein to listen to a local station and was pleasantly surprised at the options made available to me. I think it's great thus far.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Can't figure out survival craft and there are no directions to help you. Other than that it is a good game.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I am enjoying the Tudors very much. Some acting could be improved but overall the action is exciting. It is entertaining.
B007REV4YI|1.0|This is not a James Bond film and Daniel Craig is a worst Bond I have ever seen. What makes a Bond film so attractive? The British sense of humor, thrill action sequence, and beautiful women. James Bond's is a well known character. His mission is to save the world and this film has brought entertainment to audience at all age level before Daniel Craig's time. When producer Albert Broccoli, Harry Salizman, and director Terence Young created James Bond's character (based on Ian Flemings's novel) back to the early 60's, they specifically designed Bond as a world hero and lady's man then the world has already embraced it. Now 50 years later, some lousy director and producer bought this franchise and ripped off the good image from what we had for James Bond. They made him a cold blood killer with very bad temper. Due to the reputation of all past James Bond films, people will take a risk to see this movie because they love the James Bond's character and hopefully his legacy will last forever...... Unfortunately this franchise is moving to the wrong direction and Daniel Craig should learn from his predecessors and apologize to loyal Bond's fans for what he has destroyed Bond's image and misinterpreted 007's immortal role in the heart of us who really follow / enjoy James Bond's films since Dr. No!!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The characters are full bodied.  John Clark,although semi retired is still a hero.  I'd go see this if it were to be made into a movie.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This should be required viewing. You will not approach your food choices in the same way. Educate yourself about what is happening to the American farmer and to our food system. Your choices will make all the difference.
1451695195|5.0|Absolutely stellar.  The information is both interesting and awe inspiring.  Amazing the connection between science and spirituality.  I've given it as gifts
B0034DGPEU|1.0|Writing is elementary at best.  I was bored by the lackluster descriptions. .  The characters lacked depth.  Everything was very superficial
B00065JTBA|5.0|I decided to buy this after listening to the Bon Jovi limited time radio on Sirius XM. Hearing songs I'd never heard before with not only Jon singing, but other members of the band as well. Not just Sambora but others. I had to by this set and I'm so glad I did! Love it!
B00CATSONE|4.0|A good quick introduction to tesla.  His inventions and imagination quite amazing<br />In the end a sales pitch for another book.
B00AKKS278|1.0|Basically he tells you to wake up early to find extra time to achieve your goals, that's the whole book, rehashed over and over. As if waking up early was his idea. Joke's on me.
B005K17RU0|4.0|AccuWeather is a great place to find a thorough review of current and future local weather conditions. Easy to read with a lot of detail.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|This DVD is WONDERFUL!! I HIGHLY Recommend!! Eagles are one of the BEST bands around! Don Henley is a gem
B00C2C637I|5.0|years and years ago I saw the movie. It did not do justice to Ray Bradbury's book. Sometimes Bradbury gets.....wordy, but I still love the story line.
B0031RS2XG|5.0|This is the one and only book, that will explain you the phenomen of sticking ideas. It has dozens of examples, and is written in a very simple and entertaining language.
0345537998|4.0|I am an avid George Martin fan, and this book was delightful in a totally different way from the Game of Thrones series. Part of the reason I enjoyed this book is because I really love a good space sci-fi. Different species, different standards, just different is enjoyable to read. Quirky characters, particularly the main character, made this book even more fun to read. Psychic cats don't hurt either...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I feel like I just met Katniss Everdeen. I am hungry for more of her life and recovery. Great series. Highly recommend!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I started reading this book because  my best friend told me about It and she said it was a good boom.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I wanted to see this since I'd heard such great things about it, so when it got released on download, I leapt at the chance to sit and enjoy it.  It was quite interesting and the acting is very strong, of course.  Day-Lewis and Field are always amazing to watch.  But frankly, it wasn't as good as the hype, maybe I just expected more?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Best adventure of my entire life! I love to get the jitters and be kept on the edge of my feet! Also I love the bonus adventures! As long as you make a sequel I will keep buying!
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Another Harry Bosch thriller. One never knows where it will take you and who will be the eventual killer. Along the path the reader learns what may seem what it is, is in fact not. I have not found one book of Michael Connelly that I have not enjoyed. I love reading his stories. Usually within three to four days.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its a simple game but fun and entertaining. Its great for all ages. I really enjoy this game and just spend time playing this simple game. Reminds me of that cartoon that has a little old man driving his car, he has a little hair, cant seem to remember too much of the cartoon but thus game reminds me of that....enjoy!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|A great app to get the kids to take a quiet time when parents need to relax for a few
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Saw this movie in the theatre the weekend it opened and was surprised at how much I really liked it.  I'm no great Tarantino fan, his violence is too constant for me but the story made it easy to over look a lot of the bloodshed.  I liked it so much I purchased the dvd when it released and have watched it a couple of times so far.  The acting is incredible; Fox, Waltz & DiCaprio all give amazing performances, so equally strong that it's clear why this is such an amazing film.  It IS violent but the story is humorous, humane (you will want the guys that are killed to meet that fate) and throughly entertaining.  I bet you will like it, too!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|My God, I'm 12 years old and that game kept me on the edge of my feet! From the beggining ever since the demon appeared in the front of the screen, I've been scared he was going to pop up  again, so every time I went on the elevator I covered the screen with my hand! Haha! I love how u guys leave bonus adventures!
B000SGSU58|5.0|True to his writings, Michael Connelly makes you want to learn the truth of who Harry Bosch is searching for. I have not found any of Harry Bosch character stories that I have not enjoyed reading. This is one character I just to love to read about. I feel as if somehow I know Harry on a personal basis. Love the character and the stories written about him and his life adventures.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Great Acting and story.  Glad I watched it.  Story has life lessons for real world. Made me laugh and I would watch again.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I love this show and I love the music and artists they have come out with and will keep watching the show and buying the music.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|All the performances in this film were strong and after having seen the play 3 times, I actually was really able to get the entire story finally.  You know how when you see live performances, a lot can be lost because you can miss some of the dialog, this completed the story in every last detail for me.  So that was a great plus.  If you liked the play, I think you will really enjoy this film adaptation.
B0015AARJI|3.0|At first i was worried about buying it, for all the review that said it came a fake controller. But at the end it turned out to be the real thing.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it but it woulnt let me plant muchroom and that you don't have water and surten Things in it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Good read, wish things had been tied up a little neater for it being then end of a series. Oh we'll.
0307593312|1.0|This book had no interesting characters or new ideas and I do not want to take the time to elaborate it when others have done so well, just want to rate it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|What can I say?  Denzel's performance is nothing short of amazing!  Talk about a flawed human being with all of his wounds out on display...this will be one you won't soon forget!  And John Goodman is pretty fantastic, too!  Great story, lots of complexity and a really interesting take on addiction.  Well worth the time you will put into it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|great family night fun for all the family fast delivery great price thank you as always awesome price recommend to all friends an family
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I play it all the time and got other people to play it with me. Great way to pass the time
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|This was a spiritually beneficial movie for me to watch with my granddaughter. She knows more about her Savior now by viewing this movie.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Excellent children's classic movie. Perfect movie to watch with the family and one I'd highly recommend for a family movie night.
B00498YZFK|4.0|Man, this movie put me in a funk for days!  Jennifer Lawrence is breathtaking in this performance and to think of how young she was and how much she took on with this role, it's impressive!  This story is really stark and harsh.  Not for viewing if you aren't the kind of person who is generally of a pretty happy disposition, which I am and it still took me a few days to get past this one.  It's depressing, shocking and sobering, I won't candy-coat it.  It's an interesting tale but one that I think comes at a cost to the viewer, which really is what film making is truly about, right?  So, it you're feeling up to a tough tale, well drawn, then this is right up your alley!
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|great movie wonderful family time and great price for so much fun was fast delivery I recommend to all my family and friends thank you
B0012HEB32|5.0|This my first time using the kindle fire it was cool to watch videos on the kindle fire with family
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I love all the actors in this film, so it is a huge disappointment to me that I HATED this move.  It was horrid from the very first moment.  When a movie tries way too hard to be \\"funny\\" the end result is usually that it is not funny.  I liked some of the story-line that was serious in nature and I wish they had chosen just a few of the characters and made a movie about them. Two examples would be the relationship between Liam Neeson and his son...and Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman.  Laura Linney was wonderful but absolutely wasted and there was no resolution of her story.  What a tragic waste of so much talent.  Skip this film if you value your time.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Christoph Waltz &#60;3 Brilliant. Not quite as insane as QT's other movies, but just as good. Loved it as usual
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|A friend had seen this in the theatre and encouraged me to have a look.  So, when it came out on download, I thought about it.  Weeks later I decided on a slow day to watch it and it actually was amazingly entertaining.  It's a great story and having lost my Mother at a relatively young age, I could relate to the main character in many ways.  If you've been on the fence with this one but you like movies that surprise you a bit and have a really great message, you might want to give this one a chance...
B008XCM18Q|1.0|Congratulations to the brilliant screenwriters who rewrote this book from A to Y.  I found myself rooting for the (other) villain Carlos just before giving up half way through.  If you purchase this book, you might like to know that kindle books are returnable.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Wonderful entertainment. FREE IS GOOD ... ONE OF THE MANY REASONS  I RENEW MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP.  its nice to catch up on programming I was not even aware of when it was originally in production!
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|This story ends abruptly and leave you with questions. I look forward to the next movie. The 3D is excellent.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I was an intriguing read! I like her style of writing and chose this book after reading her first one. Now I am ready for &#34;Gone Girl, &#34; and am looking forward to it.
B004GCPJDQ|3.0|I really loved the idea of this charger. It works but when the battery is low and you place the Magic Mouse on the charger you can't use the mouse at the same time. Side to side swiping is disabled somehow. As long as you remember to put it on the charger at the end of the day for an overnight boost you'll be fine. It also doesnt charge if the computer is turned off. I recommend keeping a backup set of regular batteries just in case.
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|The Adventures of Tintin was a movie I had not originally heard of until recently, and boy it IS a treat. Tintin is not just your average animated film. So believe me when I say this movie is well worth your time. Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg are two of the best film makers and they do not disappoint with The Adventures of Tintin. The title character Tintin, is played by Jamie Bell; I think he did a wonderful job with his approach and the intensity he brought to the character. Daniel Craig takes a break from 007 and plays the bad guy Ivan Sakharine; he also did a marvelous job. My favorite character who brought a lot of the humor to the movie was Captain Haddock played by Andy Serkis. So to sum up my review: Tintin has: humor, adventure, action, interesting storyline, and great visuals for an animated film in my opinion. I will definitely be buying The Adventures of Tintin on blu-ray, and I am really looking forward to the upcoming sequel.<br /><br />4 Stars
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|This series was changed over to Blu-Ray very well. The red tint that is usually on the upgrade was not so prevalent.
0375869026|5.0|A good book about empathy, for pre-teens and older. The central character is a child, but we see this person from several points of view, which provides useful insights into how different people may view the same events.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun .I found this game once I started to play ito couldn't stop playing ..if you like temple run 1and2youll like this game.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|loved the series and the way it flowed into the story hope the story continues to unfold to see what happens
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great game. fun to play. interesting. I find it hard to stop playing. three in a row match is fun. so are locked tiles.
0525478817|5.0|I read it in a day but still think of it months later. It then worked its way through the rest of our house. Subject is teens dealing with teen subjects (love, angst, friendship, peers) through the hyper-focus of terminal illness. Funny, sad, and thought-provoking. The author also has extensive Q&As online for after you've finished the book. We read a lot in our house and this is one of the best books we've read in years.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|My mother-in-law was reading the book but never finished it. She didn't like it so she quit reading it.  k
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A very good read--made bittersweet by the tragedy last February. God bless his family for such a tragic loss. We certainly need more men like him.
030758836X|2.0|This book made me cringe, unlikeable, hate filled characters. They spew so much hate against everything and everyone, I became totally disgusted with the plot. And, the ending; what a stupid, illogical ending. Think the author ran out of ideas and decided to call it a day and send her back home. This book would have been better if such abusive language wasn't used to describe each other, \\"f-ing c...\\",\\"f-ing t...\\". It truly made me wonder if the author needs professional help. Wierd book, all hype, no substance, skip it folks.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its pretty cool and is one of my favorite games. you can go on mountains and go to the moon.
B009NY43NY|5.0|One of the best books of the series. It's sad to think there won't be another Sookie book. But it tied up most of the loose ends very nicely.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a fun little game and super cute. It's not one that you can play for long periods of time each day because there's not enough to do but it's fun to check in briefly every day and keep things going.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was interesting and held my attention. I just disliked the ending. Without giving away some of the 'happenings' I can't go into detail.  I just didn't find the story line feasible.
B003UV8TFE|5.0|Even though parts of this book are way above my ability to understand, it still holds my interest.  Professor Levin is a great storyteller.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Combines gameplay of Temple Run and Fruit Ninja skillfully. However, runs tend to be too short, and arbitrary resource limitations exist solely to monetize the app. Graphics are good. Sound effects are unimpressive.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I was a fan of Lost and this series is similar to it. There are several characters and their different worlds to keep up with, but that's what makes it a good program. It's not always predictable and most of the time the show is over before I want it to be, and that's usually the sign of a good movie/series.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Omg this game is amazing its well worth the money but the one flaw is that its not modern it takes place in the futur witch kina pisses me off but otherwise great game
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Freaking unreal!!! Joseph Gordon levit...yumm.  Great plot.  Not like any movie you have seen.  Defiantly one of my best movies out there.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|I love this movie so much it's so good. The creepy atmosphere in this movie was so different from other horrors I've seen. The second chapter comes out this September.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was a great sci-fi movie and a great Star Trek film in general. Lots of action, plenty of humor, surprises, emotion, and a brilliant twist to one of the classic Star Trek Films. After a mission has gone bad, Captain James Kirk is demoted to first officer of the Enterprise, with his predecessor, Admiral Christopher Pike reassuming command. When Starfleet is attacked by John Harrison, Kirk and his crew journey to a Klingon planet in search for Harrison. What follows is an all out war with Harrison, the Klingons, and a rogue Admiral. If you're a Trekkie, I highly recommend STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS!!!
B0012DP8A6|4.0|Just as I remembered it, a good musical with a little dark humor. Not recommended for kids under 12 or 13. couple of language issues and weird sexual content.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Really enjoyed the entire first season! Great characters, twists and story!<br />Looking forward to see what they do for next season, wish I didn't have to wait so long for the nest!
B00BFBSV72|5.0|awesome I love this app. my son loves it very much. I would recommend to anyone. download it. very fun game
B008B1BL4E|5.0|IT GIVES YOU EXACTLY WHAT WAS BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE MURDER OF FRANCIS FERDINAND, SHOWING THAT IT WAS A REAL COMPLOT AND NOT EXECUTED BY A LONELY ANARCHIST!!!!!
0345529057|5.0|This series beats out any other book series out there. It is a series based in  a fictional reality, where characters behave as they should behave. No immortal characters here, anyone can die at any moment. Intrigue and politics are abound as they play the game of thrones.
B005SAJRV0|5.0|I'm a sienfield fan , and sitcoms today are all just a bunch of garbage!! All of a sudden I decided to Big Bang Theory cuz nothing was on the boob tube as usual , and to my surprise this show is friggin funny , all the characters have their little quirks about them , anyone who's a comic book geek , movie lover and brainiac will fully enjoy the Big Bang theory .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've got 5 words for you: &quot; Get this game... RIGHT NOW!!! It is awesome!! Some people say it's the same as temple run but I think this is way better. I love how you can get different power ups and you have daily challenges and different&hellip; fun characters. I also like how the setting is so colorful and how you can jump and run on trains. Anyway what I'm trying to say is... well I think you get what I'm saying.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Awesome game with strategic game play and realistic graphics. I did not give five stars because the game was way too short, especially for a paid game. If this game was longer and had more puzzles, then it would have definitely earned five stars! I hope this game will come with an update that will add more rooms.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I am a TRONerd for way back. I watched the original 1,000 of times in my childhood. I even had a copy on Beta!! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie (just watched it last night while I'm on vacation). I think it is a great film and hope Disney does another (if they're not too busy with Star Wars).<br />Enjoy!!
B001795SH8|4.0|It may be inappropriate to say that abbado's conducting style is very similar to Kleiber, but, for me, they are very similar. However, both of them and their orchestra maintained to be both dynamic and orderly, which I guess very difficult.<br /><br />I enjoy the music very much.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|The squares should be a little bigger, it is hard to hit the squares sometimes.  Otherwise it was fun to play.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It was fantastic with a lot more drama that occurred from the first season. Can't wait to watch the third season.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A great ending to a great show. Ties up loose ends and tugs your heart strings. If you watched the show you must finish the adventure.<br />Enjoy!!
B008X8P8A8|5.0|SEGA did a great job bringing the game to the mobile platform. I just bought it and have already played it nonstop. Buy it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Watched 2nd time on our Prime membership as it was free and enjoyed it as much as the first time.  That is amazing for us
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I'm a fan of all Nicholas sparks books and movies thus far and this one I loved.<br />I saw Julianne In rock of ages and didn't care for her acting but in this one she is a completely different person and did a great job.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie you'll love it. If you enjoy daft punk you'll love it. Either way is good.<br />Enjoy!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the series and the final book tied up all ends. It was full of surprises and twists until the end. If you enjoyed the first two books you will have to read this one. I hated it to end.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|It is gory but what a cliff hanger.  The reality of the production is unbelievable and it is so well acted.  Don't miss it.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This is a fabulous read.  Buck is a dog with a heart and a brain as big as the Yukon.  He is faced with adversities that would have killed most humans.  This book confirmed for me my feelings that animals are better than humans.  Humans are greedy and cruel.  The book ended just as it should have.  Buck was free.
B009R659L8|1.0|I was unable to read the book because it was structured as if it were a screen play. I tried to read but was unable to get interested.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you enjoyed the first book you will have to read this one. It explains more about the people involved in the story and why things are the way they are. As for the fire - you will have to read it to understand. Be surprised is all I can say. When it ends you will want to read on to see how it all ends or does it?
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|It was very hard to keep up with the subtleties of the changing and shifting scenes and characters.  Interesting but somewhat frustrating.  Costumes and sets great.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I am eighty now downloading the game again after accidental earasing. so I thought it would be a good time to put in a review. I had to buy it again so I just used 99 of my amazon coins. anyway I honestly love this game! better than survivalcraft byf so its highly reccamended!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great family game. We never want to stop playing. Someone is always playing so when my turn comes it is new from where I was last. Great game and great graphics.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Keeps you absorbed the whole movie.  Excellent acting and cinematography.  Being 71 I forgot just how intense this was at the time I was living it out.  Some things I didn't know.  Don't miss it.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|Ok, the cancoin deal is, well, weird, but, take your camcoins and press the button that said 'free video' or something like that. But it is REALLY good!  50 stars
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|How much I wanted to save Jamie the main character and how grateful the author gave him such loving friends.  A real twist at the end  well with the delightful ride. I highly recommend this hook
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second time to read this book. I feel it was even better the second time. I am ready for the movie to be released.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A beuatiful and challenging game.  I can't wait for further editions.  Although more levels would have been appreciated, I can't really complaint for the $1.99 cost.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great puzzle game. Love the gameplay, music, and visuals. Challenging enough to be interesting, but not discouraging. My 6yo also likes it.
B00C2C637I|4.0|I enjoy reading to achieve a selfish end, such as a bit of fright, a trip into a world outside my control, or maybe just a diversion from a boring and workaday world. I liike being reminded of why it is that we play with snakes, knowing that we’ll eventually be bitten and that we might even die.<br /><br />Coming from the mouth of a Shakespearean elf are the words “Look what fools we mortals be.” And still we flock to the madness of a carnival. Subtle danger perhaps, designing craziness maybe, dark and sinister invitations seemingly, depraved and debauched activities with a wanton disregard for the welfare of human beings for sure.<br /><br />Grotesque mechanical fat ladies insanely laughing, the morphing of unfortunate creatures that nature has cruelly manipulated into macabre sideshow freaks prompt many to look and look away. Add to these disorienting and distorting mirrors, unnerving illusions, invitations to the dark side, and a subliminal intelligence that seems to know one’s innermost fears lurk everywhere within the parameter of the controlled insanity.<br /><br />Bradbury allows us to see with our mind's eye the faces of carnival goers as they laugh unrestrained at things that should be pitied, throw their money away on valueless trinkets, gluttonously eat all the fattening unhealthy foods of death, and entrust their children to the satanic carnies that make their living stealing and lying and manipulating unwary searchers for entertainment.<br /><br />With a reader’s ear we can hear the cacophonous sounds of calliope, Farris wheel and carousel mixed with the squeals and screams of youngsters and oldsters as they are lifted into the heavens and then plummeted back to earth; saved just before the fatal impact with the ground; fun, fun, fun!<br /><br />What evil and terrors stalk the crowds and offer the unthinkable to any who agree to sell their souls in exchange for some demonic bauble or even the promise of youth to the old and age to the young; all from a simple marry-go-round.<br /><br />Now weave all these surrealistic elements into a fairytale tapestry using a weaver’s warp and weft of an occultist’s powers and a human’s dream of a self-serving beck and call to the underworld. Run these challenges through the filters of two twelve year-old boys and pitch a battle between good and evil, and the reader has the opportunity faced by Ray Bradbury in Something Wicked This Way Comes.<br /><br />Do pure, unadulterated, evil and satanic forces join hands and make periodic appearances in the world? How does an author explain abstract realism overlaying the concrete stuff of dreamscapes? Metaphor and allegory, expanded vocabulary, control of the reader’s emotions, and the creative genus required to explain the unexplainable are all tools mastered by Bradbury. Yet even with his polished skill and wordsmithing excellence, there remain the pitfalls experienced by nearly every writer no matter his or her prolific prowess of the pen.<br /><br />Bradbury, no doubt belongs in the Sci-Fi and Horror Hall of Fame with Stephen King, Edgar Allen Poe, Rod Serling, Dean Koontz and the rest. He is guilty however, of frequently over-reaching and trying too hard to bring the reader to an intellectual and emotional climax through the use of many words, literary devices, and attempting crescendos and avalanches of ethereal and sometimes questionable terms and phrases.<br /><br />Most of the time, Bradbury’s thesaurus treasures fit, sometimes they are employed ad nauseum, and sometimes he just tries too hard to make a point and leaves the reader wondering what he meant. This is all the more reason for a reader to match his or her syntax acumen with Bradbury’s.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, although Grimm-like fairytale read and adventure into the dark world of demonic tricks and tantalizing traps to steal souls and feed the insatiable appetite of the chief bad guy, Mister Dark or the Illustrated Man, who seemingly orchestrates the entire show to his own agenda or something’s or someone’s directive who is more evil than he is.<br /><br />This book is recommended for those readers needing a respite from werewolves, zombies and vampirestrates the entire show to his own agenda or something’s or someone’s directive who is more evil than he is.<br /><br />This book is recommended for those readers needing a respite from werewolves, zombies and vampires
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Nancy Gibbs has put together a pleasant read of U.S. Political friendships that evolve after &#34;time served&#34;, beginning with Harry S Truman and his ability to cross party lines and utilize Herbert Hoover in post WWII reconstruction efforts in Europe.  If you are looking for in depth political interpretation, this is not the book; however, if you are looking for a book to re-instill trust and faith in our current political system - muddlings and all -- you will enjoy each of the tales told of all Presidents from Truman to current date.  You just might gain some tolerance for those we elect to the office and might even be reminded to hold each of these people in your prayers.  Hail to the Chief!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game is lots of fun. Although i wish we didnt have to pay so much real money. For example i now got 20 pets and i need another home to buy more pets and i need to pay real money so i can get enough gems to buy the house.
1400069289|4.0|Very much enjoyed this excellent reportage piece on how our brains work and drive our behavior.  This is a flourishing genre, with lots of great choices that I keep dipping into.  The gold standard is certainly [[ASIN:0374533555 Thinking, Fast and Slow]], which this book neither rivals not attempts to rival.  It has the insight, readability, and detail one would expect from an expert middle/high brow magazine writer, and I found it both useful and enjoyable.<br /><br />  The author has a broader understanding of the word \\"habit\\" than many of us use in common parlance, so the book is both broader and shallower than one might expect.  \\"Habits\\" are not just smoking or cracking your knuckles, they are how you work, eat, recreate, relate to others, raise your children, etc..  While it also discusses techniques for changing habits (broadly understood), it is not a \\"how to\\" book by any means.  More a description of the science of empirical behavioral psychology.  If that sounds interesting to you, you will enjoy this book, as I did.  Indeed, only a weak final section of the book kept me from going five stars.
B008C20TDG|3.0|I was excited about this book, but found it very basic and lacking in great resources or supporting studies. Do I think you can get healthier on this plan?  Yes. Is it the end all, be all?  No.
0061906220|5.0|My grandchildren love the Pete the Cat books.  Pete stays cool and doesn't complain about anything.  When the kids get upset I ask them what Pete would do and they say &#34;Pete would stay cool&#34;.
0525953728|5.0|That is an interesting book that is a very quick read. I read it in three sessions and I have wanted to see the movie but have not yet.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is in the same category as Temple Run.  Simply one of the Best android games ever written!<br /><br />The graphics aren't breathtaking, but they're cute and the game play is a lot of fun.  Plus with different incentives and things to buy in game (with money you can earn in game), it doesn't get boring.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This version of Mah-jong was a pleasure to okay. It was nice without being too fancy.  Fit the screen of my S3 nicely. Solid fun.
B00A0MJA1I|4.0|the kids like it.  it's Disney.  what else can you say?  classic cartoon that keeps them occupied for 90 minutes.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Great detail from start to finish. The characters, the story, the visuals and the music... very well done. Thought provoking... the kind of movie that makes you think about life, maybe even changes your life.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|Entertaining, works well on my Asus Tablet. Plays like the board game, computer opponents level is pretty good for competitive game.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|What a fantastic movie.Peter Jackson does it again.My review is for the blu-ray, 169 minute combo edition.All action,moves right along,great scenery,great transfer,great acting,and great visual effects....support your favorite artists.
B005ZUR724|4.0|it would be alot better if it wasn't so buggy at times. Overall very fun, even though I kind of want to murderer children when it wont let me pass through a door....
B005LAIIHG|4.0|We enjoyed this film. It was interesting and spell-binding at times. A bit sad but well worth the purchase. I think you will enjoy it.
0316223239|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this story.  My daughter gave it to me for Mother's Day after she told me how much she liked it.  I had issues at times with Jack's voice (sometimes quite stilted sounding, while at other times, very well-spoken), but overall, I'm really glad the story was told from his point of view.  I found that very effective.  I think the author did an excellent job of showing the difficulty of the transition to Outside.  She maintained the mother-child relationship that was developed in the first part of the book throughout the second half, with all the other issues that came to bear on it. The interview with the author at the end of the book provided some good insight, so don't skip it!  The ending was especially poignant and well-done. It was also easy to relate because I have another daughter and a grandson who are the same ages as Ma and Jack. I don't want to say more, because, really, you need to read it and get all the wonderful nuances and good stuff for yourself. I will be checking out more books by this author.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good story; I like Baldacci and this book was a very good read. Would recommend it to anyone who loves a good mystery.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Took me to  a different place and time.  His life was unimaginable.  Both sad and yet very funny and fun at times.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|A personal favorite from my child hood. Every Teen must watch this movie. Awesome movie. For all High Schooler . Bueller, Bueller..
B009A9EYUO|5.0|Nice. Very good product. You should buy it right now. And you don't need to be a fan, you just need a good musical taste!!!
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|This is a strong sequel effort from Giacchino. It acknowledges the previous film's themes while adding to the world established. I can't say it's dramatically different from the first movie's album, but that's not a bad thing. I'm glad to see Giacchino finally got someone other than Dan Walin to record and mix the music, though. It sounds dramatically better than his other scores. Overall, it's a fun listen, though not extremely different from the previous film's album. It suits the film perfectly, however, and that's all that matters.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Excellent game very easy and fun to play.  Nothing short of 4 stars.  Tutorials were on point and smooth graphics.<br /><br />The Bad<br />Everything cost too much. And getting off the ground could pose as a challenge.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this a really great game,it is also very very addictive,once you start playing it you can't stop.i play for hours
B000V7J82S|5.0|Nice. Very good product. You should buy it right now. And you don't need to be a fan, you just need a good musical taste!!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|THE ONLY PHOTO APP I USE! I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY!!BEST APP EVER! THANKS PICSART
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am obsessed with this game. When I saw my friends playing it, I didn't see what was so special about it. I decided to try it, though. So I downloaded it..... and fell in love with it! :)
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I'm a huge horror and thriller buff and this flick truly satisfies that need which is increasingly hard to do since I've seen everything from F grade flicks to the best. I rate this as one of the best and full of great surprises.
B009FHRRAA|5.0|Nice. Very good product. You should buy it right now. And you don't need to be a fan, you just need a good musical taste!!!
0688091717|5.0|Bought this for my son and he asked his mom to read it to his class (he is in 1st Grade).  Taught a great lesson about how we are all different.  Received the product very quickly.
B00006D295|5.0|rhps is still as good as when first became a cult classic years and years, decades and decades ago, ditto.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show to watch. Takes you back to a simpler time for us. It's interesting watching how much it relates to now tho too. They are in a time of change but many of the older generation don't want to change anything when the younger generation know that change is a must if they are to survive!
B002RIA00S|5.0|This book is a relaxing read, full of colour and atmosphere.  I would recommend it, especially if you have seen the painting
B007LGPSX0|4.0|These stories are all first world problems. They tend to be exaggerated, but at the same time, we can still see what's happening in American high schools and colleges. They tend to seek Nicer, Better, Bigger.....endless desire that can affect mental health of wealthy people in the U.S.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|This album is awesome! There are plenty of songs for all music fans. 'A Celebration' is an excellent driving-on-the-highway song. High energy. 'Unstoppable Momentum' and 'Weight of the World' are other great tracks. Still listening to the others. GET THIS ALBUM! You won't be disappointed!
B008PZ69T8|5.0|The music is just great... follows along with the book all the music is lovely! .......wish E.L James would do more!!!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|This game is pretty cool. Each level brings more monsters with different abilities.and leveling your character is pretty cool. I am playing for hours.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was my introduction to Pendergast and I immediately became a fan.  He is like my hero Jack Bauer in the TV show \\"24\\".  There is nothing he can't do and you feel safe and secure when he is in charge.  The book is very suspenseful and kept my interest throughout.<br /><br />This was my first audio book and the narration was mesmerizing; I am addicted.  I just purchased my second Preston & Childs audio book and can't wait to begin.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie. It was hilarious. Great for music lovers! It makes me laugh every time I watch it.
B00846REIS|2.0|once you have read Fifty shades ... this is a bore.... similar however not as good writer.... boring cannot even finish it
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is fun to play and it has a system of rewards that is increasing with each level. Players have the choice of working hard for rewards to get to a higher level or buy some rewards to get there faster.This game has great graphics and is really fun.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Awesome book and series! Well worth reading. If you love action and adventure then pick this series. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|It was a funny, well acted, sweet movie. I liked it a lot. I liked how it went from dark and dreary to warm and hopeful. good flick
0452289963|5.0|The book is really interesting. The author has very good general knowledge in a variety of topics whic made me aware about our life purpose as human beings. Great book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and all and I'm not trying to say its bad but on creative mode you can't get flint and steel or use your furness  crafting table or chest and no night or mobs or you can't place water or magma.you can't go to the nether, but It is AMAZING! It has the update 0.7.0 coming soon but it is probly out all ready for some of you so it will get better and mayby t will have the seed &quot;super flat world!&quot;
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I just love, love<br />, love this game!!!!!!! Good gratfics fun rooms,an fun people, casino games if u want a change in pace.
B001ILFUDC|3.0|I thought I saw this movie as a little boy, but after viewing it, I realize I must have only seen excerpts from the old Wonderful World of Disney. The beginning is awesome, though those clocks seem a mite violent in their activities (Mama spanking bare-bottom child, couple of other animals trying to club others). Aside from that it's magical. But the bad guys show up and it loses some steam for me. When the fairy comes to Pinoc's rescue, and his nose starts growing, it seems a stretch to me. He's really not lying when he says 2 monsters got him. I'd always thought the nose thing was ongoing, not just one short segment.<br /><br />When his father was swallowed by the whale, along with the cat, goldfish and rest of the house, I was surprised. Didn't strike me as being even slightly believable. Further, since  virtually all the animals could talk, including sea horses, how could Geppetto justify catching those fish to eat? lol Great characters, grand animation, but the story line could have been better I thought.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|It's pretty good. Nothing life-changing, but it's about what you'd expect an action movie with Mark Wahlberg to be. Overall, we weren't amazed, but we weren't disappointed either.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|It's almost impossible not to enjoy the chemistry between Rudd and Mann but the various subplots that circle them aren't as compelling. With a 25-35% reduction in side stories (like the whole &#34;Megan Fox prostitute&#34; thing) and a little more narrative focus for the main story it would have felt like a much more complete story. Really, I want to give it 3.5 stars but I'm rounding up to 4 because movies like this need positive encouragement.  Even flawed, this is far better than 90% of the RomCom's currently being churned out.
B00A81MV3U|3.0|\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a romantic dramedy adapted from the book of the same name by Matthew Quick. David O. Russell wrote the screenplay and directs. Pat Solitano, Jr. (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from a psychiatric hospital, where he spent some time after severely beating his wife's lover. He immediately vows to win back the affections of his estranged wife Nikki, against the advice of his bookmaking father (Robert De Niro) and headstrong mother (Jackie Weaver). When Pat is introduced to Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of a friend, sparks fly, as she is recently widowed with some problems of her own. Tiffany proposes that she help Pat contact Nikki -if he will be her competitive dance partner in return.<br /><br />David O. Russell chose this material, because it made mental illness, specifically bipolar disorder, accessible. And Pat is not the only one afflicted. Tiffany dealt with her husband's death with pathological behavior. Pat's father has a minor obsessive-compulsive disorder. Danny (Chris Tucker), a friend from the hospital, has drug problems and a constant battle over the legal status of his hospitalization. It's a menagerie of personality problems. I'm not sure that any of these characters are quite believable, but the film doesn't try to pass dysfunction off as quirkiness, a common ploy in independent film. It takes a matter-of-fact but sympathetic approach to the characters' problems. Pat's struggle to deal with his impulses makes him sympathetic.<br /><br />The film glosses over, or even advocates, some very bad behavior, however. Pat is bipolar, but Tiffany's problems are more troubling. Tiffany reacts to situations in which she feels uncomfortable by accusing innocent men of sexual harassment. She does this once and alludes to it a second time. She repeatedly lies to Pat about things that are important to him and sees nothing wrong with toying with others' emotions for her own gratification. None of this is presented in a negative light. In fact, we are supposed to celebrate Tiffany's self-acceptance. But making unfounded accusations is not acceptable. Jennifer Lawrence is an appealing actress, and that white-washes the character. She makes Tiffany's frankness seem charming, which it is in some contexts, but Tiffany has no concept of right and wrong, and she doesn't have psychosis to blame. She's the last person with whom a bipolar individual should be involved.<br /><br />The DVD (Anchor Bay 2013): Bonus features include 17 deleted scenes. There is a meandering featurette called \\"Silver Linings Playbook: The Movie That Became a Movement\\" (29 min), which features interviews with director David O. Russell, author Matthew Quick, the cast, some psychiatrists, and composer Danny Elfman. \\"Dance Rehearsal\\" (1:30 min) is a brief snippet, and \\"Going Steadicam with Bradley Cooper\\" (1 min) is also a snippet of someone filming Cooper experimenting with a Steadicam. Those last two are not worthwhile. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish. Dubbing is available in French.in a negative light.

B00821PCJS|4.0|Not the very best ever done, but a decent production that kept me interested in the characters. Got me through some boring times waiting in doctor's offices.
B00BOLE7X0|1.0|My connection is so slow  I was never able to se the movie, it to dark and no color to it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final book in this trilogy did not disappoint me. While some plot points were predictable, the ending was interesting and nor entirely predictable. Not a bad group of books.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Those Angry Days<br /><br />This book attracted my interest because it covers a period of United States history, the years  before The Second World War, when I was six to eight years old----1939 to 1941. I listened  to the conversations of my parents and grandparents, which dealt with the fear that &#34;we might be getting into a war,&#34; which was about all I understood about what was happening. Since then, I've done some reading on the causes of WW2, but this book adds a new dimension that I never considered: the schism in prewar United States between those who believed we should avoid war with Germany and Japan at all cost  (isolationists) and those who believed  it was necessary that we should intercede (interventionists) by at least helping  the British fight the Nazis.<br /><br />The story centers around FDR and Charles Lindbergh, Lindbergh being the voice of the isolationists. The role many other people in and out of government played in the pros and cons of this debate are also included in this story. This information was important but a little tedious at times to  follow. Lynne Olson has done a great job of writing about the balance FDR felt he had to strike between the isolationists and the interventionists, underscoring his slowness in taking any action that would even give assistance to Britain to save it from the Nazis, let alone provide American ground troops. The author does an equally well-done job of writing about Charles Lindbergh and his key role in the isolationist group, America First. In addition, Lynne Olson provides information about the Lindbergh immediate and extended family, which has little to do with those angry days, but is interesting nonetheless.<br /><br />I thought it was a book well worth reading if you want to learn something in depth about this period of American history, when our country was so polarized.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I'd give it a five if it was had more puzzles.  We finished it in just a day or two.

B008BTC5E6|5.0|It is easy to relate to Scott Jurek if you run, like a challenge, have curiosity.<br />This is an easy book to read, I like the recipes and will try a couple. (I'm neither vegetarian nor Vegan) but, like many people, i want to be healthy and get the best from myself that may mean changing perspectives...if you do what you've always done, you'll get what you have always got, right?<br />Whatever reason you have for exercise, goal setting, experimenting there is something here for you. This book feels honest, Scott comes across as a real person...sound trite ? Read it and you'll see what I mean.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Hype for the movie lead me to read the book first.  The first review shown on Amazon actually tells you the entire story....almost.  All the positive comments about the book are true but none of them that I read touch on the affect of the Eagles.<br /><br />Having lived near Philly I had lots of friends and neighbors who were Eagles fans.  I never really got the attraction or obsession of rooting for a professional team.  This book, in addition to being an entertaining and enchanting story, actually presents a very good picture of an Eagles fan, both the good and the bad.  And yet, with all the focus on the Eagles and the fans that weave their lives around the Eagles, it rang very true and I didn't want to put the book down until I finished it.

You will enjoy this huge book long into the night.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Finally, a near 20 year read is over in a great way. But the cost of the book is ridiculous. Get it at a used bookstore or borrow from the public library.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I read this while on holiday and it's a mark of the plotting and writing that I couldn't wait to get back to the hotel room so I could keep going. It's got an excellent, tense plot and two characters that you oscillate between liking and hating, feeling sympathy for, and feeling they are getting what they deserve. Really well-written and I can't wait to read more of this author's work.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Interesting tale.  The books goes back and forth  between the harsh life in an orphanage in the 1940`s and life 30 years later.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Having read the book and seen previous versions of this story could not believe what they did to it.  It is such a good story that there is no need to try and modernize it.  Couldn't watch it to the end had to stop it to retain my sanity!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So engrossing and amazingly written. Such a powerful parable of our lives. This is the second time I`ve read the trilogy, and I loved it even more this time!
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I took this little thing to the gym with me since my normal headphone jack on the iPod doesn't work anymore and the Fiio allows using the 9-pin connector. I clipped the fiio on my shirt and I think a small amount of sweat got on the surface of it. It worked well on my way home. When I tried turning it on and charging the next day it stopped working. It was dead. :(<br /><br />Otherwise it's ok for the money but the build and materials are not of great quality. The sound it produces is loud enough and the only bass option I cared for is the 2nd one (blue). The controls were annoying since to change the bass you need to push the on/off switch up which may turn off your device while trying to do it.

I'm annoyed that the cover for this book has the characters from the movie on it as the movie sucked big time!!

1401324649|5.0|I began reading in the aisle seat on a plane going to Egypt and I laughed for four hours.  I was in an aisle seat because I find flying a bit dodgy.  All the people around me heard me and were very curious.  But I was laughing so much I couldn't explain anything past the title. I didn't even panic about the turbulence.  I have a very serious job, which I handle lightly, but even so, it was so wonderful to read absolute fun and laugh out loud.  This is holiday reading at its best.  And then something happened. On the second day of my holiday, The Hundred Year Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window And Disappeared, did just that, It Disappeared.  I looked everywhere under sun beds, by the camels, in my room and at the beach bar. I wondered if Allan was trying to tell me something. I couldn't imagine what, so I went to reception to report the disappearance giving Amr (can't recall his surname) the name of the book.  Suddenly a lady standing next to me said, Oh The Hundred Year Old Man Who Climbed out Of The Window and Disappeared? I said 'yes, the very one'.  She said 'I have it, my daughter bought it for me and I'm nearly finished it and  you can have it when I'm done.  I'll leave it at Reception, but its in terrible condition because its covered in sun tan lotion and coming apart at the seams'. I didn't care.  I was desperate to find out what was happening to Allan.  Eventually I got to finish it and was able to carry on laughing to the end.  The style of writing is amazing.  Original, stimulating and impossible to put down.  My only disappointment is that I've finished it.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I have such mixed feelings after finishing this novel. I loved how unique the narration was! However, I am torn on the actual content. I was angry with Hannah for her actions and the blame that she felt was owed to her peers; and I wish that she had included herself in the blame too! I guess that is the thing about a sensitive topic such as suicide.... even though I was mad at her selfish actions, I almost understood her perspective by the end. It was weird, there was a sense of fullness for me in understanding her story, but a disappointment that it even happened.

B0044DEAUA|5.0|I found this through Amazon.  I was unhappy with my Jabra visor car speaker for my cellphone - have had two or three Jabra car speakers, because I bought them at Costco, and never really researched.  Was never really happy with them because my friends and family complained they couldn't understand me.<br /><br />This little speaker is exceptional - and at the $35 I paid for it on Amazon- amazing at that price.<br /><br />It's REALLY loud on my end, the sound is clear, and it ALWAYS connects when I step in the car.<br /><br />Battery life seems really good.  It's never given me a signal that it's getting low.<br /><br />I found it searching listings on Amazon for highest rated and best reviews - and they were right.  This is the best, and at half the price of their competitors.

0316023744|5.0|Antony Beevor (whom I had the honour to meet in Jerusalem) is an outstanding humanist who even in this work describing most barbarian acts of war and civil atrocities does not neglect the human approach to this worldwide tragedy. Each page consists tenthousands of victims but the few pages describing the holocaust - which Beevor considers a part of this terrible war - do consist a milion victims each. Beevor describes holocaust and its victims with deep feeling and sensivity.

B0010SKUYM|4.0|Upon high recommendation of this series by both my son and nephew, who rated this story as the best he'd read in the last 10 years (and he's a prolific reader!),  I purchased the first book to listen to while on vacation. It was a little slow to get started, but now both my husband and I are hooked!  It's a long tale, and full of meaty details and character development, which we both enjoy.  The lead character is developing nicely and we are so interested to see where the story takes us.  I also purchased the book on Kindle because I like the Whispersync feature and it gives me more options to get through the story, though that works better when I am reading a story on my own!  I will definitely purchase more of the books in this series.

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|First listen in I was ready to trash this, as it seemed unnecessary and irrelevant.  but I as played it more and more it really grew on me. Pretty fine record and a pretty fine Bowie album at that.  His best album since his seventies work, excepting Earthling. And while Earthling found Bowie trying to stay current, working with T. Reznor to create that essential late Bowie track \\" I'm Afraid of Americans\\",  'Next Day' looks back with fondness. Its derivative but it in a very good way, harkening back to his early and mid seventies music, as well as even referencing Earthling......nice. Touches of Diamond Dogs, Ziggy Stardust, and Aladdin Sane as well Earthling, abound. The arrangements, as per vintage Bowie, are amazing. Its real music, played by real musicians(great band, just on fire) and its really motherlovin'  good. Gets better with every listen, as all great albums do. Sophisticated but it really rocks.  Give the man his due. Don't call it a comeback.....<br />So if you've worked your way through his seventies catalogue as well as Earthling, be sure to add this to your essential Bowie collection.<br />Well done, Thin White Duke, well done
B009NG1Q96|1.0|First off, I seldom write reviews, and this is the first time I felt compelled to write a negative one.  loved the selection, and I figured that the sequel must be great too, But I was very disappointed  with the book. The writing didn't jump out and engage me like the first, and the main characters seemed whiny and foolish. It might just be me, but I really hated it.

B008LD09LS|1.0|I've had my drone for about four months.  It worked fairly well using the older software version, but after downloading this newer version for my Galaxy S2, the drone works just fine for about five to six minutes, then the \\"connection\\" is lost between the drone and my Galaxy, I'm prompted to send a report to Parrot, then the program closes and my drone drops to the ground....  Yes, this has happened a dozen times in the last two weeks.  Of course, I learned what to expect and did not fly my drone more than 3 feet high after five minutes of flight time after my first crash!  I have tried everything possible to resolve the problem- even flying the drone less than 15 feet from my Galaxy and the problem persists.  I gave up a few days ago, bought the Drone Flight Pro program for a bit over five dollars and....  no problems!  The other software has a multitude of possible mods that one can make to \\"customize\\" their drone's software.  Parrot's new software leaves a lot to be desired for an Android phone user.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|*** SPOILERS WITHIN ***<br />*** SPOILERS WITHIN ***<br />*** SPOILERS WITHIN ***<br /><br /> Those who know me have heard umpteen times my saying about original ideas in the movies (they don't exist, only original ways of telling them).  This is particularly true when doing a reboot/remake/sequel; you have a universe that has already been set up, now how do you give the audience something different while still playing within the limits of that universe?  The Star Trek reboot I thought was one that got it right, and if that wasn't enough, they reset the universe in such a way that they could pretty much do whatever they wanted.<br /><br /> And what did they do with this opportunity?  They lamely ripped off a previous entry in the franchise, threw in some glaring logic holes and a preachy message, while producer/director J.J. Abrams forced some hammy overacting out of the villain.<br /><br /> LAME RIP-OFFS<br /><br /> The previous entry they ripped off was \\"Star Trek II:  Wrath of Khan\\", and they ripped off the ending, but only swapped the roles between Kirk and Spock, and if that wasn't enough, Spock screams Khan's name after Kirk dies, just Kirk did when Khan taunted him in the original.<br /><br /> LOGIC ERRORS<br /><br /> How does an armed ship fly up to Starfleet Headquarters and proceed to blow away a meeting of admirals?  Where's security (especially since it occurred right after a \\"terrorist\\" attack)?<br /><br /> How does Scotty manage to fly into an enemy base by pulling the old \\"Let's Blend in with the Drones\\" trick?  Where's their security?<br /><br /> THEME PROBLEMS<br /><br /> The \\"terrorist attack\\" clearly parallels the terrorist situation of today and so we're clubbed over the head with a debate on how to respond to them.  I know this debate will never end, and I can see both sides of this issue, but did the writers have to be so blatant about it?  This was the reason I hate \\"Avatar\\" so much, but at least this movie only hit us over the head twice.<br /><br /> HAMMY OVERACTING<br /><br /> Before this movie, I had never heard of Benedict Cumberbatch, the actor playing the villain.  I then saw him in a BBC TV series \\"Sherlock\\" (an example of a reboot done right), and could see he was the right man for the job.  In the trailers, he oozed menace out of the simplest lines like \\"Now, shall we begin?\\".  That was clearly his best line, because the rest of his deliveries were so hammy I was waiting for some eggs to show up.<br /><br /> RECOMMENDATIONS<br /><br /> As I previously mentioned, BBC's \\"Sherlock\\", a modern-day update of the one-man CSI lab, is an example of a remake done right.  Benedict owns the role, and the writers really challenged the character while still staying faithful to the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle./><br /> HAMMY OVERACTING<br /><br /> Before this movie, I had never heard of Benedict Cumberbatch, the actor playing the villain.

B009POCG2C|3.0|This movie did not live up to our expectations. We will not be watching it again anytime soon. Clint Eastwood is still looking pretty good for his age.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|I first read this as a teenager in the '80s and was utterly blown away.  Re-reading this again so may years later, I was delighted to find the impact of Dick's imagination, prose, and mind bending take on logic and causality to be just as strong as it was the first time.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Never read the book ,and frankly even knowing what Jack is suppose to look like in said book this movie didn't bother me one bit. Solid movie all the way ,and it manages to do something that certain films fall short on. It manages to have a plot that is good ,but doesn't take away from the action. Rent it ,or own it either way you should like it
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The only thing about this game is I wish there was another way to get chips to be able to play instead of buying them.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|my username and password do not work and my browser will not accept the cookie on the url scewing up 2 bids
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The only issue I see with this game is that every time I close the game and restart it again, a lot of the things I did weren't saved. Really fun and easy game.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|I am a huge fan of Arnold ,but not a crazed fanboy he has made his movie mistakes (Twins ,Jingle all the way ,Kindergarten Cop just to name a few). Having said that this was not a bad film at all ,and I hope he's got a few more in him before he hangs hit hat. You can tell its been awhile since he last took the lead in a film ,but he's an action star so you shouldn't expect much in the way of dialogue ,and more in the way of a body count ,and explosions..lol. In conclusion most will enjoy the film(just keep in mind he's a little out of practice ,and older now) ,and in my opinion a good entry to launching his career.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this for my teen grand daughter.  She loves it.  It is sturdy and very nice looking for her.  She is taking a Mission trip over seas and wanted to be sure her phone would be safe.
B0073TBYTC|5.0|I saw the movie, The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, and was intrigued enough to want to read the series that was written about this strange young girl.  I would suggest reading all 3 books to really understand what Salander is really about.  She is an enigma of nature and quite the little powerhouse.  Most of all she is a survivor.  This definitely is not a love story, but it does have an insight into learning what it means to love the humanity of experiences.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I had forgotten just how funny the first season was and how much &#34; Nikki Heat&#34; had hated Castle in the first episode! Nathan's Castle was hilarious! He gave Beckkett so many reasons (one-liners) why he disgusts her.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Lean In offers great advice to husbands and fathers on how they can 'lean in' to help their spouses succeed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book, the story line had me hooked! Really recommend this book to anyone - starts out a bit slow, you think its going to be a typical teenage love story but just hang in there...
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I don't care for this game at all although it is relaxing..  A very young child might like it.  Way too slow for me.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|It is really fun but there are not enough levels. If you update this app it to have more levels it will be five stars.
193700788X|5.0|This is the last book in the series and I have to say i'm glad that she ended it how she did. Some of it was kind of predicted in the other previous books though. I originally said start from the beginning but after re-reading the series end at book 9 and create your own ending. It will be way better then this crap.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Its very rare for a book to grip your emotions the way this one does.  I found my heart racing, that I was gasping for air and speed reading just so I could see what happened next.  Just bought the Shift series as I desperately need to know what happens next!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't use Evernote much on my computer but the App for the Kindle is great! I can keep everything organized!
B008YW5RH2|4.0|Decent game but seems a bit unbalanced. I don't want to buy rackets to make me more competitive. Fun time though. worth a look.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this for my android phone and I love it. Yea it is smaller then my actual kindle but it is nice just to be able to pick it up and read
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a fantastic game. Beautiful design, great flow. Can't wait for the next installment.Great game.maybe a little longer next time
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This writer has helped me understand others a bit more, especially family. So glad I read it & would recommend it to others!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This was equal to or better than Book 1. The movement through the chapters is far easier to follow and is more fluid.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|This is a great app for the avid gamer I use it on a daily basis I found it better then Skype since I don't use video chat that much anyways
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This movie is a must see.  It is masterfully directed and produced.  The actors are phenomenal and do an excellent job of portraying events with the storyline.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is easy but challenging! Always fun and easy to play. Glad it's now available for the kindle. It was so fun on my smart phone but even better on the bigger screen.
B009D0LBRO|4.0|provides hours of fun. this game is hard to put down after starting the first level.  there are several different levels.
0061367036|5.0|This book features all the monsters that have been featured on the show. Not all of them but most of them through seasons 1 to at least 3. Good book if you need to do research on the show for some reason
B00AKFG15S|2.0|This book was a great disappointment.I found the Mr Archer is clearly writing either in response to a mini- series TV deal or hoping to secure one.The book goes nowhere as clearly you are supposed to want to buy the next in the series.It leaves one empty and feeling somewhat defrauded.He is a great storyteller but do not believe that he has kept up with the times.Sorry but cannot recommend you to waste your money
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Great price for a movie, cheap shipping and got here in two days.  Bought the movie for a friend so I can't comment on the quality of the CD now.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was such a surprise! I rented it because there wasn't anything else on TV. I think I laughed harder than I have in many months! Surprisingly, the singing was really good; music mashes were well thought-out; acting was good too.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|It's amazon for kindle/android I love it cause it is such a simple thing to use its such a simple app to go on to find something simple
B0029F2F6G|2.0|I had never read D. H. Lawrence before, so I ordered this to enlighten my brain. And no, I didn't like it. I read three short stories in the Prussian Officer series. Too much unnecessary and meaningless violence for me. And he seemed to promote violence as a requirement for a good relationship.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Can't beat this app since it is free. Info seems to be pretty accurate and it provides a good selection of options.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|In this day and age, it's hard to find movies that are family-friendly but not cartoonish. Safe Haven is pretty true to the book, which I really appreciate. It's a sweet love story with enough action/mystery to keep it interesting. I really enjoyed it!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I am a twitter junkie I love it on my kindle since it is bigger then my android phone I just wish i could customize tones
B00BDAP66E|4.0|A much easier way/tool to manage my business' page. Love that the app is available on both my tablet and phone
B009EHDU7U|5.0|It was recommended to me by a friend in my book group, our taste in books is very different, but the title and description got me in.<br />I really enjoyed the story and found myself wondering where and who Alan would meet and influence next.<br />Would recommend this book for our group to read and any one else for that matter.
B00BI5IXL4|3.0|I was so eager for this to come out on DVD. While it was the usual great storyline, I was incredibly disappointed in the singing. I understand that except for Amanda Seyfried the actors as just that...actors, not singers...this is a MUSICAL. Why put in non-singers in a muscial? I loved Amanda, and I thought the others did passable jobs. Just not the outstanding performances I expected. The acting was great - they should have just cut out the singing.
0062073192|5.0|The journal belonging to the Infamous John Winchester. You go from the day the major event took place to the few days before the pilot episode. I cannot go into more details since it may contain spoilers for those who haven't read it
B00CL68BK2|3.0|I had high expectations prior to viewing this film. I found it mildly entertaining, but a disappointment overall. There is way too much screaming between the various characters in this film.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|it was a great game, enjoyed it...it keeps me and my girls entertained through out the course of the night.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this movie, but it got good reviews. I'm so glad I watched it. nothing really complicated about it, just plain fun!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so much fun yes the graphics are kinda off but that's to be expected I keep playing it daily since I find it that fun
B009IEXKXI|5.0|No plot twists. No complicated character development.  Just pure entertainment.  A story of one man's survival against all odds.  Filled with wry humor.  Lots of good, plausible science that is explained to the reader.  This one made a 10hr flight go quickly!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Such an awesome game! It is so addicting, I got it two days ago and I'm on the last level!! It is very time consuming, but is great if you're looking for a little challenge.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|If you liked the movie, as I did, you will enjoy the soundtrack. All the main songs on it as well as quite a few from the acapella competition.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|When I first saw this movie I fell in love with it. Then again I am a huge fan of Simon Pegg. This is more of Stoner comedy/travel movie and it's a play on E.T ....the X-files...ECT. plus the head villain was an awesome twist
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Middle is slow but the end is a good twist. Grisham is always an easy read but this is not one of his best.
B0063IH60K|5.0|How do you review a game as basic as good old solitaire, no frills, just does the job as expected.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This movie was NOT what I expected, at least as far as the storyline. It was better! I thought the storyline was original, but with characters I knew (the Easter Bunny; Santa Claus; the Sandman...). What a neat twist!
B00005JPS8|5.0|It's the first Iron Man. If you have NOT watched these films go in order. This goes for all the Marvel films. They make more sense if they are in order. Plus if you are a Robert Downey Jr fan this movie is for you
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I'm not the biggest trekky in the world but I have always enjoyed the series for the most part.  This movie was a nice way to restart an old and rapidly aging series.<br /><br />I would say they did a much better job of making this film more likable for a wider range of people and not just the die hard fans.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Would rate it higher if I could figure out how to get it in more suits. Really enjoy the one suit I do have.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed so when I began breezing through the levels, I figured this game had to be a few years old! Going back and reading the info on it, I believe, was 2008, so granted, for being five years old, must have been great fun 'back in the day'! Now, for the advances that have been made, this game is pretty dated! I can see this as a great starter for kids till they graduate up to more thought provoking and modern games!<br /><br />That being said, I gave it three stars because it must have been pretty cool back then! Storyline and dialogue is pretty cheesy but on the good side it gives you the option of skipping all that, which, my patience gave up halfway through and couldn't deal anymore. I continued playing when I was bored and nothing else appealed to me. Needless to say, I still have not completed it! Other, newer G5 games are much more detailed and challenging, so if you are more adept than I am, (and you probably are!) you would benefit more to check out the newer apps!
B0044KI79S|5.0|It's the 6th season of supernatural it's a different story line since 5 wrapped up the other one totally worth the watch
B00CHILW64|5.0|This film helps to really understand the devastation that has happened not only with the 2004 tsunami but also the recent one in Japan.  It brings home the power of nature and how it can level everything - not just physically but socially - all the tourists in Thailand at that time suddenly found themselves in the same boat so to speak as the natives - didn't matter who you were or what you owned.  Real leveling of the playing field.<br />Also excellent story of that young man (Lucas played by Tom Holland) having to mature very quickly.  Naomi Watts as the mother put in a powerful performance as well.
1451696191|5.0|The book was in perfect condition, and of course the story was amazing (I love Charlie).  Thank you so much.
B007X709PE|2.0|Glad I didn't spend a dime on it. How about getting the more entertaining Texas Tornado involved. Where is the look behind the scenes? Any MotoGP fan has seen all the races already. Rossi worshipping continues...
B000K3HTRY|5.0|Awesome a must see!!!!spectacular !!!great story line:) twisted an cute ! I wish there were more movies like this one!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book, well organized and written. Provides clarity and understanding to the HBO SERIES. I strongly recommend this as a great read.
1594204217|2.0|I  thought it was rather boring. A voyeur among the doers. Better off getting the information  from a real source than second hand by someone just tripping through the culinary world.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This app is the best in the best it is just like gta but it is this game is the buy it now really fun and funny
B005HE5J7I|5.0|This book was much more interesting than I had expected.  I thoroughly enjoyed itt  It really does cover the history of London all the way from the start to &#34;current&#34; times.  The interactions of the various families and groups of people throughout history was pretty fun to read about, even though the specific people in this book were &#34;made up&#34; by the author.  I recommend it!
B00499NHLC|4.0|I liked the filming locations of this film. The story is a little tiring with the &#34;I know it all attitude&#34; but that is how Sherlock is supposed to be.Film quality is very good.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I loved the Sookie Stackhouse series.  Why the author didn't take the time to write a good ending to her excellent series is just beyond me.  The last few books really seemed phoned in. Charlaine Harris just didn't seem to care about the quality of what she created anymore.<br /><br />Guess she just went Hollywood and ignored her Art.  Such a shame. Sure she laughing all the way to the bank.<br /><br />I am extremely disappointed and disillusioned with Charlaine Harris.  Save your money, wait for it to come out at your library if you must read it.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|A fun read (though admittedly I'd seen the music first).  It's all in the first person point of view from Pat (the guy) and so the Tiffany character plays a bit more in the movie.  Not bad.
B009IUH1N2|3.0|Worth every Penny...As the Amazon Free<br /><br />App of the Day this was well worth the<br /><br />price I paid for it. I only get the ones<br /><br />that are worth it....
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|angry birds beats me everytime, but I will not give up!!!  ITis another game I have to play for hours
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love the story so much that I couldn't wait through the HBO season, I had to read the book! And it was well worth cheating this way, because it's so good. I love the way each character has their own very distinctive voice and that each chapter follows a character. Martin is a genius.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|the atmosphere and graphics are masterfully done. There's a genuine sense of mystery and you want to press on with each new puzzle presented. I hope there are indeed many more Rooms to come.
B0064QNS62|3.0|Worth every Penny...As the Amazon Free<br /><br />App of the Day this was well worth the<br /><br />price I paid for it. I only get the ones<br /><br />that are worth it....
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds-Rio is a Fun and entertaining game for all ages. Can not put it down when needed too! Enjoy
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|A tough movie about a tough subject. Good message if you can make it to the end of the flick.
1609611543|5.0|for years I suffered from bloating and no-one could give me a reason for this, I tried everything to restore my flat tummy but nothing did any good until I read this book so thank you for writing and publishing same.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome! I love Pinterest and use it almost daily. It has the best ideas because they mostly come from \\"average\\" people like myself.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|I, like many other reviewers here, was guilty of not watching this series when it ran originally. I'm not sure what the specific cause of the cancellation was, but it was a serious loss to science fiction on television. A number of folks only consider the final season to be good. I completely disagree. What seasons 1-3 of Enterprise show is the human race, struggling, making poor decisions as we do, trying to find its way in a universe far more complex than it initially could fathom. As with all good science fiction, this series provokes all sorts of philosophical questions: What does it mean to be human? Should utilitarianism be allowed to override other moral and ethical principles valued by a culture, and if so, under what circumstances? What are the limits of moral relativism? Is morality something that should be imposed, or at least presumed to exist in other species? This series is entertaining all the way through, and I think they did a great job of keeping the slow burn of T'Pal and Trip's relationship just barely smoldering as both struggle with what a relationship would even mean for the both of them. As opposed to The Next Generation (which is a fine series), Enterprise is far more interesting because you are witnessing such a protean endeavor, and like an infant, the human race shown here often stumbles and falls, but never gives up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was great and I would recommend it to anyone but especially to those that are a victim of abuse so they can see there is a way out and they too can be a survivor!

B008GXHOFW|4.0|This is one of the best handheld games i have EVER played. i also like the sale on all  seven dollar games. :P the only drawback that needs to be fixed is the character detail.  but other than that its a great game. i recommend this game to all.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best shows on TV!  The characters are so well-developed , and the writers keep surprising us. My whole family watches it - from grandkids to grandparents. Can't wait for season 4.
B0073COMUW|3.0|it is a good bulb but I like the 7 watt better than this one for my use at home
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|Fantastic....love the games like this<br />Worth every Penny...As the Amazon Free<br /><br />App of the Day this was well worth the<br /><br />price I paid for it. I only get the ones<br /><br />that are worth it....
B00AB7HESI|2.0|The in game content is absurd. I mean, the levels they give you are not challenging, and to get more levels, you have to buy them. Sure you might say &quot;But Pale, it's only a dollar!&quot; To which I'll reply &quot;This isn't a two sided conversation, so shut up and listen.&quot; And the game restricts how many items can be on the screen, even though most devices can handle probably 25 on screen items. If you want to change your avatar: One dollar, and that's for one pack. I believe there's 3 or 4. I would rather pay 5 or 6 dollars up front, than to pay for &quot;extra&quot; content, that without it, the game sucks. But, the only saving grace, thus the one star, is the music. All of the background music is fantastic, especially when you get a starite. God, that guitar rift.
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|Gina Carano is nice looking and she makes a different kind of action heroine.  As a contractor betrayed by her employer, she sets out to get her revenge.  While not a great movie , it ahs some good action scenes and is fun to watch.
B004TI1WME|3.0|I was expecting a calculator I can use for school that has many function, but it is mainly used for office nd buissness

B00992CF6W|5.0|Kids love it can't keep them off it. Sometimes hard for me to enjoy my kindle cause they keep bugging me to get back on the game. Graphics are cool too
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|it helps if you have read the book.  enjoyed all the characters and the way they tried to roll it together.  not an easy task.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The best thing since sliced bread!! I've gotten my mom hooked. We've tried many of the pins. I have no clue that there are so many uses for coconut oil, baking soda or vinegar.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Very happy with it. I was afraid to buy a mobile device and used my laptop for a long time,  I thought that I would not be able to print from a mobile device and it will be a waiste of money.Then I bought Kindel Fire and downloaded HP app,  and it worked just fine!
B005V5WBFG|5.0|I really appreciate the way that they send me messages if there is questionable sites, especially games. I have protection for my computer, iphone & Kindle fire.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play this game every day- I absolutely love it! It occasionally has a glitch or two, but usually it runs well and is loads of fun!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed the game and the puzzles involved in moving forward.  I hope their will be more rooms to explore. Well done!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|It took a little time to learn but once I got the hang of playing the game it is really fun to play. It's challenging but fun. You don't have to use real money to enjoy the game. I might buy rare cards in the future but for now I will just have fun with what I have. It's a strategy game so if you like that type of game I recommend this game. It's a lot of fun.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is amazing even though it's not the full version still amazing. I have an alarm clock but it sets off at the wrong time,but this app you chose the time and set the kind of alarm write press save and there you go. Again it's truly an amazing app so go ahead and get it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you liked hunger games then you'll love this second book . And I can't wait to read the third book in the series.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book likes more than the 4th book in my opinion, because it shows the historys that I like more of this saga.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It provides huge variety.  I love the fact it stores your times this way I'm able to compete with my family and friends. I highly recommend.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game! Easy for my 3 year old to play. Save all your prizes so your coin limit grows!
B003UBTX72|5.0|I've read many rock autobiographies lately and this on shines. Keith Richards is not writing a book, but telling us a story about his interesting and provoking life in the most vivid details. There is drugs and rock'n'roll (not too much sex). This story gave me a lot of insight about rock'n'roll history. I wonder how he remembers so much of the golden years :)<br /><br />I loved it and I'm sure you will too.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Complex and intricate, with a deep, rich storyline. Martin gets you to know his characters, and lets you decide whether you love or hate them. One dislike is Martin's way of killing off characters, as well as his apparent dislike of the Starks, but that just makes this novel more enriching to read. A brilliant book!
B00AFQC4QC|4.0|An intriguing story based around a very turbulent political time, where I cannot even imagine what it must have felt like living beneath the menacing shadow of the 3rd Reich - especially if you were a Jew. Such is the fate of the innocent, Greta, whose marriage to a charming young German would appear to be a blessing in disguise. Greta is an attractive, educated young woman whose passion for books captivates the attention of Wilhelm, junior sales assistant of a local bookshop. When the couple marry, he is aware of her Jewish heritage. So, the couple set out to live together on a farm, run by Wilhelm's family where they celebrate the birth of their first child.<br /><br />But it is not long before the fear and prejudice spread by the Nazis, turns Wilhelm coldly against his young wife - prompting him to flee to Germany with their young son, leaving Greta behind, frightened, alone and at the mercy of his own family on an isolated farm in Bratislava. Never the less, she remains hardworking and stoic - giving birth to a second child, who her ex-husband is already convinced will be genetically flawed, as stirred up by the anti-Semitic propaganda of the era. It is even more regrettable that Greta comes under pressure from her manipulative aunt, Joanna - and as Hitler's minions continue to poison the population against the Jewish community, so Greta is eventually coerced into believing her position on their farm might actually endanger them. With the inevitable shift in politics which resulted in millions of Jews being transported to the Nazi concentration camps, it is fortuitous that the Weissensteiner family is kept off the lists by a benevolent Countess - who ultimately offers them sanctuary.<br /><br />This novel explores the fragile relationships of both sides, but at the same time outlines a traumatic era in history and gives a vivid portrayal of the events which blighted Europe during World War 2. This is indeed a skilfully woven tale and a great story. I am impressed by the incredible length the author went to to describe the history and politics.<br /><br />If I was to make any criticism, it would be that the book was a little long for me and with perhaps too much detail in places. But I am no historian - and given the amount of research which obviously went into this book, it seems wrong not to expect the author to make the most extensive use of his knowledge. An interesting and absorbing read, depicting the forces of love, prejudice and betrayal.d by the incredible length the author went to to describe the history and politics.<br /><br />If I was to make any criticism, it would be that the book was a little long for me and with perhaps too much detail in places.

B00CB4ET0K|2.0|***UPDATE 7/13/2013*** GAMER BEWARE!!!! I am lowering my rating to 2 stars-<br />After playing this game for several weeks, and amassing a respectable arsenal for free (3 rifles,3 machine guns,med kits,artillery strikes,over 100 hand grenades, several bazookas etc. I turned on my kindle and \\"POOF\\" ALL GONE!!!! All of my progress was deleted and the game was reset as if it was my first time installing. Naturally I contacted GLU support and was given the standard \\"so sorry\\" but it must be a problem with your device we have no way to restore your progress. I was told that my Kindle saves back ups of all game sync progress but it doesn't (There are no such controls within the game) - so I contacted Amazon and was told that GLU is responsible for all technical issues  - TRANSLATION - I got the runaround. While I enjoyed playing the game , I don't have hour upon hour to waste restoring all that I lost. I had already opened up other campaigns by earning stars and have NO DESIRE to replay the same levels again. Thankfully I did not spend any real money on this or I would be really ticked off! Time to move on THIS WAR IS LOST!!!!<br /><br />***Original Review***<br />Great game. You can play a lot of levels before having to make any real money purchases.<br />Graphics are smooth on the Kindle Fire HD. Installed without any hiccups.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I watch a lot of videos on Netflix and it is nice to have such a user friendly monitor. Also it warns me when I need to plug in.
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|Not very challenging, I won't be playing very often. It was free and installed correctly... Game play was fairly boring.
B001K3EXTA|3.0|After all the hype about the current Gatsby remake, I decided to watch this older version instead. Mia Farrow was unbearably awful, ridiculous actually. I enjoyed seeing Sam Waterston as Nick and of course, Robert Redford was a believable Gatsby. Except for his obsession for Mia Farrow, no actor could carry that off. Maybe that is why this version was unsuccessful in its day.
1594204217|5.0|I had read Omnivore's Dilemma, which turned me into one who paid attention to food and to a fan of Michael Pollan's.  I ordered this one, with some trepidation, not sure it could hold my interest, but found it riveting.  Each section, cooking with fire, water, air, and fermentation seemed less likely to do so, yet each was more exciting than the one before. It is a testament to Pollan's writing ability where he examines a subject but through the eyes of an expert who is always a fascinating character. One come away with a sense of history of cooking, a philosophy, and even a broader sense of the process of life. Buy the hard copy, share it with friends, and revisit it from time to time.

0061906220|5.0|We first learned of Pete the Cat in my son's preschool class. What a fun series! The free online songs just add to the fun. He has this book memorized and walks around the house reciting it. Fun book! We will be purchasing the others in the series as well...I can tell already.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Makes me think of Heinlein's classic 'Orphans of the Sky', and Harlan Ellison's society in stasis story 'A Boy and His Dog'.

B008K9SG9K|4.0|This is a wonderful CD of an up and coming band. The music style is fresh and each song is not like the rest. I also like being able to download it as soon as I bought it.

B004NNUZ5K|5.0|It's and amazing book for any level. Very useful tips and great information about any subject you want to know about mixing.
B00CRS88IO|3.0|A fun adventure for a passed-over part of World War II history.  The story has good historical details and lots of action.  I agree with another reviewer that sometimes the reader gets pulled out of the story by some of the details which is why I gave it three stars.

B008M721MS|1.0|My mother was given this kindle as a gift to view and talk to her daughter whose permanently hospitalized 2000 miles away - Skype is the only application that she uses on the kindle - she is 87 yrs old and was thrilled to be able to see and talk to her daughter over the last 5 months - last week she got on Skype and found that your latest updated version3.2.505.13 has shrunk the viewable image to half the size of the screen where before she had a much larger picture - the solution simple - buy a different tablet from another manufacturer which gives you the option of choosing which version of Skype works best for you - she is very upset and now wants a tablet that gave her the image size she once had before
B00386EZJU|5.0|This music score is so heavenly, my son plays trumpet and tenor sax to it. Sometimes we just listen to it.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|The first ZZ Top album I owned was this one, and I had it on 8-track tape.  I listened to this one so much in high school that the tape was worn thin.  Beer Drinkers and Hells Raisers is the top of the heap -- it just plain rocks.  The guitar solo on Waitin' for the Bus is hard to beat as well.  Precious and Grace is another favorite of mine.  In fact, it's much easier to name the songs that suck on this one, and that would be none.  Billy gets the slide cookin', and the big blues that sounds more like rock just keeps coming at you.<br /><br />Back in the early 70's, I loved this one so much that I went back and got Rio Grande Mud shortly afterward.  It has a lot more blues, and I think their both great.  After Tres Hombres, I was so impressed that I bought Fandango before I'd even heard a single song from the album.  I bought it before they had started playing Tush on the radio.<br /><br />Rock and Roll!  Get down with the blues!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very pleased with the different mechanical aspects.  Creative process and challenges keep you trying and looking for something you missed.  Recommend it to anyone who enjoy like games.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I cannot say enough about these headphones.  I've used them for over 15 years.<br /><br />Frequency response for the size is excellent.  The headband doesn't look like it, but it holds the earbuds securely in place.  Nor do they induce the annoying ear fatigue of in-ear designs.  Despite the price, they're very well manufactured.  A real Sony winner.<br /><br />And, I don't mind occasionally losing them.  Replacements are easy to find online.<br /><br />I've used them everywhere - airlines, yardwork, you name it - and they've held up beautifully.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|This game is good. It's fun to play and interesting. I played the free part of the game and was going to pay for the rest of the game until I saw the price. I am not paying $5.00 for any game. None of them is worth that much to me. there are a lot of games out there that are just like it for  a dollar or two at the most. I would have enjoyed finishing it but not at that price. So if you are willing to pay the price, go for it!! It is fun!
0553801473|2.0|After making it to the end of book 5, I refuse to waste another dollar or minute of my time on this meandering miasma of meaninglessness.<br /><br />Book 1 was of course a pretty good read. By books 2 and 3, I started reading just one sentence per page in some chapters to get through the endless and excessive descriptions. By books 4 and 5, in many chapters I was reading perhaps one sentence every five or ten pages because the story literally moves that slowly.<br /><br />I really don't know what GRRM hoped to accomplish with the awful books 4 and 5. As countless other reviewers have pointed out, despite their 1,700 pages of text, pretty much nothing happens except that a character or two that might have been developed in some meaningful way was killed off.<br /><br />There is so much that could have been done but wasn't. Sansa and Tyrion could actually have learned something from each other, and their marriage might have developed with a little time. Arya was on a roll for the first three books then hit the tar pits of books 4 and 5. And Jon ... what a waste.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is GRRM's proclivity for doing lengthy character developments, then abruptly killing the character. I found almost as bad his undeviating use of cliffhanger chapter endings. Obviously, it is a pretty standard practice in popular entertainment novels, but he manages to make the trite device excruciatingly painful time after time by waiting five or ten chapters, or even an entire book, to again pick up the story for that character.<br /><br />In short, GRRM has squandered in countless ways what could have been an exciting three or four books.  Instead, he supersized it, filled it with bloat, and destroyed nearly all forward momentum with hundreds and hundreds of pages of meaningless writing.<br /><br />So I'm done. I refuse to read any more.

B00C5ZORES|5.0|I bought the album on the strength of My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark and was pleased to find many other songs that I love.  I incorporate many of them in my running playlist (they get me pumped to outrun zombies in the Zombies Run app).
B00BSW6F26|3.0|I gave it three stars because I managed to finish it! There were times I was just going back and forth from place to place randomly, touching this in the hopes that something would happen. Was frustrating at times because I couldn't see what the items were that I picked or where they might go! Would I play it again? Well, let me put it this way. I have already deleted it off My Kindle Fire and off my computer so it is completely gone! Good luck folks. Your going to need it
B0044C3RB4|4.0|On star less because from being fun it is getting to be complicated, in a non-amusing way. The aftertaste is that of a cheap novella and a great suspense. Mixed feelings about it. I do understand that maintaining this type of show interesting is a very difficult task for the crew involved, but it has become a romantic quasi-cheesy show. Still, the acting is superb, the Walters are the best, and Anna Torv is incomparable when impersonating the other-universe Olivia Dunham, which, by the way, it is a true human being when compared to our universe's Dunham. Jasika Nicole, in both universes, is great, but I love her character in our universe: intelligent, attentive, compassionate, and full of understanding.  It is this great acting by all members that makes it a 4 star so far. First and Second seasons: 5 stars, no doubt about it.
0761169253|4.0|this book is a quick easy read filled mostly with quotes about creativity and stealing.<br />What I learned from the book:<br /><br />-nothing is original, it's all derivative.<br />-take everything you see and hear and taste, touch and smell then make it your own.<br />-when you're stuck on life decisions, ask yourself what would make for a better story then do that<br />-write, produce or create the thing that you want to read, see or hear.  Often times we watch a movie and say \\"they should've done this with the movie.\\"  Create that movie.  Write the book that you want to read.<br />-write what you like, not what you know<br />-be regular and ordinary in life so you can violent and extreme in your work
B005S9EKCW|3.0|After all the hype, I had to see the movie. The acting was good but I missed the quality of the singing that I enjoyed in live theater. I realize the director wanted it to be more realistic - but that's sort of silly isn't it, after all most people don't burst into song as a matter of course, so it's better to have beautiful voices. That's my opinion. The filming, make up and acting were very good. I just didn't think that the movie version brought anything more to the book or theater, so for that reason, I found it a bit flat.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|I cant overstate how horribly bad this movie was. I didnt expect much from the trailers and i was STILL dissapointed! So many reasons why this movie was bad that I dont know where to begin. I think the movie hit rock bottom for me when Stark tells a 10 year old kid to not be a 'pussy' over the kid's dad leaving him. You can see where they are going with Stark's character. This movie was absolute garbage from beginning to end. I honestly have no idea how it is making so much money and getting such good reviews. Dont fall for the hype!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an incredible story of bravery and mental toughness portrayed by the Navy Seals. I felt like I was part of an unbelieable journey experiencing first hand what it must have been like to be captured and tortured. As a free country, we can't thank our military heros enough!

B001UEBHYS|5.0|This was the third or fourth time I'd seen this movie and I loved it just as much as the first time.  This viewing was a dvd I downloaded to show a friend who hadn't seen the movie.  She was as moved by it was I am.  I could watch the closing scenes over and over with the joy and hope they put into dance and music
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Great book, great production and great music, but a muddled cinematic flop. The constant jumping around from one isolated story line to another, with only the vague connection of old souls meeting up again, was somewhat exhausting and confusing. This is another movie that's based on a great book that could not translate well into a coherent movie experience. Even though the movie is two hours long, not enough time exists in each story line to develop audience empathy for each story line's characters. This movie, in trying to cover much, ends up expressing little resolute meaningfulness in the end.<br /><br />The interweaved futuristic \\"fabricant\\" story line, if extracted from the movie and developed more, would have made for a great movie on its own. Too bad that didn't happen.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Joe has come out with cool, fresh new material. I really liked the previous album, so my expectations were kind of high. Joe did not let down, not for a single moment. I love every single song, and this is probably the first Satriani album I can hear non-stop from beginning to end and smile all the way. It opens with the title song, which features a really awesome 5/4 time signature and a feel-good mood, with the cool sounds that he's known for. Songs like Jumpin' out and Three sheets to the wind are particularly enjoyable also.<br /><br />Yet probably the thing I noticed the most, is the rest of the band. They are so good! The older Satriani material usually featured slightly boring rhythm sections and were a little too simple at times. But Vinnie's drums are truly exciting, Mike's keyboard harmonies are very powerful and Chris's bass fits perfectly with the rest of the band, without jumping out too much. It just works! They should get together more often.<br /><br />Last but not least, the audio quality is outstanding - truly amazing. Do yourself a favor and get some nice headphones or speakers to listen this album. It's a great experience.<br /><br />Unstoppable Momentum is fresh, modern, cool, exciting and just plain awesome, with Joe's signature sound all over. Go check it out!

B000YJ54DU|1.0|I have loved these books. Bought them all. But Child has stopped writing and starting preaching. His personal bias against Christianity has become a major theme of his writing. I don't care what Child's personal beliefs are, but do we have to infuse Jack Reacher with them?  Reacher is absolutely tolerant of every kind of creed, sexual orientation, race... But we're to believe that he's so anti-Christian; anti-Bible?<br /><br />Furthermore, Child now makes Reacher a pacifist. A died-in-the-wool military man who is supportive of AWOL soldiers?  He justifies soldiers turning their back on their military commitment by claiming that there is all manner of unjust killing by the US military in Iraq. Maybe there is, but Reacher is not the guy to become the standard bearer for the Peace Movement. We have seen him kill dozens of men with his bare hands in which he was the judge and jury and now we are to believe that he's supportive of soldiers who are deserting because they don't believe in the killing?  Sorry Mr. Child, I'm not buying Jack Reacher any more. Neither his books nor the character that you're trying to turn him into. If you want to preach your anti-Christian, pacifist agenda, do it through a different character.
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|I really don't understand where a lot of these reviews are coming from. Bruce Willis is a bad actor? Um...ok.<br /><br />SPOILER!!!!<br />Yes, Duke dies, Channing Tatum's character. A lot of people complained about this. \\"Duke Never Died!\\" Actually, he pretty much did in the original G.I. Joe cartoon film, and did die in it's original version. Still, he is the one character (aside from Cobra Commander) that was any good from the first G.I. Joe live action film \\"Rise Of Cobra,\\" which really was just ok.<br /><br />The opening consists of introducing a few new characters while the situation with Zartan posed as the president commands a Cobra strike on the Joe's, in which most of them are killed. This is a pretty hard hit to start out a film with, but we see Cobra doing it's worst damage imaginable in this film, what they were afraid to ever do in the cartoons (for obvious reasons). This G.I. Joe movie is far more gritty than the previous one, which is by all means, a very good thing.<br /><br />We end up with Cobra Commander (the new actor is great) and others getting back together while Roadblock (The Rock) and Lady Jaye go and find \\"Joe Colton\\" who was the original Joe. Great!!! What ensues are various ways to question if the president is the president, and it leads to them confirming it.<br /><br />The president (as Zartan) literally begins a nuclear war, threatening everyone and then stopping his own while others do. He shows them a device that is like a nuclear bomb without fallout, and there are many in space. These satellites of destruction destroy London, and the vision of it is pretty creepy. A terrorist organization that actually suceeds? As Zartan says in the trailer \\"This is what we have been waiting for.\\" No more cheesiness with nanobots or plots that never happen.<br /><br />Now, after this, we do get some serious plotline with Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes, that Storm Shadow was after Zartan for killing their \\"master\\", and was only working the other sideto get close to them. People didn't like this plot point, missing that this is the same plot the character had in the cartoons and original comics. With them, you get the film's greatest fight scene, in which they fight a lot of ninja's up on mountains.<br />The 3D here was truly impressive, and I am self-spoken hater of cheap 3-D conversions. This isn't one of them.<br /><br />So when the team is together, you can expect a lot of explosive fights with geniune G.I. Joe vechicles (which people complain is to sell more toys) that were lacking horribly from the first film. In the end, well, most turns out good, but there is a pretty nice opening left, even when a lot is closed up.<br /><br />I won't spoil further. This is 100x better than \\"Rise Of Cobra,\\" and a lot of the reviews are complaining about things they are wrong about, or are die-hard Channing Tatum fans (who, despite him being a good fit for the role of Duke, is not all G.I. Joe is about). If you do not want to watch a well-done G.I. Joe film-a good plot, lots of cool characters, a lot of fights and explosions-good guys mostly save the day, then stay away. Otherwise, jump on, because this film is about as good as one could make a G.I. Joe film.<br /><br />I hope the same people stay on to do a third, actors and directors, etc. They left it open for a pretty good chance for something as good-and dare I say after my prior words-better? Time will tell, this film was far more sucessful than the first.

B00785P2QC|4.0|I think virtual city playground is pretty good. I don't like that you will have to decomtaminate buildings. It gets annoying.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|I was bored through the whole movie for some reason the acting all the way around was bad including the actress who played Sandy was really bad. Maybe it was the story becasue I am a BIG FAN of TC's movies and this one seemed like a comic character role not sure.<br /><br />One thing I am sure of it was a waste of my money. Since TC produced the movie I hope he gets back his investment. I wish there was a way to get my money back. The worse part was the the scene in the bathroom fight it wasn't funny it was just really stupid. Tom time for another MI movie those are always great. BTW I am wondering WHY you've never done a Batman movie that you would be great at.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I bought this to replace it's smaller brother I'd purchased in 2008 because I'd gone from a 15&#34; to a 17.4&#34; Inspiron and needed the extra room for the bigger screen (not because I'd worn out the smaller one).<br /><br />I use this everyday to get to work, lug the laptop and sometimes a smallish projector around the Texas Medical Center for meetings, so I've come to expect a solid, dependable piece of kit that can hold up to daily use- I was not disappointed.<br /><br />In fact, I wish I'd gotten the bigger one in the first place as it has a very spacious main pocket and it's larger size is a better fit than the smaller one (which has been adopted by my wife for her 15&#34; Acer laptop).
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Have not finished book. So far I find it very interesting. The math involved is complicated but then again it should be.
1400069742|4.0|I have some ambivalent feelings about the quality of the book, and the story itself is quite sad in some ways, but I still think it is worth reading.<br /><br />The book covers the debate between isolationists and interventionists in the United States from the middle `30s to Pearl Harbor.  Olson puts special emphasis on the period from Britain's entry into the war in 1939, and on the especially dangerous time from the collapse of France through the Battle of Britain, when it seemed to many observers that Britain would not be able to resist the Nazis without support from the U.S.  It is only with the benefit of hindsight that one of these choices seems to be the obviously correct one, and there were numerous well-intentioned and fair-minded folks on both sides of the debate.<br /><br />Though she goes into great detail about numerous leading figures on both sides of this debate--lots of information on Wendell Willkie, for instance--she uses FDR as the focal point for the interventionist side (which makes sense) and Charles Lindbergh as the representative of the isolationist side.  In fact, the book begins and ends with a scene of Lindbergh trying to steal a few precious private moments in the Smithsonian where he could be alone again with his true love, \\"The Spirit of St. Louis.\\"<br /><br />It's a poignant moment, but the structure of the book is made somewhat unwieldy by this comparison/contrast structure.  I found myself lost at times as to the chronology since the author kept bouncing back and forth between FDR and Lindbergh, and then would drop both of them for long stretches.  I did find immensely moving the story of Lindbergh's wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, who was torn between her family's passionate interventionist beliefs and her husband's cerebral, distant, \\"tone deaf\\" response to the increasing threat that Hitler represented.  If FDR and Lindbergh are the two major \\"characters\\" here, Anne Morrow Lindbergh is the third most important person in the book, which I like because she is a very attractive, if also tragic, figure.<br /><br />Some random thoughts:  Fairly or not, FDR does not come off well here.  Olson presents him as someone who leads from behind, who takes no action without a great deal of polling (an important insider in the Gallup organization worked closely with FDR), and who generally frustrated Churchill and the other interventionists in and out of government.<br /><br />Also, according to the book, much of the influential Army leadership was opposed to actions that would push the U.S. toward war.  Some of these people, if not exactly pro-Nazi, were at least sympathetic to them; others thought it was foolish to send Britain armaments when our own defenses were so meager.  George Marshall was apparently in this camp.  \\"Hap\\" Arnold was so determined to keep the U.S. out of the war until he was sure we had a strong enough air force to take on Hitler that he leaked the top-secret plans for a war against the Nazis, a plan which the top Nazi generals urged Hitler to take into consideration in planning strategy, but which Hitler ultimately decided to ignore.<br /><br />Lindbergh also comes off quite poorly here.  He was of course anti-Semitic, but most people in the U.S. were at this time.  He did not seem to see the threat to democracy that the Nazis represented, was seemingly indifferent to anti-Jewish violence, and was more concerned about Stalin.  He was no fan of Britain, though he himself had retreated to Britain to escape the public eye after the killing of his son.  (Anne Lindbergh cringed incessantly at his anti-British speeches, for she well knew how much they owed some of their friends in England.)<br /><br />One of the strengths of the book is how well it captures the virulence of the debate, and Olson explicitly compares this tumultuousness to debates in our own time over Vietnam and Iraq.  Lindbergh was called a fascist and a Nazi by major newspaper columnists and by major figures in the Rooseveltadministration, and FDR in a press conference compared him to Clement Vallandigham, a northern Democrat who sympathized with the South in the Civil War.  The book deals with the fine line that exists between free speech in a democracy and speech that is traitorous.  It is fascinating and frightening to see the extent to which FDR used the resources of government to go after Lindbergh and anyone who agreed with him.<br /><br />My complaints about the book:  First, this is not an academic book.  Olson has not done a great deal of original research with primary documents, relying greatly not just on secondary works, but, bafflingly, on her OWN secondary works.  Several times I looked to find the source of a comment by Churchill or FDR, and she has cited one of her OWN books.  That makes no sense to me at all.<br /><br />Secondly, she totally ignores a major aspect of the side that opposed intervening against Germany:  those outright Communists or their sympathizers (I would put many writers and artists in this camp, people such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger) who were active members of the America First movement and its satellite groups RIGHT UP UNTIL GERMANY INVADED THE SOVIET UNION, at which time these people did an about-face and became staunch interventionists.  There are ample opportunities for Olson to make this point.  For instance, she discusses not only the sinking of the American destroyer Reuben James by a German submarine in October 1941, but also cites lyrics from the catchy song Woody Guthrie wrote about it:  \\"Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names,/Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?\\"  What better place to add a discussion of the conversion that people such as Guthrie and Seeger went through after June 1941?  It is a major failing of the book.<br /><br />Similarly, except for a brief mention of him in her section on Hollywood's response to this debate, Olson completely ignores the isolationist and defeatist beliefs ofJoseph P. Kennedy, who was essentially forced to resign as ambassador to Britain late in 1940 because of his politically embarrassing comments and attempts to meet privately with Hitler.  JFK is mentioned briefly, along with Gerald Ford and Gore Vidal and Potter Stewart, as early members of the America First movement (which began among college students), but surely the elder Kennedy should have been discussed here.<br /><br />With those reservations, I still recommend the book.

B00CFA225Y|2.0|Asking $35.00 for this movie is insane. The film, I understand from others, is not very good. The best that I heard was it is OK with no enthusiasm.<br /><br />Bought bought Gamer 3D for $15.00.Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D for $19.99. Both from Amazon, natch. Arrived real fast, May 18th, 2013.<br /><br />No one in their right mind is going to pay that kind of money for this dud.<br /><br />Sentences. Proper grammar. Who cares.<br /><br />Don't spend a week on reviews. it is 1,2,3.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Milton Friedman makes a clear and direct case on the many benefits of the free market. Markets are the people and when government gets involved everyone is hurt. This has been proven throughout history. The socialist party in Nazi Germany to the Soviets starving their own people. The only economic system that works is capitalism with free markets. People are voting everyday with their dollars for businesses to provide the best goods and services, highest quality, at the best price. Obama with his slave markets of socialism only produce destruction. A free economy is a free people. I plan on reading all Milton Friedman books.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|My new &#34;Kindle Fire&#34; was a mother;s day gift from my step-son. (Yep, he's a keeper) My biggest tip for purchasers is to spray it completely with &#34;Scotch Guard&#34; or a similar product. Keeps the one on my older Kindle clean and lengthens the life of it.
B002OLE1XU|5.0|It was back to the original team unlike the second and third. Though I did find it weird that Han died in one and was brought back again.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|For those that have followed this great series from author Lee Child,Jack was done very well. The books describe Reacher totally different, but Cruise played it perfect! The attitude was spot on and the action done very well. The best part of the books are brought to life within the clever dialog throughout the movie. Great job and I hope there are more Reacher movies in the works!
B00A3VLJCE|1.0|Does not explain how to do anything. Incredibly frustrating and crazy hard to use.  I want my money back now.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Cable was OK however Kindle device had a defective power jack so charger/cable did not solve problem. Necessary to replace device.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a book that should be read in every middle school. I read it to my class and they love it, too. It has great lessons to teach.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book as the others was a fantastic read. I highly recommend it to find out what happens to the Mockingjay.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is a great game of u like to kill stuff as a shark and better yet h can upgrade it
B002H3T3TM|1.0|Even though I think MB is great, this BLU RAY features just a handfull of songs and like a 40min interview...<br />I wouldnt recommend it...
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Easy to follow instructions, great clear pictures even on an older kindle. Always carry a length of cord with me now.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My daughter really enjoys this game. It is a lot of fun! Eight more words are required. Still wasn't enough.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's a great game to play if your a teenager or adult. I think it's great if you have time to kill or just want something to do.
B0064MGU98|4.0|It is a good show. It is a little different from typical law shows but still very interesting. I will keep up with it and view the other seasons.
B002GHHHKQ|4.0|Yep, Ms. Foster did an excellent job of acting in this movie.  Took me quite a while to finally watch this one, and I haven't regretted it for a moment.  It's a great movie for all Sci-Fi fans.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|This is not your typical Tom Hanks movie. Very different story and difficult to follow the multiple story lines. Did not enjoy and a weak ending.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love this game if u need and xtra team member add me on facebook Angel Walsh or search angelw0415@gmail.com.very addicting I will trade and send gifts.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Now this one really surprised me.  How many movies reach a fourth or fifth sequel and is still good enough to gain rave reviews.<br />I wasn't really expecting much out of this one, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  Not only did Christian Bale do a good job as the &#34;new&#34; Batman, he moved it right up to the top of the heap of the series.  He proved to be a powerful addition to the series.<br />He was good enough to convince you that his character could actually be a real life &#34;Super Hero&#34; right from the days of the Batman comics. Don't miss this one because you won't be disappointed!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the worst book I've ever picked up.  Incredibly ridiculous in every possible way.  Makes the bouquet romance &#34;novels&#34; of Danielle Steel look like literary classics.  Don't waste your money.
B004QOB8SY|4.0|I wasn't aware of the number of episodes in this single case, 2 discs.  We thought there would be more.... 2 episodes in disc 1 and 1 episode in disc 2; total of 3 episodes.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I actually read this book for the first time many years ago. Although, to my knowledge, I have no American Indian ancestry, the subject has always interested me. I especially like the quotes from some of the native Americans. As far as it's impact on me, I believe that it opened my as to the fact that as a country we are not as perfect as we would like to believe.
B009NY43NY|1.0|*Spoilers*<br /><br />For those who enjoyed reading about Sookie cleaning out her attic, baking casseroles and washing dishes more than her supernatural adventures, or related most to the small minded townsfolk or Sookie's \\"friends\\" who swept all vampires into the same category, this book might seem like a fitting ending.<br /><br />For me, however, it did not.  While this series was a fun & sexy escape and I did enjoy how 'real' Sookie's life felt as it made her all the more relatable - I also enjoyed what I thought were messages of self-acceptance, diversity and tolerance and respected the author for writing about tough subjects such as rape and sexual abuse. I enjoyed the parallels of Sookie, the vamps and other supes being the outcasts and the unlikely allies Sookie found in every type of being - from pointy toothed elves like Bellenos to speed talking demons like Diantha. For every enemy such as Arlene & the FoTS, Claude, Jannalyn and Victor there were friends and allies such as Amelia, Claudine, Eric and Pam.<br /><br />Then it all took a horribly bad turn in this final book. Not only was the plot weak (even laughable at times), the character motivations unconvincing and the mythology changed when convenient, but the messages became ones of intolerance, defeatism and regression. Blech! Can someone pass me a mint please?  I can't get rid of this awful taste.<br /><br />Before reading DEA, I considered this one of the most memorable quotes in the series:<br /><br />\\"Sam, two years ago I didn't have any idea of what the world around me was really like. I didn't know what you really were; I didn't know that vampires were as different from each other as we are. I didn't know that there were real fairies... What a world this is, Sam. It's wonderful and it's scary. Each day is different. I never thought I would have any kind of life for myself, and now I do.\\"<br /><br />Turns out, Sookie was just being naive and foolish.  Sam was so right - she should have just stayed home, slinging beers, pretending to be happy & \\"normal\\".<br /><br />Nope, sorry Charlaine Harris.  Thank you for creating this magical world that in the end, sadly, I must reject.  You see, in my fictional world - you don't settle for tomatoes, abusive creeps like Appius Livius Ocella don't win, rapists don't make good friends, love is worth fighting for, every day is a new possibility, the most meaningful acceptance you can find is within yourself, what makes you different is embraced and it is never wrong to follow your heart or hope for MORE. The Sookie books don't belong in my world, not anymore, not ever again.
0525478817|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ READ IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN I READ IT IN ONE DAY AND ITS SO GOOD YOU SHOULD GO READ IT NOW ALSO WATCH VLOG BROTHERS VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE BECAUSE ITS JOHN GREEN AND HIS BROTHER AND THEY ARE HILARIOUS AND AMAZING AND ALSO READ THIS BOOK ALONG WITH ALL HIS OTHERS!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|You certainly have to work hard at getting what you want in this game. Just work hard and play hard this game is awesome. I honestly love it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book will have you asking for more and yet leaves you satisfied...great book...great story.<br />Can't wait to read the next one!
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|I hate when I don't hear about great shows like this. This show is genius! A mix of Star Wars, a great western, and pirate movie-So cool! Great character building (and chosen cast)...and great, adventurous story line. A group of interesting misfits(ex militia, I think?)western space travelers go from a western town to a pirate like quest in a cool ship (with a cool driver-love that guy! Excellent actor).
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I have this app on both my kindle and my iPhone5. It's very cool and sometimes hard to stop. I do, however, wish there were more ways to get pearls. But I guess, that's the challenge part of this game.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It clearly is the adaptation of a lo get book and of a book for teens. The story is disjoint and it is hard to follow the setup of the dystopian world. The plot is simplistic(you don't quite see how the alliances form), the actors ok.<br />Not an Oscar movie, but a good evening of entertainment. One more thing: some scenes are overly violent. This is not a children movie.
